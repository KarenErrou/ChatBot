There's quite a lot of good jokes in this but again they obviously didn't work with the big crowd. I had other issues especially with Michael Herbig. He doesn't seem able to shake off his TV past. It still seems from time to time that he tries to look into the camera. Still if that's the only criticism you have of course that shouldn't block your viewing pleasure.

	schema:reviewBody "Zettl is a German 110minute movie from 2012 so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. It is the very last work of his life and career by director Helmut Dietl and he is also the one who adapted the original work by Benjamin von StuckradBarre a relatively wellknown writer who was the next big thing here in Germany for a while.And when Dietl calls they all show up which is why you will see a gigantic amount of big name actors from Germany in these slightly under 2 hours. Even Harald Schmidt reprises his Late Show character from a long time earlier. But the fact that only one cast member is listed with awards reception here and that one also got 90 of it for another film is very telling in terms of the quality here. Dietl may have been way past his peak already at that point sadly. He is known as a filmmaker who had a tendency to depict the richer part of the German society in many of his films what you may want to call the high society and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. And it is undeniable that Dietl has a talent when it comes to combining character studies with comedy. The big problem in this film however is that he really shamelessly goes over the top throughout the entire film from start to finish. Add to that the several really unrealistic plot twists and the characters that just stopped feeling authentic at some point. It's not a bad foundation overall I would say but what they made of it is simply a gigantic mess. There was really only one moment that somewhat touched me namely seeing George's character dead towards the end but this had to do just with the actor's real dead not too long ago and not with the movie. Apart from that it did become once again pretty obvious to me that Bully Herbig is not lead actor material in anything that isn't 100 fun and comedy like his new Bullyparade movie for example. The film as a whole is also way too absurd to make any interesting critical statement about society. Dietl was just letting loose and the outcome is very disappointing. Not a good way to say goodbye. I give the film a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

There is also a dark austere quality to the photography and lighting that evoke the wartime mood otherwise not evident in the film. The story concerns Cary Grant escaping from jail and hiding out in the summer cottage of  middleaged bachelor law professor Ronald Colman. Grant's character named Leopold Dilg who has a fondness for borscht with an egg in it was falsely accused of burning down a textile mill. Jean Arthur's local gal vacillates bewteen these two very different men who as things turn out get on quite well with one another. Grant teaches Colman a thing or two about real life while Colman instructs Grant in the law. The problem is that the gentle professor doesn't know that Grant is in trouble with the law. Things gets awfully complicated near the end as the story turns melodramatic not altogether happily as it had been for the most part up till this time a warm funny study in character and mistaken identity.Overall the movie is hard to fault. The actors are so engaging and the dialogue so good one can forgive almost anything. There's a nicely suggested smalltown New England feel to the film which does not caricature Yankee types as was so often the case at the time and is most refreshing here. Grant is as usual so excellent that one forgets that he is acting as he manages to suggest workingclass origins genuine intellectual curiosity and a hint of anger especially in the eyes as his performance perfectly sums up what the film is about without drawing too much attention to itself. A remarkable achievement for Grant director Stevens and everyone involved in this happy production.".

I grew fond of Roland Coleman through this movie he is simply debonair. Sure the preaching toward the end of the movie is a bit thick but it is in character and should you listen closely you would find that the message is as relevant today as then. And about the love triangle plot It keeps you guessing till the last moment only one other movie successfully does the same Casablanca. Talk of the Town is an intelligent and endearing mix of comedy and drama it does not use comedy only for the introduction but keeps it up in parallel to the drama well through the movie in that it is remarkable. To say the least it did not deserve to be forgotten for it does what movies do best give you a good time.".

And about the love triangle plot It keeps you guessing till the last moment only one other movie successfully does the same Casablanca. Talk of the Town is an intelligent and endearing mix of comedy and drama it does not use comedy only for the introduction but keeps it up in parallel to the drama well through the movie in that it is remarkable. To say the least it did not deserve to be forgotten for it does what movies do best give you a good time.";

He's rented a cottage for some peace and quiet before going before a Senate committee dealing with his nomination to the Supreme Court. But things are anything but peaceful in the town of Lorchester Massachusetts.The factory owned by Charles Dingle has burned down arson is suspected and Cary Grant in an unusual working class role is the suspected arsonist. He's a man of radical opinions in the town so he's a convenient suspect. As the factory was the main employer in the town you can imagine that folks are crying for blood.Which brings an escaped Cary to that same house that Jean Arthur has rented to Colman. Though there are some amusing moments to be sure from all three of the stars I find The Talk of the Town to be more serious than dramatic. Grant challenges Colman to come down out of the ivory tower he's been living in and apply his high minded principles to real life if not necessarily his case.When he does Colman does it with a vengeance and it brings down a whole lot of Lorchester's leading citizens.Though Grant and Arthur are first billed this film really belongs to Ronald Colman. His character is modeled I believe on a recent Harvard law professor who was also appointed to the Supreme Court one Felix Frankfurter. Of course what the impeccable English Ronald Colman playing WASP Michael Lightcap and a Viennese Jew have in common is not obvious at first. But before becoming mentor to a host of New Deal civil servants Felix Frankfurter was not only a professor of law at Harvard but concerned himself with a host of social issues. He was for instance very prominent in the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti whose plight in the twenties is very similar to Cary Grant's. Like Colman's character Lightcap Frankfurter was also known as a man of impeccable integrity who even his worst enemies conceded. He could also be a bit too high minded at times and had to be brought to realize in his philosophy of judicial restraint that the courts are and should be an instrument for progress and social change. His story would make an excellent film itself.Although I can't see Felix Frankfurter putting the moves on beauty parlor owner Glenda Farrell to learn the truth about the arson. Farrell who graced many a Warner Brothers crime feature in the Thirties has the best of the supporting roles in The Talk of the Town. Also the ever unctuous Charles Dingle is wonderful as the very corrupting influence on the town itself.Colman's final speech to the mob who are ready to lynch Cary Grant is a masterpiece one of his best moments on screen. The words ought to be required reading and viewing for those who would dismantle our judicial system out of heated passion of the moment.As a film that challenges folks to live up to the creed they espouse The Talk of the Town should not be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cary Grant has a curious role in this film  he is a labor agitator. He has been stirring up matters in his native town against the local big business factory owned by Charles Dingle. Then there is a fire at the factory  an arson fire. Grant is suspected and arrested for the arson and subsequently for the murder of Tom Tyler the factory foreman who is missing and presumed dead. Grant manages to escape capture and heads for the home of one of his oldest friends  Jean Arthur. What he does not realize is that Arthur has rented the house for the summer to a law professor of note Ronald Colman. Arthur is willing to hide Grant in the attic but Colman does arrive only to find that the sheriff and a pack of hounds are at his door and due to some unexpected clothing switching the hounds chase Colman up a tree.Starting with this situation THE TALK OF THE TOWN blossoms into a neat little comedy triangle that tackles the issues of what is law and what do we expect of it? Colman's Professor Lightcap is a quiet judicial scholar  a man of books. Probably too many books. Later in the film Grant's Leopold Dilg tells Arthur's Nora Shelley that he's looked at the legal tomes Colman reads and upon which his judicial philosophy is based and they are intelligent comprehensible and dead. Colman in short is a legal conservative and so has a tendency to support the status quo. He is also an appointee awaiting confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. All this is hardly promising for Grant and Arthur who hope that Colman can assist them in saving Grant from prison or worse. Grant's attempts at getting Colman into the real world is limited by his inability to appear in public he is a wanted man after all. But Arthur and Grant's attorney Edgar Buchanan are capable to take Colman around the town and make him realize that Grant has not been given a fair chance to defend himself.The film concentrates on Colman's slowly becoming a realist  seeing that the opinions of one hundred years of precedents are not the be all or end all of justice. It begins when he meets Dingle and then the trial judge who seems all too prejudiced against Grant before the trial  not to mention too chummy with the owner of the factory. As he comes down to earth he even strips himself of his badge of ivory towerism  his beard which he shaves off much to the distress of his valet played by a subdued but funny Rex Ingram. I leave it to the viewers to see how Colman eventually does get Grant out of his legal difficulties. The movie is one of the few up to that date in the 1940s that looked at the legal system critically. The massive dislike of the townspeople towards Grant where they all have been financially hurt by the factory fire they blame on him makes a fair trial in that town impossible. It reminds us of the issue nowadays about media coverage of crimes where local jury pools get tainted by prejudgments of defendants thrust down their throats. Yet Colman is warned by his political friends to avoid involvement  to keep himself clean before he is confirmed. You wonder what is the value of a seat on the Supreme Court if the wouldbe judge cannot make sure that justice is even handed and as near pure as possible.To me TALK OF THE TOWN may not be a great film but it is above average and an unusual one for both male leads  for Grant in his character's personality and for Colman for his gradual concentration less on his rivalry with Grant over Arthur as with the battle for justice. Before TWELVE ANGRY MEN came out over a decade later TALK OF THE TOWN was the best movie about the philosophy and reality of the law except for THE OXBOW INCIDENT Hollywood produced.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I read through all the 43 previous reviews to see if anyone saw the same things I saw in this movie. I should say that I had the privilege of seeing the film in all its bigscreen glory at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto with a live audience who laughed heartily. It was a hard film to watch for someone who has spent too much time in too many courtrooms watching too much injustice but two things shocked me though and the second made sense of the first. Two reviewers did mention what's on my mind but only part of it. The first shocking thing was that I had to agree with reviewer Joey the Brit when he wrote about actor Rex Ingram's disproportionate prominent grieving when his employer played by Ronald Colman shaved off his beard. Colman a law professor performed this act because after he had admitted to his landlady and housekeeper Jean Arthur that he had grown the beard to hide his youth while an underage student in law school she accused him of hiding behind it. Ingram's reaction is truly disproportionate. The camera focuses on Ingram's face for perhaps a full minute. The black man's face fills the screen as he grieves and finally a tear runs down his face. It was so out of place so prolonged this scene! Why? As soon as Ingram arrives he is full of deference with dignity. His character has been with his employer for 15 years during all of which time the boss has had the beard. But to grieve for a beard! I forgot my dumbfounded reaction as the plot moved forward but I watched Tilney Ingram's character as the professor's man more carefully. The second shock has to do with what reviewer mitchmcc wrote that heshe would bet that the script was written by a 'progressive' and that 'social justice' was the real goal here. Given that one of the screenplay writers was blacklisted in the 1950s that's probably not far from the mark. It wasn't until the last courtroom scene when the lynch mob bashes their way into the Hall of Justice that I suddenly understood the significance of Ingram's reaction. It wasn't trivial. I had just been reading about how in 1936 yet another attempt had been made to pass antilynching legislation. It was the best hope of passage there had been since this type of legislation had first been introduced following the Civil War but many experts blame its failure to pass on President Roosevelt's failure to support the bill. Although it isn't clear to me that Roosevelt's support at that time would have helped to pass it or could have kept it from being repealed by a hostile Supreme Court it is clear to me that no antilynching legislation had been passed by 1942 when this film was released. No such legislation was ever passed. And when I saw that rope in the hands of the lynch mob I knew why Ingram had been weeping. It wasn't for any beard. It was for the one black man or more lynched every month around that time. It may be only a subtext but Ingram's screenfilling weeping face made it a powerful one.".

	schema:headline " An uneven story salvaged by three resourceful actors";
	schema:reviewBody "Social commentary either elevates the value of a film or bogs it down and with comedies it is generally the latter. The Talk of the Town is no exception while it is a fun film that has much to admire the pretensions of the filmmakers often get in the way of what could have been a masterpiece of comic suspense. The tone becomes almost unbearably preachy at times and some of the monologues on justice' and the pursuit of truth' are excruciating on the ears. Thankfully the good people at Columbia hired just the right people to star.The specific political stances of Leopold Dilg are never made clear we're just supposed to accept the idea that he's a good guy who is put down by a corrupt system.

	onyx:emotionText "Social commentary either elevates the value of a film or bogs it down and with comedies it is generally the latter. The Talk of the Town is no exception while it is a fun film that has much to admire the pretensions of the filmmakers often get in the way of what could have been a masterpiece of comic suspense. The tone becomes almost unbearably preachy at times and some of the monologues on justice' and the pursuit of truth' are excruciating on the ears. Thankfully the good people at Columbia hired just the right people to star.The specific political stances of Leopold Dilg are never made clear we're just supposed to accept the idea that he's a good guy who is put down by a corrupt system.

	schema:reviewBody "It's ironic that two of my three favorite actors  Cary Grant and Ronald Colman the third being Spencer Tracy  are in this film...but that the film really belongs to Jean Arthur.I don't think the casting for this film could have been more perfect. Colman as the older distinguished soontobe nominee to the Supreme Court. Grant as the slightly edgy maybeguilty liberal. And Jean Arthur as the slightly ditzy but always crusading for right female. Just perfect.Ronald Colman made this film the same year he made my favorite Colman film Random Harvest although he seems significantly older here. If you're a Colman fan you might be a bit disappointed here through much of the film because while his scenes are absolutely critical to the story line they are not exceptional scenes. But then near the close of the movie he has the best scene in the whole film  in the courtroom when he talks about the American justice system and concludes by saying Think of the world crying for this very law. A moment that almost makes you cry.Cary Grant does well here but frankly in terms of true billing he would probably come third here. He's very good in this film...plays his edgy character almost perfectly. But there isn't a single scene of his where in my view he stands out.Jean Arthur shines throughout the production. I won't say it's her best role but it's classic Arthur.In terms of the script Bosley Crowther and Variety put it in perspective the essential purpose of this tale is to amuse with some devious dilemmas and the film makes transition from serious or melodramatic to the slaphappy. This film is a comedy but with heavy doses of drama and a cause  justice. There are times it makes you laugh and times it makes you terribly sad.There's little here to criticize. Perhaps at 118 minutes it could have been just a little tighter in a few places. And then there's the ending. Who should Jean Arthur marry? The edgy liberal or the serious Supreme Court judge? Two endings were filmed and the studio let preview audiences decide...and they chose Grant. I think that was a mistake. It would have been a better ending had she stayed with Colman. But it does work either way...which is one of the reasons this script is so cleverly worked.Very highly recommended.".

He's also hoping for an appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.Arthur introduces Grant as the gardener. Coleman soon finds that Grant is a most peculiar gardener. He cultivates some pretty unorthodox views of the law promoting its spirit whatever its letter.

I'd have given Jean Arthur to Ronald Coleman who seems more devoted to her than Grant is. It would be better for everyone concerned. Coleman is older and Arthur would provide him with contentment for the rest of his life after which she'd become terribly rich. Grant on the other hand is a wisecracking malcontent whose middle name is Trouble. On top of that he's named Leopold Dilg. That means she would have to become Mrs. Dilg. And on top of THAT Cary Grant always gets the girl. Let's give her to Coleman this time. She'd make a nice addition to his library.I didn't find it as satisfying as some other viewers. The blend of romance comedy and drama was a little uneasy. Grant had a tendency at this point in his career of branching out into serious roles often in message movies in which he challenged his usual handsomely carefree film persona. Penny Serenade for instance. They were generally failures and Grant went back to doing what he did best by the late 40s.Never again would he be a character named Leopold Dilg or Ernie Mott or something.Good.".

The first half manages to sparkle with Grant in the attic Coleman in bed and Arthur's reputation in trouble. Too bad that the movie peaks early when the comic architecture builds into laughs as first reporters then cops then movers and finally other assorted pests flood the house where fugitive Grant is hiding. Had the film kept along in this humorous vein and lopped off about 20 minutes near the end I would have liked it a lot better.However the screenplay decided to say something Profound about the sanctity of The Law which they then try to juggle along with the comedic moments. Sometimes it works but mostly it doesn't in part because the ideas presented are dumbed down in the extreme. Add to that Arthur's having to decide her heart's desire and we end up with a few sparkling parts that are far from a satisfying whole. Then too the lynch mob may have done lots for Coleman's legal argument but is too heavily suggestive for the movie's lighter mood.In passing There's quite a lovely little scene soon after Coleman has moved in with Arthur. He's seated at the outdoor breakfast table as Arthur fusses about his comfort. Watch Coleman's subtle expressions as he responds to her winsome charm despite his better judgment. It's really quite a delightful and spontaneous level of emotion that goes unequaled for the remaining 90 minutes. The fact that the film was made at the close of the proletarian 1930's and the start of the world war accounts for much of the heavier subtext. Humanizing Coleman by exposing his ivory tower to bits of Americana a baseball game a jive joint is very much part of the times when the wisdom and vitality of the common man were being celebrated. Also reconciling a street radical of unknown persuasion like Dilg with the upperclass Coleman brings together opposing aspects of the Depression era. In short it says the law can be made to work for working people as well as for the more elite sectors despite a past history of conflict note how the real villain is exposed as the greedy plant owner. Mobilizing all aspects of American life under the leadership of Washington and New Deal reforms which the reconstructed Coleman represents was a major political aim of the period. And in its own way is what the movie is also aiming to do in an entertaining manner.Nonetheless noble aims or not the movie remains an erratic oddity and a somewhat awkward reflection of its time.".

Grant is terrific a truly great actor who rarely let his audience see anything but the famous Cary Grant persona. Here he's a man of the people with a clumsy walk and casual clothes.

Lightcap is barely able to stand the chicanery of Nora's household at first as he has a strict routine. Fast forward and he's flirting and dancing with a smartmouthed beautician Glenda Farrell in order to pump her for information about her boyfriend. His acting particularly his courtroom speech toward the end of the film is magnificent. Arthur plays Nora as a dizzy confused and nervous woman completely thrown as a landlord a friend and a woman by the appearance of Leopold and the brilliance of Lightcap as well as his admiration of her. She's torn between the two of them  and keeps the audience wondering.Really a mustsee for the lesson that true justice must be not read not preached but lived and for the wonderful characterizations and direction by Stevens.".

	schema:reviewBody "A pleasant comedy classic it is witty and well acted particularly by Ronald Colman as the law school professor. The film has some comedy parts that are overly silly as well as some sentimental bits that do not quite fit in however there is enough charm and genuinely amusing jokes to compensate. A number of genres are cleverly fitted into the material other than just comedy. At different times it leans towards being a thriller a mystery a drama and even a romance picture. Still it is a comedy throughout and for such a lighthearted treatment the messages are pressed too hard but this is not too much of a problem. The real drawback that I found was the final fifteen or so minutes which the film could have really done without. Otherwise this a well made picture benefited with a highly effective beginning montage sequence too.".

The film has some comedy parts that are overly silly as well as some sentimental bits that do not quite fit in however there is enough charm and genuinely amusing jokes to compensate. A number of genres are cleverly fitted into the material other than just comedy. At different times it leans towards being a thriller a mystery a drama and even a romance picture. Still it is a comedy throughout and for such a lighthearted treatment the messages are pressed too hard but this is not too much of a problem. The real drawback that I found was the final fifteen or so minutes which the film could have really done without. Otherwise this a well made picture benefited with a highly effective beginning montage sequence too.";

Over the years several stories The Girls In Their Summer Dresses Tip On A Dead Jockey In The French Style and novels The Young Lions Two Weeks In Another Town by Shaw would reach the screen and in addition he received Screenplay credit on film adaptations of other writers Fire Down Below Act Of Love and if his masterpiece was his own adaptation of two of his finest stories  A Year To Learn The Language and In The French Style The Talk Of The Town was not far behind. It's the kind of thing that used to epitomise Hollywood movies civilized sophisticated people good looking urbane feeling no need to disfigure themselves via the application of tattoos studs safety pins happy to utilise wellmodulated voices not to whine but to flip deceptively light dialogue at each other keeping it in the air like a juggler's clubs and in passing make the odd moralethical comment on society.

Casting Directors knowing nothing about the character but registering only the name Leopold Dilg would not immediately think of Cary Grant but the part of anarchistscapegoat fits him like a glove as does Supreme Court Judge in waiting Lightcap Ronald Coleman. If it seems a tad unlikely that cracker lawyer Edgar Buchanan was once a classmate of the urbane Ronald Coleman it needn't detain us long. For a film that is dialogue heavy it gets off to a flying start with a couple of minutes of montage in which the whole premise  a fire at a mill death of at least one man readymade scapegoat  is laid out like a red carpet at Cannes. Thereafter the three principals pick up the ball and run with it The Eighty Yard Run was of course another classic short story by Irwin Shaw.

	schema:reviewBody "Accused arsonist Cary Grant escapes from jail and hides out at the home of childhood friend Jean Arthur. The situation is further complicated when the man who was supposed to rent her house law professor Ronald Colman arrives earlier than expected. The two men debate law and grow to respect each other while both falling for Arthur. But Colman has no clue who Grant really is and when he finds out conflict arises between them.I have a lovehate relationship with The Talk of the Town. Most of it stems from the fact that all throughout the movie I found myself liking Ronald Colman's character the most. Yet the movie would have me be more sympathetic to Cary Grant. I understand the reasoning put forth for why I should root for Grant. He was innocent of the crime of which he was accused after all and Colman is somewhat stuffy and rigid in his beliefs. Intellectually I understand. But emotionally my sympathies lie with Colman's kind and gentle Professor Lightcap not Grant's arrogant and sometimes brutish Leopold Dilg. Innocent he may be nice he is not. So it was a sticking point for me and has continued to be so after multiple viewings over the years. I blame the script for not making Dilg more sympathetic beyond simply being innocent of the crime. The fact that he readily assaults people including Lightcap made me like him even less. Colman's wonderful performance earned my allegiance. I also disliked Jean Arthur's character more as the movie went along. It seemed like they were set on her ending up with Dilg at the end so in the second half they began to sabotage her relationship with Lightcap giving her a few bitchy scenes that were out of character with the way she was presented in the first half. So Lightcap doesn't even get the girl in the end. Dilg does and frankly all I kept thinking was what a miserable life they will have together. This guy has a huge chip on his shoulder and the likelihood he will wind up being behind bars again maybe for something he actually did next time is pretty strong. Maybe I'm thinking about it too much in the wrong way. I don't know really but I was dissatisfied with elements of the film so I can't rate it higher.The three stars are all fine although like I said Colman was the best. Most of the comedy falls on Jean Arthur's shoulders. The other two get some funny bits particularly Colman but Jean does most of the wacky stuff and that's almost all in the first half. The supporting cast is good including Edgar Buchanan and Rex Ingram. Glenda Farrell almost steals the picture with just a couple of scenes. Lloyd Bridges has an early role as a reporter. I wish it had lived up to its potential given the three legends as the leads. Still despite my issues with the film it really is a good dramedy. It's well directed and acted with a script full of nice dialogue. Fans of the stars will undoubtedly like it if not love it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cary Grant is inevitably charming as all get out as a prison escapee accused of burning down a mill and thus killing a foreman in the fire. Seeking out refuge in a house owned by Jean Arthur a schoolteacher on whom he has had a crush for years Grant has to hide in the attic since Arthur has rented the place out for the summer to Ronald Colman who plays an eminent law Professor who plans to write a book. Though there are certainly some funny enough instants in George Stevens's curiously labeled romantic comedy it is more determined as a relevant social commentary than a comedy. Cary Grant dares Ronald Colman to step out of his cerebrum and apply his didactic ideology to reality. Despite the fact that Grant and Jean Arthur are first billed and intended as the movie's stars though I would have definitely preferred Irene Dunne over the passable Arthur this film if truth be told is headed by Ronald Colman.This interesting picture begins as a neat and stagy farce and unravels as a film essentially about Colman's straitlaced social critic gradually developing into a pragmatist due to his unlikely bond between a schoolteacher and a framed fugitive mill worker. He sees that the beliefs of centuries of standards are not the natural last word on fair dealing and legal justice. As he begins to really set his feet on the ground he shaves his facial hair his symbol of dignified removedness in a great brief moment that which is the signature touch of Stevens showing the unhappily surprised look of his black driver played by a droll passive Rex Ingram. Now that I have discovered George Stevens much to my epiphanic delight I see that in his day he broke tremendous ground. It was later when he made Giant the first Hollywood movie to show the harsh realities of racism in America. The Talk of the Town is not nearly as good as Giant I find it ironic that it's a film about the scales of justice when the film itself seems a bit uneven uncertain of whether or not to give the 1940s moviegoers what they wanted in a comedy with Cary Grant and Jean Arthur applying the tiringly ineffectual autopilot clich of a love triangle but knows it must continue on its natural course as an examination of Ronald Colman's character. Nonetheless it is one of the few films by its time that passed judgment on the system that functions to pass judgment on us. The colossal hatred of the townspeople towards Grant makes an impartial trial in that town unfeasible.And yet like seemingly every other film with a dire social implication it is just as timely decades later not having awakened anyone to the extent that any progress has been made. The issue nowadays is hightech and that is the only difference Media exposure of people charged with this and that always seem to affect district jury assemblies whose judgments of defendants are compromised by the preconceptions by which they are surrounded. In The Talk of the Town Colman is advised strongly by his associates in political circles to steer clear of association with Grant's case to keep himself untainted before he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court. Any participating audience doubts the significance of a position on the Supreme Court if the prospective judge must betray his most realistic sense of justice.The court system is and must be an medium for advancement and social progress. Colman's climactic speech should be required reading for those who would take apart our judicial system at the heat of their excited and overextended spirited elements. As a film that dares people to match the doctrine they advocate The Talk of the Town should not be missed.".

It's a very awkwardly plotted film and the attempts at comedy fall flat. I never really believed Grant as a rabblerouser and he just can't seem to handle the dramatic angle of the picture at all.

'The Parallax View' is THE definitive 1970s paranoid thriller beaten only by Coppola's 'The Conversation' released incidentally the same year. The movie has to be watched in the context of when it was made. It's shot through with postWatergate cynicism and the Kennedy assassinations cast a long shadow over the plot. Beatty gives a very subtle relaxed performance and for me is totally believable. The supporting cast is first rate. Veteran Hume Cronyn 'Shadow Of A Doubt' plays Beatty's editor Paula Prentiss 'The Stepford Wives' a hysterical fellow journalist and William Daniels Dustin Hoffman's father in 'The Graduate' has a brief but memorable bit as another witness who fears for his life. Also keep an eye out for the legendary Bill McKinney who nobody who's ever seen 'Deliverance' will forget! as an assassin Anthony Zerbe 'The Omega Man' as a psychologist playing Pong with a chimp! and Earl Hindman 'The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three' in the bar fight scene. Much of 'The Parallax View' was later used in 'Arlington Road' an unconvincing movie which was much too contrived for me to be believable. It just didn't have the subtlety that this one has and spelled everything out seeming assuming its audience wasn't bright enough to get it. 'The Parallax View' is still one of the most intelligent tense and effective conspiracy thrillers ever made and the direction by the late Alan J. Pakula is just about flawless. Highly recommended.".

His commanding use of light shapes and most of all darkness creates a sense of uncertainty that flavors this socalled paranoid thriller.  Along with undersung director Alan J.

That's fine.  It's supposed to be twobit paper.We are shown eyewitnesses who don't know what they thought they saw during an assassination attempt.  We don't know what we thought we saw either.

Kenneth Mars even gives Beatty a second false identity just in case the first one is checked.  Finally we take a slideshow psychological exam right along with Beatty and perhaps we wonder what our own responses to it show us to be.  It's a very special film that allows us to trust the filmmakers even though we know they may be giving us unreliable information.  That blind trust seems to be the soul of this truly great movie.Finally I'd like to cast a vote for Mr. Beatty as one of our true American acting treasures.  Where would the great films of the 70s be without his hip wisecracking presence?  Did we expect Elliott Gould to do all the work?".

	schema:reviewBody "PARALLAX VIEW is an impressive political thriller with an unusually specific and scary viewpoint. It posits that many conspiracies work because relatively few people are in on the whole joke some are involved in the set up some in the telling and some in the punchline but only a precious few are given the whole picture making detection almost impossible. The argument is compellingly made.It is the perfectly machinetooled punchline role the Powers That Be assign to an unwitting Warren Beatty that makes PARALLAX VIEW such a frightening movie. There seems to be a thread running through many of the bigger conspiracy movies see ARLINGTON ROAD ROLLERBALL NETWORK THE INSIDER etc. that suggests unless the individual can find an inroad to make themselves useful to the system the system finds a role for individual often not to his liking. In the case of NETWORK individual Howard Beal is initially spared by one geopolitical phase of the corporate system and allowed continue to rant on TV once he is properly slotted by Ned Beatty but he is ultimately murdered when the corporate television arm of the system no longer has a use for his declining ratings. He becomes a punchline.In THE INSIDER Russell Crowe is initially hung out to dry by the system until Al Pacino is able to find a way to manipulate the television arm of the system to find a value for Crowe. Crowe becomes the instrument of the telling.In ROLLERBALL James Caan is beloved by part of the system as the greatest celebrity sports figure of his time but ultimately sabotaged by another part of the corporate world which is trying to espouse the notion in the game that the individual can never beat the system something Caan has been indirectly doing by being too successful in the game. Caan successfully defeats the setup telling and punchline though he's probably not long for this world.In the case of Warren Beatty in the PARALLAX VIEW he is elected to take the fall for a political assassination which will simultaneously discredit his own conspiracy investigations. The task is accomplished with such cold blooded efficiency and clever precision one has to seriously doubt whether our own Federal government could do it. But then is that perceived incompetence of our officials just another con being perpetrated on us by Them? Beatty's mistake is that he underestimates the setup and becomes the posterchild of the system's punchline.It is in this battle between individual and system that THE PARALLAX VIEW really distinguishes itself. What initially appears to be the ambiguous paranoia of a decidedly neurotic woman is gradually allowed to organically grow such that we can begin to see tips of the iceberg along the way but don't want to believe what we're seeing even when the truth is apparent. That iceberg subtly floats by in different forms every time Beatty investigates further or reexamines his own position yet remains nearly invisible possibly because it is so big it cannot be seen or contemplated? Certainly there are aspects which lurch toward absurdity. For instance the nonfallout from the cartoonish bomb explosion of Beatty's plane containing an important political official no less certainly should have aroused greater attention and suspicion. A car chase about 23rds of the way through feels particularly tackedon. However the overall focus of this movie which is the slow peeling back of the layers to get to the irresistible mystery is highly effective. People can judge for themselves whether any of the dirty tricks this movie documents really go on but that's really not the point. This is a story full of intriguing moves and clever countermoves. Scams and ploys and scams inside of ploys. Most of these details are fascinating and we feel like Pakula is letting us in on some of the dirty little subversive things we've always feared may occur behind the doors of the seat of government. But ultimately this is a story about a man who looks too long at the sun and is so intrigued yet blinded by what he sees he ignores the nature of the sun which is to both illuminate and to burn. Whether any of the conspiracy suggested is true it remains one of the most compelling efforts of the seventies and is a mustsee. See it and judge for yourself.".

Base on the David Giler novel and aptly directed by Alan J. Pakula this movie is driven by suspense and fueled by circumstance. From the very beginning the audience is drawn ever forward with the hero and we hope he will get to the exit door before the Parallax crew prevents him.

They see their vastly superior scripts or movies that they are trying to promote or be financed rejected and then they come across a film such as the PARALLAX VIEW it must drive them potty having to make sense of this! That's too bad for them but in my case I'm just an end user I don't care about poor writing or plot holes or if a movie is a bit of a train wreck. I judge a film positively simply on the basis if it keeps my attention and entertains me or there are scenes in it that I like nothing else!In 1974 this type of movie was contemporary with America embroiled in a political and constitutional crisis with Watergate and struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of the Vietnam war as well as the hangover from the assassination of a President in 1963 . An investigation followed where the official report from the Warren Commission concluded Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone as the assassin . If this wasn't bad enough Oswald himself was rubbed out while in police custody by Jack Ruby who also died very shortly after seemingly in mysterious circumstances. In addition over the years there was apparently an unusually high number of deaths from people who were at some capacity involved or close to the facility of the JFK shooting i.e doctors nurses coroners security etc. Endless documentaries and books outlined the fact that many suffered more than there fare share of coronaries or pulmonary embolisms car crashes drownings and suicides in the immediate postassassination years!In addition if that wasn't enough ten years on from JFK and after the assassination of prominent civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and popular democratic presidential hopeful Bobby Kennedy as well as an failed attempt on segregationist and presidential contender George Wallace a skeptical US public did not buy the official line of a lone deranged gunmen with a grudge. The government had lied to them for so long about so much they were just ripe for alternative view or theory.What I like about this movie is the atmosphere created by Pakula the music score both at the beginning and the end as well as in certain areas during the movie. Also there is an eerie sense of foreboding it's quite unsettling. There are some good scenes i.e. up on top of the Seattle space needle the grinning assassin at the bottom after Joe Frady on the plane the meeting with one of his female companions the desperate and frightened Austin Tucker and lastly the brain washing scene at the parallax complex. I admit to seeing plot holes and I understand that it's frustrating at times with more questions than answers here but it still kept my attention. The ending is unsatisfactory and not easy to explain? Did Parallax realize that Frady was an investigative reporter or was he simply hired to be a patsy that would take the fall for a killing? I believe that it's likely that the movie allows the viewer to fill in these plot holes anyway they like bearing in mind that it would be impossible to produce this type of conspiracy in under two hours. Also they would have to fill in the gaps and form their own conclusions! Then again maybe Pakula was being subtle! The fact that the events that unfolded are not plausible only reinforced my feeling that maybe it was just his way of pointing out to a cynical public that the idea of this type of organized conspiracy was simply ludicrous so he presented a film that suggests just that!Personally I liked the movie there is a good cast with Warren Beatty William Daniels Paula Prentiss Hume Conyn and Earl Hindaman who played Mr Brown in the taking of Pelham 123. In particular I liked Bill McKinley as the assassin he never said much but came over as menacing he really seemed to enjoy his work! Overall more worked for me in this film than didn't. If you like 70's films and government conspiracy movies you'll probably get a kick out of this. There are also some nice out door shots too. I would recommend this movie.Note in 1975 a year after this movie was released President Gerald Ford who prior to becoming president was on the warren Commission was also a victim of a couple assassination attempts on him apparently from lone deranged gunwomen. Also ironically both Walter McGinn and Alan.J.Pakula were killed in automobile accidents a few years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how to start this review of the second installment in Alan J. Pakula's virtuoso Paranoia Trilogy. I guess I'll start at the beginning. The brooding realism of the beginning is arranged with a keen sense of the vertical. The camera divulges Seattle's Space Needle tower behind a totem pole where an assassination goes down amidst Independence Day pomp. A committee of officials constrained by the frame proclaims the lack of evidence of a wider conspiracy yet these are Watergate times and Alan J. Pakula marshals his investigation as a compulsory act of irresponsible speculation. Gordon Willis' cinematography twists the menacing from the everyday with unreserved harshness Overwhelming architecture the bomb warning scrawled on a napkin one character's last cup of coffee. All of the decade's political misgivings and introspection is concentrated into the merciless culmination with Yankee Doodle trumpeting in the bare hall while unpleasant transactions imbue the catwalks above a country awakening to methodical obscurity and transparency alike.What happens to our muckraking protagonist splinters the movie's straightforward standards and leaves the final 40 minutes or so as the most transcendent impressionistic illustration of paranoia not as a psychosomatic condition but more like the belief in it as an idea that I've ever seen. The first half of Pakula's anamorphically shot impressionistic thriller is about paranoia the second is paranoia. The movie is not that suspenseful. A lot of times Beatty's escape from danger seems remarkably effortless and his way of being recruited by the Parallax Corporation is less an obstacle than a convenient turning of the page to the recruitment itself. The movie is not about suspense. It's about mood and atmosphere. And when something malevolent happens the suspense is diffused in favor of creeping through this dark kitchensink world governed by power fear and indoctrination.Another thing at which Pakula excels and at which he reached an indelible peak in All the President's Men is demonstrated consistently throughout The Parallax View. People talk so very quietly in his movies. And if you think about it if you're this scared all the time there's no reason to talk any louder than that. And when Paula Prentiss an estranged fellow journalist of Beatty's who believes someone is trying to kill her does raise her voice early on in a scene she makes terrifying with a brilliant performance it's not only rage and fear our ears are racked with a profound desperation to escape from a silence that's turned lethal. Later someone else will talk to Beatty and he will say Who are you? He will be so tranquil and tenderly quiet when he says it.The evolution is realized through what I sincerely consider to be one of the very central sequences in American cinema in the 1970s Pakula's virtuoso showpiece of Kuleshovstyle perception the indoctrination slideshow a celestial event of imagery and keywords shot through the viewer's brains. I could describe further but the account would be dull and futile. It's simply a conquest of film language in a way that confounds textual explanation. Beholden in no insignificant portion to the Soviet montage theory in which solitary snippets of imagery are given implication due to the images flanking it this is shown to us from a character's precise pointofview. We've become him and are undergoing exactly what he is.Pakula shoots on location to capture a careful texture of the outside world's danger much of the time. And he has a strong feeling for the bizarre as in a scene where a character on a golf cart is shot in a vast banquet hall and the cart strays knocks over tables until police cars arrive on the vestibule floor. There's also an endeavor to enforce the glare of modern American architecture throughout as a monumental backdrop steel and glass edifices that look somehowoppressive.The conclusion has a relentless common sense to it. Sans spoilers I can merely say that it both insinuates how an establishment might get away with murder and how the unassisted loner hypothesis of assassination has a convincing tidiness about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bourne Identity is a reasonable starting point for a comparison. Both films are smart action thrillers about assassination. Both downplay the violence a bit and instead use substantial characters and an intelligent script to provide much of the menace instead of set piece fights. But the Bourne franchise the best of its kind today looks cartoonishly simple in comparison to this masterpiece. It is a top 100 movie of all time and a demonstration of what can happen when a Hollywood level of budget and craftsmanship is combined with an Indie or Brit sensibility and a limitless supply of good taste and sophistication in moviemaking.Pakula shows great respect for the intelligence of the audience and never over explains what is happening. This is a fine line to walk and the decisions here show mastery of that touchy subject. The closing scene is the closest we get to a wrapup and it doesn't go too far I thought.Governments including the US government really do practice assassination on a grand scale at times and they cover up assassinations and manipulate mass media and bomb airplanes and do all the extreme things that happen in this film. That is a historical fact and it is what makes this script so scary the movie bad guy is real and he has blood on his hands. This isn't a supernatural story or one that takes place in a simpler reality. The story happens in our world and does a good job of being plausible in broad outlines. I don't think this film would be made today. In the era of corporate control of the studios no one would spend this kind of money on a movie with a cynical perspective that does so little to pander to the audience. If a project like this one were being developed today it would be softened and sweetened and would lose what made it wonderful. Something like Inception is the closest we have gotten recently.".

Most didn't believe that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone and there was also a strong belief that there had been a high level cover up.When the President's brother Robert was later assassinated in circumstances which also led many to believe that a second gunman had been involved public distrust of official explanations grew even deeper and the Watergate scandal reinforced the opinions of those who believed that corruption cover ups and conspiracies were routinely being practised on a massive scale by ruthless groups who simply served their own interests and certainly didn't hold themselves accountable to the general public.The Parallax View captures perfectly the ominous and unsettling mood of this period when suspicion and cynicism were widespread and an increasingly apprehensive public became convinced that truth and integrity had become the greatest casualties of the era.When Joe Frady Warren Beatty a reporter for a small time newspaper is visited by his exgirlfriend Lee Carter Paula Prentiss she tells him that she's terrified and fears for her life. Three years previously she'd been a television reporter at an event at the Space Needle in Seattle where she'd witnessed the assassination of Senator Charles Carroll William Joyce and since that time six other witnesses had died unexpectedly. Her fear is that she'll be the next witness to be killed. Frady dismisses her concerns as being unfounded and regards the series of deaths as pure coincidence. When Lee's dead body is found shortly after and her death is recorded as either a suicide or the result of an accidental overdose Frady decides to investigate further.Frady's investigations lead him to the town of Salmontail where he gets involved in a fight with the local deputy sheriff and survives an attempt on his life before discovering some papers about the Parallax Corporation which appears to be an organisation which hires political assassins. He then meets Senator Carroll's exadviser on a boat which is destroyed when a bomb explodes. Frady is presumed dead and this enables him to continue his work under an assumed name.Frady subsequently applies to join the Parallax Corporation and after being accepted finds himself involved in some tense situations when a bomb is planted on a plane and again when another Senator is assassinated at a convention hall.The plot of The Parallax View is given credibility by the inclusion of elements which are recognisable from the JFK assassination more than one gunman involved and the untimely deaths of witnesses and an investigator who like Woodward and Bernstein in the case of the Watergate investigation is a newspaper reporter. Furthermore a powerful montage of images and titles which form part of the psychological test which Frady has to undergo in order to be recruited into the Parallax Corporation shows a very simple method by which a candidate's values and beliefs could easily be distorted.Frady is a flawed character who clearly believed he was a good deal smarter than he was and whose career had been set back by what his editor described as creative irresponsibility and drinking. When he embarked on his investigation he was immediately out of his depth and totally underestimated the degrees of danger and deception he would encounter. On screen this is symbolised on a number of occasions as he's seen dwarfed against an enormous dam or against the huge exterior wall of a convention hall or minimised in the centre of the frame when he's about to take the Parallax recruitment test.Importantly Warren Beatty is always believable as the main character in this movie which so brilliantly conveys the sense of disenchantment and paranoia which pervaded a period of time which was later seen by many as representing an end to innocence.".

	schema:headline " Parallax View  A greatly overrated and disappointing picture?";
	schema:reviewBody "Parallax View starring Warren Beatty playing a reporter in Alan J Pakula's film a couple years before ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. A film that did not enjoy success when it first was released but has apparently gained some momentum since.I had been reading some reviews full of praise for this film. It was compared to movies about conspiracy such as Three Days of the Condor All the President's Men Manchurian Candidate JFK and the Conversation. The movie has 7.4 average at IMDb and 91 at Rottentomatoes. My comparison would be POINT BLANK except this one being slightly inferior on all counts.A masterpiece of suspense tension and cinematic storytelling the likes of which sadly Hollywood doesn't make anymore.I'm happy that they don't. Maybe 70's seems better from distance or from parallax viewpoint? The movie was about a reporter Joseph FradyBeatty tracking a conspiracy to kill high position politicians I think...However the plot is sort of messy and unsatisfying questions are being unanswered and unexplained or never made. I'm not sure if this was by purpose or due to inadequate writing. In the beginning a politician is killed and shortly after possible witnesses from the crime scene are getting killed in various accidents...which sounds like a nice prospect for a thriller. However we are never explained why the urge to kill the witnesses in the first place? There was nothing to witness after the assassin getting killed at the event. Yes us viewers do see that someone else was involved in assassination at the crime scene but how would the witnesses know that remains a question not answered in the movie. I guess they just have to be killed all 12? of them...now that will make the conspiracy less noticeable for sure.While following a lead for one of the witness killings Frady eventually finds out that there may be a company called Parallax behind all this. So how to get more information on the company?  Simple fill out a psychological test application form and send it to the company. If you're found out to be an antisocial murdering type you get an interview...because that's how hit men are really recruited. In this interview they apply some brainwash techniques just to be on the safe side when dealing with a psychopath I guess. Although I don't see the need for a brainwash AND being a psychopath.Anyways the problem with the movie apart plot holes was the long dragging scenes. I found myself just staring at the screen thinking something unrelated. The movie never grabbed me along the attempted atmosphere...which was supposedly very dark and paranoid. Actually what was dark was the dim lit filming...it was so dark that you could hardly see anything in many of the scenes. This is something that is typical to many films of the 70's usually for the bottom of the barrel types. It can be used to film's advantage but not all way through imo especially when you're kept in the dark about what and why things are happening in the first place. Filming long and black shots does not a suspense make it actually requires something to be suspenseful about...something along the lines of TIGHTROPE or DIRTY HARRY perhaps where darkness was used wisely to not only in attempt to create but also to enhance existing atmosphere created by script acting and characterization.Talking about characters...There was no character development at all not even for the protagonist. Other characters did get very little screen time and seemed to be irrelevant. I don't know...maybe Hackman could have pulled this off but Beatty didn't seem to be able to.After the movie I found myself thinking...Wow I would have really hard time explaining the actual plot afterwards. Very unclear plot an unnecessary bar fight scene and out of nowhere car chase. What was that boat explosion all about...How come Frady was the only one to survive and how did he get to dry land? Were there only Frady and his boss working in this newspaper? How did he know there was a bomb on the plane? Who were the people he asked about the application form? etc etc...And most importantly why did this all happen in the first place!? It's really hard to tell since there was no character development nor explanations but rather jumping from one scene to another making it look sort of like a montage of cut scenes that were barely related. Rather hard to follow when you're in the trance state of staring and suddenly notice that it's a new scene you're watching...what happened in the last one how did we get here...Positives for the movie would be Somewhat creative brainwash scene along the lines of CLOCKWORK ORANGE Unclear ending...was Frady actually brainwashed and an assassin himself in the end. The way how he informs the plane crew about the bomb while not being accused himself of planting it. And finally a scene with a chimpanzee playing Pong. Yes you read it right this was the highlight of the movie for me personally...Watch The CONVERSATION or THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR instead. Former being vastly more successful on creating paranoid atmosphere and latter on suspense and having a good tight script with great pacing on keeping the suspense...NOT letting it drain away with long pointless disjointed and dim scenes as in PARALLAX VIEW.410".

	schema:reviewBody "The Parallax View belongs to a Golden Age of thrillers in American cinema. It seems in the '70s filmmakers couldn't get wrong with the thriller movie. It could not always be spectacular but it always had a little touch that made it enjoyable. From this decade came The Day of the Jackal The Conversation Three Days of the Condor Exquisite Corpses Klute Marathon Man and many others. There was a sense of paranoia of voyeurism of fascination with evil that made the decade perfect for this genre.Alan J. Pakula's paranoid thriller sometimes has a sloppy meandering narrative sometimes it doesn't make absolute sense but it has that little touch that je ne sais quoi that makes it enjoyable.Warren Beatty plays Joe Frady a journalist who's seen better days. He works for a small time newspaper not because he's still great at his job but because his boss played by Hume Cronyn feels sorry for him. One day Joe's old lover Lee Paula Prentiss comes to him in need of help claiming that someone is trying to kill her. Her evidence is showing him that six people related to the murder of a senator three years before have died since in mysterious circumstances. When she shows up dead too Joe starts investigating.His investigating takes him to the mysterious Parallax Corporation. What is its purpose? Who are the people working for it? The answers will come but in a confused and not particularly satisfying manner.Beatty isn't bad here but he's acted better.If I had to single out the real star of the movie I'd say it's director of photography Gordon Willis. Few DPs are as underrated as this master but in this movie he shows why he's one of the great masters of cinematography. His camera is always inventing and innovative. Here he uses a lot of wide shots emphasizing the growing loneliness of Joe as he becomes more and more involved in the Parallax Corporation. At other times his positioning of the camera allows him to 'split' the screen in halves and show simultaneous actions on each. The use of colors in the last minutes is unforgettable. And then there's the way he uses shadows the way he has characters step in and out of shadows existing in them as if it were their natural world. Willis does visual poetry here.Judging from Klute Pakula's previous thriller I'd say he has problems with plot and narrative. In Klute that was compensated with a great performance by Jane Fonda. In here by Willis' work and even by the outlandish aspects of the plot sloppy as it may be. It's not the perfect thriller but it's an enjoyable mindbending one.".

	schema:headline " Visual metaphors clarify a confusing conspiracy";
	schema:reviewBody "As others have said Pakula's paranoid tale subverts the Hollywood paradigm. Creating an unreliable hero is only the beginning it is difficult to tell who is lying who is telling the truth  or how much of the truth they know. It's a lot more real than onetrack plots which leave no room for doubt. I have always thought it was influenced heavily by CostaGavras's magnificent film Z where conflicting versions of the central event are on display.  Nevertheless in Z it adds up to a clearcut conspiracy even though not all the conspirators will be punished here it adds up to a depressing  but again real  failure to get the evidence where and when it is needed like Silkwood.What sets it apart in my viewing however is the way Pakula deploys visual metaphors throughout the story and I am disappointed that other commentators obviously haven't picked up on them. The most important of these is the setting of the central event the assassination on 4 July! atop the Space Needle in Seattle. It's a circular venue.  That means that each witness sees the event from a different angle that is the very meaning of parallax. It's also why different versions of the event emerge and continue and why some people telling the truth can't be reconciled with others. The opening sequence doesn't merely define parallax it defines the whole film. There are many other examples such as the hypertrophied attempt the wash the conspiracy clean by releasing a flood from a dam.  Don't mistake this for a naturalistic film it's as highly stylised as Eastwood's The Gauntlet or Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.A collection of great writers  Lorenzo Semple Jr Robert Towne Chinatownamong them  put together this narrative which is deliberately fuzzy.  Many socalled filmmakers would be satisfied to simply relate a script as good as that but Pakula's films always had a visual vitality that adds a further dimension. It's supposed to be why we watch films instead of reading books.  In this film there is a valuable visual commentary on the plot which will take the tale to the attentive viewer on another level.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is a typical things are not always what they seem sinister powers are covering up paranoid fantasy and there's not really much to the murky plot but director Alan J.

With incredibly long takes amazing wide shots and masterful use of darkness and light it's a treasure to look at. Cinematography usually can't save a film but it does here. Warren Beatty is little more that a fantastic haircut and movie star charisma and the screenplay is disjointed and undercooked. For a bigbudget American studio film answers and motivations are thin on the ground. There are no character arcs here. Beside's Beatty and his putupon but supportive editor Hume Cronyn every other character is a killer or a victim. There's something to be said for that and I'm sure it's intentional but it may leave modern audiences wanting more.But if you can forget about that The Parralax View is a real treat for anyone who doesn't like their plot mashed up and served room temperature. The audience sees only a little more than Beatty's reporter and usually learns what's going on just as he does. He is confused and not quite sure of what he's on to and neither are we. It's a wonderful distillation of all the fear and burgeoning mistrust of the government and the establishment that gripped America in the fallout of Watergate. All the President's Men is a better film. Better acted better written and more engaging because it was news just a few years earlier. The Parralax View however is creepier more deeply pessimistic and far more unsettling.".

It's not the way a splatter horror picture is shocking people but finally it's the same cheap level. This movie does not deliver many explanations for the strange things going on in it. But it delivers a couple of unintentionally funny or implausible scenes like the boat explosion with only one survivor surprise surprise who the survivor is... the stereotype bar brawl between the lead character and the sheriff's assistant or the plane scene with minutes full of.... nothing. One long shot after the other. You see stewardesses doing their job. It looks like you should start being scared about what's going on but you aren't... and after that plane scene the overlong style is still killing this movie more and more slowly until its end. Only because nothing happens or things happen very slowly a movie isn't exciting or creates suspense automatically. On the other hand the movie steadily tries to submit to audience there are some very SERIOUS things going on out there behind that what we call 'reality' but the problem is the movie itself makes it difficult to take it serious.I really enjoyed 'All the President's Men' but this one here is so hypothetic it can never work without a good style of narration which DOES deliver explanations and creates suspense in an interesting way but not with a couple of overlong scenes in a row. I liked the way Hume Cronyn and especially old Western veteran Jim Davis played their parts and the manipulative scene in which Frady is confronted with a collage of pictures and keywords but this is nearly everything about this movie that was interesting to me. It starts quite well but after the murder case which leads Frady into his investigations in other words after 15 or 20 minutes the movie is getting bumptious. There are dozens of more informative conspiracy movies...after having seen this one you just ask yourself What have I been told by this movie?".

	schema:reviewBody "That three of 1974's major film releases Chinatown The Conversation and The Parallax View deal with themes of conspiracy corruption and distrust is no coincidence. After a decade which had brought events as momentous and shocking as the Kennedy and other political assassinations the 'Cuban Missile Crisis' raceriots the Vietnam War and finally the 'Watergate' scandal it's little wonder that US film audiences were eager to go and see films which expressed their collective sense of uncertainty unease and distrust. Of this trio of films perhaps the least well known is the late Alan J. Pakula's The Parallax View. And whilst it may not be as polished or complete a production as the other two movies I'd argue that it's the one which is most effective at capturing the early 1970's paranoiac Zeitgeist.The thriller stars Hollywood legend Warren Beatty as an American smalltown journalist Joseph Frady who becomes drawn into a deadly investigation due to events he witnessed earlier in his career. Pakula manages to cleverly weave the film's plot so that the 'enemy' from both Frady's and the audiences' perspective is only partially identifiable and their motives seem unclear  just the feelings that film's contemporary viewers may well have held about some of the dark forces responsible for some of America's problems at that time. This coupled with Beatty's quietly charismatic and believable performance allows the film's audience to really engage and identify with the film's main character and the peril that he faces.The movie has many other strong elements too. Its musical score by Michael Small is particularly accomplished  throughout the film it manages to convey a strong feeling of the seemingly omnipresent threat that Frady's enemies pose. Likewise Gordon Willis's cinematography is firstrate as is the supporting cast too. William Daniels Paula Prentiss and the wonderful Hume Cronyn who plays Frady's newspaper editor all give superb performances.Sadly though the film also has a rather significant flaw. Whilst it may have many subtle political messages first and foremost it is supposed to be a thriller and some could argue that it fails to deliver in this regard. The first half of the movie ratches up the tension nicely but sadly the latter part of the film doesn't provide any major thrills.However any aspects of the film that warrant criticism are largely overshadowed by its many finer points. One profound scene in which Beatty's character is made to watch a montage of striking images stands out as the film's highlight. The purpose of this 'film within a film' seems to be to question the amount of trust that we should place in society's traditional institutions.So although The Parallax View ultimately may lack the cohesion and cinematic rhythm to be an outstanding thriller or mystery  unlike the masterpiece that is Chinatown for example  this unusual film still deserves to be regarded as a classic of the conspiracy genre. Okay it offers no clear answers or solutions but instead it is a powerful reflection of the instincts and emotions that were prevalent around the time it was made. Film audiences would have to wait for another two years before another of Pakula's productions 1976's All The President's Men would finally be able to offer some real explanations.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has become commonplace to identify '70s Hollywood films as their own genre. I'll go one farther and identify this era as a collective structural autuer. If that hypothesis holds any water this is one of its impressive works. Made shortly after Watergate and less than a decade after the JFK assassination this envisions conspiracies and assassinations not as a disruption of but a cornerstone of the American establishment. This is in a sense not a POLITICAL conspiracy thriller. The US government or that of any other country is presented as merely a dope of a greater power that of the big corporations of whatever stripe. This is a dystopian capitalist democracy one in which representatives are elected to officially be as clueless as the general populace about the real social reality around them. Perhaps the most subversive thing about this very subversive film is that the assassinations don't seem catastrophic or even troubling. When one takes place the victim politician is basically a walking sound bite. His sacrifice seems only the continuation of a ritual of banal brutality. In one scene a film is shown that is supposed to condition the viewer to murderous obedience. It is a montage of images of Americana including those of violence and oppression. In most '70s conspiracy thrillers the evil that lurked beneath the surface had a predatory relation to the commonly understood reality. People were putting their trust in a machine that was not what it seemed. Here the evil is the surface. America IS the conspiracy. DP Gordon Willis has never impressed me more. In his work with Woody Allen and Francis Coppola his showoffy use of shadow and intheframe lighting sources seemed at times to distract from the tone or theme of the film as if Willis was only interested in defining his look regardless of its relation to the film's content. Here it fits the tone of the film perfectly. The final scenes largely devoid of dialog in a hall filled with terrifyingly patriotic imagery is gorgeous. Many of the shots reminded me of de Cherico paintings.".

There are two culprits both dressed as waiters but the one who did not do the actual shooting is trapped on the Needle roof by security guards and quickly falls to his death. The other escapes and reports to an unseen party that the job was completed. A few months later the investigative committee which allows no questions states that the assassin acted alone. Case closed. Over the next three years six of the witnesses die in assorted ways. A reporter who was present during the assassination expresses her concerns to Oregon Portland investigative reporter Joe Frady who brushes her off. When she is found dead a few days later in her apartment a coroner states that the cause of death was an overdose of barbiturates. Frady now skeptical convinces his editorboss Bill Rintels to allow him to further investigate the events concerning the Carroll assassination.Frady drives to a small Washington town where a witness died while fishing in a creek near a dam. After winning minor battles  a bar room fight and a car chase  Frady has gathered documents about the Parallax Corporation. He reports his findings to an incredulous Rintels. Frady though submits a doctored application with an alias Richard Parton to Parallax. Shortly after Frady meets with Austin Tucker a former Carroll aide who is most distressed about two assassination attempts on his life. Tucker takes Brady on his sailboat where he explains his concerns about the Carroll assassination coverup. He shows Frady a photo of the second Carroll assassin the surviving waiter. Right after the boat explodes and all aboard die except for Frady who jumps off in time into the water. He returns to Rintels who now forms a pact with Frady. The latter goes undercover.In Los Angeles a representative of the Parallax Corporation who wants Frady to join the company visits him. Going to the company HQ for testing Frady is shown a special room where brainwashing techniques are employed. Words photos and images are used to chilling effect. They begin with good and positive words and images LOVE  MOTHER  COUNTRY ... GOD  HAPPINESS  FATHER  but then there is a mixture Hitler  CASTRO  HOME  ME  COUNTRY  ENEMY  SEX  NIXON  POLICE  CHEERLEADER  OSWALD  ending with mostly bad KKK  Hitler  GUNS  Satan  CROWDS  GRAVES  FLOWERS  crescendo. When the test is complete Frady leaves the building for the day. He spots the Carroll assassin and tails him to the airport where the killer checks himself with a briefcase onto an airplane to Chicago. Frady manages to get aboard but the assassin never embarks. Knowing that the briefcase is on board and spotting a prominent political figure Frady believes that the briefcase has a bomb. Through various means he is successful in getting the plane to return to the airport after which it blows up but not before all have safely disembarked.In LA Frady is contacted by the Parallax official who then offers him a job with a good salary. The official though has concerns about Frady's alias and other statements on the application and he intends to investigate further. Fearing that his real name and purpose may be found out Frady mails incriminating information to Rintels who now knows that the reporter is onto a big story. Rintels though is soon poisoned officially a heart attack and the evidence disappears. This scene is important because it shows that the syndicate is onto Frady.Unaware of the editor's murder and now on his own Frady spots the Carroll assassin and follows him to the LA Convention Center. There Frady sees other Parallax personnel. Meanwhile Senator George Hammond is practicing for a youth rally and a marching band is present. As Hammond rides on a golf cart onto the convention floor an assassin on an overhead walkway guns him down with a rifle. The onlookers see Frady nearby and think that he killed Hammond. But Frady chases after the assassin who wheeling about fires! A few months later the investigative committee brings forth its findings George Hammond was assassinated by Joe Frady. There is no evidence in any conspiracy in the death of George Hammond.".

Right after the boat explodes and all aboard die except for Frady who jumps off in time into the water. He returns to Rintels who now forms a pact with Frady. The latter goes undercover.In Los Angeles a representative of the Parallax Corporation who wants Frady to join the company visits him. Going to the company HQ for testing Frady is shown a special room where brainwashing techniques are employed. Words photos and images are used to chilling effect. They begin with good and positive words and images LOVE  MOTHER  COUNTRY ... GOD  HAPPINESS  FATHER  but then there is a mixture Hitler  CASTRO  HOME  ME  COUNTRY  ENEMY  SEX  NIXON  POLICE  CHEERLEADER  OSWALD  ending with mostly bad KKK  Hitler  GUNS  Satan  CROWDS  GRAVES  FLOWERS  crescendo. When the test is complete Frady leaves the building for the day. He spots the Carroll assassin and tails him to the airport where the killer checks himself with a briefcase onto an airplane to Chicago. Frady manages to get aboard but the assassin never embarks. Knowing that the briefcase is on board and spotting a prominent political figure Frady believes that the briefcase has a bomb. Through various means he is successful in getting the plane to return to the airport after which it blows up but not before all have safely disembarked.In LA Frady is contacted by the Parallax official who then offers him a job with a good salary. The official though has concerns about Frady's alias and other statements on the application and he intends to investigate further. Fearing that his real name and purpose may be found out Frady mails incriminating information to Rintels who now knows that the reporter is onto a big story. Rintels though is soon poisoned officially a heart attack and the evidence disappears. This scene is important because it shows that the syndicate is onto Frady.Unaware of the editor's murder and now on his own Frady spots the Carroll assassin and follows him to the LA Convention Center. There Frady sees other Parallax personnel. Meanwhile Senator George Hammond is practicing for a youth rally and a marching band is present. As Hammond rides on a golf cart onto the convention floor an assassin on an overhead walkway guns him down with a rifle. The onlookers see Frady nearby and think that he killed Hammond. But Frady chases after the assassin who wheeling about fires! A few months later the investigative committee brings forth its findings George Hammond was assassinated by Joe Frady. There is no evidence in any conspiracy in the death of George Hammond.";

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder is a director with an understanding of cinema that is almost unmatched throughout the medium's entire history  that's why his films are always so good. Witness for the Prosecution is yet another highlight in the great director's history and it proves that courtroom dramas can be both riveting and a great opportunity for some first rate comedy. Wilder's film features one of the most well paced plots I've ever seen in a film and it's a plot that includes some very finely tuned twists. Towards the end Wilder bombards us with twist after twist each one both making sense and topping the one before it. In a time when people are impressed by films such as 'The Sixth Sense' Billy Wilder still shows us how to skilfully attribute a twist into a film's plot. The plot itself follows the story of Sir Wilfrid Robarts an ace defence lawyer that has been told that his health won't allow him to tackle anything more than mundane cases but is brought back into the fray when a case involving the murder of an elderly woman comes into his hands. Wilfrid must now juggle the case and his health as he attempts to keep the young man from being sent down.Like all Wilder films this one is a very pleasurable viewing. Wilder manages to find a middle ground between substance and entertainment and so this is a film that will please fans of both aspects. The film is deliriously entertaining throughout with some truly great lines of dialogue most of which is very quotable and every twist adds a new level to the story. The substance comes from a multitude of angles and themes of love health sacrifice and most notably justice are all more than prevalent. The acting is certainly of note in Witness for the Prosecution. Charles Laughton is absolutely sublime as the undermining and stubborn Wilfrid Robarts his performance is very strong and makes up the backbone of the film. The main supporting performance comes from Marlene Dietrich. I'm not a big fan of hers despite having a great pair of legs she just doesn't do anything for me but in this film she brings sufficient coldness to her character and really makes it her own. The final main performance comes from Tyrone Power he isn't as great as the other two but does enough with his character to ensure he's believable. Highly recommended viewing!".

I can't praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.Tyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden. She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate. When she's murdered Scotland Yard arrests Power.Power's solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton. Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case. Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor's advice.The original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 but lost to Alec Guinness. Marlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She's a war bride over from Germany and she's got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.The AngloSaxon legal system's goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution.".

Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor's advice.The original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 but lost to Alec Guinness. Marlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She's a war bride over from Germany and she's got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.The AngloSaxon legal system's goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution.";

The shocking ending caused quite a stir back then too.The only part of the movie I thought looked dated and unrealistic was Tyrone Power's character being able to interrupt the trial with outbursts and not be reprimanded for it. There is no way that would be tolerated at least today.Otherwise it's a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton who plays Power's defense attorney grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power's wife. Laughton's dialog is terrific throughout bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He's just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn't have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester playing Laughton's nurse. She too demonstrates her comedic talent and significantly adds to the fun of watching this film.If you like some fine drama storyline twists a little humor thrown in and great acting and dialog this is a classic film to check out.".

	schema:headline " If you've seen the movie be sure to read Christie's story. If you've read the story still see this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Witness for the Prosecution is as IMDb voters cann attest a great movie. A clever characterdriven courtroom drama it deserved the Academy Award nominations that it received in 1958 and it has justly endured to the present day. Starring the terrific talents of Charles Laughton Tyrone Power and particularly Marlene Dietrich directed by Billy Wilder and based on the superb short story by Agatha Christie it is a combination has all of the very best ingredients and delivers a nearly outstanding film.The movie centers around Laughton's character an aged feisty and very canny English barrister lawyer who is in poor health and headed toward retirement. The opening of the movie is entirely Laughton's show as he portrays a curmudgeonly and endearing character. On his first day home from the hospital he soon takes up the defense of Leonard Vole Power a man who is charged with murder and up against a barrage of circumstantial evidence. Power is convincing as the honest and somewhat naive defendant in increasingly over his head. Soon Dietrich makes her entrance as Vole's cool German femme fatal of a wife. After a few flashbacks to set up the story of the murder case Laughton takes up Vole's case. What ensues is a wellwritten and welldirected courtroom drama in which Laughton continues to shine delivering a convincing performance peppered with humor. Soon the story takes a series of dramatic twists during which Power plays his part as the beleaguered defendant to the hilt and Dietrich uses the gifts that made her a legend. By the end the audience has been treated to an excellent drama with sensational acting.The result is a classic but not an icon in the sense that Christie's short story penned twenty years earlier would become. While it may be the bestregarded of all Christie adaptations Murder on the Orient Express a possible exception the movie does not seem to have the stature it ought to have. At the end of the movie I did not feel the same as when I read the story and not just because I knew all along how it would turn out. With such visible talent on all fronts I took a long look at what it was and what was missing. The answer Christie. The movie is good in its own right but from the beginning misses the crucial aspect that the original story has the mystery. Agatha Christie is the master of suspense and throughout the story that suspense that anxiousness to know what will happen next the eagerness to know where this next twist will lead and the shock that comes at the very end were what the story was all about. The direction the movie went the legal thriller substituted drama for mystery and while the movie only added to the story changing very little of what Christie wrote the movie lost the grip that only she could create. Christie treated the courtroom proceedings the centerpiece of the movie with brevity focusing on the intrigue surrounding the case. Also the Hollywood ending overdoes it a little bit and deprives the most important plot twist of some of its its emotional impact.That said however the movie is still a classic. Fortunately the heart of the story was still very strong with a unique plot and rich characters which were taken advantage of by Wilder and the cast respectively. And as it turns out the movie is a good complement to the story. To those who have only seen the movie the story should be read to truly appreciate the missing value of the mystery. To those who have read the story the movie nails the characters particularly Dietrich's Mrs. Vole. All in all I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and would gladly see it again.".

Moreover this is one BW movie for people who don't like BW movies.";

	schema:headline " I suspected something but not that. Never that!";
	schema:reviewBody "That's a quotation from the film and what you'll say at the conclusion. I saw it the first time 36 years ago back when network TV ran old movies late at night and I'd never even heard of it. I thought it was a Hitchcock film with all of the unexpected twists but no the director was Billy Wilder. How surprised I was to see Wilder do Hitchcock better than Hitchcock ever could! The setup is this  Leonard Vole Tyrone Power is an inventor that is having trouble getting his inventions to market. He befriends a wealthy older woman one Emily French. She is obviously flirting with him and Vole though married flirts back his objective being that maybe she will financially back one of his inventions. Then disaster strikes. Emily French is found murdered. Vole is an obvious suspect because Mrs. French has just changed her will and left everything to Vole. There is circumstantial evidence pointing to Vole and he says he knows nothing about the will. Enter barrister Sir Wilfred the finest in England whose doctor has told him he must quit work and go on a vacation because of his heart condition. Sir Wilfred talks to Vole believes his story and also talks to his wife Christine Marlene Dietrich who backs up Leonard's story but comes across as somewhat cold to her husband's peril. Sir Wilfred is convinced to take the case and agrees to retire upon this last trial. Past that I cannot tell you any details or I'll ruin it for you.Everyone in the cast performs masterfully. Especially charming is the interaction between Laughton's character and his nurse played by his wife of then 28 years Elsa Lanchester. They go back and forth at each other with Nurse Pimsoll insisting that Sir Wilfred keep his rigid schedule of medications and him treating her like a jailer with hilarious one liners at the poor woman's expense. Only a long married couple could do this feature length banter so well. If Nightmare Alley didn't convince you that Tyrone Power was more than a pretty face this film will. Likewise Marlene Dietrich is much more than a blue angel and a fine figure of a woman at age 56.Notice all of the little touches. How Sir Wilfred seems to be ignoring testimony in court by counting out his pills only to stand up and ask insightful questions when his turn comes. Plus this film really shows that nothing is off the record even if the judge says that it is  the jury hears and sees everything. Sir Wilfred plays on that fact.Great acting great direction great story  it doesn't get any better than this. Thus I give this a solid 1010. And one irony  Power's character mentions several times about Sir Wilfred's heart but it is Tyrone Power himself who will be dead of a heart attack by the end of the following year. Sadly this is his last completed film.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the artistic success of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE the only notable film based on Dame Agatha Christie's stories was a remake of LOVE FROM A STRANGER with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney as the illmatched couple but restaged in the 1890s rather than 1930 England. Then in 1957 Billy Wilder made this production of a short story by Dame Agatha called WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. With a tiptop cast of Charles Laughton Marlene Dietrich Tyrone Power and Elsa Lancaster the film was a brilliantly done version of Christie's short story changed in it's ending but to a changed ending found in Christie's own dramatization. Leonard Vole Tyrone Power is a salesman who meets an elderly wealthy woman Norma Varden and gains her affections  much to the dislike and mistrust of her servant Una O'Connor. O'Connor claims she saw the two together the night that Varden was beaten to death in her apartment. Vole is arrested and his solicitor Henry Daniell wants England's best barrister Sir Wilfred Robarts Laughton to defend him. Robarts is recovering from a heart attack and is being nursed by Miss Plimsoll Elsa Lancaster. He is a difficult patient and is not looking forward to an enforced rest in Bermuda. So despite the protests of Plimsoll he takes the case. He does promise her he will listen to his doctor and take his medicine. She does not trust him. Sir Robert meets Vole's German born wife Christina Helm Dietrich who alarms him. She is too cool to detached at her husband's peril. But he goes ahead and is soon in court fighting a first rate opponent Torin Thatcher as Myers and scores some impressive points against the prosecution especially in crossexamining O'Connor. But at the critical moment he finds that by a subtle point of law Dietrich can testify against Power and does so. So the plot becomes how to defeat this witness for the prosecution? Is there something that can turn the tables on her and her testimony.And the evidence to use against Dietrich does appear  from an unexpected source. Is it effective? Will Power be saved in the end? Or is there something going on?Although the conclusion of this film has been pretty well known for years I will refrain from explaining what it is. A good mystery should surprise the audience as this does every audience that sees it for the first time. Laughton and Lancaster make a funny pair and in the end an endearing one from Lancaster's point of view. Power gets to play his most sinister part since the Great Stanton Carlyle in NIGHTMARE ALLEY. And Dietrich does pull off the biggest surprise twist in her career. As for Wilder after some questionable films in the mid 1950s THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS he was back in form. His handling of the courtroom scenes which make up nearly 60 of the film are far more realistic and speedy than Alfred Hitchcock's plodding THE PARADINE CASE a decade earlier. It was the best of the Christie films prior to MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.".

I know she lived a long time but still if I lived as long as Methusala I couldn't grind out that many pieces. Not just novels either but plays including this one. And they all tell the kinds of stories that involve a lot of lead time while the author works out the details of the intricate plots. Between Jack Kerouac knocking out On The Road on a single roll of toilet paper or whatever it was and Nabokov and his multitudinous 3 X 5 index cards Christie must have been very much closer to Nabokov.This is an engrossing and tightly wound tale of greed murder deception bigamy adultery and all the other good things in life. It's essentially a courtroom drama with several big  REALLY big  surprises. It does not end the way you might expect with the true criminal suddenly revealed in all his moral turpitude by the expert penetrating examination by the defense breaking down in the witness chair and sobbing Okay. I did it! I DID IT! I didn't mean to kill her! I just wanted to frighten her. The play's the thing in this movie yet the director Billy Wilder brings his own snappy interpretation to it. The dialog is unashamedly fast. Nobody dawdles over significant utterances. Even on the witness stand they seem to make a series of unhesitating declarations. Yes. No. Yes I told you already. And it wouldn't be as good as it is without the acting. Charles Laughton is the central figure one of those cute old curmudgeons that everyone likes because of his weakness for cigars and brandy. His efforts to bootleg these items under the nose of his nurse his real wife Elsa Lanchester are pretty funny. She won't even find the ASHES he cackles innocently like a child getting away with mischief flicking his cigar ash into an empty drawer. She's always bright and chipper and energetic a nice contrast to his flabby sedate presence.Una O'Connor as the Scottish maid is extremely engaging as well snapping back indignantly at the judge. Tyrone Power is called on to change from a careless and thoughtful guy to one stricken by fate then back again and he pulls it off. Henry Daniell a Robin Hood villain and John Williams ever the legal type are welcome in every scene in which they appear. Reliable sorts don't you know. But Marlene Dietrich takes the palm. She was everyone's idea of a nobaloney kind of woman but never anyone's idea of a great actress. And yet she had me fooled here. Oh hammy sure but her performances fit in because EVERYONE is hammy in Witness for the Prosecution. God forbid anyone try to make anything serious and arty out of an Agatha Christie mystery! They're fine just as they are.".

	schema:reviewBody "Entertaining suspense movie packs thrills  intrigue  twists and turns  being realized in Hitchcock style . As the tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses including sensational acting  enjoyable dialog and interesting screenplay from start to finish . Leonard Vole Tyrone Power is detained on suspicion of killing an elderly acquaintance . He employs an experienced but aging barrister Sir Wilfrid Charles Lawton as his defense attorney who is recovering from a severe heart attack . The ill advocate at law is attended by a nurse Miss Plimsoll Elsa Lanchester  they were reallife husband and wife. Excellent film packs drama  emotion  suspense and plot twists . This agreeable and often intriguing picture from master of comedy has a memorable scene after another . It contains interesting intrigue based on Agatha Christie's novel  fun intrigue  amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The film followed the basic story of Agatha Christie's play but director and coscreenwriter Billy Wilder opened up the story by including numerous scenes that did not take place solely in the courtroom as the play had and changed the emphasis from Leonard Vole to Sir Wilfrid Robarts. Topnotch and unforgettable performance from Charles Laughton as the peculiar as well as intelligent barrister  throwing himself into the role with dedication and delight . Nice acting by Tyrone Power  this would be his last complete film  he would die of a heart attack while on the set of his next film Salomon less than one year after release of this one . Sensational support cast  including familiar faces such as Elsa Lanchester  John Williams  Henry Daniell  Ruta Lee  Torin Thatcher and veteran Ian Wolfe . Special mention for Una O'Connor  this was Una O'Connor's last big screen motion picture and she was the only member of the original Broadway cast of the play to repeat her role on film . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Russell Harlan . The producers were so concerned about the financial success of the film that during the credits an announcer urges the audience not to reveal the film's ending to anyone . Lavishly produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and Edward Small  as the courtroom setting which cost 75000 to build was a recreation of an actual courtroom in London's Central Criminal Courts  The Old Bailey. The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines  amusing dialogues  humor and entertaining intrigue . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as Ninotchka  Ball of fire  making their film debut as such with Major and the minor . Sunset Boulevard was their last picture together before they split up . Later on  Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for Stalag 17 dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that  they wroteproduceddirected such classics as Ace in the hole  the touching romantic comedy Sabrina  this Witness for the prosecution and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe  the warmth Seven year itch and Some like hot. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun The apartment. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s  the duo fell headlong into the pit  they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as Buddy buddy Fedora  Front page and Secret life of Sherlock Holmes though the agreeable Avanti slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . Witness for prosecution rating  Above average  essential and indispensable watching . It justly deserves its place among the best Court Dramas ever made . One of the very best films of all time and to see and see again . An extremely entertaining and riveting film and completely provoking  as it ranked 6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre Courtroom Drama . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but  because the treatment  enjoy it all the same .".

Lavishly produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and Edward Small  as the courtroom setting which cost 75000 to build was a recreation of an actual courtroom in London's Central Criminal Courts  The Old Bailey. The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines  amusing dialogues  humor and entertaining intrigue . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as Ninotchka  Ball of fire  making their film debut as such with Major and the minor . Sunset Boulevard was their last picture together before they split up . Later on  Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for Stalag 17 dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that  they wroteproduceddirected such classics as Ace in the hole  the touching romantic comedy Sabrina  this Witness for the prosecution and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe  the warmth Seven year itch and Some like hot. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun The apartment. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s  the duo fell headlong into the pit  they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as Buddy buddy Fedora  Front page and Secret life of Sherlock Holmes though the agreeable Avanti slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . Witness for prosecution rating  Above average  essential and indispensable watching . It justly deserves its place among the best Court Dramas ever made . One of the very best films of all time and to see and see again . An extremely entertaining and riveting film and completely provoking  as it ranked 6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre Courtroom Drama . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but  because the treatment  enjoy it all the same .";

Charles Laughton completely owns the courtroom starring as a famously brilliant barrister who's supposed to be taking a break for his healthbut he gets drawn in by a truly compelling murder trial. Tyrone Power in his last movie has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. While all the evidence racks up against him Charles doesn't give up hope and tries to win the case all the while trying to crack the very hard nut Marlene Dietrich. Marlene is Tyrone's wife and it's impossible to tell what she's really thinking or feeling.I love this story and I love both versions of the film from 1957 and 1982. It's incredibly suspenseful and interestingand also quite impossible to talk about without giving spoilers. If you've never seen Witness for the Prosecution add this one to your list of classics to rent. The acting is fantastic and the timing makes it a very entertaining old movie to watch. There are no boring bits in this drama and I guarantee you'll still sit on the edge of your seat the second time you watch it.".

I absolutely positively worship this brilliant woman and try to read as many of her novels short stories and stage play adaptations as possible. Witness for the Prosecution is a genuine classic and although somewhat atypical for Christie it is undeniably one of the greatest stories ever penned down. There's one major disadvantage about having read all of Christie's whodunits of course namely that you can't experience the same astounding twistintheend twice! I would really have loved to be overwhelmed by the climax of this film version especially because Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power give away such fabulous performances. The story with its fascinating characters and dazzling plot twists does remain the movie's biggest strongpoint but there are a number of more reasons why Witness for the Prosecution is righteously considered as one of the most massive milestones in cinematic history. Billy Wilder's surefooted direction for one and the stellar performances of the entire ensemble cast. I mentioned Dietrich and Power already but there's also the downright phenomenal Charles Laughton arguably the most shamefully neglected actordirector in history and an appealing supportive role for Elsa Lancaster. But do I daresay that the ultimate successfactor of this stage play adaptation is the masterful recreation of the court trial? The bombastic settings and decors the echoing acoustics the powerful monologues of confident and arrogant barristers and the intimidating gowns and wigs are largely what make Witness for the Prosecution not only the first but also the mother of all courtroom dramas. This may just be the opinion of an avid fan but practically ALL great courtroomdramas that were released from the sixties until present day To Kill a Mockingbird Philadelphia Devil's Advocate A Few Good Men were clearly influenced by Witness for the Prosecution. In fact I only have one minor complaint  Spoiler  the film version adds one more final twist that I didn't find 100 plausible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me explain.The best book on music I've ever read is The Classical Style Haydn Mozart and Beethoven by Charles Rosen.  Read it it's fascinating.  One of Rosen's claims is that the classical style was the offspring of two impulses the desire to surprise and the desire to be formally perfect to sound right.  In the decades before Haydn's maturity there were composers who startled and composers who satisfied Haydn was the first to startle and satisfy in the same breath.Detective story writers have the same ideal as classical composers.  The solution must surprise us yet the shape of the story to those who know the solution must be beautiful.  And as in music it's hard to surprise and satisfy at once.  If you must go one way or the other much better to satisfy.  One can see the denouement of a Thorndyke story by R. Austin Freeman a mile off but it's always perfectly crafted and that is enough. Too many modern detective stories startle us by having the murderer turn out to be one of a dozen characters when it could so easily have been one of the other eleven and nobody would have particularly cared because there's little beauty in the story whoever it turns out to be.  But Agatha Christie ... not for nothing is she called classical.  Her solutions are almost always surprising  she may have been better at misdirection than anyone else who ever lived  but they always in a way that's hard to describe make perfect dramatic sense.  Okay so she's not the world's best mystery WRITER.  But I often think she attracts undue criticism because she so obviously writes less well than she plots while the literary defects of writers who can't plot either pass unnoticed.For all these reasons I'm surprised there aren't more firstrate films based on her works.  I can understand though why The Mousetrap has never been filmed.  Looking through the IMDb list of twentyeight cinematic Christies I'm surprised how many of the ones I've seen fall short of their potential. And twentyeight isn't really when you think about it that many especially when so many of them are remakes of earlier ones.Still most are worth watching and this particular one is excellent. Faithful to the play it has the usual finely crafted classical Agatha Christie twist.  Wilder made it at a moment in his career when he could do no wrong.  It must have taken him all of two seconds to decide that Charles Laughton would make the perfect Sir Wilfrid then perhaps another fifteen minutes to settle on Marlene Dietrich as the title character.  Just as Double Indemnity is set in a blackandwhite California Witness is set in a blackandwhite England  it makes me wonder if it's a mistake filming Agatha Christie in colour.  You'll enjoy this trust me.".

By chance their neighbor is a marine biologist and has two daughters.  Anyway Zeus and the cat bring father and mother together which leads to Zeus discovering Roxanne a dolphin raised in captivity that the mother biologist is trying to reintroduce into a dolphin pod.  Zeus and Roxanne can talk with each other leading to attempts by a nasty animalunfriendly scientist to want to use Roxanne for his own selfish ends.Sure the plot is contrived and filled with obvious gags etc. but at least it has an interesting and environmentally correct theme and the animals do a great job of keeping the movie visually interesting.  I particularly enjoyed the way the camera shots were laid out so that viewers get an animal's eye view throughout the movie.Unlike many art films this story at least makes sense shows people including children doing worthwhile things and being nice to each other.

As for the comment about the kid with the Goth look you have no clue about teenagers she came across as a typical one. The animals were good too and all in all it was a nice easy to watch movie and I'd rather watch it 10 times than have to sit through Big Momma's House 2 and it's ilk just the once. 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "An elderly spinster called Miss Marple witnesses a man strangling a woman on a passing train. When nobody believes her she investigates the crime herself.Murder She Said marked the first bigscreen appearance of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. The script by David Pursall and Jack Seddon is based on the 1957 novel 450 From Paddington. Its success lead to three more equally entertaining films starring Margaret Rutherford. Agatha Christie liked Rutherford as an actress but thought that she was all wrong for the part. Indeed Rutherford is nothing like the Jane Marple that Joan Hickson would portray in the highly successful BBC series of the 1980's90's but she is a delight to watch as she makes the part entirely her own and earned herself a legion of fans. Incidentally Hickson appears in this film in a minor role as the miserable housekeeper Mrs Kidder. A great supporting cast includes Muriel Pavlow Arthur Kennedy and James Robertson Justice. Charles Tingwell plays the hapless Inspector Craddock who cannot bear Miss Marple interfering and solving his cases for him a role which in which he is featured in all the entries in this series. Another regular in the series is Stringer Davis Rutherford's real life husband who plays the local librarian and her closest friend Mr Stringer. Director George Pollock worked steadily as an assistant director during the forties and fifties and during that time he learned at the feet of some of Britain's most acclaimed directors such as Thorold Dickinson on Gaslight 1940 and David Lean on Brief Encounter Great Expectations both 1945 and Oliver Twist 1948. After directing a few trivial comedies such as Village Of Daughters 1961 Pollock had an opportunity with the Marple films to show that he was a very good director investing the films with great British humour as well as intriguing mystery making them timeless entertainment. The films resembled the quota quickies of the 1950's but they were done with a slightly higher budget more professionalism and better production values. In addition Ron Goodwin's music is splendid and the harpsichord laden theme tune would become familiar as it was used in all the other entries in this series. I don't think I would be going over the top to use a wellworn phrase they don't make them like that anymore. 450 From Paddington has been filmed twice subsequently. In 1987 the BBC gave us a faithful but rather stodgy version starring Joan Hickson and ITV filmed it in 2004 as part of their new series of Miss Marple whodunits starring Geraldine McEwan. But the less said about these the better.Sequels MURDER AT THE GALLOP 1963 MURDER MOST FOUL 1964 and MURDER AHOY produced in 1964 but released in late 1965 to space out the series.".

He even gets to propose to the lady herself so impressed is he with her detecting.Add the requisite cute kid Ronnie Raymond an excellent bit part by Joan Hickson the future Miss Marple in the excellent BBC series and what faults are there to be found in this unique first film of four in the series.8 out of 10. Incredibly entertaining wonderful use of black and white film medium and a really good score.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first in a series of four Miss Marple films featuring the incomparable Margaret Rutherford as the elderly spinster with excellent detective abilities from the popular Agatha Christie novels.The story sticks relatively close to the events in the novel 450 from Paddington with one major exception that may surprise fans of this series who have not read the novels. Christie's Marple was really a sedate seemingly dithery woman who basically spends most of the books sitting on her backside knitting  in fact in some of the novels Marple actually gets very little time and is merely onhand to piece together the clues provided by others and provide the name of the culprit. In this case screenwriters wisely combined a young character with Miss Marple so she remains front and center in the action. I much prefer these films as opposed to the more traditional renderings from BBCPBS as Miss Marple is depicted here as such a vital and uniquely active free spirit. Rutherford is simply wonderful with her unforgettable expressions. She plays well off a diversity of people including the gloriously crusty hypochondriac patriarch James Robertson Justice the mischievous grandson Ronnie Raymond the mildly exasperated police inspector Charles Tingwell or the gentle compatriot Stringer Davis.A delightful series and a testament to a great talent who should never be forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "As other critics have previously pointed out Margaret Rutherford's portrayal of Jane Marple has little in common with the visions of the character's creator Agatha Christie.  However just as Basil Rathbone's depiction of Sherlock Holmes both in his character portrayal and in the film company's telling of most of the tales had little to do with the original writer's intentions so too did both he and Miss Rutherford seem to create pseudocharacters from worthwhile plots of equal value and entertainment levels.As the first of a wonderful quartet of easytoview movies made in black and white in early 60's England and the second best of them overall in my opinion this appropriately atmospheric film takes us through a clever little screenplay centred around the family of a large estate 'in the sticks' on the outskirts of London.  The storyline is littered with a mixture of eccentric and fundamental cameo parts that serve up the right amount of suspense and partial comedy as Miss Marple and her buddy Mr.Stringer take it upon themselves to solve a railway murder that Inspector Craddock the local 'head plod' had put down to being the byproduct of her rambling 'hallucinations'.Not surprisingly we are kept on our toes as to whom was the culprit as the intrepid Jane goes undercover as a geriatric maid who proves to be so competent in her matriarchal manoeuvres that the 'Lord of the Manor' superbly played as ever by the magnificent James Robertson Justice seeks her hand in marriage as a sort of reward for her spirited detective work. However Dame Rutherford had Stringer to consider  not least because he was her partner in real life  and there were of course other stories to film in the future...What a pity they didn't follow Rathbone and Bruce by making around a dozen of these marvellous movies!".

Margaret Rutherford as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple is quite something different I was expecting. Usually in other films and TVseries I've found the character a bit boring compared to Hercule Poirot and have much more preferred Christie stories involving the latter. Not this time because this must be the best Agatha Christie movie I have seen yet. I haven't read the book the film is based on '16.50 from Paddington' so I can't tell how faithful the film adaption is. But Rutherford's Marple sure sparkles. She is above all witty energetic and enormously fun to watch.What generally makes this movie so delightful is the humorous style which I strongly connected to the classic Ealing comedies. There is also some obvious influence of Hitchcock's early films from his English period for example the trick of using a woman's scream and a train whistle together very effectively. Good looking sharp photography and fastpaced direction keep things moving . The dialog is very stylish so utterly British for someone from a different language area and a treat for one's ear. I doubt if anyone really talks like that anymore but hopefully I'm utterly wrong.And for once I guessed the murderer right beforehand without spoiling any of my fun. On the contrary the movie gave me such a good time it fully surprised me in that. Judging by this and the trailers of the other films in the series Yes hurray there is more of it! I'll have to catch up with the rest of them too. Do let your evening be crowned or saved by this wonderful film.".

I do rate Murder she said as the best it seems slightly more inspired than the others though they are all enjoyable. There are of course a few complaints. Mrs. Rutherfords husband is obviously included in the film for no other reason than being her husband. The character of young Alexander is simply annoying and the ending is a bit of a disappointment.

	schema:reviewBody "An unusual day and a totally unpredictable moment for a 'dotty old' Miss Jane Marple Margaret Rutherford on her supposedly 'too comfortable' journey by train. As a seemingly gray passenger on the 4.50 train from Paddington she is not only stuck because of an impertinent little kid but something far more shocking happens in a train passing by her window. Death does not only appear to have windows in a detective story she has been reading...murder is indeed no longer a sheer bad dream that an 'unstable' or 'unbalanced' maid could have. It is the stimulus for the most intriguing senses being activated within the most unusual investigation. Soon she will be the one who can provide light to the dark mystery of a murder. But can she ever make herself too comfortable again at the weird Ackenthorpe Hall a mansion where there is a constant vacancy for a maid... a perfect setting for an English mystery thriller with lots of relics from the past? Something that would recall the makebelieve in William Gillette's SHERLOCK HOLMES something that Hitchcock would have developed within the ultimate flair for style...What this thriller develops is not so much the style but above all the absolutely stunning sympathetic witty intelligent vibrant character of Miss Marple. Based upon the novel by Agatha Christie 4.50 From Paddington she is the character with certain knowledge of criminal mind. Now she is placed in the situation which puts her to harsh test and imposes constant alertness. Quoting the New York Times review which appeared just after the American premiere of the movie Miss Marple proves that the aging but still vigorous female of the species can be a better sleuth than the Scotland Yard operatives. Name of Marple nature of marble referring to the screenplay...that is what highlights best her character. That is also what makes it interesting also for modern audiences. And MURDER SHE SAID beautifully introduces her to viewers. However the true entertainment does not lie in the literary source Agatha Christie was not happy about the numerous liberties taken but by the actress who interprets Miss Marple adorable Dame Margaret Rutherford.Although MURDER SHE SAID is just the first of four movies made within the adaptations she appears as a truly creative and gifted performer from the very start. It is Miss Rutherford who dominates our attention and makes the thriller a rarity of its genre as a novel adaptation and as a cinematic production. When I saw her performance first with my friend I was stunned throughout. In majority thanks to her thrill is combined with humor and cutting tongue with the most honest intentions. She executes her lines marvelously! Determined but calm and patient witty but as wisely advised never 'too comfortable'  that is how she remains with viewers and allows us to grasp the idea of skillfully proceeding acting. As her male counterpart in a way comes Stringer Davis her husband in real life in the role of Mr Stringer. From the moment when the police inspector Craddock Charles Tingwell occurs to care little about the crime they begin their own investigation. In their scenes the two carry the essence of humor in the film. Just to note the unforgettable scene when early in the morning after 'hearty breakfast' Mr Stringer is giving Miss Marple 'a leg up' and they find both the dog and the man really 'frightfullooking.' Alone she is absolutely captivating when encountering the Ackenthorpes a really peculiar dynasty with just little exceptions Emma. It seems that the only good thing the family have ever done were...delicious biscuits. It soon occurs that both things and crimes go in threes. All sorts of people from neurotic eccentrics to calm doctors gently tease our senses...They are all worth broader consideration as supporting characters those temporary 'tresspassers' who highlight the backdrop for the mystery because the performances are exceptionally well crafted. James Robertson Justice an eminent British actor beautifully portrays an old pretentious mean neurotic 'Chairman' of the family who cannot stand the drawbacks of his own within other people including impertinence. He strongly and strictly prefers beef steak to beef broth. Everything and everybody seem to move around his affairs and his premonitions of what he thinks other people mean. Some of the most spicy moments appear between him and Miss Marple with memorably cutting remarks in their lines. Apart from Charles Tingwell as skeptical inspector Craddock who appears in all four films the cast who need particular attention are Arthur Kennedy as family's ambiguous doctor and Ronnie Raymond as 'too clever' yet sympathetic youngster Alexander who sees the family as 'vultures' with some exceptions and who appears and disappears in the most unpredictable moments. Consider his scenes with Miss Marple...They seem to share some interests...in golf for instance.The atmosphere of the movie makes MURDER SHE SAID a pure classic thriller old thriller with the magic of black and white and the slight features of horror in some of the scenes. It is considerably supported by lighting sets and undertones of images. The magical effect is provided by Ron Goodwin's music score where a variety of tunes beautifully create a balance between tension and relief.MURDER SHE SAID and finally 'riddle she figures out' and 'murderer she finds' yet...before you decide to see this movie which I highly recommend prepare for great tensions and a number of misleading predictions. Worn in lots of mysteries lots of suspicions  yes. But isn't that what should emerge from a perfect detective story?

It stars Margaret Rutherford Arthur Kennedy Muriel Pavlow  James Robertson Justice.Lets forget the book eh and lets forget that Agatha Christie felt that Margaret Rutherford was wrong for the role of Miss. Jane Marple. How about we just view this delightful English mystery on its filmic terms? Rutherford is just lovely as Marple putting her own classy stamp on the role she was an instant hit and went on to make a further three Marple movies. It has all the classic elements for a Christie murder mystery. An odd family at a big foreboding residence Ackenthorpe Hall and sure enough there's something afoot here. Enter Rutherford's determined sleuther Miss. Marple as she enrols as housekeeper there and pokes around in search of clues. The suspense is built up as is the mystery who done it? element but the film never loses its sense of humour. Something that makes Rutherford's incarnation of Marple a joy to be involved with. Her play offs with James Robertson Justice's blustery old grump Ackenthorpe and wee Ronnie Raymond's Alexander are true high points in Pollock's movie.Be it Marple or Poirot you know the formula at the heart of these murder mysteries. There are many adaptations to the screen of Christie's works and for sure not all of them work. With that Rutherford's tenure as Miss Marple probably ranks about middle tier in the pantheon. But that is still good enough for a jolly day of viewings fun viewings that are propelled by the wonderful talent of Margaret Rutherford. 7.510".

So she proceeds to investigate the murder herself despite Inspector Craddock's Charles Tingwell discouragement to do so. But all that is secondary to Miss Rutherford. Margaret Rutherford is Miss Jane Marple and gives the performance of a lifetime in all four movies of this mystery series. The best one of the four in terms of story acting by all concerned and sheer entertainment in my opinion would be the second one Murder at the Gallop. Murder Ahoy and Murder Most Foul follow. But all of them I would rank as between 7 and 10.

It is not the most faithful adaptation to the book 450 From Paddington or to Agatha Christie in general look to Joan Hickson if you want this but if you are willing to judge an adaptation on its own merits it makes for an enjoyable and easy watch. It does start off a little too slow and the character of Alexander played by Ronnie Raymond is very irritating. But the setting is evocative and the film is well shot. Murder She Said is further advantaged by crisp pacing a deliciously witty script and an outstanding music score. The story is very compelling with a nice mixture of comedy and clue solving. The final solution wasn't a surprise to me then again I have read the book more than once and have seen the Hickson and Geraldine McEwan versionsso it was more a familiarity issue than predictability but it doesn't underwhelm either. The film is tautly directed by Pollock and apart from Raymond the cast are great. Margaret Rutherford is a sheer delight and James Robertson Justice is superb as the crusty patriarch. Alan Kennedy makes a good impression as the doctor and Charles Tingwell also seems to be enjoying himself as the Inspector in his mild exasperation. As with the book and the other adaptations the characters are diverse and generally well defined. All in all not for Christie purists maybe but much fun to be had on its ownwhich ideally is how an adaptation should be judged. 910 Bethany Cox".

Every facial expression is great  watch her as she serves coffee to the simpering siblings discussing the murder.

But if you like 'The Avengers' you will almost certainly like Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple. She rides she hikes there are vehicles from sports cars to horses and buggies she's an expert swords woman she can even fight. And the way she usually solves the crime is to become an unofficial undercover agent sometimes backed by her friend Mr.Springer or by her favorite but always skeptical police official Inspector Craddock. The sprightly and stirring theme and the other incidental music is delivered with harpsichord and mordents perhaps outright borrowed for The Avengers.And like The Avengers don't expect everything to be realistic expect some 'Avenger' like fantasy and you'll be well satisfied.".

She is joined by a good supporting cast headed by James Robertson Justice.The original character of Miss Marple is a challenging one to depict on film or even on stage since many of her most interesting characteristics are very subtle traits that come across most memorably in a book. It would be wonderful to see someone get the character just right in a movie or television series as David Suchet has done with Christie's Hercule Poirot but most of the actresses who have played the part have at least offered some strengths of their own.Justice is pretty entertaining as the badtempered family patriarch and most of the other characters are also believable.

They were like struggling in a very slowmoving turmoil desires so much to change their lives but yet so helpless and knowing nothing about how to do it. They drifted away from there initial purposes their friendship and their love.The cello appears 3 times during the whole film which is almost heartbreaking. They were running towards the train but the train just ran away. And gradually you forgot what you've been chasing when you were young you don't care about those inspiring songs like 'In the field of hopes' which is a symbol of those old days. Life always keeps moving on like the brick of those ancient walls of Fenyang ever exists.There are so many retrospective 'cultural reminders' in this film e.g. those old songs costumes literal expressions furniture and behaviors that bring you back to that time. I would say if a western audience appreciate this film he will appreciate double if he were Chinese and even more.Bravo Jia Zhangke.

Like these others it succeeds in creating a complete world of its own that because it is so remote from Western experience exerts a fascination that is hard to forget.  We are in Fenyang a small town somewhere West of Beijing where flat plains give way to craggy uninviting mountains.  The time is the early 1980s when strict Maoist ideology was about to give way to a period of consumer liberalisation.  A group of young actorsinger dancers employed by the state to remind provincial audiences of the principles of Mao through the medium of stage entertainment are about to see their world fall victim to the progress of private enterprise when no longer needed for government propaganda.  What was once a captive audience turns fickle often rejecting outright the new form of pop culture they are offered.  The irony is that progress in this context brings disillusionment resulting in a group of friends drifting away from their close initial camaraderie.  By the time the film ends their future looks far from confident.   Both thematically and atmospherically Zhantai has the potential for great cinema.  Why then after two viewings in quick succession do I find its sense of communication so elusive and uninvolving?  The answer must lie in the way the director seems to distant his characters from their audience.  We never get closer to them than a middle shot.  In a film where the closeup is as rigorously excluded from cinematic grammar as camera movement from the later work of Ozu the characters' everyday lives seem to be presentad as an extension of their existance on stage to the extent that we are often left to guess at their feelings and emotions.  I have written before of how fascinated I am to respond to the demands of directors such as Edward Yang and Hou Xiaoxian to connect with characters and situations when given the barest information.  Director Jia Zhangke is obviously aiming at their oblique narrative style but somehow gives so little that by the end I felt I knew much more about the topography of Fenyang than of the characters that live there.  For a film about the effect of historical change on individuals to be completely successful it needs to be the other way round.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this to be an extremely understated film style so emotionally detached throughout a very oblique presentation with little or no narrative this played like a documentary with very little embellishments.The film is set in the decade of the 1980's which opens needing Communist Party approval for all State sponsored art so kids are seen bored stiff at lifeless cultural performances singing the praises of China only in the most affirmative manner something akin to preschool exhibitions here glorified by an always shining sun and by beautiful bright colors but in this film no one is fooled by this. Initial images are shot in near darkness or with the bleakest of light and there's a kind of feint glowing aura surrounding such diminished light.Initially there is obviously no heat or electricity in this cold barren wintry landscape so each image features frost on the breath and the cold desolate interior brick rooms occasionally people gather around a stove for warmth they really don't want to move at all bricks dominate the exteriors as well the obvious poverty in the images is similar to many Iranian films as there is absolutely nothing to grab the interest of the graduating high school class who have no expectations of a better life yet they are constantly seen interacting but largely avoiding one another smoking staring off into the barren landscape saying little or nothing unbelievably detached from the rest of the world and each other.The imagery was quite unique as this small town is in fact a rural Communist collective work farm complete with required Party meetings where all are asked to voice their opinions or stand up to the critical discussions led by the Communist group leader again the decade opens with a criticism of individual dissent like the wearing of bellbottom pants establishing an absolute need for individualism which drives a whirlwind of changes within the Party leading to the introduction of electricity to the most outer rural regions and to concepts like privatization owning your own farm and why not western style pop music which gives rise to an opportunity for this little group of would be artists to form a band and hit the road through some of the most desolate and empty terrain on the planet always they travel on the back of the truck searching for the world outside.Two of the most powerful images in the film both very much in the Kiarostamistyle end shot a long drawn out shot that by itself reveals the story of the film...There is a long shot of a group of rolling hills with nothing growing on them round and bare and the infamous truck winds it's way along a windswept dirt road around a myriad of curves until it is finally close to the camera but then the truck mysteriously stops and turns around in the most deliberate and laborious manner before heading back into those rolling hills while this is seen the audience hears the sound of the truck radio providing a weather report powerful changing winds are heading their way...There is a long distant shot of this same infamous truck and it appears to be stuck in the middle of nowhere far off in the distance the sound of the engine gunning is all that's heard but no wheels are turning they ar e going nowhere so there is a cut to the blue door of the truck one of the artists climbs into the front seat and turns on the radio which plays the title song Platform We are waiting our whole hearts are waiting waiting forever... In this unique moment the first time rock music is heard in the film the audience is made aware that from this barren desolation there are now possibilities.However as the decade comes to a close this image is contrasted against a later scene where the actual band plays this song Platform and one can only describe it as laughable the audience is throwing things at them the lead singer attempts to go out into the crowd and touch hands but he is nearly beaten up until he retreats to the safety of the stage yet still under the barrage of the audience certainly this reflects the end of possibilities...Yet another scene must be mentioned one of their former girl friends who chose not to go on the road but to stay at home is seen alone in a bureaucratic office again dimly lit she waters her plants in the corner shuffles some papers around but the music heard on the radio causes her to stir she stops her routine makes the briefest of moves as if she wants to dance but stops herself until this slowly evolves into one of the most beautiful traditional Chinese dances alone in the dark dancing.True to the peculiarity of this film one character appears with the band he has long black hair and he's dressed all in black the band manager tells him to get his lazy ass back to the group as he's outside smoking a cigarette one of the most prevalent images throughout the film is the constant smoking of cigarettes but this guy never says a word to anybody nor is he ever seen performing with the band he just exists totally outside the universe of any known reality later on he is seen cutting his hair this character is not seen in the entire film interacting with anyone yet he is seen on the fringes definitely a unique character but totally alone.In many ways this is largely a wordless film as the words are so meaningless instead eyes drift off into the distant landscape and the sound of the film is filled with the noises of humans street sounds traffic trucks tractors distant shouts or street chatter radios the noises of humans this is really the theme of the film the individuals are incidental they come they go but the constant is the noise.".

This sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all. I'd be sorry to see Chinese cinema judged against this benchmark.";

The boys wear bellbottom trousers the girls get perms and the band delivers the latest pop disco music. The boys are sullen however and their romances with Zhong and Ruijuan seem lethargic. Zhong Pin becomes pregnant by Jun and has an abortion after Jun is arrested for having sex out of wedlock.They smoke cigarettes go to the movies and become enmeshed in petty squabbles  all seemingly to no end as their personal happiness remains elusive. In one scene that underscores their loneliness the female dancers of the band stand alone looking desolate as they perform on the back of a truck while uninterested motorists drive past without noticing. Their lives that started out so promising seem to deliver very little. Toward the end the AllStar Band returns to Fenyang and Cui Mingliang is reunited with Ruijuan who has become a tax collector. Platform takes its title from a popular 1980s Chinese pop song that includes the line We are waiting our whole hearts are waiting forever. As in the film Unknown Pleasures by Jia the youngsters find themselves doing a lot of waiting. Jia captures this desultory mood but after two and halfhours the grim tone becomes oppressive. Platform is an important film and a realistic depiction of a turning point in Chinese history yet I found the characters to be poorly defined and the film did not come alive as an experience.".

But the fact remains that the loose repetitive episodic structure mixed with the total lack of character development hinder much of the possible enjoyment or involvement. I know it's not cool for a certain sector of Chinese art films to allow the audience to give a crap what's going on. But surprisingly I did enjoy it to a fair extent. You kind of feel like you're part of the performance troupe in the film that you're being carted between these sections of nowhere around the vast country. There are many beautiful scenes. It's worthwhile. I suggest given its 2.5 hour running length to watch it in bits and pieces. It won't feel quite as repetitive.".

The photography was very poor it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of closeup work.

China was emerging from the damage due to the 10 years long Cultural Revolution and these young people rode the waves of the changes in the Chinese society searching for their positions in the new social structure.Like Jia's other films this film does a good job on capturing the details of the lives of the ordinary people especially those on the very bottom of the society. But it's like a broken container trying to hold its ingredient together. You see those cooking materials are scattered around all over the place but they are never put together to make a delicious dish. It doesn't have a focus.I am not sure if the film maker did it intentionally or because he was using those nonprofessional actors the camera always stays far away from its object and it almost never gets a close up on these characters. It makes me a bystander to watch what happens to these characters standing in distance. It's very frustrating not to be able to get closer and get connected to those characters.By the way I have no idea why the director Jia Zhang Ke is so obsessed with this guy Wang Hong Wei. Wang is the lead actor in every one of Jia's film. I start to think that Wang is the mafia boss and has total control of Jia. Otherwise how can I explain this phenomenon after I see most of Jia's films? This is an interesting film to check out especially if you have the patience and time but not a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story itself is simple a young boy is the odd one out. His parents are much older his mother unmercifully picks on him favoring his nearadult siblings while his longsuffering father has withdrawn into the small pleasures of hunting and meeting with friends. Really it's a sort of Cinderella the wicked stepmother only it's his real mother the vain pampered older siblings his having to work and slave for them wearing tattered handmedowns. But it's told with a wonderful leisurely anecdotal naturalism laced with delightful moments of surrealism he's surrounded by doubleexposure goblins when told to close up the hen house at night for example. The greatest scene in the film combines the two as the boy and a young girl rehearse a marriage ceremony marching through the fields while the animals about them burst into song. The father as delineated by Baur and the maid also immeasurably enriched by a subtle performance are marvelous characters. The film was made during that brief period when the French countryside was a pretechnological world yet technology was sufficiently advanced so that sound films could document that existence. Certainly there are literary story telling elements such as the family being introduced by the father the older maid telling the new maid what to expect and the boy's school essay about his miserable family life. But the wonderful thing about the film is its ineffable technique and its enigmatic moments that are the purest styleless cinema. There are many visual joys like the shot of boys playing leapfrog with the town spread out below them that are presented with simplicity and unostentatious naturalism. All told this is a film of the highest cinematic art approaching the level of Renoir and Ozu.I saw this film at the unlikely venue of the Walter Reade Theatre in New York. The film was introduced by David Grossman a retired exhibitor who dedicated the showing to film historian and enthusiast William K. Everson. Grossman was so full of love for the film that he could hardly express himself. The print was his cobbled together from several sources. The original US and British release was missing most of the wedding rehearsal and all of the scene where the boy swims while his uncle fishes the latter because the boy is nude. He spoke of Duvivier's great love for making movies. The film he said ran a year in Paris in its initial release unheard of during the depression. At the end of the film he stood from his seat and stated that the actor who played the young boy was later executed by the Nazis for being in the resistance and that Baur was also executed by the Nazis only a few weeks before the liberation for reasons not clear. He apologized for the poor subtitles the reinserted scenes had none and the rest had those intermittent titles that as he said was typical of the thirties though he needn't have apologized since full translation was unnecessary. And he asked for comments from the audience in the manner of someone who's just taken a friend to see his very favorite film. and asks Well wasn't it great? A very appropriate introduction to this wonderful film.This is a film that cries out for restoration and wider release. I wonder if the print shown on Ontario TV and the video offered on Amazon probably the same are complete.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bullied by his hateful mother and by his much older brother and sister ignored by his father the childhood of eleven years old Francoise Lepic Robert Lynen is as miserable as it could ever be. An illegitimate and unwanted child he is the main reason for the ill feeling which exists between his parents who continue to live in the same house but are far apart. His mother keeps him dressed in old and tattered castoffs and hand me downs while his much older brother and sister have the best clothes that money can buy. Meanwhile he doesn't even have any underpants to wear he is skinny because she denies him his share of the food although he has fair hair his mother insists that he has red hair and this gives her an excuse to hate him nicknaming him Poil de Carotte the carrot top. She always has him doing the chores while his older siblings sit around doing nothing. Miserably unhappy herself and trapped in a loveless marriage she makes sure he is denied anything that would make him happy. In the midst of all this Francoise has learned to put on a happy face for outsiders such as his teacher at school while inside he is seething with resentment and unhappiness. In the end Poil de Carotte's suffering becomes more than he can bear and he decides to kill himself! Considering the age of this film eighty years old this is one hell of a terrific film and it should be made available on DVD to a wider audience with English subtitles. Director Julien Duvivier could easily be thought of as the Carol Reed of French cinemacertainly he was just as good at getting wonderful performances out of boys who had never acted beforeand there are some real standout scenes in this example of his work. One is where Francoise is out playing in a stream when the family's maid Annette comes after him in a horse and trap. His mother wants him to go home and do the chores. As they drive back to his unhappy home with Francoise driving he sees children being loved by their parents and other adults in the fields they pass. Enraged that they can be happy when he can't Francoise stands up in the cart and whips the horse into a furious gallop again and again as Annette tries to wrestle the reins from him. NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE ME LIKE THAT! he shouts as he whips the horse to go faster and faster almost running people down walking along the road. NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE ME! NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE ME! he yells as Annette begs him to stop and tries to grab the reins from his hand. This is a stunning sequence a superb blend of editing and scoring and acting from an eleven year old the likes of which I'd never seen before. Towards the end of the film where his father enters the barn just in time to prevent his son from hanging himself we see the most powerful scene in this remarkable film. TAKE OFF THE ROPE! the father orders as he wrestles with his son trying to prevent him jumping off the crate. NO! NO! NO! cries Francoise. TAKE IT OFF! shouts his father. I WANT TO DIE! I WANT TO DIE! cries the boy.The film was released in France in November 1932 and Robert caused a sensation rocketing to stardom overnight. Incredibly the film ran for twelve months in Paris something that was unheard of during the depression.I had never heard the name Robert Lynen until I came across a Picturegoer magazine from October 1948 containing a review of Carol Reed's then new film release The Fallen Idol where the reviewer said that child actor Bobby Henrey was comparable to another child actor Robert Lynen who caused a sensation in the French film Poil de Carotte and that Robert was killed during the war. I immediately investigated this and found that not only was there a similarity in the boy's looks and manners but that during the war Robert joined the French resistance a very brave thing to do that he was caught by the Gestapo and tortured before being executed along with fourteen of his colleagues and thrown into a mass grave. A terrible and totally unjustified end for this very talented French former child actor who had appeared in many films and was well loved. Yes he was a real hero and I would have been proud to know him.His remains were later removed and reburied in a proper grave and a colour photo of it can be found on the Find a Grave website. I soon bought the DVD of his 1932 film Poil de Carotte from amazon France and was enthralled by it although it had no English subtitles. But a friend of mine sent me an AVI DVDR of the film with English subtitles which made viewing the film an even better experience. Oddly Robert Lynen's full name was Robert Henri Lynen so he could also have been called Bobby Henri as a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Truffaut had bothered to see this gem before penning his infamous essay in which he tarred master craftsmen like Duvivier who wrote and directed this film Carne Renoir Allegret Jeanson Bost Aurenche Prevert etc with the same 'incompetent' brush he would not have had the gall to shoot even one frame of his own take on the subject 'The 400 Yawns'.  As it is Duvivier is still being revived after 70 years whilst with any luck the TruffautGodard drek will sink without trace long before that. Here Duvivier obtains an exquisite and heartbreaking performance from tenyearold Robert Lynen one of the few French actors to take an active part in the 'Resistance' for which he paid with his life and it's difficult to imagine what Duvivier said or did to Lynen prior to shooting the scene in the barn where he trembles on the brink of suicide but whatever it was he should bottle it and make it available to directors everywhere.  There have of course been 'child' actors before  one thinks of Bobby Henry in 'The Fallen Idol' Claude Jarman Jnr in 'The Yearling' Brandon de Wilde in 'Shane'  and there will be again but it is doubtful indeed if one will ever eclipse Lynen. The story is unashamedly lifted from Cinderella and comes complete with two ugly siblings one of each sex and a wicked Mother instead of a Stepmother which Comedie Francaise actress Catherine Fonteney brings off to a faretheewell without resorting to chewing the scenery a la Charles Laughton.  Harry Baur turns in sterling work as the father whose only crime is in failing to notice he has a young son whose life is reduced to misery by a cold uncaring mother and two spoiled brats. Duvivier was a master director he would use Lynen again first in his poetic La Belle Equipe with the great Gabin and later in Un Carnet de Bal with Raimu Louis Jouvet and Harry Baur also a victim of the nazis.  In sum a wonderful lyrical evocation of a tainted childhood. 910".

As it is Duvivier is still being revived after 70 years whilst with any luck the TruffautGodard drek will sink without trace long before that.

	schema:reviewBody "Poil de Carotte  which means carrot top  is a curious amalgam of fairytale themes and psychological realism. The film evokes fairy tales with its story of a neglected and exploited child who has a kindly godparent set in a picturesque French village that except for the absence of a castle with a prince in it could have doubled for the setting of Cinderella. We first meet the film's Cinderella analog Franois Lepic Robert Lynen known universally as Poil de carotte as he is about to leave school for a vacation back home. He doesn't really want to go When we first see him he is being criticized by a teacher for having written in an essay A family is a group of people forced to live together under one roof who can't stand one another. We soon find out how he comes by this cynical definition when he arrives home to his vaguely neglectful father Harry Baur his icy controlling mother Catherine Fonteney and his spoiled older siblings Ernestine Simone Aubry and Flix Maxime Fromiot. His status in the family becomes apparent at the dinner table where he sits licking his lips in anticipation of the dish of melon slices being passed around only to have his mother say he doesn't want any apparently because she doesn't like melons. After dinner he is sent to take the melon rinds  he gnaws on them once he's outside  to the rabbits and to shut the gate to the chicken yard. He protests It's dark outside and he's scared. But his sister and brother refuse the task because they're both reading and he's sent out into the night which he imagines to be full of ghosts dancing in a ring. His only escape from the chores his mother's harshness and his father's indifference is to visit his godfather Louis Gauthier a cheerful idler where he wades in the brook and has a mock wedding with a little neighbor girl Mathilde Colette Segall presided over by the godfather playing a tune on his hurdygurdy. It's a lovely little pastoral idyll that ends all too soon. As he returns home Poil de Carotte realizes how lonely and unloved he is and he begins to contemplate suicide. This abrupt reversal of mood comes from an 1894 novella by Jules Renard that writerdirector Julien Duvivier first adapted for a silent movie version in 1926. It's a little too abrupt for a work of psychological truth Poil de Carotte has been seen as resilient and resourceful up to this point and his deep depression comes upon him all too suddenly. When he finally achieves a connection with his father in a scene that despite the dramatic flaws of the film is quite touching it's explained to us that Poil de Carotte was conceived by accident long after the husband and wife had ceased to love each other. He therefore became an object of resentment by both parents. At the end the father vows that everyone will call him Franois not Poil de Carotte henceforth. The performances by Lynen and Baur make this second reversal plausible if not entirely convincing. Duvivier's direction is more solid than his screenplay and the film is at its best in the scenes of village life beautifully shot by Armand Thirard.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first became aware of the film Headspace back in early 2006 after reading a featured article in Fangoria one of my favorite horror mags. The article was interesting as they usually are but what enticed me most about this little independent gem was the insanely original storyline which we'll get to shortly. I was also attracted to the filmmakers themselves and the producers writer and director all seemed very self motivated intelligent and determined to make an awesome film. So you could say I was expecting a little more than usual going into Headspace.Let me fill you in on the plot. We see a young troubled guy known to the world as Alex Borden played by Christopher Denham. By troubled I mean a pretty rough childhood which at one point involves him and his brother viewing their dad blow their mom's face to smithereens with a shotgun. Serves her right for getting too far away from the kitchen Alex has been a smart guy all his life but at the age of twentyfive his intelligence begins increasing by the minute. This dude reads books in minutes learns how to master chess in a day's time and can even understand women. Actually I'm kidding Nobody's that smart. Eventually Alex learns that he can see events that have taken place in the past and towards the end of the film can even see into other dimensions which is where the crap really hits the fan.This Good Will Hunting Gone Wild tale could have easily been a disaster if it were not for the TLC given by the people involved. The look of the film really enhanced the quality for me. Headspace looks like it cost five to ten million to make and I would bet my dead rabbit Penny's water bottle that the budget was nowhere near that amount. Headpsace recently took home the Best Cinematography Award at the New York Horror Film Festival and with good reason. The film is colorful shot well and looks magnificent over all.Another element that boosted the quality of the film for me was the casting. It seemed like every five minutes some blast from the past was popping up. We have Olivia Hussey from Black Christmas William Atherton from Ghostbusters Sean Young from Bladerunner and Dee WallaceStone from The Hills Have Eyes. I could keep going but I think you get the idea. These seasoned vets not only make the film more fun because of that Oh I remember them! factor but they also bring some serious acting chops to the table. Newcomer Christopher Denham definitely holds his own as well and he's interesting to watch as he manages to find a balance between the nice guy nextdoor and the freak with the expanding brain. I mean I liked the guy throughout the entire movie but I wasn't sure if someone should spend time scouring the Earth for the best doctor available or just drag him in the back yard behind the shed and put him down Ol' Yeller style! It was a nice dynamic.With all this being said the bottom line is that I really respect the filmmakers of Headspace for truly caring about the material. They set out to make one of those B rated monster movies that we all remember as kids and they nailed it. It was like watching USA's Creature Double Feature night with the only difference being that it was Tuesday and there was only one featured Creature Feature as apposed to two featured Double Creature Features. Huh? Anyway those films were never this well done. Bravo!Overall I really enjoyed Headspace and feel very comfortable recommending it to everyone even the casual fans of the genre. One thing to the gore lovers though these characters spend a lot more time talking than chopping so if you're looking for a blood bath try something else. I highly suggest watching the film in the dark on a Saturday night with a big fat bowl of popped corn floating in butter. It's that kind of film!".

	schema:headline " Somewhat lacking but still an excellent exercise in suspense and storytelling!";
	schema:reviewBody "Headspace isn't a completely successful film but if there was an award for 'most ambitious screenplay' this flick would certainly win it. Andrew van den Houten's debut feature demands respect from the audience for its charming originality and for the way that it manages to pull many different story elements together. The film is definitely hard to categorise and works from a psychological base which is backed up nicely by some good old fashioned scenes of gore. I'm guessing the director was hampered by budget or pressures from elsewhere as several elements of the film don't feel properly fleshed out and given how much thought has gone into the film I find it hard to believe that the writers would just neglect some areas. The film focuses on Alex Borden a young man who meets a chess player one day and suddenly finds his intellect expanding. This however leads to nightmares and Alex soon finds his world crumbling around him when past traumas meet with real threats from 'demons' which Alex has began to see and which are killing off people he knows.The great thing about watching this film is that it's never clear where it's going and director Andrew van den Houten does a good job of building up the mystery without ever giving too much away at once. I'm deliberately focusing more on the good elements of this film simply because the majority of horror movies coming out recently are tired and derivative so it's nice to see one that tries its best to do something original. I guess the main negative element of the film is that while the story plays out well there's no real resolution to the film and while messages such as 'ignorance is bliss' stand out from the story no actual messages are played with much. The director has assembled a strong cast of lesser known stars which help to provide the film with a lot of cult value. Unknown actor Christopher Denham does well in the lead role and he's backed up by such cult stars of the past as Sean Young Olivia Hussey William Atherton Dee Wallace and best of all Udo Kier who lights up the screen with a cameo performance midway through. Overall Headspace might not be completely successful but it's a great attempt and I'll be keeping my eye on what van den Houten's does next.".

	onyx:emotionText "Headspace isn't a completely successful film but if there was an award for 'most ambitious screenplay' this flick would certainly win it. Andrew van den Houten's debut feature demands respect from the audience for its charming originality and for the way that it manages to pull many different story elements together. The film is definitely hard to categorise and works from a psychological base which is backed up nicely by some good old fashioned scenes of gore. I'm guessing the director was hampered by budget or pressures from elsewhere as several elements of the film don't feel properly fleshed out and given how much thought has gone into the film I find it hard to believe that the writers would just neglect some areas. The film focuses on Alex Borden a young man who meets a chess player one day and suddenly finds his intellect expanding. This however leads to nightmares and Alex soon finds his world crumbling around him when past traumas meet with real threats from 'demons' which Alex has began to see and which are killing off people he knows.The great thing about watching this film is that it's never clear where it's going and director Andrew van den Houten does a good job of building up the mystery without ever giving too much away at once. I'm deliberately focusing more on the good elements of this film simply because the majority of horror movies coming out recently are tired and derivative so it's nice to see one that tries its best to do something original. I guess the main negative element of the film is that while the story plays out well there's no real resolution to the film and while messages such as 'ignorance is bliss' stand out from the story no actual messages are played with much.

	schema:reviewBody "I have a question for the horror fans today? What stars Olivia Black Christmas Hussey Sean Young Udo Kier and Dee Wallace Stone? No this isn't the 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon it's the movie we are reviewing today Headspace.Headspace tells the tale of a young man Alex who is plagued with severe headaches. The headaches worsen upon a chance meeting with an ace street corner chess playerartist. As the headaches increase one evening he passes out on the floor as a fiend is at his apartment. His friend gets him an ambulance and once at the hospital tests are ran on him to see if he has any neurological issues.Upon the doctors findings they discover that he is using the frontal lobe to an amazing degree to a point that he is able to remember things by the slightest glance. Shortly after this Alex begins to have visions that he remembers as a child having of people dying and creatures! These creatures begin to manifest themselves into our world and begin to kill anyone in contact with Alex. Can Alex find the key to these creatures and whats causing this and what is his link to this mysterious chess master? I was rather entertained with this film. It has a very solid cast and an interesting story and has a couple of nice gore set pieces but nothing extremely nasty except for a shotgun blast to the head sequence that was cool. This one is more of a mix of psychological horrormonster movie which I cannot recall the last time I seen one quite this way. Shades of From Beyond can be seen throughout in this film as well as we deal with things in another dimension and enlarged frontal lobes.This movie is one that you may have to watch twice to catch everything and some things you may not get completely however unlike the film Calvaire which did a lot of that to little success this movie overall can be made heads or tails out of and will not have you totally scratching your head in the end.Other than some lulls in action and some weird peeping tom sequence that really did not seem to fit into the story other than a chance to show a sex scene this is a solid rental title and for some a possible purchase. Another low expectations going into flick that will entertain if you do so. I give Headspace 610 above average a nice horrorthriller that will provide a nice 90 minutes of entertainment for those interested in a change of pace mental creature feature flick or for those who like to watch horror movies dealing with the mind.Thats it for now but remember the creatures of the mind can sometimes be worse than the creatures in the flesh!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "A young man Alex has incredible mental capacity that seems to grow by the second... while at the same time his migraines become more and more frequent. How is this connected to the monsters that have recently appeared and began killing off his acquaintances one by one? I received this film as the result of a contest at Killer Reviews where I have since become a staff member. I had never heard of the director never heard of the film was a bit wary of the socalled awards listed on the back. I knew who Dee Wallace and Udo Kier were but didn't know if that was enough to make a movie work. In short I had expected this film to be watched once and filed away behind a copy of Point Break or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. I was wrong.The film starts with some short shots that fade in and out which I didn't care for but they end after the intro. Then in the first ten minutes we get the goriest scene in the movie and one of the better gore scenes in a horror movie I've seen lately let's just say it's like the suicide from the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre but better.The gore is toned down after that which is too bad because many times  especially the restroom scene  were just begging to be bloodbaths. But where the blood stops a deep and complex storyline begins that you may not be able to figure out in your first viewing. Some aspects are guessable but the entirely film demands close attention if you want to even catch a fraction of the underlying plot.There is a subplot concerning a chess game or rather multiple chess games I found to be very interesting. I didn't understand some of the technical dialog in these scenes discussions of past chess players' defenses but this really drove home the hyperintellect aspect of the film and I appreciated that.Udo Kier appears as the creepy German guy just like most of his other films. And he makes it work being a priest in this case. Dee Wallace plays a doctor but her character does not really stand out much so other than a nod to her earlier horror work it wasn't really necessary to cast her. All the other actors whose names I don't know were perfect there was nothing amateur or independentlooking about this production.Andrew VanDenHouten is a great addition to the horror world and is sadly being overlooked due to the mainstream work of such people as Rob Zombie and Eli Roth. Maybe Headspace will be for VanDenHouten what Dog Soldiers was for Neil Marshall and in another year or two he will be a name known in the dark underbelly of film.".

This quandary of the human mind is a focus of the horror genre.It takes a lot of guts so to say to step into the horror genre but not a lot of wit. Anyone is capable of tricking someone else easy to pop out behind a closed door simple even to cue the wolf's howl on a dark moonlit night. The movies then that truly stand out in horror are those that not only stay on a wellfounded formula but continue the internal analytic deviation in the voyeur's eyes by stretching the limits of what is believable.Then there are the movies such as Houten's HeadSpace starring Christopher Denham that go and above and beyond the dilemma of how to make a monster unbelievably horrific but to make the story real to take back that previously forsaken realm of storytelling. Without abandoning the human emotions of empathy sympathy and character attachment HeadSpace delivers a full force horror entourage. The most actually interesting thing about the story aside from the numerous subplots is that the story on paper might even sound believable for a moment. The only thing bringing us away from the dangerous precipice of the normal belief suspension commonly used in film is that it is indeed only a movie.The story follows Alex a mid20's inner city male. The striking yet correlated traits of confused innocence uncouth arrogance selfless helplessness stand out amongst the youthful characters he surrounds himself with. He is a homesitter and artist who collects unemployment and drinks himself silly some nights while still maintaining certain hidden truths about his life and future. The trouble begins one day while playing chess in the park but by the time the story ends we're taken into a world where we are all just pawns to a game of life and death played in realms we do not belong.My advice for approaching this film is to pay attention to nuance. The dialogue is phenomenal for character development the most crucial part of a horrorslasher film and the plot that intertwines religion with metaphysics and science is genius but don't forget to watch everything else. The score is great although not the best and the cinematography is simple and effective.Checkmate. 1010".

The trouble begins one day while playing chess in the park but by the time the story ends we're taken into a world where we are all just pawns to a game of life and death played in realms we do not belong.My advice for approaching this film is to pay attention to nuance. The dialogue is phenomenal for character development the most crucial part of a horrorslasher film and the plot that intertwines religion with metaphysics and science is genius but don't forget to watch everything else. The score is great although not the best and the cinematography is simple and effective.Checkmate. 1010";

	schema:headline " Strange But Watchable Indie Monster Movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Headspace is a strange little creature feature that I decided to give a rent when I saw it at the video store. The film centers around Alex Borden a normal guy in his midtwenties living in New York City. While Alex may appear to be normal but his life is slowly spiraling out of control. After meeting a mysterious artistchessmaster Alex begins to gain more and more knowledge and becomes smarter and smarter to the point where it's no longer for his own good. Something is causing him to tap into a different region of his brain and he suffers from horrible headaches and night terrors because of it. After being referred by Dr. Bell Dee WallaceStone of The Hills Have Eyes and E.T. Alex visits a psychologist Karen the lovely Olivia Hussey of Black Christmas and Romeo and Juliet who studies patients similar to Alex. But soon after people around Alex begin to die in horrible ways all murdered by a savage unseen beast. Is any of it related to Alex's troubled childhood? Or what really is happening to him?I mainly decided to rent this film because 1 the cover art was creepy and the back of the box had nothing but praise for the film and 2 Olivia Hussey and Dee WallaceStone were listed in the cast. While the film wasn't a complete waste it wasn't wonderful either. The storyline to the film may sound interesting and I thought it did myself. While it is interesting it's also a little bit cloudy and some things are far too unclear left without any explanation at all. The problem with this is that these elements in the story need some type of explaining because otherwise they make little to no sense. The plot is a little convoluted but this film does have some good offerings too. The cinematography is nice and stylish and the creature in the film is presented realistically. It's normally difficult to make a monster movie where the monster itself is presented in a way that doesn't throw all logic out the window and this film succeeds at that. The monster isn't too overdone and it's believable enough.There is quite a good amount of gore in the film as well there's more than plenty of monster mutilations to please all of those gore hounds. The film boasts a mildly impressive cast including two wellknown actresses in the horror genre. The lead Christopher Denham who plays Alex is convincing in his role as the troubled young adult. Dee WallaceStone has a fairly small role as a doctor and is also excellent in her short on screen time. And Olivia Hussey who starred as the lead in my favorite horror film of all time Black Christmas plays Alex's doctorfriend. She is given very little to work with but she is also wonderful in all of her scenes which also wasn't a whole lot I would have liked to see her a little more often. The film's surprise ending caught me off guard and while it took me a minute to understand what had happened it was a fitting way to conclude the story.All in all Headspace is a just about average monster movie. It's not too overdone and is far from being corny but the plot becomes a little cloudy at times and is hard to follow on some occasions. It does boast some very good actors though and plenty of monstermurders for anyone who enjoys a good creature feature. I'd say it's about average but I have to admit it was better than I was expecting. Trust me there's much worse out there. Worth a rent if you're into this kind of stuff. 510.".

Conversations between characters is very unnatural and at times you feel as if the actors may have skipped over a few lines. The part in the movie when the Russian psychiatrist explains to Alex what he is and what is happening to him is the only exception to this.

He really channeled Alex Borden and I think that he is a very talented actor. I hope to see more of him in the future. The DVD is coming out in March so if you were not able to see it in the limited theater then get it when it comes out. Sipposedly the DVD will have better cuts on it! There were some big names and it seems that people were surprised that Denham was cast as the lead but he really pulled through. I definitely jumped more than once throughout the movie.".

	schema:headline " WORST Xmen movie ever by far.";
	schema:reviewBody "Usually plot holes are isolated. This movie was however one giant plothole. 1 GrandpaThis is what I understood at the end of the movie Turns out Grandpa is a bad ass who just wanted to magically suck Wolverine's healing powers and live forever. So what he did was i Invite Wolverine to Japan ii Fake his own death iii As part of his plan ? inject a spider onto Wolverine's heart so that he loses his healing powersWhat in the world did this achieve for evil Grandpa? iv As part of his plan ? allow his granddaughter to be subject to multiple assassination attempts just so that Wolverine will keep following her v Then after leaving a trail of crumbs for Hansel and Gretel captures his granddaughter and lures Wolverine to some sort of lair where his powers can be sucked.The ?'s indicate where I am not sure if it was really part of Grandpa's plan or things just worked out this way. Given the tremendous amount of uncertainty involved in the above plan e.g. Wolverine might've been killed in which case no powers to suck his granddaughter might've been killed in which case end of story and Wolverine would've returned to the Yukon to chill out with grizzlies you'd think there'd been a simpler and cleaner way to do all this. But no. All this is quite forgivable compared to other things that went wrong. 2 ViperwomanWhat the hell is motivating her? What does she want? Is she working for herself? Or is she working for Grandpa and if so why? How did she inject the spider onto Wolverine's heart? Just by kissing him in the middle of the night? This was never clarified.3 Japanese Father and Japanese FiancOK so it turns out the whole family except pretty granddaughter are a bunch of onedimensional assholes. This is clichd and boring and stupid but still acceptable if you at least make some effort explaining what exactly was motivating them.

	onyx:emotionText "Usually plot holes are isolated. This movie was however one giant plothole. 1 GrandpaThis is what I understood at the end of the movie Turns out Grandpa is a bad ass who just wanted to magically suck Wolverine's healing powers and live forever. So what he did was i Invite Wolverine to Japan ii Fake his own death iii As part of his plan ? inject a spider onto Wolverine's heart so that he loses his healing powersWhat in the world did this achieve for evil Grandpa? iv As part of his plan ? allow his granddaughter to be subject to multiple assassination attempts just so that Wolverine will keep following her v Then after leaving a trail of crumbs for Hansel and Gretel captures his granddaughter and lures Wolverine to some sort of lair where his powers can be sucked.The ?'s indicate where I am not sure if it was really part of Grandpa's plan or things just worked out this way. Given the tremendous amount of uncertainty involved in the above plan e.g. Wolverine might've been killed in which case no powers to suck his granddaughter might've been killed in which case end of story and Wolverine would've returned to the Yukon to chill out with grizzlies you'd think there'd been a simpler and cleaner way to do all this. But no. All this is quite forgivable compared to other things that went wrong. 2 ViperwomanWhat the hell is motivating her? What does she want? Is she working for herself? Or is she working for Grandpa and if so why? How did she inject the spider onto Wolverine's heart? Just by kissing him in the middle of the night? This was never clarified.3 Japanese Father and Japanese FiancOK so it turns out the whole family except pretty granddaughter are a bunch of onedimensional assholes. This is clichd and boring and stupid but still acceptable if you at least make some effort explaining what exactly was motivating them. Japanese Father wants to kill his own daughter just because Grandpa willed her everything? Oh and this too was part of Grandpa's grand masterplan?Japanese Fianc is just some asshole who's engaged to pretty granddaughter this BTW is explained for us gaijin simply by the line that You're not Japanese so you won't understand.

What really brings the movie down isn't its action though but rather the culprit lies in the writing. Not only does it defy science and physics every chance it gets SPOILER A poor representation of an atomic bomb hitting Nagasaki is shown through a memory SPOILER OVER  but the depictions of certain powers make you wonder if the writers even know how Wolverine's powers work. SPOILER At one point a guy in a robot samurai Real Steel anyone?somehow manages to CUT Wolverine's adamantium claws with a heated blade despite the fact that adamantium is supposed to be unbreakable with the only material within the same zone of strength being vibranium what Captain America's shield is made of. But the film never offers any sort of clarification or explanation to this. Added to this is that by somehow drilling into his bones the man in the suit gets younger as if he got Logan's healing factor even though that's not how it works yet a few seconds later he gets stabbed and his supposed healing power does nothing anymore? SPOILER OVER The character writing is poor and very 2dimensional for everyone other than Logan and so many developmentalemotional moments are thrown at you so fast that you don't have time to grab onto any of them. It's like there was a bag full of typical Hollywood ideas that the movie just flung ontop of the script.Build onto this is a predictable and lazy script with a few cheap jokes and a forced romance and you have a movie that does little more than halfentertain you. And to add to this the after credits scene makes NO sense powers wise and backtracksnegates important aspects from the last movie which is a very childish and unprofessional thing to do even if the last movie was quite bad. The people at Marvel need to simply accept their mistake and move on rather than try to dwell on things that people enjoyed from their first 2 successful XMen movies.However people always overate movies when they first come out especially for Marvel so the rating you see here is probably not the one you would give it. But if you're willing to deny several of the things you thought you knew for an hour and a half to be sorta entertained then you shouldn't have much of a problem for this movie. If not i recommend reading the plot instead to get ready for the next movie.".

But then you have this other stuff far removed from that story that seems to be studioimposed and ultimately hurts what could have been one of the best comic book movies to date. The good stuff the stuff worth watching this for are the slower quieter parts of the story. The Wolverine and Mariko parts basically. But all of the special effectsheavy parts and the loud flashy action sequences suck and take away from the impact the movie would have otherwise had. There's probably no better example than the different climactic battle scenes. Wolverine vs Shingen is a much more powerful emotional scene than the shallow garish stuff with Viper and a guy in robot armor.I don't really blame James Mangold. No doubt it was Fox's interference that caused the problems and also caused Darren Aronofsky to bail before filming. You can see a better movie underneath this one. But Fox didn't have the guts to make that movie. Probably felt it wasn't commercial enough. Needed more robots and CGI fights on top of a speeding train. Still it's good enough to watch and enjoy most of it. It's certainly miles better than the last Wolverine movie. But I can't help but feel sad thinking about what might have been. They very well could have given Wolverine his own 'Batman Begins' but instead we get just another watchable popcorn movie with hints at something more substantial.".

	schema:reviewBody "There were so many things wrong with this movie that I'm sure I'll forget something. First off I'm a huge fan of the XMen characters and story that being said this should NOT be included as a film in that series. First off WE GET IT. WOLVERINE DOES THE HEALING THING. CAN'T DIE. It is NOT necessary to stop all action every time he's injured wait until he's done healing and then continue fighting. It happens in every fight scene in this movie which by the way is all this movie is. There's a cute scene between him and Marikol that later has NO significance WHATSOEVER but besides that the whole movie seems to be fight scene after fight scene.Also seemed to me that Wolverine had probably 20 too many one liners and while a few were pretty funny not all 50 were. It would have been nice to have some real dialouge. It probably would have helped clear up all the confusion we experienced with the plot of the movie. On that note I thought the XMen franchise was supposed to be about MUTANTS. That's been the deal thus far but this movie went political brought a bunch of humans into it and seemed to forget about the mutants. Are we living in a world where everyone is OK with mutants? Is this supposed to be before or after Logan's time at the school with Professor X? We don't know because there is NO interaction with anyone except the main characters. I would have much rather gone to a movie about Storm's history or Professor X's history OR EVEN JEANNE'S HISTORY instead of ANOTHER one about Logan. One was perfect this one was NOT. And the whole scene at the beginning was pointless. WHy do we care that Logan is a mountain man who cares about bears and avenges their deaths? Was the poisoned arrow supposed to have a connection to the lizard girl? What's her deal? Where'd she come from? Why does she wear those ridiculous outfits? What was the point of the scene where she pulls her skin off? Although it was cool I guess it seemed to have no point no reason to be in the movie. Maybe she's Mystique's sister...That would have made sense. OH. And don't get me started on the logic of how the hell little old Logan is able to tackle the 2 story pure Adamantium robot powered by an almost dead jerk off who wants Logan's power. What's is deal anyway? Most guys would be thankful their life was saved ONCE... and not shoot for immortality. No one cares if you aren't ready to die you aren't a mutant so get over it and leave Logan alone. . And at the end it is NOT clear in any way whether or not Logan can heal anymore. Did he magically get his power back and they just forgot to include that detail? Or were we supposed to gather that he can't heal anymore since the weird Asian mutant is now his bodyguard? And what was the point of him falling in love with Marikol? He just leaves her. Why did we find out about the true plot behind the ENTIRE movie 15 minutes before the screen went black and credits rolled?Why was he shot in the back with 100 poisonous arrows intending to keep him from breaking into the building and then brought into the building..? And why did he fall face down in the snow like a penguin who waddled too fast? That was horrendus. He lost his badass status with that move. How is it possible for him to be riding a motorcycle in the slippery snow? Why the hell is he wearing a wife beater tank top and a jacket in the snow? Why does the army of ninjas 1. wait to attack him until he's healed back up again and 2. only come at him 1 by 1? Not very ninjalike. What was the point of Marikol's friend in the movie? To predict the future that we NEVER saw come true accurately? She sucked. She was a terrible actress and her hair was awful and there was no point in her being there there was no scene that portrayed to us any kind of real relationship she and Marikol had. But I guess she maybe does martial arts? I've also caught myself wondering what the point of half of the movie was. Why couldn't we have found out about the bad grandfather and the ENTIRE PLOT OF THE MOVIE BEFORE IT ENDED. THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED MAKE IT A GOOD MOVIE. IT WOULD HAVE AT LEAST MADE SENSE. While I can handle plotinconsistencies or stupid mistakes or cheesy lines I learned this evening that I cannot handle all of that in ONE movie. It's too much. To not have a clue what's going on have to deal with crappy writing and rookie mistakes is too much. There are so many more things I could rant about but I doubt anyone made it to the end of this review at this point so I'll end with that. OH. And despite the terrible acting around him the horrible one liners he had to deliver due to a terrible writer  director Hugh Jackman did incredible well with the part and his image in my mind remains untarnished. I was also impressed with Marikol's performance. Though she was a pretty shallow character she really played her part well. Kudos to you two.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can'y start to explain how much disappointed I was after watching this movie. As many of the xmen fans I too like the Wolverine the most. Having said that and given how much exciting the trailer looked for this title the movie to me was a big let down. Its slow moving not as much action packed as I hoped it would be. And plot to me made no sense. Spoiler Alert I don't know if I got it wrong but in the movie it has been portrayed that removing adamantium from Wolverine's body deprives him of his healing power. WTF ? More so it has been depicted to give the grandpa hiswolverine's healing powers ! utter bullshit. WolverineLogan was known for his healing power and that was the reason striker chose him for injecting adamantium. Did i miss something there ? There wasn't a single scene in the movie that I wished I could watch again which is generally not true for a Wolverine movie. Can't believe how Jackman agreed to do this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've wanted to see a wolverine movie that was fast paced action packed with a good storyline that would be well received by critics for the longest time. In my opinion wolverine is by far the most interesting of the x men characters. However this was not the wolverine I was waiting for. Yes it was action packed and I honestly enjoyed the fight scenes but it was just shocking. This movie was flaw central. It saddens me to know that this was truly Hugh Jackmans last attempt at Wolverine because we all know he's just too old for another attempt. And no one wants to see him as wolverine fighting off the bad guys at 45 it would be unbecoming. The characters in this story were ridiculous. I could tell from the moment they met that Wolverine was going to get with Mariko but part of me just would not accept it up until that fatal night when they kissed. A kiss which lacked any conviction or real passion it was laughable. The oddest on screen couple I've seen since Matt Damon and Michael Douglas in Behind The Candelabra. They were painfully awkward. The arch villain serpant lady was atrocious. The ostentatious villain that we never even learn why or how she came about to work for Yashida with undiminishing loyalty or what her general goal was. Yashida himself was a tedious villain and we didn't really here much about his life after Nagasaki. Mariko's father was a perpetual imbecile I could not fathom why he was even mentioned in the movie his character had no real significance. My favourite character had to have been Yuriko at least her motives were clear Mariko was sort of a sister to her and it was obvious from the outset she wanted a slice of the wolverine pie. Now that couple would have at least been believable because she was bad ass and fearless. Her psychic powers were a bit ridiculous though she didn't really foresee anything worthwhile did she. The fight scenes were enjoyable though especially with the deadly ninja assassins creeping through the night descending from rooftops and snapping necks like nobody's business. Yuriko was pretty sharp too I was never really worried for her character she could hold her own.... she had enough sass. It's a tragedy though I truly believe that Hugh Jackman was the perfect wolverine he just didn't get the movie he deserved. Well my advice is to wait a few years until the stench from this movie clears and then find a 20 year old Hugh Jackman doppelganger and create a Wolverine with some substance. It can't be that hard it has so much potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't much care for XMen Origins Wolverine. Hugh Jackman still was and always will be a brilliant Wolverine but the other characters felt lackluster the villain was weak and the storyline didn't fit well with the other XMen movies. It didn't have the same feel.For some time it seemed that the poor critical performances of both that and XMen 3 would mean there would be no more movies with Wolverine in them at least in a leading role. Luckily the film makers decided to do one more and if this particular movie is going to be the last one I for one can move on happy with what I got.The Wolverine is a movie that works both as a continuation of the XMen storyline as well as a standalone movie. The focus is kept heavily on Hugh Jackman which works for the movie's advantage. There are some callbacks to the events of the trilogy but as a whole I think this film could have worked just as well without them if not better as they are a bit distracting from time to time. But most of the time the focus is on where it should be. In this movie Logan travels to Japan in order to meet an old acquaintance who wants to settle old scores before his demise. In Japan we get some gorgeous scenery nice atmosphere intriguing settings believable characters all that good stuff.I especially liked Tao Okamoto's character Mariko the granddaughter of Wolverine's old friend. Jackman and Okamoto have brilliant chemistry together and when the movie slows down during the second act to give them time to simply interact with one another it feels justified. Usually that kind of slowing down in an action movie feels boring and unneeded even sappy but here it works because the actors have the skills to pull it off. Which is a great thing because it gives the movie more depth and we get a chance to know Wolverine in a new way that the Origins movie tried to reach but never could because of its lack of emotional maturity.Unfortunately this film has one major flaw and that is the unbelievably weak villain known as Viper. Her actress Svetlana Khodchenkova just doesn't have the screen presence or acting skills to give the character any memorable attributes. She merely stands there struts around in her skintight suit and spouts the dialogue. That's it. Sure part of that is poor writing but it's still rather jarring because the two main protagonists are so damn good. If only the villain had been as good this could easily have been one of the best Marvel movies yet made.As it is it's still fine. The two main characters are very good most of the side characters do a good job as well the action works wonderfully the Japanese setting gives the film a nice coating of majesty and even the story while nothing that extraordinary functions well enough for us to enjoy it. The villain is weak very weak in fact which keeps the film from being great but you can overlook it and focus on the good stuff.".

I loved Man of Steel for example. The Wolverine starts off with some really boring sequences but as a WolverineXMen fan I really thought that soon I was going sit on the edge of my seat. The aggressive Wolverine is about to cut open some hillbilly bear hunters because they have wounded a bear with a toxic dart. OK I think stupid reason to fight but hey let's just have fun and watch this piles of dirt get what they deserve from a real superhero! But a female ninja enters the bar cuts a chair in half slice the bottom of a beerbottle with a magnificent sword and ends it all before something happens for us to see.. So much for the action for the first half of the film. A viperwoman then drains Wolverine for his powers. When he gets his healing powers backby pulling his own heart out  this is BTW a cool scene!! he is beatensliced to pieces by a normal man who has trained karate! If he didn't have his healing power he would be dead by now. Really disappointing to see one of my favorite superheroes the Wolverine who stands up to Hulk in the cartoons be sliced to pieces by a 50 year old man. So much for fighting skills and super strength..... Involved in this film is a great ninja clan. They forgot to rehearse hiding so the main ninja unluckily sits on top of the roof where everyone can see him. Well well. Ninjas can do a lot of other stuff. The movie is just a dull love story for much part. Really boring and stupid. In the final battle the villain in the form of a robot with a man insidewho is not tall enough to see over the robots neck kick Wolverines ass. Luckily the lead ninja hits the robot with an arrow in the eye and we can finish this movie off with some really stupid lines before Wolverine takes off leaving his woman behind.This was such a bad movie that for the first time in my life I was considering leaving the theater.

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost I must say that I absolutely loved this movie. But as I will cover in my review it may largely be due to the fact that I have always held the source material of this film in very high regard. Having said that I do recognize that their may be a sliding scale of enjoyability for this film. If you are a fan of the 1983 ClaremontMiller miniseries of Wolverine then this is the movie you have been waiting for. If you are fond of the character Wolverine and interested into delving deeper into his chronology and exploring his inner conflicts you will certainly enjoy this movie. If however you have no familiarity or no desire to familiarize with the character of Wolverine you may find yourself not caring about many of the slower moments and longing for a more evenly paced action film.Fans of Claremont's Wolverine rejoice this Wolverine does it right. The film does its best keeping characters intact while deviating from the comics in the sake of a self contained story and grander character development. There are several of the shots in this film that are near recreations of the comic's original panels and although story lines have been shifted and shuffled in some places its all there. Mariko Yukio Harada Shingen and Viper may develop differently than in the comic series but their relation to each other and contextual significance is intact. As a Wolverine fan it was also nice to see a meaningful relationship blossom between Wolverine and Mariko unlike the comics where it really is love at first sight. Instead here Wolverine falls in love not entirely with the character of Mariko but rather with the idea of being a protector a take that is a welcome addition to the Claremont storyline. The characters of Silver Samurai and Viper undergo the largest facelift in this film but it isn't entirely out of place. Let us not forget they were involved in the X Men issues directly connecting to the Wolverine miniseries. Although their characters have undertaken slight adjustments in order to incorporate ideas from the Fatal Attractions storyline the plot does well to take from Wolverine's side of this storyline because it was one of the few times in the series where Logan did feel vulnerable. Many fans will recognize that the plot device and character of Master Yashida cannot be found in any of the original comics but one must keep in mind it serves as a useful device to connect all the developments of Logan's journey. All in all I think its the best character study of Wolverine that any fan could ask for. Wolverine struggles with his animalistic urges and his commitment to reform he grapples to find meaning in his endless immortality and he ultimately finds purpose and resolution that he had not before. None of these developments are significantly or profoundly discovered rather they are slowly revealed which may turn casual movie goers off from enjoying this film. As a thoughtful exploration of Wolverine's character and a grand homage to incredible source material though how can any Wolverine fan say no to this movie? It is the best XMen movie and one of the best comic based movies.For those who would not consider themselves fans but are rather moviegoers intent on enjoying a superhero epic be warned. This film is a character study it does not grapple with any conflicts outside of Wolverine's internal struggles. The world is not being threatened and not many lives outside of Logan's are even being threatened so the storyline does not crescendo in epic suspense like the Avengers or the Dark Knight. So for those not invested in Wolverine's personal self discovery some of the action can seem unmotivated and the pacing an obstacle to satisfaction. The film does its job in providing action sequences but it intersperses several moments of symbolic soul searching cryptic metaphors and relationship building that serve as pavement for Wolverine's self discovery. This movie can still be enjoyable without interest in Wolverine's inner conflicts however. With an outstanding supporting cast a beautiful setting and gripping and intense action sequences it plays a lot like a token Bond film for those unfamiliar with Wolverine.Whether you are familiar with the original comics or not this movie will certainly provide entertaining thrills and intriguing themes. If however you are a fan of the original comic books this film is a wonderful achievement.".

He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests.

This film has really tried to please the fans as it was loosely based on the beloved Japan story line from the comics and it is clear that the film has tried to fix the problems that were complained about in the previous solo Wolverine film. Despite taking place after the events of Xmen The Last Stand this film attempts to distance itself from the rest of the Xmen characters and story and focuses solely on the Wolverine character and as a result this film feels very different to all previous Xmen films. This allows for the best portrayal of Wolverine's character that we have seen so far and Hugh Jackman also delivers his best performance of the character to date. I really enjoyed the pacing of the film as well because although it was a face paced action film it wasn't afraid to slow things down and develop the characters and the relationships between them. However it never slows down for too long before it picks up the pace with another action scene. The action in this film is also very well done because every sequence is creative and has a purpose so it never feels like the mindless action we've come to expect in big budget summer films. Humour is also used effectively in this film as the writers take advantage of Wolverine's IDGAF attitude. However the film isn't perfect as there is one other mutant character that occasionally seems slightly out of place and some people might find her character a bit too over the top. Also from time to time it does feel like they are playing it too safe to insure that they don't make any of the same mistakes as the last Wolverine film. Overall The Wolverine although not perfect is a fun superhero film that gets a lot of things right about what makes the Wolverine character so popular.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the worst Xmen film to date. Many of the earlier films suffer from the rating restriction imposed by the need for a large underage viewership. They are not gritty they lack the adult character relationships lack depth and are too focused on action with minimal blood. This movie seems to have made an attempt to be more adult by throwing a few curse words in but fails in the adult movie department for starters because the plot just doesn't make any sense. From the bear scenario at the beginning of the film things are already looking pretty directionless and it does not get better as Logan enters the country of the samurai. The fight scenes are too fast filmed too closely poorly soundtracked metal on metal sound every time an adamantium claw enters someone's body a bus a tree and not believable. Sometimes Wolverine lets people get him down just so another hero can save him and throughout the film he takes on injuries that a hundreds of years old warrior trained in every martial art should have learned to avoid by now. Fans who have followed Wolverine from comic book to television show to film will wretch at this movie more than the first Wolverine title because it does not portray anything of what makes Logan's story so compelling. How he became what he is the relationships he has had the emotional baggage he carries and not being sure where he stands in the mutant struggle for equality. Logan is an emotionally complex individual one who has had and lost seen people be born and grow old and dynasties rise and fall. The movie fails to convey any of this intellectually showing only a lonely man living in a cave in Alaska with a serious look on his face who immediately falls in love with a girl fights a bunch of Japanese with no cause themselves for the next hour and then gets on a plane with another girl. The dream sequences with Jean Grey are extraneous and at the end of the movie Wolverine fights a giant robot that was designed specifically to take his powers by a person who has every reason to be his friend. I am not sure anyone who could review this film positively saw the same movie as me. I want my two hours back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the course of the modern superhero era one thing has stayed true Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. After being a successful piece of the XMen franchise for three films Wolverine got his own solo gig in 2009's XMen Origins Wolverine which turned out to be a chaotic smear of superhero film with a clichridden script. Jackman who has become synonymous with the part in a way that would make even Robert Downey Jr. jealous deserved better.Thankfully The Wolverine is better. In fact it bounces back from the very worst failings of Origins telling a characteroriented story that borrows from the Chris ClaremontFrank Miller comic featuring Wolverine's Japanese saga.The story takes place postXMen The Last Stand as Logan is haunted in his dreams by Jean Grey Famke Janssen whom he killed in that film in order to essentially save the world. Hiding out and looking like an imprisoned Jean Valjean somewhere in Alaska he tends to do that a Japanese woman named Yukio Rila Fukushima finds him and convinces him to travel back with her to Japan to meet her master Yashida Hal Yamanouchi whom Wolverine saved during the bombing of Nagasaki in World War II. Yashida is one of Japan's wealthiest men a technology entrepreneur and he wants to offer Wolverine the one thing he's never had  mortality. For someone who feels as though their gift has been a curse lately it's an appealing offer.Of course there has to be a catch and Wolverine soon finds himself dealing with the venomous Viper Svetlana Khodchenkova and going on the run and protecting Yashida's granddaughter Mariko Tao Okamoto who is being sought after by the Yakuza Japanese mob.The film almost never leaves Wolverine's side and provides more than adequate motivational fuel for us to become invested in the story. Wolverine's consideration of his own inner pain and immortality finally gives Jackman something to work with despite how good he is with all the more exterior elements of the character.Director James Mangold Walk the Line and the underrated remake of 310 to Yuma excels at finding these character moments while also taking the opportunity to make a Marvel samurai movie. The film's fight sequences take a visceral yet artistic approach reminiscent of a samurai film violent but stylized. An Rrated version however would've made this an exceptional film but such is Hollywood.In summer after summer of largescale blockbusters with immense action sequences The Wolverine will be a tad underwhelming for anyone impartial to the character that is just looking for the next big movie. Again this movie is as much about Wolverine's internal struggle as what's happening on screen. It is exciting in small ways not in big ways outside of a sequence on top a bullet train. Mangold also does some cool things with a chase sequence through Tokyo in which the archer Harada Will Yun Lee snipes Yakuza thugs as Wolverine runs with Mariko.A lot of props go to the script team of Mark Bomback Unstoppable Total Recall and Scott Frank Minority Report who revised the initial draft by Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie The Usual Suspects. Obviously the character element of the story works well but the pacing is strong and surprises wait at every turn even if the plot trajectory follows a pretty traditional superhero movie structure.To put The Wolverine in the context of the evergrowing rolodex of superhero movies it's a rocksolid entertaining betterthanmost entry but years from now will probably get overlooked among the genre's best thanks to the visually groundbreaking event films now and soon to be even more prevalent. It does little to stand out but the Wolverine character didn't need something to make him stand out it needed something more personal. Why else would you isolate a character from the XMen if not to tell his personal story? The Wolverine is a superb film that should've come out four years ago when it would've been a great film. If it were an origin story and not the fifth time Jackman put the claws on not counting his XMen First Class cameo I would put it on par with Iron Man minus some of the flashy CGI and a decent percentage of humor. There's no question Wolverine's lack of novelty will play a factor for those who find it unimpressive but getting down to what it means to make a good superhero film you can't go wrong with the model used in The Wolverine. And fans will genuinely be excited about what Wolverine does next with or without the XMen.Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's 1982 Japanese story arc is one of the most famous and celebrated in comic book history. It has finally been the cinematic treatment amidst a loose adaptation and watches out the taste of Wolverine's first solo outing.After the events of XMen The Last Stand Logan Hugh Jackman has living alone in the Canadian wilderness and suffering from recurring dreams about Jean Grey Famke Janssen and guilt about her death. As Logan challenges a group of illegal hunters in a bar he is found by Yukio Rila Fukushima a woman recruited to bring The Wolverine to Yashida Haruhiko Yamanouchi a dying Japanese industrialist he saved when he was a Prisoner of War outside Nagasaki.In Japan Yashida gives Logan an offer to take his healing factor and make Wolverine mortal. But even though Wolverine refuses his powers are taken from him anyway and he is thrown into a family industrial struggle involving the Yakuza a clan of ninjas a corrupt Japanese government minister and a mysterious biochemist mutant known as The Viper Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova who performs with a flawless American accent. As Wolverine protects Yashida's granddaughter Mariko Tao Okamoto from all these factions he also begins to see what it can be like to live a normal life.XMen Origins Wolverine had many problems misjudged humour awful special effects subpar action awful writing and introducing characters just for the sake of fan service. The Wolverine does rectify many of these problems and director James Mangold had much more free reign then Gavin Hood had.Mangold knew what made the best XMen films work so he focuses on character development and more brooding drama and it is complemented by an excellent performance from Jackman. Jackman gives us the Wolverine of old a character who is haunted suffering from nightmares and guilt looking for a reason to give his life meaning as well as giving us the gruff wit we know and love from Wolverine. The Wolverine is a much darker film more akin to XMen and X2 which it needed to be. Yet the film still has a massive injection of fun which you would expect from a film featuring mutants samurais and ninjas.While The Wolverine has an expected PG13 rating Mangold does push it to the limit. We see Wolverine sliding his way through Yakuza thugs having his flesh scorched off by the nuclear blast and our hero having to operate on himself. There is solid action throughout the film and the more cheesy elements has been removed in The Wolverine with the only misjudged sequence being the Bullet Train fight sequence as it comes off a little goofy. Comedy has also been cut with The Wolverine having two overtly comic sequences and Wolverine having a few comic remarks but they are actually inkeeping with the character.As an adaptation of the Japanese miniseries The Wolverine had to take liberties to make it work with the film series' continuity though continuity is now very screwed up in the XMen series. Yukio is no longer the ambiguous assassin with a danger complex and her colour are nailed on the mast Mariko and Logan having no prior relationship Mariko's father Hiroyuki Sanada is a combination of her father and husband in the comic and the Viper has no role in the original comic are just some of the changes that were made. But these are changes that are easy to look past even though on a personal standpoint it would have been nice to see more of the parallels between Wolverine and Yukio. The changes to the Silver Samurai will be a bit harder to swallow for comic book fans and it is when the film loses it way a little with its action climax.The Wolverine had a number of villains and it does result in problems. The first one is the film does not know who to make the main villain before settling on Viper who does have a commanding presence on screen. The other is due to the number of factions in play which makes many of the characters a bit underdeveloped. One character that suffered this was Will Yun Lee's Harada the head of the ninja who did have an interesting character who was loyal to Mariko.The Wolverine does have some script problems and the final act is a more generic affair but its clear that Mangold and Jackman do have a good understanding of the character and they put the cinematic version of Wolverine in good standing.And on a final note the post credit scene is a must see it is one of best and most tantalising in a long time.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com".

Jackman gives us the Wolverine of old a character who is haunted suffering from nightmares and guilt looking for a reason to give his life meaning as well as giving us the gruff wit we know and love from Wolverine. The Wolverine is a much darker film more akin to XMen and X2 which it needed to be. Yet the film still has a massive injection of fun which you would expect from a film featuring mutants samurais and ninjas.While The Wolverine has an expected PG13 rating Mangold does push it to the limit. We see Wolverine sliding his way through Yakuza thugs having his flesh scorched off by the nuclear blast and our hero having to operate on himself. There is solid action throughout the film and the more cheesy elements has been removed in The Wolverine with the only misjudged sequence being the Bullet Train fight sequence as it comes off a little goofy. Comedy has also been cut with The Wolverine having two overtly comic sequences and Wolverine having a few comic remarks but they are actually inkeeping with the character.As an adaptation of the Japanese miniseries The Wolverine had to take liberties to make it work with the film series' continuity though continuity is now very screwed up in the XMen series. Yukio is no longer the ambiguous assassin with a danger complex and her colour are nailed on the mast Mariko and Logan having no prior relationship Mariko's father Hiroyuki Sanada is a combination of her father and husband in the comic and the Viper has no role in the original comic are just some of the changes that were made. But these are changes that are easy to look past even though on a personal standpoint it would have been nice to see more of the parallels between Wolverine and Yukio. The changes to the Silver Samurai will be a bit harder to swallow for comic book fans and it is when the film loses it way a little with its action climax.The Wolverine had a number of villains and it does result in problems. The first one is the film does not know who to make the main villain before settling on Viper who does have a commanding presence on screen. The other is due to the number of factions in play which makes many of the characters a bit underdeveloped. One character that suffered this was Will Yun Lee's Harada the head of the ninja who did have an interesting character who was loyal to Mariko.The Wolverine does have some script problems and the final act is a more generic affair but its clear that Mangold and Jackman do have a good understanding of the character and they put the cinematic version of Wolverine in good standing.And on a final note the post credit scene is a must see it is one of best and most tantalising in a long time.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com";

First Wolverine when in the Japanese prison camp of which I'm pretty sure there were none in Nagasaki says something to the effect of 'that's a B52 bomber. no one's gonna outrun that.' Did he know about the project code named 'Big Boy?' Did he know that it was the atomic bomb? And if so how the heck would he know that? Also he slept with his friend's granddaughter. Isn't that against some unwritten code of honor? Also almost the only factor in the entire movie that moved anybody even a little bit was his relationship with his Japanese friend and how he sustained an atomic blast to protect him. Then in the end we came to find out that he was only looking to take advantage of Wolverine and reclaim his youth. Nicely done. Bonus there were some funny parts like in the porno hotel and with the 'doctor.. sort of. veterinarian.. student' and I'll admit the beginning part with the bear was pretty sad and Wolverine's rage was pretty justified. And the train fight scene was awesome! However this movie was just like that train except way too slow paced at times and it didn't know where it was going. Like I'm pretty positive the director pulled the ending right out of his butt. Pretty bad. 510".

However i'm entitled to my opinion just as much as you're entitled to yours so i can say what i want about The Wolverine.I went into the film expecting very little but it somehow managed to surprise me and deliver even less than i had expected i'm not one of these uber comic fans that compares everything to the graphic novels then complains when it isn't exactly the same but if major changes are being made then i feel they should benefit the story. which is where The Wolverine is lacking the story is paperthin and guessable from the first half hour alone. i'd like to step around the plot holes but they are so damn wide it would be impossible to do so my major gripe being how can Adamantium be broken by more Adamantium? i get that the sword was superheated but we've established in the previous X Men films that Adamantium is unbreakable when hardened but somehow that rule is changed as and when to suit the film. The other massive hole i can't get my head around is how does Wolverine even remember Yashida? this is supposedly set in the canon of after the Last Stand but Wolverine had all his memories prior to Origins wiped in Origins and as far as i recall he never got them back so surely his memory of Yashida in World War 2 would have gone? If you have an answer for that i would love to hear it too.I didn't go into Wolverine wanting much but it failed to deliver on nearly every level from the awful story to the terrible character development. And as for the sneaky credit scene i dread to think how the XMen universe of Fox will tackle a subject as difficult as Time Travel to explain itself.Simply put i'd save my money ignore the fanboys and wait for the next offering from the MarvelDisney team to fulfill your superhero fix.".

Logan Hugh Jackman the honorable yet brutal warrior of the mutant super team has grown disenchanted with life and is living in the wilderness of Canada. Haunted by memories of his lost love Jean Grey Famke Janssen the loner is a victim of his own immortality. He has all the time in the world but nothing left to live for.That is until Yukio Rila Fukushima a messenger from a man he once saved many years before named Yashida Haruhiko Yamanouchi  tracks him down with a luring proposition. Yashida  now a technology mogul is nearing the end of his life. He claims that before he passes he wishes to grant Logan the gift of mortality in exchange for saving his life so many years ago.Of course everything is not as it seems. And it is not long before Logan is caught up in family politics involving Yashida's heirs fiery son Shingen Hiroyuki Sanada and captivating granddaughter Mariko Tao Okamato. After Yakuza goons make an attempt to kidnap Mariko Logan rescues her and finds new purpose in keeping her protected. As they camp out in hiding the two fall for each other and he is able to find relief in confessing his past to her. But peace does not last for long as Mariko is eventually snatched away from him leading the Wolverine to give chase and track her down by any means necessary.The thing that makes The Wolverine work on so many levels is its maturity. Christopher Nolan showed with his Batman trilogy that superhero movies could be loyal to the sometimes serious tone of comics but still be accessible to the masses. Movies based on Marvel characters for the most part have not followed suit. While entertaining the Marvel movies the Punishers being the exception have been light hearted affairs that focus more on action and laughs than story or character development. Logan however is a serious character with grown up problems who deserves a script to reflect that. Director James Mangold and Jackman have a done a solid job in bringing that angst to the screen. The Frank Miller and Chris Claremont penned story arc that Mangold and his crew of writers have borrowed from for this movie is considered to be one of the best in Wolverine canon. In fact the first twothirds of The Wolverine are so good at developing the mutant's character that viewers do not even notice the lack of constant action scenes that are so prevalent in superhero films today. It is a testament to Jackman's now effortless portrayal of the troubled protagonist and also to Mangold's ability to match the atmosphere of the dark content of early Wolverine comics.This is not to say that The Wolverine lacks explosiveness. There is just enough fighting and chases throughout those aforementioned first twothirds and a little too much of it in the final act. It is in the final act where Mangold slips a little digressing back into a standard Marvel piece heavy on smoke and mirrors instead of genuine substance. But Marvel's smoke and mirrors still outdazzle most of its competition on any given movie night and audiences will not be let down here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saving Silverman is about as far away from say Citizen Kane for film greatness as any film could. But it's not a clunker either. For what it is it's a very enjoyable occasionally hilarious movie pretty much guaranteed to give anyone a good time.Movie history especially in the 1930s is littered with small comedy films that were never meant to be critical award winning films but made for audiences that wanted to laugh like We're Not Dressing and any number of WC Fields' films Fields' Million Dollar Legs seems very similar in tone to Saving Silverman. Unpretentious funny and entertaining films and Saving Silverman falls squarely into that category. It's dopey but harmless and frequently charming. All of the actors are insynch and none of them hold back especially Amanda Peet as the woman from hell. She's beautiful and you can completely understand why Darren would fall for her the way he does. Peet's willingness to give it her all especially at the end is key to the movie working as well as it does. Any vanity on her part would've sunk the already flimsy premise but she goes into it wholeheartedly. Peet's not given enough credit here.Yes Black and Zahn are great. That pretty much goes without saying. Biggs is well cast but he's essentially playing a male victim. The role is largely just his puzzled reactions. Last but not least is Amanda Detmer as Sandy in a role straight out of 1930s comedy the good down to earth girl who ever so slightly off her rocker but in a good appealing way. R. Lee Ermey rounds out the cast in a silly but memorable role. Who would've thunk that the uberintimidating drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket would turn out to be one of the most reliable character actors around?Saving Silverman is a simple funny little film. Not great but it was not made to be.".

Was this film good on paper?  Did it look funny at the time?  I don't know.  I'm not even sure if it is possible for this film to look good in any form.  I was intrigued by the trailer it looked damn funny and the principal players in the film are all actors that I like.  Amanda Peet has a great resume of smaller films such as Body Shots Playing By Heart Whipped and She's The One.  All films that I loved.  Jack Black thrilled me with his comic genius in High Fidelity.  Steve Zahn was irritatingly likable in Out of Sight and of course Jason Biggs was awesome in American Pie.  Hey I even admire a lot of Neil Diamonds music and I am one of the few people that liked The Jazz Singer. So how did this movie get so bad?  That is simple.  It starts with making Judith  Amanda Peet  such a bitch!  Seriously that is all that did it for me.  Not to mention the fact that the film wasn't funny but when you have a film that is predicated on showing how one friend falls madly in love with a woman and abandons his friends you had better give a good reason as to why he is expunging himself from his friends of 20 years.  You can't just have a hot chick come into one man's life reason enough to turn it upside down. There has to be reasons.  This film doesn't give any reasons.Jason Biggs plays Darren Silverman as a romantic at heart.  His two best friends are apparent losers that do nothing in life except party and listen to Neil Diamond songs.  The three also have a Neil Diamond cover band.  They are close buds.  Then one day Judith walks into a bar.  She is beautiful but crass and rude.  Eventually her and Darren hook up and he is in love with her.  He falls in love with her because she makes him masturbate instead of making love to her.  She makes him abandon his friends of 20 years she forces him to quite the band that he loves she makes him take relationship counseling she orders him around she makes him wear a beeper so that she can have him at her beck and call she tells his friends that Darren is her puppet and that she is the puppet master she tells him what he can drink on the very first day that she meets him and she makes him burn all of his Neil Diamond records.  There is no growth of this woman into the mind control freak that she is.  She is just a bitch from the moment that Darren lays eyes on her.  How could anyone fall for someone like that?  I know many guys that have been in love with many different beautiful woman but not one of them has ever been as nasty as Judith is and hence not one guys has ever had to live his life like he is in a convent.Another problem with the film is the lack of comedy.  As I said earlier Black and Zahn have shown before that they are plenty capable of comedy. But as much as they try here it falls flat.  I don't think that is their fault it is the script that they are working with.  Black has a few parts that look as if they are going to be funny but you are waiting for a payoff that never comes.Saving Silverman is one of the worst movies I have seen in about a year. There was a romance that came out last year called Here On Earth starring Biggs' American Pie buddy Chris Klein and Leeleeleelee Sobieski that was so bad and so inept that I measure all bad films against that one.  While this one isn't quite as bad it is close.  I wonder if this is a pattern with the boys from American Pie.  Are they all going to make sucky movies for quite some time?  If these two films are any sort of barometer for the hopeful success they are praying for things don't look to good.There is one plus for the film.  Amanda Detmer looks good.  That is it.1 out of 10 half being for Detmer and the other half because it wasn't as bad as Here One Earth.".

Judith Escaped Wayne.... Dehrrrrrrrr. That always makes me laugh so hard that I had to hear it over and over and over again and I will stay be laughing.Some say this was a bad movie but I really enjoy it and I recently started watching it again because it had a good cast and a funny story and lots of laughs that make you keep coming back for me.So Overall I am glad to say that Saving Silverman is one of my favorite movies in my DVD collection and should be worth checking out.I give Saving Silverman a 8 out of 10 thanks for reading my review and take care.Judith Escaped.

There's also a totally random use of flashbacks throughout dear God just tell us what happened and get it over with it's not like any of those flashbacks contains a good joke or something. However as the movie progresses the material does get better and Steve Zahn and Jack Black deliver like they've never delivered before. They have the onscreen chemistry of a classic comedy duo only a lot more disturbed. Either way Evil Woman what kind of title is Saving Silverman? is a movie that made me laugh in all its weirdnessan R.Lee Ermey cameo! and it looks ever so charming. Unexpectably good.".

The film is Saving Silverman directed by Dennis Dugan who has experience with lowbrow tasteless humor Big Daddy Happy Gilmore but never has he laid his paws on a project this unimaginably horrible. It is so bad in so many different ways we question what attracted the stars to this material. Amanda Peet was so good in The Whole Nine Yards but destroys her credibility here Steve Zahn can really make us laugh if provided with the right comic elements just take a look at Happy Texas  and Jason Biggs well he has never been in a movie of true quality but even American Pie Boys and Girls and Loser were better than this insipid unfunny and stupid so called comedy.The plot Darren Jason Biggs Wayne Steve Zahn and J.D. Jack Black have been best friends since their school years they even have a band named after their music idol Neil Diamond. Darren is a social worker. Wayne is a pest controller. J.D. is a fired Subway employee. The three guys have nothing better to do than scramble from bar to bar hoping to pick up a young woman for Darren because he has never recovered from the girl of his dreams Sandy Amanda Detmer from high school. One night they get Darren fixed with the wrong girl.Her name is Judith SnodgrassFessbeggler Amanda Peet and she is a sophisticated psychologist. They have nothing in common have no chemistry together and seeming distrust each other but they both fall in love immediately. She proposes to him after a few weeks. He accepts. Judith seemingly has compete control over Darren's entire livelihood. She demands that he never spend time with his disgusting friends again and that he must quit their band. Wayne and J.D. attempt to end Judith and Darren's relationship by kidnapping the unsuspecting witch and setting their best friend up with his old love interest.The characters wander around the screenplay with little or nothing to do. The story is a sketch to rationalize a series of painfully cheap jokes and hey I have some space to kill some of the film's best humor includes a group of nuns body building jokes about homosexuality an electric prod zapping certain parts of someone's body R. Lee Ermy taking a dump in a person's front yard a violent struggle between Judith and her two kidnappers and the sight of a butt cheek implant that is not for the faint of heart. There is also a scene where Amanda Peet's character threatens to take away Darren's masturbation privileges. This is a problem for Darren as demonstrated by an earlier scene where Judith is pleasured by Darren but when it comes his turn she hands him a porno magazine and a bottle of hand lotion.Saving Silverman is obviously from the imagination of horny amateur and breastobsessed people Judith's wardrobe is more revealing than Jennifer Lopez's Grammy outfit the entire plot is based on sexual urges and contains a wide selection of wanking off jokes. The film clearly strives to contain humor that is sure to offend everyone putting the PG13 rating in question here. Nothing in this movie adds up to much of anything. There is a scene where an old wrinkly man wins a game of bingo jumping out of his seat to reveal his bare buttock that fills the movie screen this exemplifies the experience of watching Saving Silverman.".

They have an unbreakable friendship as you'll see in the movie sometimes they will go to completely drastic measures to fight for each other. But throughout this film you will want them to all just be happy and stick together.Of course this is just another one of those movies which comes out every year with the same plot but I guarantee you that if you are eagering for a good laugh sound proof walls recommended then get this out. It's randomly hilarious the characters are cute and stupid it'll leave you wishing it would just go on for hours!I mean where else can you find a movie with the lines such as we ate her!";

Jack Black Steve Zaun and Jason Biggs all did a good part and should be proud of their success.The basic theme is Darren Jason Biggs gets a new girlfriend who takes over his life. She makes it so he does everything she says and he has no freedom. Wayne and JD Steve Zaun and Jack Black both try to save him from this woman.

And as comedies go they don't get much funnier or sillier than Saving Silverman'. So my hat's off to the entire cast and crew of this film. Everything from the scripting the acting and direction was first rate. Jason Biggs was a great choice for playing Darren Silverman.  Jack Black was hilarious in his role as was Steve Zahn.  But the real star here was Amanda Peet.  I think Amanda Peet is one of the sexiest and possibly the best comedic actress in the business.  I was a little disappointed by the movie Whipped' although I did not think it was her fault.  That particular script had many problems in my opinion.  But Saving Silverman' did not have those problems.  This cast seemed to be a cut above and it was just a much more funny plot.  All I can say here is that if you like outrageous comedy and can survive a marathon of laughter then by all means rent this video or DVD.  You'll be glad you did.  You certainly don't have to be a big Neil Diamond fan to find this movie funny or entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Romero does an excellent job of swapping Zombies for Monkeys. This film may sound ridiculous in the most preposterous way. But then again we now live in a world of Snakes on a Plane and Burning Bright so this is a little easier to swallow. In its genre it is one of the best examples and I'm not just talking about killer animals. I'm also referring to the stalkerobsessive partnerfriend genre. What Romero does brilliantly is to take a number of characters and the audience on a journey of emotions and self discovery. For example I started off wanting one of these monkeys. The relationship built up is a genuinely loving one. It's really cute and this could easily be one of those lifetime inspirational movies. If the monkey wasn't a genetically modified telepathic homicidal psycho monkey. The well trained monkey takes us from tragic victim of experiments to a loving carer. We get a wonderful cleaning montage as the monkey helps the friendship expands. The monkey's obsession grows steadily. It starts off with a few temper tantrums and escalates into bananas in the slippers. Soon bananas turn to murder. It's the evolution of all species.None of this would work if it wasn't for a dramatic human connection. Beghe is a law studentathlete that is paralysed. He goes through acceptance denial frustration which is understandable as his girlfriend leaves him for his doctor a sleazy Tucci he gets a patronizing nurse and then his overbearing mother. It's great to see how the characters react to Beghe's quadriplegia as it enforces Beghe's later anger. Beghe also does a terrific job of facial acting which is most important as he can't use his body. In a single look he can convey the embarrassment of his mother having to wash him. On the surface this is a story of a monkey being a bitch to a cripple. But look deep down REAAAAAAALLY deep and you'll see a social commentary. For a long time the monkey is the only one that treats Beghe as an equal. It doesn't throw money at his problem try and cheer him up nor can the monkey do everything for him. Romero fills the film with dread absurdity and most of all a serious edge that clearly does the film justice. It's easy to mock this film. But the truth is this could actually happen. Monkeys are creepy and untrustworthy.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for body count blood or bogeymen this film is not for you. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror film though it was billed as horror likely because of the pseudoscience gimmick that provides the basis for the conflict in the plot.While the film tends to wander a bit i.e. a subplot involving the research head that gets dropped 34 of the way through it stays fairly well focused on the main character and his problems. Aside from the lead the most effective acting was done by the monkeys but the real actors do a pretty good job of carrying their own. It gives you a little insight into what it's like to be quadriplegic. For a late 80's movie the style of filming was well done there is very little cheese and the special effects didn't overreach.The premise seems a bit farfetched to our currently more sophisticated and informed sense of what's possible on the genetic engineering front. After all this movie was made 15 years ago. If Romero had gone with either a supernatural cause or a plain animal jealousy angle it might be less dated but then again it might have been a little less believable to begin with.Not very horrific not startling or scary but worth seeing if you don't mind a slightly slowpaced thriller. I gave it a higher than average score 6 out of 10 just because it didn't make me say oh please! too many times unlike other movies from that timeparticularly horror filmsare prone to do. For example the pivotal moment is fully supported by plausible input earlier in the film it's not one of those miraculous developments pulled out of nowhere in the last few seconds before the climax.".

Never have I wanted so many people to die so badly while watching a flick.  I mean these people get what's coming to them.  The evil lazy nurse the jealous mother the cheating exgirlfriend and the vindictive doctor.  Take Kathy Bates from Misery and make her every character.  You want to see this monkey go apesht and kill them.  It's great.  It's every young boy's dream to have a killer monkey and Monkey Shines really brings that to life.  This idea has never quite been attempted this way and it's suspenseful as hell.  I'd say it succeeded in doing what it tried to do.  My only peve is that it introduces a few characters that clearly deserve to die but don't the nurse and Stephen Root.  Other than that it's a thoroughly enjoyable thriller.

	schema:headline " One of Romero's most underrated and finest horror films  Monkey Shines";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems that every once and a while a neat little horror film comes along that eschews genre conventions and is able to tap into a new vein to provide its scares. Writerdirector George A. Romero of Night of the Living Dead 1968 and Dawn of the Dead 1978 infamy brings forth Monkey Shines an adaptation of the novel by Michael Stewart.Romero has always been a director who goes for the throat in delivering the shocks in his horror pictures. But in the savage gore and mayhem he has never lost sight of the human characters their drama and their plight. In Monkey Shines Romero seems to have been domesticated somewhat  dare I say tamed  in that characters and drama are most essential to the core of the film and that horror is really the last thing on his mind.Monkey Shines begins with the Good Day Gone Bad Really Bad Allan Mann Jason Beghe is a highly physical law student who goes for a jog early one morning after spending the night with his girlfriend Linda Janine Turner. To avoid a dog on the sidewalk he unknowingly runs into the path of an oncoming truck. He wakes up several weeks later in the hospital now a quadriplegic paralyzed unable to use his body anywhere below the neck.Confined to a wheelchair he moves around by working a lever with his mouth and having to rely on livein nurse Maryanne Christine Forrest his doting overbearing mother Dorothy Joyce Van Patten and having to deal with his pompous surgeon Dr. Wiseman Stanley Tucci who begins having an affair with Linda Allan gives up and tries to commit suicide. Luckily Allan's madscientist friend Geoffrey John Pankow may have a solution Ella an extremely intelligent capuchin monkey who is being trained by animal specialist Melanie Parker Kate McNiel to be a sort of helpprimate for paraplegics and quadriplegics much like a seeingeye dog is used for blind people.At first a great weight seems lifted off Allan's shoulders Ella's the perfect helper  she can answer the phone play cassette tapes in the radio and even help Allan turn the pages of his books when he reads. She even raises her hand in class for her turn to be called on. A deep bond develops between the two that's right out of any madeforTV movie about hope and determination to beat the odds. Of course and this is where the horror elements begin to kick in what Allan doesn't know is that Ella is really Geoffrey's guinea pig in an experiment to create superintelligent primates he's been secretly injecting her with human brain tissue which explains her superintelligence in helping to make Allan's life a little bit easier. Even more horrifically Allan has been having incredibly realistic nightmares in which he has acquired a monkey'seye view of the world and Ella is subconsciously acting out his deeplysuppressed anger frustration hatred and rage for those around him. And it soon begins a battle of wits to see who is really controlling who which also sees if Charles Darwin was really right all those years ago.Monkey Shines develops so nicely during its first hour that it's easy to forget that first and foremost it's a horror film and not just any horror film a George A. Romerodirected horror film. Romero shows remarkable restraint in combining both the human story with the horror story that both elements are given enough screen time to thoroughly develop and not seem so tackedon to each other. That atmosphere and tension of the film's horrorthemed second half is pretty intense even if things can be forgiven for the haunted housestyle climax.This is easily the bestacted film Romero has ever directed though obviously it's not his best that honor goes to Dawn of the Dead. All of the characters turn in fine and realistic performances including John Pankow as Allan's drugaddled madscientist friend who truly has his friend's best interests at heart even if they're morally gray in the end. But there is one performer who is highly deserving of much praise and that is Jason Beghe. Jason Beghe delivers a strong controlled central performance that in my opinion was criminally overlooked by a great many awards organizations. His performance is one of the most convincing and sympathetic portrayals of a physically handicapped protagonist I've ever seen in the movies. Essentially a prisoner in his own body he hits every emotive note perfectly and we believe and can see where and why his anger and rage at his condition is one of the most believable performances in the history of Romero's long and distinguished career as a filmmaker.Monkey Shines is an overlooked career highlight from a highly distinguished director George A. Romero. Even more so Jason Beghe's criminally underrated performance makes the film even more worthy of more significant praise.This is one horror film that isn't monkeying around in the end. It is really scary.810".

	schema:headline " Monkey Horror Movie kinda shines. Then it kinda pees on itself.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film may sound ridiculous in the most preposterous way because it's a killer monkey movie but don't monkey around. Go see this movie. It's not that bad as it seem. It's honestly pretty alright. I have to say this isn't your runofthemill cheesy Slasher monkey horror film like 1990's Shakma  1995's Congo. This is a pretty smart psychological thriller that you can go bananas for! Written and directed by George A. Romero the film is based on a novel with the same title authored by Michael Stewart. Monkey Shines An Experiment in Fear tells the story of an extrack athlete Alan Mann Jason Beghe whom became paralyzed when struck by a truck. Mann fails to adjust to his condition becoming suicidal and despondent. To help Alan out his friend Geoffrey Fischer John Pankow trained a monkey named Ella Boo the Monkey to help him with his paralysis. What he doesn't know is that Geoffrey has been experimenting with Ella genetically alter her brain that cause the little monkey to develop more humanlike deep feelings and rage against its new master and her monkey trainer Melanie Parker Kate McNeil. I can understand why people might overlook this movie. The little monkey is too cute. Whose idea was it to use a capuchin monkey as a villain? Why didn't they just use a bigger ape? While a capuchin monkey seem silly as a villain. There is a way to portray it right like what they did in 1995's Outbreak. They was able to do it because that monkey in that movie was carrying a deadly disease that cause its villains to have violent and gory deaths. This movie didn't have any of that fears because it lacks gore. The movie is a bit laughable as the small monkey tries to poison and burn fully grown human beings. Clearly Boo has no clue what she was doing. Most of the action in the film is very unintentionally hilarious. The crash scene involving a running man a barking dog and flying bricks is just cheesy. While I couldn't see the monkey as a serious threat. I did love how the movie portray their relationship. The relationship built up is a genuinely loving one. It was a deep bond between the two that's right out of any kid's animal movie and then it got really bizarre with Alan picks up on Ella's primal behavior and Ella picks up on Allan's feelings of frustration rage and revenge. The movie never explain this odd empathy of two as both feel increasing in love with each other. It almost beasty. As if the movie was trying to channel the same themes of horror in Gothic tales like Beauty and the Beast Planet of the Apes  the Island of Doctor Moreau where no matter how civilize you can act you still have one foot out of the jungle. I guess the movie was trying to say something like a link from man to beast but it never fully explained satisfactorily leaving a gaping plot hole that is a wart to what the film is trying to accomplish. I had actually read Monkey Shines. It was not a great read but it's explain the concept better than the movie with the main character taking the same pills intended to increase the learning ability of his primate companion but in the movie it's never explained. Why and how exactly does Geoffrey's intelligenceboosting potion wind up linking Ella to Alan psychically? Who Knows! The movie doesn't bothered with it. The concept of the story has some interesting aspects. The life of a quadriplegic is an interesting subject and you see it with the great acting from Jason Beghe. You really see the struggle of it through his facial expression and eyes. Kate McNeil is very convincing as the energetic robust and beautiful trainer. Together Beghe and McNeil make a cute couple on screen and unlike other viewers I didn't find the sex scene between them weird. It's very rare to see how severely handicapped are able to make love. Their love scene is very sensual proving that the handicapped can do most anything. A young Stanley Tucci is a cool look as the supporting character despicable neurosurgeon Dr. John Wiseman. I really couldn't believe that was him. Most of the rest of the supporting cast was alright in their roles. Boo the monkey was the star of the film big time. Without her the movie couldn't had work. A lot of people might hate this movie due to the fact that they have a monkey as a villain. Watching a monkey maim and kill people could be pretty traumatic for younger and even some older viewers I would imagine. PETA might jump in for the very controversial ending. The ending was so controversial that the film's distributor Orion Pictures forced Romero to add a happy ending to the picture a plot device which the director had long avoided in favor of more ambiguous endings because they were desperate for a hit as it was in financial difficulty. Second after poor previews the studio recut the film without Romero's knowledge to add a shock ending. While there are tons of alternate endings. It didn't help the film much. Overall Unfortunately the plotting and scripting is quite weak. The pacing a bit too long. The concept is interesting but the execution leaves much to be desired. Still it's worth watching at least once. Monkey see monkey do.".

Also the POV by the monkey was annoying and overused and there's a REAL embarrassing sex scene between Beghe and McNeil. Still I do like this movie.As I said it's too long but I was never really bored. Beghe is excellent in a very difficult role Pankow nicely underplays the scientist and McNeil is fresh and appealing.

Nope you ain't gonna see ungodly amounts of screen blood ooze out of all kinds of twisted sick mangled body parts either.  If you are looking for sheer violence of the gory kind  look elsewhere.  This Romero film is a thoughtful intelligent suspenseful film that spends a lot of its time developing the personalities of its characters as well as the climax of the film. A young man studying to be a lawyer is paralyzed after hit by a truck. He loses his beautiful girlfriend to his surgeon his mother stays with him and hires an obnoxious nurse with a budgie and his whole life is upsidedown as he must depend on others or machines for everything.  A friend from an experimentation lab donates a monkey to him that will help care for him.  The monkey initially brings back his zeal for life but soon strange things start to happen....almost a telepathic link of kinds is established between the small capuchin monkey and the wheelchairbound man. The film builds events very slowly and with a lot of talk.  I thought this helped the film as the writing is crisp and the acting more than adequate. The star of the film...the small monkey is a talented little thespian.  As strange as this sounds...she with the aid of Romero's direction... actually is able to create some sort of pathos.  The scenes where she listens to the tape and hugs her owner are powerful as are the ones where she uses her face to express her emotions.  Jason Beghe also does a credible job in his difficult role.  The other actors are fine.  Maryanne HodgesMrs. George Romero does an outstanding job as the uncaring nurse.  Stephen Root of News Radio also has an intriguing role in a plot strand that is left for dead in the end.  Although the film is fine in many respects it has some problems. Most of these problems arise from the script.  Some plot elements are never really explained fully.  Some plot strands are abandoned.  And some characters are overdrawn in terms of stereotypical behaviour.  Romero once again tackles a difficult task and does a very credible job overall.  The thing I found most unique about the film was his choice of music for the film.  It just seemed inappropriate somehow.  The only music that really worked was the the music that Ellathe monkey  heard as she embraced her owner.  That was a fine choice.".

His friend though decides to give him a monkey he is experimenting on to help his friend out. Unfortunately this monkey begins to form some sort of link between itself and the disabled man and performs some of the man's dark thoughts. The monkey kills off the bird of the caretaker as this bird actually attacks the man the monkey also goes after his former lover and the guy she had an affair on. This guy is actually the one who performed the surgery on the guy. The caretaker moves out after her bird is killed so the guys mom moves in to take care of her son and treat him like a child. You can really sympathize with the guy as his frustration mounts as it seems people are discouraging him from ever moving again even though there is a slim possibility he can regain his former abilities. This movie also shows how even though someone may be disabled and in need of assistance that they shouldn't be treated like a child. All in all an OK flick with a rather good ending.".

His friend though decides to give him a monkey he is experimenting on to help his friend out. Unfortunately this monkey begins to form some sort of link between itself and the disabled man and performs some of the man's dark thoughts. The monkey kills off the bird of the caretaker as this bird actually attacks the man the monkey also goes after his former lover and the guy she had an affair on. This guy is actually the one who performed the surgery on the guy. The caretaker moves out after her bird is killed so the guys mom moves in to take care of her son and treat him like a child.

The genres he works in 99 of the time are in the horror genre or some bird of it be it with zombies in his 'Dead' films or more psychological with Martin and the Dark Half. Here he brings us the tale of a once prime athlete confined to a wheelchair and the plucky little monkey who is trained to help him around the house and act as his companion as well as hands and feet. But of course things don't turn out right with what this 'experiment' comes forth. It's like one of those stories you find in those cheap paperback books at the grocery store only stripped down to bare essentials and given some adrenaline from its filmmaker.This is a peculiar film to see which offers brilliance as well as dullness and just plain oddness. Some things about the story make less sense than others as well as will happen when science becomes important to the story as opposed to more of a MacGuffin. The lead actor Jason Beghe is good in the role but isn't nearly as convincing in being the after effect of the 'medicine' he's given as does the Monkey as he is in being the earnest nice side of the character. There is even one great supporting performance in cold hardpressed form from Christine Forrest wife and bit player in the films of Romero. It's not meant to be taken very seriously to be sure but Romero on the one hand has a kind of sweet in the ironic sense interesting story with just the monkey and her master as the injections start to take its toll on the both of them. On the other hand he still has to work in this framework of building up more and more terror with a kind of onefoot deathmachine or something.It's worth a look especially for just the craft of the film but it's definitely not one of Romero's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "While this will likely never be considered one of filmmaker George Romero's best it still represents a commendable effort in one of his rare forays into studio productions in this case Orion. Scripted by Romero based on a novel by Michael Stewart it tells the story of Allan Mann handsome Jason Beghe a law student who gets into a horrible accident that renders him a quadriplegic. He soon becomes despondent enough to attempt suicide but soon he receives some temporary salvation in the form of Ella Boo a capuchin monkey who is trained to see to his needs. What he doesn't know is that his friend Geoffrey John Pankow has been playing mad scientist and injecting the cute lil' thing with human brain cells. Soon the bond between patient and helper becomes so strong that a mental connection is made and Ella is physically acting out Allan's worst impulses. So what is he going to do about this little homicidal primate? Romero does a good job here at telling a fairly interesting story although some viewers might be turned off at the lack of sympathetic characters. Most of them are flawed to some degree or another  creepy dean Burbage Stephen Root smarmy incompetent doctor Wiseman Stanley Tucci fairweather girlfriend Linda Janine Turner bitchy nurse Maryanne Christine Forrest a.k.a. Mrs. Romero  and even a guy like Geoffrey who initially just wants to help has his problems as he's obsessed with his work. At least Allan has an appealing love interest played by Kate McNeil whom horror fans will recognize as the lead in the slasher The House on Sorority Row. The cast is pretty good overall Joyce Van Patten plays the stereotypically smothering mother to good effect and it's a treat to see character actors Root and Tucci near the beginnings of their careers but the one performer the audience is likely to remember is Boo who's adorable and very well trained the animal action is first rate throughout there's also a rather annoying bird on hand. The evolving relationship between Allan and Ella makes for a compelling hook and it makes one appreciate the reallife efforts that people put into training service animals and the animals themselves. The film is light on horror  most of the violence is implied  as Romero tends to go for a more psychological approach and refrains from going for the gore. Overall this is a decent flick worth a look for genre fans who are interested in checking out Romero's nonzombie films. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "You meet the girl of your dreams and with the feeling being mutual decide to fast track the romance into marriage. It's one of the big decisions in life and so you engage some help from your pals who happen to be some of the most disorganized bunch ever unintentionally lining up what would be one of life's most memorable events with a series of mishaps and accidents that are just waiting to happen from run ins with drug dealers abuse of drugs and drink and an animal featured somewhere as well. No this is not The Hangover films although at first glance A Few Best Men may seem to tread on similar territory.Unlike the American films that focus on extreme shenanigans A Few Best Men may deal with similar wedding blues in comedic fashion but was rather a bit more restrained in its grossness although toilet humour is something staple that is never too far away and utilized when there's a need to for maximum effect. This Australian production follows a more British route with witty repartee and quirky zany characters peppering the landscape with probably the only sane people in the entire film being the groom David Xavier Samuel and his bride Mia Laura Brent.The titular characters refer to David's best mates Tom Kris Marshall who's usually the catalyst of problems with his indifferent attitude Graham Kevin Bishop the somewhat dim witted follower and Luke Tim Draxi who still can't get over the break up with his ex. Together they lend support to David as his best men for his wedding making that round the world trip from England to Australia. Mia on the other hand comes from a political family with a senator for a dad in Jim Jonathan Biggins whose more than proud to turn his daughter's wedding into political gain wife Barbara Olivia NewtonJohn probably the largest name in this ensemble and sister Daphne Rebel Wilson last seen in What To Expect When You're Expecting. With worlds so different colliding together sparks fly in similar slowly but surely fashion to Meet the Fockers with a scene being somewhat of a lift off The Hangover when the stag's night out turned into one big blur.A Few Best Men sees the long awaited return by director Stephan Elliott who did the acclaimed Priscilla Queen of the Desert. And I have to admit unabashedly that I'm somewhat of a fan of writer Dean Craig's work after what he did with Death at a Funeral dealing with something similar with family and friends' shenanigans standing out during life's ceremonies and in a way this film seemed like a spiritual companion to his earlier work for the way it encompassed rip tickling moments over one of life's major rituals. It's basically Murphy's Law put on display here with everything that can go wrong actually do go wrong with a couple of surprise some may argue convenient twists thrown in for good measure.The soundtrack is also noteworthy in the film consisting of mostly evergreens and oldies from the 60s and 70s and having Olivia NewtonJohn lend her vocals as well. In fact her character becomes what would be the live wire of the film as it wore on together with Kris Marshall and Kevin Bishop drawing the loudest of laughs thanks to their subplot involving their quest for weed from which everything got intricately tied to no thanks to their being stuck with contraband drugs and being quite inept in helping the groom settle and solve the mess they got everyone into.If one is game for ensemble films and buddy type ones where the inevitably lessons extracted will be themes on brotherhood friendship and family with lots of laughs thrown in from good measure then A Few Best Men would be your choice this week during the summer season breather in between blockbusters hitting the cinemas. Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Colourful British wit makes light of black Aussie humour";
	schema:reviewBody "On a tropical holiday David Xavier Samuel meets an Australian girl named Mia Laura Brent and they quickly fall in love. At a surprise party back home in the UK David tells his three mates that he and Mia are getting married in Australia. The lads are unhappy about this because they don't want to lose him and also because they'll have to fly over there. They're an odd bunch. Tom Kris Marshall doesn't want to grow up. Graham Kevin Bishop is always pushed around by the other lads and Luke Tim Draxl is miserable trying to win his exgirlfriend back. The men arrive in Australia and are at the mercy of Mia's strict father Jim Jonathan Biggins and his wife Barbara Olivia NewtownJohn. Jim is a wealthy senator looking to impress his contacts with the lavish wedding but is frequently at odds with his other daughter Daphne Rebel Wilson who may or may not be a lesbian. The lads find themselves in trouble when they try purchasing some marijuana from a drug dealer with emotional problems and also when they have a crazy night together the day before the wedding. They wake up to find they've been tormenting Jim's prized campaign sheep. Colourful British wit makes light of black Aussie humour burying memories of awful local comedies from the early millennium. The film is an AustralianUK coproduction. It was directed by an Australian Stephan Elliott but written by Dean Craig the same Brit who penned Death at a Funeral 2007. That was another film I greatly enjoyed and this is a similar mixture of genres. It combines fish out of water with comedic farce along with setups from countless other films. It is impossible not to recall the likes of Death at a Funeral and even The Hangover 2009. Yet the essential ingredients for a great movie on its own rights have not been forgotten. This is the funniest Australian film I have seen in years. What's important here is how the comedy is played out. The lads here are fools and regularly make a meal out of everything they touch. Yet you can't bring yourself to hate them because we understand they're out of their depth in a foreign environment both geographically and classwise too. And this might just be my own jet black sense of humour talking but there is something immensely appealing to watch and listen to with selfdepreciative humour. The lads in this movie are gifted comedians. They know how to keep a straight face as they poke fun of themselves their social problems and eccentricities. I enjoyed the film enormously for this reason the lack of winking but also the variety of comedy too. On top of the rapid quips between the men and their jabs at each other there are some delicious sight gags too. The film never makes a huge point of them so look sharply for a picture of the Queen wearing Joker makeup or the face of an airline passenger after Graham tries to defend his Hitler moustache. I enjoy comedy when it speaks for itself and lets us read the jokes without any help. By far my favourite scene is I think when Graham has to give an unprepared best man speech and is so high that he spends the whole time talking about something indescribable.The silences of the guests and the way the camera scans the reaction of their faces is just hysterical. Screenwriter Dean Craig employs a lot of the same farcelike comedy from Death at a Funeral with people behind doors o r moving in and out of rooms secretively. The material is reused cleverly because director Elliott gives us a complete overview of the impending chaos. Take the scene where the boys are trying to attend to the sheep they've tormented. The camera cuts to the corridor outside the room providing vision of who is about to walk in on them. Just like the wedding speech scene they know how to really build the tension and extend the jokes. The comedy works because there's a lot at stake. Just when you think a giant ball crushing the wedding is the craziest the film can become you're wrong it continues to reach new levels of insanity. For as well constructed as a lot of the film is some of the editing is noticeably choppy. Snippets of scenes sometimes feel out of place or interrupt confrontations and could have been removed altogether. This is a small complaint that most people won't notice and its mostly in the first half too. For all of this film's lunacy and there's a lot the tension comes from characters that have resemblance of actual feelings. David is a sympathetic lead because he's torn between his mates his only real family we learn and a far more prestige life that he is trying to adapt to. I particularly liked it when he and Mia started questioning how little they know about each other. It's a sensible turning point. The lovable lads are very distinctive and funny with their sets of problems but they share some of the laughs with the women too. I particularly liked Olivia NewtonJohn as the mother with a wild side. This gem of a film was absolutely delightful and I sincerely hope its quality is indicative of all Australian films this year.".

	schema:headline " Excellent performance make familiar material seem fresh";
	schema:reviewBody "A Few Best Men meets my first and primary criterion for a comedy film that it offers many laughs. Comedy takes many forms and not every joke is right for every audience. Some will doubtlessly find the scatological humor offensive. However the film offers a wide range of humor from burlesque physical comedy to comic irony. The filmmakers employ a range of comic techniques including running gags 123 punches pratfalls sarcasm sight gags etc. Much of the film is familiar. It doesn't break much new ground that hasn't been explored in similar films such as I Love You Man Wedding Crashers The Wedding Ringer and other comedies. But the cast approach their roles with such vitality that the material seems fresh. There are numerous similarities to The Hangover and its sequels. We don't actually witness the bachelor party. A tight group of four friends is threatened by the marriage of one. One of the best men is a sybaritic mischiefmaker who introduces drugs into the equation. The protagonist and his three sidekicks must repair the damage they caused without the bride or future inlaws becoming the wiser. There are complications with criminal elements and identical bags are switched. But the cast and filmmakers manage to make the material seem fresh. As long as the laughs keep rolling one doesn't stop to analyze similarities to other films. While the humor is raucous ribald and uninhibited it also seemed more restrained particularly compared to the Hangover films. Some scenes felt as if they could have been pushed much further. The initial encounter with the drug dealer became weird but could have been much weirder. A large rolling object creates havoc but much of it is offstage and it only rolls once. We see some bare male backsides but no other nudity and only one outfit is destroyed although it is subjected to multiple humiliations. It would have been nice to see outtakes during the credits. Production values were more than adequate. Performances were solid with particular kudos to Kris Marshall. It would be easy to dismiss the film as derivative but whatever it lacks in originality is more than compensated for by the energy of its performers.".

Lighten up people aren't we allowed to make comedies in Australia... The cast held themselves together very well and the ride was a enjoyable one from start to finish. It does remind me of 'The Hangover' the derivative element from those types of films are apparent. But that's not a bad thing as the comedy works for this era so why not? Great to see Olivia Newton John back on the big screen again I'm a huge Grease fan so I guess I'm being biased  Xavier Samuel was fantastic as well. Kris Marshall is awesome his performance was the best of the lot hands down. We all have our favourites sorry guys!".

It does remind me of 'The Hangover' the derivative element from those types of films are apparent. But that's not a bad thing as the comedy works for this era so why not? Great to see Olivia Newton John back on the big screen again I'm a huge Grease fan so I guess I'm being biased  Xavier Samuel was fantastic as well. Kris Marshall is awesome his performance was the best of the lot hands down. We all have our favourites sorry guys!";

Old world England meets New world excolony Australia and working class meets the very rich and powerful. If that alone is not enough to cause some consternation we simply add to the mix by having the boys get into circumstances that albeit might have been in their control at first quickly get out of control.To the one reviewer that was upset because there was a sheep being violated in the movie get a grip it's a movie I'm PRETTY sure that the actor did NOT truly have his arm up some sheep's behind and they didn't really feed the sheep any laxatives.What makes this movie funny and crazy at the same time is that you can actually think that the various fixes to the problems the boys are coming up with are bona fide and you sit there watching it thinking that it's not such a crazy idea. i.e. lowering a sheep out of a 2nd story window with a harness of bedsheets so the guests at the front of the house don't get a chance to see it.All in all the movie didn't get me laughing so hard that tears were flowing but it did make me chuckle aloud more than a few times and I did truly feel sorry for poor David who was just trying to get through his wedding day unscathed.Other than telegraphing a few of the punchlines I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a few laughs.On a final note I personally did not see anything in this movie that could be considered racist in any way shape or form.

The friends are livid and try and talk their best friend out of making the worst mistake of his life until David informs them all that they can go to the wedding. Now only one thing needs to be decided who is going to be the Best Man? Taking off for Australia to meet up with his Bridetobe David is told to travel with Mia while his friends take a detour to see a preplanned contact who lives out in the middle of nowhere for some marijuana.Now Tom has a problem a series of problems actually of getting into trouble back in the UK and Australia is no different than back home except Australia is a much bigger place. An attractive Bride's mother in the house makes Tom's blood burn with desire while his attempts at purchasing narcotics brings the wedding celebrations well into question Will David marry Mia? Will Mia marry David? And more to the point where did Mia's Father's prize Sheep Ramsey disappear to?A Few Best Men is a very funny and vibrant film. At the same time it is a comedy with a difference that could be placed as a Breath of Fresh Air by anyone and everyone watching it. The whole cast is a misfit group that would never be seen anywhere in the world not even Manchester who all keep things together in a tight ship operation. David Xavier Samuel who plays the responsible guy has the power to keep everyone on the straight and narrow to pull in the sails once in a while so that the other three best friends have a guideline of sorts. But what happens when David is without a guideline? His friends become separated in Mind Body and Soul  therefore the actions the results and repercussions of these misfits surfaces like a fart in the depths of the ocean wanting to find freedom of the open air.Tom Kris Marshall becomes the Stiffler and Finch of the English kind drug fuelled drunken monkey boy wacked out necessity to any mishap misshaped misinterpreted and misguided movie the world over  and then some. His ability to mess things up in the UK are duly noted but to mess them up in Australia and especially on David's best day of his life he knows only too well that there would be no such forgiveness given.Our decision to give A Few Best Men an 8.9 tells the viewer one thing and that is we were very surprised But not really with Kris' part in this film especially as the developed soul he acquired for acting while in My Family seemed to boost him quite a lot. And for him to be acting alongside one of Australia's hottest actresses in history of musicals  Sultry Olivia Newton John  I bet even Finch would be writhing with jealousy.If you are out at the cinema and you're looking for a good solid and funny movie then this is the one for you. It is a truly crafted piece of work with plenty of the various helpings for everyone which will make you're night and why not? The film is from Director of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and the Writer and Producers of Death At A Funeral UK Version so you can be rest assured that there will be laughs there will be tears and there will be a little tongueincheek controversy  after all it does have a Sheep in it that has its name on the end credits. Enjoy. Review by The DVD Archive.".

So orphan David goes to his wedding at Mia's enormous house in the Blue Mountains Laura's Dad is a Senator accompanied by his three best friends and family substitutes Tom Kris Marshall a glib superconfident chancer Graham Kevin Bishop awkward graceless and socially inept and Luke Tim Draxl raw and bordering on suicidal from a recent romantic breakup. All would probably have been well had Tom not taken a small detour to buy some weed and had Graham not accidentally acquired the dealer's stock of cocaine...The small amount of advance word here was not good and I found the early parts of the film irritating and filled with Well he just wouldn't do that stuff  why does David walk in the pouring rain from Trafalgar Square to St Paul's at least half an hour carrying his Polynesian carving on his way home? Why didn't he just get a bus nearer to where he lived? He wouldn't walk in through his front door with dog mess still on the sole of his sandal he'd scrape it off outside. He wouldn't throw his wet shirt over there etc. etc. And the characters were annoyingly clichd  could anyone be as stupid as Graham? And Luke's maudlin whingeing about his exgirlfriend left no room for any other characterisation at all. Then factor in the idiotic detour to buy drugs which I couldn't envision anyone doing on the eve of their best friend's wedding and I'm a third of the way through the movie having chuckled a few times but with any amusement far outweighed by irritation. Next we meet a comedy drug dealer and Mia's dad Jim a clich bullying Dad who regards the wedding as more important for its networking opportunities than for what it means for his daughter and I'm even more annoyed to be fair there has been a moderate amount of laughter from the audience most of whom were much younger than me.But at this point we also meet Rebel Wilson as Mia's sister Daphne and Olivia Newton and John as mum Barbara and things begin to look up. The wedding morning consequences of the stag night shenanigans are genuinely amusing and I'm starting to warm to the film. In true farce manner actions have consequences and those consequences have further consequences and things start to unravel. Graham ends up in the position of having to give the best man's speech a role to which he is spectacularly unsuited and this sequence left me helpless with laughter as he reels from one faux pas to another each one being worse than the one which preceded it. From here to the end the film lurched through a series of disasters some physical some situational some characterbased most of them tasteless and nearly all of them very funny indeed.Rebel Wilson is naturally very funny and it was a delight to see Olivia Newton and John ageing most attractively joyfully attacking areas which Grease's Sandy even in black leather would have been far too prim to address.After an unconvincing opening this film made me laugh out loud more than any movie I can remember for a long time and that is what I take away with me.".

Why didn't he just get a bus nearer to where he lived? He wouldn't walk in through his front door with dog mess still on the sole of his sandal he'd scrape it off outside. He wouldn't throw his wet shirt over there etc. etc. And the characters were annoyingly clichd  could anyone be as stupid as Graham? And Luke's maudlin whingeing about his exgirlfriend left no room for any other characterisation at all. Then factor in the idiotic detour to buy drugs which I couldn't envision anyone doing on the eve of their best friend's wedding and I'm a third of the way through the movie having chuckled a few times but with any amusement far outweighed by irritation. Next we meet a comedy drug dealer and Mia's dad Jim a clich bullying Dad who regards the wedding as more important for its networking opportunities than for what it means for his daughter and I'm even more annoyed to be fair there has been a moderate amount of laughter from the audience most of whom were much younger than me.But at this point we also meet Rebel Wilson as Mia's sister Daphne and Olivia Newton and John as mum Barbara and things begin to look up. The wedding morning consequences of the stag night shenanigans are genuinely amusing and I'm starting to warm to the film. In true farce manner actions have consequences and those consequences have further consequences and things start to unravel. Graham ends up in the position of having to give the best man's speech a role to which he is spectacularly unsuited and this sequence left me helpless with laughter as he reels from one faux pas to another each one being worse than the one which preceded it. From here to the end the film lurched through a series of disasters some physical some situational some characterbased most of them tasteless and nearly all of them very funny indeed.Rebel Wilson is naturally very funny and it was a delight to see Olivia Newton and John ageing most attractively joyfully attacking areas which Grease's Sandy even in black leather would have been far too prim to address.After an unconvincing opening this film made me laugh out loud more than any movie I can remember for a long time and that is what I take away with me.";

As a whole it doesn't come close to other movies of its kind in terms of cast and plot but with its laugh out loud moments it can rival any or most Hollywood comedies and I assure you Hollywood directors could learn a thing of two from this bunch.Its greatest strength is not in its characters not in the cast either but in the cinematography and screenplay. Shot in Australia it does well to capture major beautiful scenery and has good shot sequences.There are standout and believable moments for most of its characters and their actors though most notably Xavier Samuel. This is the only other media I've seen him in outside of the Twilight eclipse and he does a decent performance as the groom. Laura Brent was also beautiful and captivating as the bride. Look out for the best man's speech that makes good work of some intertwined BritishAussie humour delivered in a hilarious fashion it will basically crack your ribs.It showed promise got flat at the middle and got downright hilarious in the third quarter. I'd recommend it for anyone who is a fan of dirty but plain laugh out loud comedy.".

	schema:headline " Misfire from a great filmmaker";
	schema:reviewBody "I have long admired the work of Kon Ichikawa and even got to interview him in New York in the '80s. But his foray into puppet movies with TOPO GIGIO is an embarrassing waste of talent.The popular Italian mouse character is a '60s equivalent to more recent critters like the Teletubbies either you like him and think he's 'cute' or its nausea time. Starring in a featurelength film he wears out his welcome in a hurry.Ever the artist and craftsman Kon is careful to use interesting lighting and color control in depicting the mouse's nonadventures. Human beings are stylized by largely being shot so we only see their shoes and pastelcolored socks with a nearly film noir emphasis on lowkey lighting throughout.The minimal plot line concerning a bank robbery James Bondstyle bomb and Cold War era missile espionage takes a back seat to supposedly cuddly hamming by the diminutive star. Watching him take a shower or create a new kind of icky sexiness wearing supposedly provocative costumes was more than offputting to me.

	onyx:emotionText "I have long admired the work of Kon Ichikawa and even got to interview him in New York in the '80s. But his foray into puppet movies with TOPO GIGIO is an embarrassing waste of talent.The popular Italian mouse character is a '60s equivalent to more recent critters like the Teletubbies either you like him and think he's 'cute' or its nausea time. Starring in a featurelength film he wears out his welcome in a hurry.Ever the artist and craftsman Kon is careful to use interesting lighting and color control in depicting the mouse's nonadventures. Human beings are stylized by largely being shot so we only see their shoes and pastelcolored socks with a nearly film noir emphasis on lowkey lighting throughout.The minimal plot line concerning a bank robbery James Bondstyle bomb and Cold War era missile espionage takes a back seat to supposedly cuddly hamming by the diminutive star. Watching him take a shower or create a new kind of icky sexiness wearing supposedly provocative costumes was more than offputting to me.

Hence in the years ahead this movie will be mentioned often for its contemporary style modern cinema language and creative editing.Centering on a criminal nicknamed as Moth the story is taken from a novel and is adapted to screenplay from its own novelist. Director Javor Gardev features Moth being a selfrespecting and chivalrous Bulgarian reflecting the character of his country under Communism. As such from the literary perspective personification has applied to Bulgaria. Despite all of his relatives and friends leaving him alone and his wife wounding his pride he has never held his head down.Not only the past of his country the writer also reflects the present and the future of Bulgaria within the same literary perspective in a dark utopia or a neonoirfilmnoir. The screenplay of Zift is very focused and detailoriented on a simple storyline. The concept of the whole storyline is the sum of Moth's escape to freedom his shortterm memories the stories he heard from his friends how he is losing his last hope and how he dies. There we can realize obviously that the main purpose of the movie is not to tell but is to impress. Director Gardev leaked impacts from Fellini's Emir Kusturica's and Danny Boyle's cinematic methods. On the other hand I don't include Frank Miller in this list since Sin City and Zift has nothing in common but the cinematography. On the level of artistic value Zift has more value than its comparisons.Even though it's resembling several industrial boxoffice hits the screenplay is truly original considering that a novel writer has prepared the whole script from his own adaptation you will see the total commitment of creating this epic by the production crew. There are scenes of violence nudity sexuality perversity immorality and enormity. Viewer discretion is strongly advised. It's only suitable for mature viewers and minor groups.".

Wonderful so very wonderful I don't know if it can revive Bulgarian cinema I think it's too far gone already but I'll be definitely following Javor Gardev's career from this point on. The man shows promise as a director who thinks outside the box. Compared to that meatwagon of stale films that get made here from time to time Zift is revolutionary in it's visual style narrative and plot.Opening with a reference to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction Zift is the story of a man nicknamed Moth no real name is ever mentioned. Right now Moth is a prisoner and it's the 1960s which in Bulgaria meant hardcore Communist regime Moth was in prison before that regime came to power but that's beside the point for now. What matters is that he's getting released today and he's all to keen in getting as far away as possible but not before paying last respect to some prison guard he didn't really like. Result Moth gets punched knocked down guards throw him out of the prison then a car with some military officer comes along and they take Moth to some crummy place and they start torturing him. Apparently they are looking for some diamond... and it's going to be one hell of a long day for Moth and that's all I'm going to say about the story.From the start Zift tells you how this is going to play out I don't mean that it's predictable or anything what I'm talking about is style. The dialogue the characters the film has a quirky pitch black sense of humor like the zift Moth likes chewing it's not something that can appeal to everyone and it might seem vulgar or profane or whatever but it has it's lyrical value it just adds up. Every story told by a character however humorous or shallow it might seem has it's own kind of wisdom to it though not necessarily connected to the storyline. The film feels both distinctly western and distinctly Bulgarian or Balkan to be more general because it uses a storyline similar to that of the American Pulp novels Zift itself is an adaptation of a pulp novel film noirs and then the character stereotypes femme fatales anti hero protagonist and all these elements get mixed together with Bulgarian culture and stereotypes resulting in what I dare say a quite original and refreshing piece of cinematic wonder.Visually speaking Zift is all high contrast black and white goodness a tasty treat for anyone who values the classic two color scheme. Essential for it's narrative structure is a series of flashbacks explaining character relationships and background stories and depending on the flashback a 1930s something maybe 1940s or modern time in the film's time frame 1960s we get a scene shot on different film. So for example the 1960s part of the film is shot on 35mm while the earliest on 8mm thus giving Zift a substantially different look for each time segment. I have to mention something about the acting and while I liked Zahary Bahalov as Moth he played him with a lot of bravado my hat goes down to the supporting cast including the great Djoko Rosic as a priest who consoles Moth and a whole lot of other actors who gave the film a strong energy boost.And while it does have its own share of flawsthe ending felt rushed and it might seems as if it's going nowhere and some scenes might seem pointless to the overall plot Zift is nevertheless high quality entertainment an example in genre filmmaking stylish and sharpedged. The least to say about Javor Gardev's debut is that it's an opening to a promising career.".

I don't know what it has to do with the story but it was funny. There were a lot of funny stories throughout the film.The film moves from there to a prison where Moth Zahary Baharov is about to be released after serving time for a crime he did not commit. He enters a world he doesn't know as the Communists are now in power.The film is brilliant in a sharp black and white which is perfect as it is neonoir. At the same time it is a Socialist Art Sots Art film which parodies the Soviet Realism with reverential depictions of workers peasants living happily in their communes. The shower scene in the prison was particularly funny.It was confusing when he is released from prison and ends up in another one immediately but in flashbacks we see Moth with his wife Ada Tanya Ilieva and partnerincrime Slug Vladimir Penev who is now an official in the new prison and is looking for a diamond they stole years earlier.He escapes but not before he is poisoned. He manages to find Ada before he is to die. Things get a little surreal and weird from here but they go after the diamond. What happens next was satisfying and sad.There were other great performances Mihail Mutafov as Van Wurstthe Eye and Djoko Rosic as the priest.".

I don't know what it has to do with the story but it was funny. There were a lot of funny stories throughout the film.The film moves from there to a prison where Moth Zahary Baharov is about to be released after serving time for a crime he did not commit. He enters a world he doesn't know as the Communists are now in power.The film is brilliant in a sharp black and white which is perfect as it is neonoir. At the same time it is a Socialist Art Sots Art film which parodies the Soviet Realism with reverential depictions of workers peasants living happily in their communes. The shower scene in the prison was particularly funny.It was confusing when he is released from prison and ends up in another one immediately but in flashbacks we see Moth with his wife Ada Tanya Ilieva and partnerincrime Slug Vladimir Penev who is now an official in the new prison and is looking for a diamond they stole years earlier.He escapes but not before he is poisoned. He manages to find Ada before he is to die. Things get a little surreal and weird from here but they go after the diamond. What happens next was satisfying and sad.There were other great performances Mihail Mutafov as Van Wurstthe Eye and Djoko Rosic as the priest.";

All the films I have seen until this point were very disappointing and could only be compared between themselves because films outside Bulgaria had always stood above in terms of cinematography actingDirection Budget etc. Of course many would say this is not true films during socialism period were many more and much better in terms of quality. While this is true that certainly does not make them foreign standard. The acting is more like theatrical than cinematic and the picture quality has more white spots on it than mount Everest not to even mention the Sound. Cinema after 1990s had not improved much. I do not remember when I heard about Zift I think I found it on IMDb so I decided to check out the Trailer. I was blown away for the first time in my life I was so excited about seeing a Bulgarian film. Yes It did took me a while since I live in the UK but I did saw it yesterday.After seeing it I felt depressed and had mixed feelings about it.I am going to analyse the film in positives and negatives. Positives  First Bulgarian neonoir film  First Bulgarian film successfully presents the Thriller and Action elements in genre.  Very Good acting especially from the Zahary Baharov and Djoko Rosic  First Bulgarian film to use cgi I know this could be a negative but in this case it is used very well.  Monologue is absolutely outstanding in some parts.  Unlike most recent Bulgarian films this one is not set around just one location.  For its small Budget a very good recreation of 1960s Sofia.  Awesome Soundtrack  Good Humor in places. Negatives  Too short 85 minutes felt too short to fully achieve its potential.  Many unnecessary scenes involving downgrade humanity and dialogue which focus on 'toilet humour'  Too much nudity this is something which all Bulgarian films suffer from but this one takes it on another level.This may not be a negative to all but I generally do not like too much nudity I believe there is different films for that purpose.Overall I believe the positives overcome the negatives and In conclusion I must say I liked Zift even though by no means its a masterpiece. It is very likely to be enjoyed by people who are fans of films like Trainspotting Irreversible Requiem for a Dream The Cook the Thief His Wife  Her Lover and Tarantino's work.".

The translation is most enjoyable and I regret that the translation team or translator working on this is not mentioned in the credits for they deserve much praise! The plays on words and the depth of the dialogs have been kept in their entirety. There are two things that strike me about this film. The Shakespearean dimension of it comes first. Full of primary symbolism Zift is a tragedy which takes place on one single night. At the same time it is a tragedy replete with irony with deep satire. It carries something undefinable that does not drive you to tears but on the contrary brings a smile to your face. The gravediggers the shots of bodily waste the farting the poisons and RomeoandJuliettesque plot transformed into a tragical farce of betrayal via the insect imagery are elements that any student of AngloSaxon literature can easily recognize. The film contains countless numbers of weirdos as if the dregs of all humankind have been gathered there to show ugliness in all its sublime beauty. This is in fact part of what impressed me on the second place  the sheer beauty of the photography. It is not black and white out of mere empty claims to artistry. It is black and white because it has been purged of everything that is superfluous. Black and white are highly contrasted the gray is present minimally. On the whole a very beautiful very intelligent film. Very wellwritten ably directed and shot. A film that deserves attention.".

It couldn't be otherwise because prior to the premiere there was such a big media invasion on all the TV and radio stations and Javor Gardev was flowing from water and gas pipes telling us how f.cking great this movie is. So I went and paid 5 euro for the ticket this is about 120th of the minimal month salary here. Then I entered the cold and ugly almost socialistic dirty theater and tuned myself for watching a masterpiece. Then I was blown away. But not with something great. Literally the first words shows how poor in soul the scriptwriter and the director were. It starts with showing feces stupidity foul language genitals and unusual sex scenes like some Bmovie from the 80's. The script is inevitably bad even for a post soc Bulgarian movie with plot holes larger than black hole in the Universe and wooden and totally meaningless lines filled with pretentious philosophical stereotypes. All the time I was getting into the impression I was watching someone's training work. Well not really. There are so many snitches from well known movies and directors that I can't really count all of them. As if Gardev was getting into Tarantino's mind but without having all the money and was assembling a movie from the small pieces of all the movies he had been watching.Some of them include Main idea snatched from Crank the main character is poisoned and ought to die in one night so the whole action takes one nightScript snatched from Snatch the run for the black diamond and other ideas Slow motion and other moves from Trainspotting Scenes taken directly from Pulp Fiction the torture scene with Bruce Willis at the basement Scenes taken directly from Sin City for example when Bruce Willis falls on the board Script snatched from Revolver the main character ought to die in several hours so he starts giving a sht about everything Scenes snitched from the TV movie Statskiy Sovetnik The State Counsellor at httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0450158  the run in the women's bathroom and other scenes Then it becomes even funnier. There are two scenes snitched directly from soc classic series here in Bulgaria I am sure you have never heard of them but count on my words it was truly classic  Na vseki kilometar At each kilometer at httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0238439 I used to notice two entirely copied scenes  the chasing in the Perlova River's channel the tramway pioneer's sequence... All in all I must say that using a foul language coupled with totally unbelievable grotesque and inane characters does NOT a great movie made. Besides the actor's play was bad to mediocre with the only two noticeable exceptions  the main character Moth and Djoko Rossich who is well known cinema professional. This is something most new Bulgarian movies suffer with  no one of the good theatrical actors have any experience with cinema and I am constantly under impression I am watching TV version of the theatrical play. The lead female character was past all belief bad. Having really good actresses here I can't really explain why nonprofessional was ever cast. Her eroticism was nonexistent. Even the sex scene at the end was flat and empty. At the very predictable end I was empty. I know that the movie has to have some double or hidden meaning but the people in the audience doesn't seem to have caught it. BTW from about 50 people in the theater I was one of the dozen ones to watch the movie till the end. And that's saying something. This is soctrash movie with no value so I don't recommend anyone watching it.".

And damn it the trailer says it all  Pineapple peels and shts. That's the best thing in this movie. A banal screenplay incredibly bad acting phrases that make you wanna kick someone's head and again this damn postcommunist element. You know all the Bulgarian movies have it.So better go and watch some stupid lowbudget Hollywood movie instead of this crap. At least you could see some better acting and more than 2 colors. Yeah black  white is banal especially when it's used without a specific reason. It might be a really nice effect see Pi and it might annoy you so much that you just decide to leave the damn theater half an hour before the predictable end.Again about the acting. Yes it's bad. Yes most of the actors had never played before. And yes I can see that clearly.And hell yes I paid 2 for that crap but I wouldn't even give 2 stotinki around 1 cent to watch this wannabeagoodBulgarianmovie. Although some Bulgarian pseudopatriots this means almost all Bulgarians might like it.In the end the good thing. Congratulations to the director  very good and professional job!

We get worldwide applause and we amaze the already berserk Hollywood At least this is the info taken from our objective press excuse me!What the heck are we left with? We can steal the same movie at some torrent site and to at least know that we're not in for it financially from all this SHT! We steal we watch we swear and we delete the movie afterward. At least if we have the opinion of our own.The movie Zift is super pitiful... at my personal estimation! I don't give a sht about the competent jury about mass advertisement and box office records in Bulgaria's standards! The mere tries for the movie to look like Metallica's video clip doesn't save the production at all. It is just that every minute of this movie you're guessing what exactly movie you were watching the same thing in and you try to guess the title  We have good level of actor's play that's only positive thing WITH THE EXCEPTION of Tanya Ilieva who pushes lines with the power of expression of the green euglene in the nonfertile age. At least her tits are nice  Aaaa! And this Nosferatu from the Bulgarian Big Brother 4... Tzvetan! He shows as a mockery with mustache obviously made out of plastic tape.What we have at the end of the long run that the Modern Bulgarian Cinema is not Modern is not Bulgarian and is not cinema at all  Not to mention that chewing asphalt in the years when chewing gum Ideal was becoming cult is true perversion!I don't like this movie!".

The acting is really really bad terribly static so many empty faces no sign of feelings at all totally stunning. So is the camera not more than 2 points of view. The overshooting with bed scenes is completely embarrassing much full nudity to compensate the lack of scenario and good acting but even if someone feel the need to make a movie full with unnecessary naked scenes why not try to make them a little more erotic. This was the most sad erotic scenes not good even for an amateur porn. I lost hour and a half of my life just to feel sad ashamed and embarrassed. People who liked this movie are just pseudopatriots to me. I am a real patriot and I want to see a good movie once in 50 years than this crap and it is a real crap  the whole predictable story is about crap.

It is true that it gets close to western civilisation criteria for a good movie cause of all the violence brutality and barbarism but this is not who we Bulgarians are.I believe i read in another post that Bulgarian cinematography is dead since 20 years and well after watching this pile of crap i have to agree.".

The Black and White movie later transferred to the big screen by Vladislav Todorov was superbly directed by director Javor Gardev. The gut wrenching story develops in an isolated dank dark brutal Bulgarian Prison where our hero  Zift  Zahary Baharov otherwise known as 'The Moth' has just been granted early Parole. The movie depicts his early years which includes his school girlfriend Ada Tanya Ilieva and a shortlived life of crime. Falsley imprisoned for his part in a murderrobbery gone bad he insists he is innocent. Just when the audience begins to believe Moth only wants to leave the country and journey to the tropics they are introduced to 'Slug' Vladimir Penev a brutal sadistic partner who plans' on trailing Moth in a desperate search for a mysterious diamond said to have been stolen during the murderrobbery. The stark bloody black and white images along with the director's ability to scatter mayhem and death through the dark rainy streets of Bulgaria offers a realistic movie which is direct honest and as for this reviewer a magnificent Classic of the first magnitude. Superior acting. ".

The terrorist is a former government eraser that the government tried but failed to erase and he's taken the train and Seoul's mayor hostage to uhh well to apparently have the plan be doomed from the start. Equal parts SPEED TAKING OF PELHAM 123 MONEY TRAIN and DIE HARD the film has few pretensions which make it easy on the derriere. Poor Bae Doona gets one of the stranger film roles in film history as a pickpocket who apparently knows she must LOVE the hero even before she KNOWS the hero and creates all the necessary Korean histrionics along the way as well as almost bearing more physical brutality than the hero! while our glowering protagonist poses with a series of unlit cigarettes in his mouth and which only one person will ever be allowed to light care to guess who?. The SPEED and TAKING OF PELHAM allusions are apt as are slight nods to MONEY TRAIN the hero's boss does his best crazy Robert Blake impersonation and DIE HARD or UNDER SIEGE 2 if you'd rather since it's so blatantly namechecked on the U.S. package but overall it's a victim of it's own weak and often downright ridiculous logic and begs a few too many questions. The lovely Bae Doona plays one of the most strangely motivated characters I've ever seen in a motion picture. Production wise though it's delivers the goods with slick production values all the way with some nicely handled chase and fight scenes. Turns out if I read the docustuff on the Korean 2disc set correctly that the Korean subway trains don't even look as hitech as they do here and the ones in the film were almost entirely CG apart from the sets for closeups! Columbia TriStar's sleeve is highly reminiscent of the art for TRANSPORTER and not entirely unexpectedly substitutes a generic Asian face for that of star Kim Seokhoon. I give it a 4.".

What makes these foreign films better or more appealing than their American counterparts you ask?  Well first and foremost is the style. Our friends from the East have a knack for action sequences.  Check out the gunplay in films like Hard Boiled and Shiri and see their influences in the West with films like FaceOff and Heat.  So when the creators of Shiri reunited for a film about a cop on the trail of a madman who has taken over a speeding train my heart began to pump uncontrollably and pestered my local DVD supplier continually for updates as to the film's North American Release.  The film I am referring is Tube.  Directed by first timer Baek WoonHak and starring a multitude of hyphenated names that you wouldn't recognize the movie was about a former assassin for the government that takes over a subway train to persuade his former boss and now mortal enemy to sacrifice his life for the lives of the innocents on board.Putting a crink in the plans is a rogue cop who has been on the killers trail for many years and who too is looking for payback for the death of his wife and the loss of a finger in an abbreviated altercation that took place some time in the past.  As demands are made and peaceful solutions examined people are shot ambushes are ordered and rail cars are blown up.  Everything we would expect from a film of this genre.  It's too bad it doesn't work.While watching Tube I wondered if the Director and Producers were sitting around one weekend watching American action films and tried to copy what they thought were the best parts from each.  The premise is stripped from Under Siege 2 and if you ever copy a Steven Segal film you need your head checked the opening sequence rips of Heat an attempted rescue on the train was done better in Speed and even films like Apollo 13 and Stallone's Daylight look to have had their scenes stolen directly from the original screenplays.But stealing from big budget films wasn't the only once noticeable Americanization of the film.  Speeches are given when the characters should be acting or reacting to their situations and flashbacks are thrown in to stretch the running time.  The soundtrack was overwhelming as is Hans Zimmer was vacationing in Tokyo and had nothing better to do than provide a repeating beat that would bound out of my subwoofer every time we see the train speeding down the track.  Even the comic relief in the character of a thug that is handcuffed in one of the rail cars was straight from a Bruckheimer brainstorm.  Whoa's me!My excitement over the films release was quashed like a lake being thrown on a campfire.  Everything that made these foreign films unique and pulse pounding was lost to what I can only assume was an attempt to puncture a hole in the lucrative North American video market.  I could have cared less about the characters I felt no attachment to the emotional attachment between the various couples and if you are just going to throw mindless action at me well then I hate to say it but give me a Michael Bay film. At least then I know what to expect and don't feel robbed of an afternoon.www.gregsrants.com".

The tube was actually the first made but was delayed because of the Daegu also spelt Taegu subway disaster which killed over 300 people and closed the Daegu subway system for just over 8 Months.Wonderful days was an OK effort and Natural city didn't really make any sense and Bichumundu was in the style of crouching tiger hidden dragon and was very successful in the Chinese market.The tube or should I say THE TUBE is interesting combining over the top Hong Kong style action rather than over the top American style action the previous reviewer obviously had only seen American action films. The back story is too unbelievable to really grab the audience but once the story moves into the subway it carries itself off well. It could have used a better bad guy though but then most movies these days have bad guys who do bad things because they are bad guys..OK...they do bad things.The love story is very Korean crazy girl forcing himself on an over serious guy.But this is not really a good introduction to Korean cinema which is still trying to find its own international voice while attempting to make lots of money. Check out 2 cops memories of murder the classic and my wife is a gangster.Here is a warning one of the two main characters dies. This is not a spoiler it is a Korean movie and even the comedies have tragic endings and the dramas have tragic beginnings middles ends and lots of tragic side stories. I won't tell you who dies but don't forget your tissues.Oh and please watch the subtitled version the people during the American voices just can't read the subtext of a Korean movie though the person who voices Kay is the exception.".

It has its share of exciting action set pieces but for the most part the film lacks brain cells which isn't much of a surprise for action movies.

	schema:reviewBody "I love trains. I love movies with a special knack for Asian ones. So when I saw this Korean action piece mostly set on a subway train I couldn't resist to buy it 2.99 euro used in the video rental shop.Then I checked IMDb and it looked like most comments were quite negative so with some anticipated disappointment I put the DVD in the player and watched it for myself.I agree with many commenters that the plot lacks plausibility while providing more climaxes than needed after the middle I felt a bit exhausted like on a long subway ride and considered one could turn this into a TV miniseries cutting after each cliffhanger... But thinking more about it I'd like to add some points.First the political aspect. As is revealed later in the film the South Korean government is supposed to have had in the past a secret Rhodes Team doing unlawful dirty jobs. As briefly shown this led to international criticism up to the UN security council and to dirty disposal of the team and their families with only T surviving and using terrorist means to force a former minister to reveal those facts. The political thread continues with quasimilitary occupation of the subway control roomthe exminister ordering the destruction of the subway train and the subway police chief exclaiming The real criminals are the politicians and parliament members! Also the part where a passenger says he retrieved the data card from T's cellphone. I suspect that this part of the story made much more impact on Korean viewers than say in Europe or America.And then there is the unlikely love triangle between hero Chang his deceased fiance and the pickpocket heroine. No sex or sleaze at all but deep emotions are symbolized with little things  sweets cigarettes a lighter a special playing card... most memorably a can of Warsteiner beer on a stone bench  first with Chang and his fiance then Chang alone then the stalking heroine alone. And their final handshake sure had Titanic appeal...As you can see the subway action which wasn't bad just a bit too long got me less involved than these two aspects. A good short summary of the tragic romance is in the music video that came as extra on my DVD. All in all I find this a quite strong movie and enjoyed it  less as a train movie than an interesting and touching Korean story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Korean action film from the makers of Shiri.That should be an indication that the film doesn't make a whole heck of sense while amping it up on the action.The plot has a transit cop duking it out with a super villain who is after a memory chip with incriminating evidence on it the evidence is of government misdeeds not his own To that end the bad guy ends up taking a subway train hostage.Think Speed Money Train the taking of Pelham 123 and die hard rolled into one. Think not American so a couple of American movieisms don't play out.Did I like it? Yes and know. Unclear to a fault this is all about the macho battle between good and bad and the action that it breeds. The action is five star classic stuff. The sequences just build and build and build. Actually every sequence has the feel of the final battle between good and evil and thats the problem the movie ends probably 19 times before it actually ends. My dad and I were watching this together and we wanted to go get something to drink but were going to wait until the approaching end only to realize that we still had over 45 minutes left.Its good hell the action is great but the actions relentless amping up wears you down. In a weird way you feel as beaten up as our hero.I'm sure this would play better if the story made any real sense. As a narrative thread and I do mean thread its the sort of thing we've seen before. Unfortunately the devil is in the details and most if not all of the details are lacking or missing so much so that I was frequently wondering why and who and how. Characters aren't developed so much as thrust fully clichd upon the screen. Only the narrating love interest has any real depth to her and she disappears for sections of the film.Give it points for a couple of decidedly nonAmerican twistswhich I won't reveal since they are twists but ultimately the story is needlessly oblique which when coupled with the audience pounding action makes the film less than it should be.For action fans this is a must see for the rest an okay time killer.6.5 out of 10 the pieces being better than the messy whole.".

We then get an introduction to key characters before the main action gets under way. Things continue well as Jay gets aboard the train and escalate nicely till he ultimately confronts T. There are significant problems though most notably like the train it just won't stop. Just as things should be ending it emerges that the train is heading for a nuclear power station and even with T no longer aboard those on the train are still in grave danger along with anybody near the power station. It is as if the makers have decided to make a two hour movie but only have an hour and a half of material so needed to add something new turning an action movie into a disaster movie. For the most part though this is an exciting thriller with a decent if somewhat clich story. There are also some comedy moments these made me laugh although some may find them a bit out of place. The cast do a solid enough job with Seokhun Kim Doona Bae and Sangmin Park impressing as Jay Kay and T respectively. The special effects are somewhat mixed the explosions certainly looked like obvious CGI. Overall you could do a lot worse if you want an action movie but don't expect a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I never heard of this movie when I rented it and I had no idea which country it was from. Heh i didn't bother reading the DVD cover. I thought it was Japanese as it had that look but the writing was a little off. Regardless it's a South Korean actioner that stylistically had some nice moments but this film did not know when to quit.Basically two bad guys take over a train and hold the country ransom. A renegade detective who is has a past with the main bad guy must work with the police and the rail system to try and save the hostages. The Korean equivalent to 'Under Siege 2'! From the opening scene where the main villain somehow manages to thwart the entire police force unscathed this is a hard film to take seriously! Not only is it fairly confusing as to what character did what to the other in the past it has moments where you don't quite know what happened to the characters. Did some of the passengers of the train get killed during that huge shootout? Why didn't the hostages in the main carriage escape during the first big macho fight between protagonist and antagonist? Little things like that! Oh and then a subcharacter and his colleagues seem to take two thirds of the movie to react to that subcharacter's love interest being one of the hostages? Oh and the police force don't seem to acknowledge any loss of life when planning their next move. But the main problem I had with this film is that it was climax overkill. Every time our hero seemed to stop something bad from happening there was another introduction of a plot element that wasn't established. Trains almost colliding with each other and the pressure is on the technical staff! The hero manages to thwart the train's weight making a bridge collapse with it's obstacles then has to stop a bomb and fight a bad guy again with obstacles then the next plot point is introduced and the other heroes have to divert the train from hitting a nuclear plant ala obstacles. And then there is yet another climax after that. Like one reviewer noted all you needed was something to hold down the weight of the lever in regard to that one! I was getting really bored of this movie towards the end. Plus there a pointless scene where the hostages stand up to the bad guy and it could have been totally cut and it didn't furthur the plot at all. It was totally unnecessary cause it didn't add to the story thematically or provide anything to the plot! That pretty much sums up how 'Tube' keeps piling unnecessary climatic moments and it really overkills the climax factor basically because they forgot to introduce many of the main elements beforehand i.e. the rigged train to explode and subsequent numerous bombs! 'Tube' is not a very good movie! out of !".

	schema:reviewBody "In its core this is a pretty original actionflick from South Korea but the way the movie is brought to the screen is little original. It uses too elements from other well known action movies and does everything in a too formulaic way. which causes this movie to also be little surprising.Seems like Baek WoonHak watched a bit too many Hollywood action movies such as Heat Die Hard True Lies Speed and whatever more movie to which this movie shows just a bit too many similarities. Nothing wrong of course with anyone from Korea or anywhere else trying to imitate Hollywood action movies but when its not done in an original way and merely just copies sequences and moments from well known movies you simply just failed at trying to create anything interesting or original. Especially since this movie is just not as refined as an Hollywood action flick. The style is there but just not the right handling of it all. No matter how good the movie looks it all feels quite amateur like and childish too at the same time. This is also due to the simple musical score the composer listened to a bit too many Hans Zimmer scores and overdone camerawork. You know it's the Michael Bay sort of cinematography.The movie also features some awkward humor and characters that are supposed to be humorous that also feels mostly out of place and is not consistent with the style of the movie. Think you can say that it downgrades this movies and makes it even harder to take it really as a serious attempt.It's action is also a reason why this movie is hard to take serious. It's just too much. The movie is almost nonstop action and all of the sequences feel rather overdone and unbelievable. It seems to be unnecessarily hard and straightforward which goes at the expense of its credibility. I mean the bad guys can basically shoot anyone even a small army of heavily armored tactical units even when they are right in the middle of them without having to take really cover or worry about their ammo. Yeah of course action movies are just never the most credible movies but you can also go too far in some cases. It's like a 12 year old kid wrote the script and had put in every action fantasy he ever had.Non of the actors also really impresses and it's no surprise non of them really works regularly as an actor though admittedly its perhaps not fair to judge the abilities an actor who speaks a language you don't. The characters all remain very flat especially disappointingly also the villains who normally always are the most fun interesting and perhaps also most important in an action type of movie.Korean cinema has better movies to offer than this.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When reading this review please bear in mind that I did not see it all in one sitting. On my first viewing the DVD I rented stopped half way through so I had to take it back and get another copy so ended up watching it over the course of two days. My perspective of the movie can best be summarised as a skewed piece of entertainment but whether this was down to bad plotting or a poor DVD transfer isn't totally clear.Anyway with regards the movie itself it's a perfectly competent action film very much in the style of Under Siege Two. At first I thought that setting this sort of movie in the rather cramped confines of a city underground line would be restrictive but they do manage to pull it off to some extent. There are plenty of big set piece action scenes packed with flair and panache the problem is they are too similar.For a start every single one seems to be repeated a second time later in the movie. There is not one but two wildly over the top SWAT team massacres wherein a small group of heavily armed criminals seem capable of just waltzing into a hail of bullets without taking a scratch. It's entertaining yes but it does leave you wondering just how incompetent Korean SWAT teams must be...Plus there are numerous one on one martial arts struggles between the two leads Jay the Cop and T the terrorist they really put a lot of thought into the names here and the finale to their climactic scrap is to be brutally honest rather disappointing.However it's not all bad. The action scenes may be repetitive and silly but they do make for entertaining viewing. Plus some of the characters are quite touching the subplot of one of the line operators who's wife is trapped on the tube is handled extremely well and the relationship between Jay and a girl called Kay see what I mean about the names? is a bit ridiculous but still touching. Then there's Jay himself I can't remember the actor's name a young Korean man who demonstrates plenty of action hero potential equally adept with fists and guns and with his brooding over his dead wife has more depth than the average Stephen Seagal role. He dominates every scene he's in and is reminiscent of a young Chow Yun Fat before Hollywood toned him down.In conclusion then a competent film but not a great one. If one thing has come out of this it shows that Korea can certainly contend with Hollywood and Hong Kong in the action cinema department. In all likelihood they'll probably produce their own 'A Better Tomorrow' sooner or later but unfortunately this isn't it.".

It's the closest thing to Die Hard we're ever likely to see nowadays  highly recommended.   ";

It's a pity because more recently Korea has been making some highly distinctive thrillers such as THE MAN FROM NOWHERE and THE YELLOW SEA with a look and feel all of their own this is nothing like them.This film follows a typical template which sees a disgruntled terrorist deciding to take a train full of commuters hostage. The Korean police and special forces are typically useless so it falls to a rather bland detective to tackle the menace singlehandedly. Along the way there's time for a little light romance with the distinctive Doona Bae and some unwelcome rather broad comedy.The problem with this film is that the action is just so lacklustre. Nothing happens that we haven't seen before and some dodgy greenscreen effects don't help to add to the experience. There's a distinct lack of effort and realism which becomes apparent as the storyline progresses and never any real danger to the proceedings you just don't care about the lives at stake. The poignant ending feels cynical and manipulative in the extreme and the movie as a whole is entirely forgettable.".

What's so French about it though is that noone seems to be able to get to the bottom of why this has come to pass. Despite plenty of dialogue bouncing off the topic the only real causal suggestion comes in the repeated  and silent  sequences of shots which observe the girls' bodies and frame the girls in their provincial bedrooms staring into space bored or dreaming. It's like Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides with all the generational disconnect and birth substituted for death.Dreaming is the key a word which appears in the poetic payoff voiceover line at the close. With little on offer in the town the girls look to create their future for themselves in this radical way. As it is with young people in this country there is little thought given to the practical ramifications of the birth the '18 years of sacrifice' that Camille's mother refers to berating her headstrong daughter. Instead the girls cling do their legal research  how to wrest themselves from parental control and the state's financial obligations  and cling to one another for the rest.It's a wellobserved often touching film in which the Coulin sisters manage a consistent tension. It's the tension of the vacuum around young people making demands for money which come with too few or too heavy a burden of responsibility attached. I enjoyed the inclusion of Camille's brother a soldier whose dreams are mortgaged to the state that has sent him to war. In a dreadful subtle scene we see photos of his mascot teddy a childish toy propped up against the guns as if firing them.An absorbing realist film that would stand up well in a double feature against the melodrama of Romain Gavras' Our Day Will Come 2010. 610".

Their plans were more than just rob whomever whenever but sporadic carefullyplanned that would take place when the celebrity was out of town judging by their Twitter feed and social networking activity.The film was immediately criticized for being empty somewhat superficial and lacking any real depth and brief searches for the Coulin sisters' Delphine and Muriel 17 Girls has warranted similar criticism. Let me reiterate the reason for the emptiness one more time. 17 Girls is based off another unfathomably true story revolving around a group of teen girls who made a pact to get pregnant around the same time so they could all deliver at he same time and raise their babies together. This kind of act is empty and stupid and the Coulin sisters make not attempt to disguise the true stupidity of what these girls did. However they do make an attempt to justify it and that is when we have a film.This pact begins when seventeenyearold Camille Louise Grinberg discovers she is pregnant after the condom breaks during sex with her partner. By making the choice to keep the child despite abortion and adoption being available options she manages to encourage her friends to also have children and get pregnant. One even resorts to getting impregnated by a twentyfouryear old homeless man.The reason the girls give to justify their pact is their desire to be loved unconditionally and their hunger for companionship. If one were to look closely at the homelives of these girls one would see nothing but emptiness and sadness with no real parental guidance or dependency whatsoever. Their parents are barely around to cook and care for them let alone give them moral guidance or help them along in school or in life. The girls resort to getting pregnant as a means of being the parent they never adequately had growing up.Make no mistake these are shallow and narrowminded girls and the Coulin sisters dually make note of that. The girls choose to go through with a process that is supposed to be wonderful and quite an emotionallyenriching experience and cheapen it to a spurofthemoment impulse that effectively robs it of any and all humanity. However the Coulin sisters bravely try and justify why the girls did which is the real uphill battle. Out of all the tabloid stories the Coulin sisters picked one of the toughest to justify and humanize and the result with 17 Girls is remarkable.I'm somewhat optimistic that one day we'll get a version of the pregnancy pact that tries to give an even deeper humanization of the girls involved with the pact. With 17 Girls we're kind of at arm's length away from the story never closing in on even one of the girls involved with this pact. However as stated the lack of character development only further gives these characters the vapidness they accentuated in real life by doing such an unthinkable act and cheapening what is supposed to be an intimate and massively rewarding experience. I constantly see people myself included complaining that movies shortchange their heroes and don't give proper justice to their own character. Here's a film that does perfect justice to its characters and their reallife personalities.Starring Louise Grinberg. Directed by Delphine and Muriel Coulin.".

These are very young girls and yet they're caught on film doing things we've all seen young girls do as if the camera were invisible. How is that possible? Because if they're only acting they are incredibly convincing.If I were a director filming a competing film about female adolescents I would shoot myself out of sheer envy. And I'm afraid I can only attribute the poor reviews this film got to something similar. I much prefer a different more masculine kind of film but I was riveted by this film's persuasiveness. That's quite a trick. This director is ingenious. If he or she is not given some meaty project after this masterful accomplishment then I'm quite sure the movie industry is dooming itself to deliberate mediocrity.The only caveat I have is that the story itself in the end is not very satisfying. However as I understand it the true story behind this fanciful embellishment was even less satisfying. In other words this movie is a flight of imagination on pretty slim facts. But don't let that stop you from seeing it it's unforgettable.".

Because if they're only acting they are incredibly convincing.If I were a director filming a competing film about female adolescents I would shoot myself out of sheer envy. And I'm afraid I can only attribute the poor reviews this film got to something similar. I much prefer a different more masculine kind of film but I was riveted by this film's persuasiveness. That's quite a trick. This director is ingenious. If he or she is not given some meaty project after this masterful accomplishment then I'm quite sure the movie industry is dooming itself to deliberate mediocrity.The only caveat I have is that the story itself in the end is not very satisfying. However as I understand it the true story behind this fanciful embellishment was even less satisfying. In other words this movie is a flight of imagination on pretty slim facts. But don't let that stop you from seeing it it's unforgettable.";

I'm going to get this out I am one of the rare girls that just doesn't get the whole Zac Efron heart throb thing I agree that he's cute but with mainly High School Musical only being his claim to fame other than Hairspray he is adorable but can he act? Surprisingly he can. I can't believe I'm saying this he was actually a good strong lead role and a perfect fit he has charisma he's funny charming and makes this story worth your time and money.In 1989 Michael O'Donnell was a star athlete with a full college scholarship imminent. He seemingly had it all when right before the championship game his girlfriend Scarlett informed him she was pregnant. In that moment he made the decision to throw everything away and proposed to her. Twenty years later Mike's life isn't exactly what he expected it to be. Scarlett wants a divorce from him forcing him to move in with his geeky millionaire best friend Ned his job is going nowhere and his kids Maggie and Alex want nothing to do with him. While paying a visit to Hayden High School to reminisce about the life he threw away he encounters a strange beardy janitor who I still swear is Bob Haskins. On the way home is magically transformed back into his 17year old self. With Ned posing as his father he reenrolls in high school believing he has been given the chance to have his life over again but to do it right. However he then discovers that his daughter is dating the basketball captain Stan who is bullying his son. He realizes that his real mission is to help his children as well as finding out that maybe his decision wasn't the worst he ever made in his life.We go a little Back to the Futureesquire when we get on the creepy level of Michelle Trachtenberg having a crush on Zac Efron who is her father just that she can't recognize him it's understanding but still makes you squirm but the director and actors pulled the scene off pretty well with getting out of that yucky situation. There is one continuity error if Mike and his girl got pregnant at the age of 17... 20 years later yet both their kids are still in high school the oldest child would only be a maximum of 18. A plot hole seriously besides the wife no one at all recognizes Mike? But I'm over thinking the movie too much at this point it's just a fun movie with decent performances I just need to let go of silly mistakes. So I would recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it but I'd say more of a matine vs. a full price ticket it has some good laughs and was a great update of the What if you could go back? story.710".

	schema:headline " Second Chance in Life";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1989 the teenager Mike O'Donnell Zac Efron is the star of the Hayden HighSchool. On the day of the final basketball game Mike will be observed and may win a scholarship in college. However his girlfriend Scarlett Allison Miller tells him that she is pregnant and Mike does not play the game. Twenty years later Mike Matthew Perry is a complete loser that blames Scar for his failures he is not promoted to sale manager after working sixteen years in the same company Scarlett Leslie Mann is divorcing him his teenagers son Alex Sterling Knight and daughter Maggie Michelle Trachtenberg hate him and he is temporarily living with his best friend the eccentric and immature millionaire Ned Gold Thomas Lennon. Mike nostalgically visits Hayden where an old janitor talks to him about second chance in life. During the night he sees the janitor jumping from a bridge into the river and he unsuccessfully tries to help the man. Mike passes out and when he wakes up he discovers that he is seventeen again. Further he discovers that he has a second chance to fix his relationship with his family.17 Again is another good movie about second chance in life. I believe most of people in a certain age question decisions took in the past and would like to have a second chance to reroute his or her life in that milestone. The cinema makes this dream come true and certainly the story is pleasant for most of the people. In addition the two lead stars Zac Efron and Matthew Perry are nice actors and the result is a nice entertainment for whole family. My vote is seven.Title Brazil 17 Outra Vez 17 Again".

	schema:headline " A genuinely good teen film. Something this generation has been lacking...";
	schema:reviewBody "I've just returned from the cinema after watching this film and I have to say my friends and I laughed like a bunch of hyenas probably to the annoyance of anyone behind us all the way through it. The story of course is nothing original but you knew that going in and yes there are some seemingly ridiculous or stereotypical character setups again acknowledged beforehand but the direction and the acting more than makes up for this. Most of the actors especially Efron who proves he's definitely not just a wannabe pretty boy and actually stores away some talent play their parts well. Matthew Perry seemed slightly misplaced even if he was the reason I went to see the film in the first place. Not to mention the director being Burr Steers who directed one of my favourite films. I could kind of tell how in the wrong hands this movie could have been embarrassingly bad but Steers manages to balance the right amount of comedy with drama and turn it into something really worth seeing. Efron blew me away. I have to say I didn't see it coming and I never thought I'd say such a sentence but this boy can do better than TV Disney movies. I'm kind of glad he has turned down remake Footloose not only because it's a 'remake of footloose'.On the negative side of things the writing lacked in terms of Mark's relationship with his daughter. The daughter didn't really seem to have a personality now I'm not totally sure if this is down to Trachtenbergs terrible acting one of very little who deliver poor performances actually or poor character development but something was wrong there.I don't really rate the cinematography but I don't think it's something to be taken quite seriously in teen films. It's all about the characters and the comedy  but what was up with that image of Zac right before 'Mark' falls into the water? Some interesting choices of music. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Quite moving and Mark is a much more 3 dimensional well developed character than most PG13 rated movies you see. I genuinely cared about him where as even in Mean Girls which is particularly hilarious and legendary as far as contemporary teen films go I didn't care too much for any of the characters. It's probably because this film went that little bit further than most and took itself seriously if only for parts of the movie. It makes a big difference.So yeah '17 Again' fairly well written hilarious well and sometimes greatly acted and awesome direction for the most part and a genuinely good enjoyable and moving film. Take a look and you'll probably be surprised... but don't go in hoping for anything Oscar worthy. I get the impression there is only so much a director can do with a film like '17 Again' and he did it alright.Trustworthy director and impressive lead I'd say. Can make all the difference.p.s. I'd also watch out for that Sterling Knight actor  he plays Marks awkward son. He gave a genuinely good performance also.".

If he keeps up the good work and takes it to the next level he can really be an A level quality star. Zac is no Matthew Macfadden yet but there is potential.There are two recasts I would have done. Matthew Perry wasn't fully right for this role. He has a comedic bent but it wasn't used at all in this movie  hence a total waste and was a mismatch from a character perspective. I think John Stamos would have been better. Also Michelle Trachtenberg playing the teenager was a bit much. Trachtenberg is a solid actress but for a teenager a different actress would have been better.It is a very nice movie and I usually rate a movie on whether it's worth paying full price matine video store Netflix or don't bother. The movie was worth paying full price.".

That's the question this movie propose and tells with a grand lush style that resonates with the teen population and even with the adults too 17 again is not just some teen movie it's a movie that even adults between the ages of 3050 would enjoy it my dad sure did.

But it wasn't the case.This Movie really proved that Efron is not an Amateur who just dances and sings a lot. It proved he is a skilled Actor and his acting brought back memories of Chandler in Friends. In some places he seemed so much like Matthew Perry which is difficult to pull off for most Amateur actors.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is because some people I watched this movie with believed it had an 'abrupt ending' but I thought you can't have too much of a good thing.".

Zac is a good looking guy with a memorable face seriously hasn't everyone seen pictures of their parents when they were teens? Wouldn't you recognize them? And his wife of 20 years does not hear a difference in his voice on the phone even though we all do? Then he introduces himself to his own son as the son of his uncle this must not be a very close family.In what world does a bigger guy and captain of the basketball team stand around to listen to a soliloquy tearing him down. In my high school big guy would have pummeled little Zack into a pulp.Why is older Mike 6 inches taller than younger Mike? In the movie's beginning he's about 7 inches taller then his wife tobe in high school but as an adult she is the same height as 17 yr old Mike wow! I guess we're supposed to believe that after age 17 not only did Mike grow 6 inches but his petite girlfriend grew 7 that's some growth spurt so late in life do they live next door to a nuclear power plant? Mike keeps on stopping by their house but the irresponsible Mother never calls the uncle to see where he lives or how he suddenly found his 17 yr old long lost son? Young Mike has an issue with his wife going out on a date but doesn't find it creepy that she is flirting with even though it's really him her 17 yr old nephew. And seriously all the guys out there if you suddenly found yourself looking like you did at 17 with the mind of a 37 yr old wouldn't one of the first things you'd do include going after young women???? But he completely ignores them. Also why is he in the same class as his daughter who would be two years older than him if he had her at 18 and he is 37 when he changes.How does the mother know where the party is and she comes to get her son to what embarrass him? Then the principal and her husbands best friend show up but then who is the uncle we've never seen because that's not him but then but.....man am I confused.Bottom line  Why do all modern high school age flicks all require you to suspend all disbelief in reality? Poor script OK acting if it could have made sense it might have been OK but no big loss they will pump out more of the same drivel in a couple months.".

I also recognized Matthew Perry and Nicole Sullivan. I did not realize until the cast credits that the bearded janitor at the high school was Brian DoyleMurray Bill's brother. Now parts of the plot and characterizations were a little uneven but despite that there were plenty of scenes that were hilarious especially those between Lennon and Hardin. With them I also saw a little Big Bang Theory vibe. Oh and there's a little touching proabstinence speech here as well though it still is acknowledged that not all teens will feel that way. All in all despite some adult humor 17 Again was an enjoyable comedy that should be enjoyable enough for parents and offspring alike. Oh and one more thing I thought the Vanilla Ice reference in the 1989 sequence didn't fit since I remember him not even emerging until the following year...".

	schema:headline " Let's push some pills my peeps  17 Again";
	schema:reviewBody "Complete with a cast of notable faces and a stellar soundtrack featuring The Virgins Santogold and The Kooks my initial trepidation was pushed aside as I decided to go into this spiritual journey mishmash with an open mind. I'm glad I did because there are some genuinely funny moments along with a sweet and touching overall message. However when you look deep into the work you will not find much to grasp onto below the surface. It's been seen before the relationship between youngagain father and his high school children gets beyond creepy and everything happens just as you'd assume it would. There are no surprises but did you really think there would be? The film is all about Mike O'Donnell a soon to be 40 year old who has been looking back on his life with regret. As the star basketball player in high school he chose love and family above a chance to play in or even go to college. The past twenty years have been a chore of responsibility he never could own up to despite his beautiful wife and two children. When divorce proceedings commence and he sees once and for all how little his kids see him as a father figure he comes in contact with Brian DoyleMurray's janitor who sends him back in body not time to rediscover why he made the choice he did. What is initially looked upon as a chance to be the hero on the court again becomes an opportunity to help his kids against the angst and horrors of high schoolbecoming a hero in his home life the path he chose back when he was actually seventeen.It all begins enjoyably as we see this hotshot kid Efron's young Mike to Matthew Perry's adult version do pretty much whatever he wantshe is the most popular boy in schooleven being best friends with the biggest dork their age. I've only seen Efron in one other film Richard Linklater's criminally unreleased Me and Orson Welles and he was very good in it. What worked in that film is my one criticism of him here and that is the fact that he looks like he is acting. For a very theatrical role in Welles it fit perfectly here however in a world that is supposed to be natural he just doesn't quite have the skills yet. The ability to be good in a few years is there but right now I believe his charisma carries him. And that isn't a bad thing. I actually really enjoyed the moments when his adult self came through in his actions and speech after the transformation takes place. The kid is definitely enjoyable to watch.The real success though are performances from Thomas Lennon and Leslie Mann. Mann is in her element with this role very similar to those her husband Judd Apatow usually casts her to play. Something about this woman just works in portraying the attractive mother any guy would be insane to let get away. As for Lennon well his absolute crazy absurdity steals each scene he is a part of. As the grownup version of Mike's friend Ned he is a rich computer programmer that collects and lives in the fantasycomic worlds he grew up idolizing. When Efron's Mike comes in the house unknown the two partake in a massive fight scene complete with mace and shield as well as a fun lightsaber dual. But where he really shines is in interactions with high school Principal Masterson played by The Office's Melora Hardin. Once we discover her true internal workings and Lennon ceases his peacocking the two of them cause massive laughter in their creepiness.But that is the good creepiness. There is a lot of bad to go with it much to the detriment of the movie. The inherent problem of having a father become the age of his children and try and help them make the basketball team Sterling Knight and practice abstinence Michelle Trachtenberg is that he will become best friend andor love interest to them respectively. Then there are the pedophilic tendencies of Mann's mother towards Efron even though they are technically married and what is unavoidable becomes used front and center for jokes. Unfortunately those jokes are of the uncomfortable kind the audience can't get their heads around the fact a seventeen year old is hitting on a forty year old or a daughter trying to make out with her father. That's right  creepy.Couple that awkwardness with the sheer predictability of it all 17 Again becomes just a runofthemill teen comedy. I did really like the message at its core that selflessness and the ability to love outweigh any dreams of grandeur for financial or popular success. Sometimes it just takes longer for someI'm not sure twenty years is a credible length of time but the writer did need to make the kids of ageor an event to push them back into the reality of how great their life is. I also liked certain scenes like that of Efron verbally abusing bully Stan Weeds's Hunter Parrish in the lunch room as well as his trying to help the Health teacher get her point across after passing out condomsthere are funny moments. I even enjoyed the filmmakers' knowledge that they were ripping off so many movies that came before. The allusions to It's a Wonderful Life the greatest spiritual journey film in existence like on the bridge are great as is the homage to Back to the Future with Efron's supposed awakening from his dream to be with his daughter much like Marty McFly wakes to his mother. In the end though its weaknesses win out. While it is reasonably harmless there are just too many quality alternatives to recommend.".

Although reminding me and probably everyone who's reading this of films like Freaky Friday 13 Going On 30 Big etc just being the opposite way in age it really makes good use of the comedy this situation brings but doesn't rely on it or overplay on it.Basically as long as you're not an Efronhater you should walk out of this film not feeling at all ashamed that you'd just watched a film with over 100 ten to fourteen year old girls!".

	schema:reviewBody "17 Again has been done before in Big 13 Going On 30 and one of my favorite movies The Kid. That being said I really liked 17 Again. This is a star vehicle for teen heartthrob Zac Efron. Okay the movie opens cheesy with ripped Efron shooting baskets in 1989 as high school star point guard Mike O'Donnell highly recruited by colleges. Efron also impresses in a dance number with the cheerleaders. It's a good kind of cheese.In director Burr Steers and writer Jason Filardi's 17 Again older Mike sympathetic Matthew Perry gets a chance to be 17 again with the assistance of spiritual guide Janitor Brian DoyeMurray. Efron is really good here displaying charm humor and surprising depth and compassion. There is a scene where the young Mike Efron consoles his daughter Maggie vulnerable Michelle Trachtenberg over her heartbreak When you're young everything seems like it's the end of the world but it's not 17 Again has a certain bitter sweet and affirming resonance. In a light hearted way 17 Again is about the choices we make in life and how we foster greatness for the ones we love. 17 Again works because of the solid Efron and the amazing Leslie Mann as Mike's estranged wife Scarlett.Mike Perry is currently living with his wealthy high school bud Ned hysterical Thomas Lennon. Ned is the genius who invented the software that prevents music piracy and also the guy who made piracy possible. Mike's wife Scarlett Leslie Mann has filed for divorce and he barely knows his two teenage kids Maggie Trachtenberg and Alex Sterling Knight. Mike has a job he hates. After a devastating day at work Mike visits his high school that Maggie and Alex now attend. He expresses his yearning to be 17 again in his glory days to the Janitor DoyleMurray. Having ice cream with his kids he finds out the Maggie got into Georgetown and Alex lies to him about trying out for the basketball team.There is a wonderful scene as Leslie Mann discards Mike's belongings in a wood chipper. Mike confesses I have been so disappointed with my life Mann's Scarlett has had to endure this for 18 years of marriage. Mike said he felt obligated. Broken hearted Scarlett concedes Don't do me any favors. From here 17 Again charts a familiar course as Mike becomes the 17 yearold Efron. What keeps it in engaging is Mike's epiphany that his travel back is really about helping Alex and Maggie. Mike discovers that Alex is a punching boy for bully Stan jerky Hunter Parrish who is captain of the basketball team. Stan is also Maggie's boyfriend. Alex is really a great kid with a good 3 point shot and sweet on head cheerleader Nicole pretty Josie Lopez. Maggie is the smart and big hearted teen defining herself in the world. Both Knight and Trachtenberg are authentic and very good.The supporting performances are strong. Thomas Lennon as Ned is hilarious and charmingly nerdy. His Jedi Knight duel with young Mike Efron is hysterical. Ned also poses as Mike's Dad. Ultimately this works as he pursues the affections of the stunning and funny Melora Hardin as Principal Masterson. I was dying when Lennon and Hardin were talking in Tolkien Elfish at dinner.We stick with the movie because of Efron and Mann who are compelling and display a goofy and touching chemistry. Efron is good looking and charming. Mann is smart sexy and funny. There is a funny sequence as Mann tells Efron that she is not into the whole cougar and Mothers I like to deal. Efron has a moment of solace as his Mike sees the beautiful garden Scarlett designed. The two have a lot of fun with an inappropriate tango of sorts. It's this kind of spirit fun and touching humanity that make 17 Again so entertaining and worth watching.".

It may possess a somewhat predictable storyline that we have seen a couple of times before but if you are looking for a lighthearted film to keep you entertained throughout this will do the job. Zac Efron shows us he is more than the allsingingalldancing charmer from High School Musical he nails this performance. His character is believable throughout showing audiences he is a true actor not a franchise and will hopefully lose some of the stigma he attracted in the role of Troy Bolton. Costars also but in a good performance including Matthew Perry although not getting much air time still played a valid role in the film as an entirety. Great watch for all the family I definitely recommend this one!".

	schema:headline " We've all seen this movie before!";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm starting to suspect that Hollywood no longer uses actual human screenwriters to create their movies. After watching years of the same recycled trash I'm starting to think that they now use a screenplaywriting machine to do it. This machine works very simply. A producer will enter the main character's name one problem they are facing and one 'gimmick' an unusual plot twist often used as a selling point for the film and hey presto!  out pops a completed and entirely unoriginal screenplay. Such is the case for 17 Again.

The other highlight of course was Matthew Perry. He's the man and an excellent comic actor but his short onscreen time was not enough to salvage this unoriginal unfunny and worst of all boring attempt at light entertainment.

	onyx:emotionText "I'm starting to suspect that Hollywood no longer uses actual human screenwriters to create their movies. After watching years of the same recycled trash I'm starting to think that they now use a screenplaywriting machine to do it. This machine works very simply. A producer will enter the main character's name one problem they are facing and one 'gimmick' an unusual plot twist often used as a selling point for the film and hey presto!  out pops a completed and entirely unoriginal screenplay. Such is the case for 17 Again.

Any movie will do at this time except 17 again. Do I begin with the pansy looking Efron who probably looked natural prettily dancing with the cheerleaders than he did as the lead actor. I am really suspicious of girls who dig Efron. Anyway that makes up for an entirely different discussion and I shall not stray any further until I am done butchering and battering this movie to bits. Did I promise not to be too harsh again? Well I will try. Be sure to fuse your logic bulb. If you don't the director will anyway. There are too many ridiculous situations and you might overload your brain with it looking for sense. Like the scene when the 17 again Mike O'Donnell Efron appears before his wife and children and they fail to recognize him. OK we have to give them the benefit of doubt. Perry to Efron is an unimaginable physical transformation even with plastic surgery. He got shorter did he at 17? But what about corny reminders Mike O' Donnell gives them by rehashing the same dialogues. Poor memory can be attributed to old age and we shall spare the wife Leslie Mann. Not yet! The script writer had another plot in mind. As the wife Leslie Mann looks into her high school year book the picture still doesn't convince her that Efron is her husband. Finally it is Efron's gesture at the championship game that makes her realize who he really is. Doh! That by far is the most ridiculously scripted part of the movie and I am still reeling under it.Although I must admit there was this particular scene when I thought I saw a sudden reflection of Perry in Efron and another one where his voice modulated to suit Perry. Those must have been genuine attempt on Efron's part. I must have been watching too closely nonetheless his effort hasn't gone unnoticed. Efron you are no eye candy to me Sterling Knight does a better job at that. At least he looks 17! Is it just me or did anyone else notice how Efron looks squint eyed.Perry doesn't get enough screen time so it wouldn't be fair to comment. His hefty eye bags sure do convince us about how old he's gotten. The whole LOTR gimmick was hilariously received by the audience there were only 3 other jobless people with me. The movie does deliver a message in the end for what it is worth which may tug at the hearts of a few. Not all of us would do things differently if we had the chance and if those moments were ones we savored. Though eventually with time those moments may seem like our weaknesses.".

The character that plays the geeky friend isn't cute or funny in fact I really want to punch him in the face repeatedly. Granted I assumed that it would be a cute movie for little kids. It isn't.

But in fact it was not a bad comedydrama in which Efron and Matthew Perry play the same character at different points of their lives.Back in 1989 Zac looked like he had it made university scholarship for basketball in the offing when girl friend Allison Miller tells him she's pregnant. That takes his head out of the game real fast and the two of course get married.Fast forward to the present and the couple now played by Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are split and she's filing for divorce. When a young girl who was probably bedding the boss at his job gets a promotion that tears if for him. Perry makes a wish that he could be young again and have a second chance at life. A very strange janitor who is a guardian angel grants his wish and he's now Zac Efron again this time in 2009.So like Joe Boyd who became Joe Hardy in Damn Yankees Perry is now young and Zac Efron again. But he's also bringing 20 years of real life experience to high school and he becomes a guardian angel himself to his two children there Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight.Although some compare 17 Again to It's A Wonderful Life I think it stands better comparison to Damn Yankees and the Faust legend except that it's a good angel and not the devil that's granting the wish. And of course his soul is no danger.Melora Hardin is around and playing the role of one of the foxiest school principals I've ever seen on film. She's the object of the affection of Thomas Lennon who was the school nerd and Efron's friend like Screech Powers to Zack Morris. As a kid he's played by Tyler Steelman. Steelman was the school nerd then but as an adult and Thomas Lennon he's a super rich guy but still friends with the guy who protected him back in the day.I was expecting a teen sex comedy and I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised with how good 17 Again was. I highly recommend to audiences of all ages. And Zac Efron's fans of all ages.".

When the fianc shows no interest she tries for playwright Lloyd Richards Hugh Marlowe but DeWitt stops her. After she accepts her award she decides to skip the afterparty and goes to her room where a young woman named Phoebe has sneaked into her room and fallen asleep.

	schema:reviewBody "In show business there is probably an Eve Harrington born every day. Someone who butters up to a performer of note acting innocently revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have.  Anne Baxter plays this type of person to a tee.  She looks like a babyfaced fan but little do we know there is a fame machine at work in her mind.  Bette Davis as Margo Channing star of the stage is a veteran who has seen it all.  She is quite the egotist.  Margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it.  Eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm.  This is the premise of ALL ABOUT EVE Joseph L. Mankiewicz's masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation.  Mankiewicz also wrote the picture winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1950 with such skill the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.The performances are great regardless especially by Bette Davis and the always detested George Sanders one of my favorite actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  The film is narrated initially by Sanders who plays a ruthless swine of a theatre critic then by Celeste Holm the wife of Eve and Margo's playwrighter then Bette Davis in the performance of a lifetime. The movie is about 90 dialogue much like a play.  The words are so crisp and sharp you never sway or lose interest.  These characters are just too interesting.  Bette Davis has a cavalcade of unforgettable dialogue. Fasten your seatbelts.  Its going to be a bumpy night!  This is the one everyone remembers but I would be remiss to get into any others.The picture runs well over 2 hours but it doesn't seem like enough. Mankiewicz could've held a seminar of screenwriting by showing this.  George Sanders is the only actor of the roster to bring home an Academy Award and rumor has it Davis and Baxter who was just 27 at the time were feuding during much of the shoot and lusted the Oscar.  Time has been very good to the film as well.  1950 was a wonderful year for movies and ALL ABOUT EVE's artistic equal that year was the equally wellwritten SUNSET BOULEVARD which took us behind the scenes of a tainted Hollywood.  EVE takes on theatre and treats Hollywood like an afterthought.  There are many references to the film industry usually involving the scenes with Margo Channing's boyfriend who is attempting to make a career on the silver screen.The movie is highly unpredictable especially the last scenes which tie the ideas of the story up.  There is an Eve everywhere and each character gets what he or she deserves. Fasten the belts and listen up.  This is screenwriting at its finest.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE definitive saga of backstage brouhaha ever dished out by Hollywood.  A triumph of screenwriting never will one see such ripe acrid dialogue spewed out like this again  every indelible scene gloriously stained with classic oneliners.  An actress wannabe looking for her big break carefully worms her way into the glamorous life of a legendary Broadway star then tries to supplant her privately and professionally.A sterling incandescent cast provides the fire and music to this concerto of theatre attitude.  Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when she was cast as Margo Channing the indomitable diva caught up in the throes of midlife crisis both on and offstage.  Not willing at all to deal with it tactfully she makes life a living hell for anyone within knifethrowing distance.  This juicy onceinalifetime part turned Davis' own flagging middleaged career back on its feet especially coming on the heels of one of her biggest dumps ever Beyond the Forest.  Remarkable as it may seem Bette was not the first choice here replacing an injured Claudette Colbert.  With all due respect to Colbert Bette Davis was BORN to play Margo Channing.  A mauling lioness one minute a coy declawed pussycat the next Davis relishes every wickedly bitchy scene she gets to tear into. Yet in her more introspective moments she evokes real sympathy for Margo as only a true star can especially when her character missteps.  It's a resounding victory for the Queen Bee in every way shape and form.Her supporting cast also manage to create a buzz of excitement.  Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe known for their relative blandness are splendid here in their respective roles as queen bee's lover and playwright.  While Merrill's Bill Sampson tames Margo the woman with gutsy directness and virile passion Marlowe's Lloyd Richards appeases Margo the star with flattery great dialogue and a calm resolve.  Worth watching then are their fireworks scenes with Margo when intelligence and restraint no longer work.  Debonair George Sanders gives customary snob appeal and dry cynicism to his waspish ultimately loathsome columnist Addison DeWitt who swarms around Broadway's elite knowledgeable in the fact his lack of heart and poison pen yield exclusive rights and power.  The most sensitive and sensible one in the collective bunch the one lacking a true stinger is Karen Richards played wonderfully by Celeste Holm Margo's best friend and confidante who finds herself caught between the queen and a hard place when she accidentally makes a pact with the devil.  Thelma Ritter couldn't be overlooked if she tried.  An inveterate scenestealer she weathers strong competition this time in a movie crammed with clever conversation and pungent zingers.  As coarse but wellmeaning Birdie Coonan a brash exvaudevillian now the queen's everloyal drone Ritter's character properly handles her boss's antics with amusing grit and backbone.  On the periphery of this Broadway beehive is mopfaced Gregory Ratoff as an edgy gullible thickaccented producer Marilyn Monroe as a hopelessly vacuous starlet and Barbara Bates as a novice schemer with a very bright future all making their few scenes count  especially Bates who is forever enshrined in the film's stunning final shot.The chief thorn in Margo's and everybody's side and the other real star of this picture is the queen's titular ladyinwaiting Eve Harrington. As played by Anne Baxter this role is probably the most delicate and difficult of all for the weight and believability of this drama falls squarely on her shoulders.  Unfairly overlooked all these years by the flashier posturings of Davis Baxter does a beautiful job of drawing initial pathos then panic as she slowly unveils her own lethal stinger.  By film's end Baxter is directly on par with her scenerychewing costar.  Killer to killer. Champion to champion.Six Oscars including Best Picture Best Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz Best Screenplay also Mankiewicz and Supporting Actor George Sanders went to this cinematic bon mot.  Had Bette Davis and Anne Baxter not competed as Best Actress Baxter refused to place herself in the Supporting Actress category it would have drummed up two more awards to be sure.Developing a faithful cult following over the years this film deserves to be on everybody's top ten list.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliantly acted and cleverly characterized with sparkling dialogue that mercilessly parries the gloss from the New York theater world's highly sophisticated veneer All About Eve is a scintillating comedy of manners that compels rapt attention for the whole of its 2 hours. We like George Sanders pointing out Gregory Ratoff to his escort Marilyn Monroe whom the script describes as a member of the Copacabana school of acting with the words There's a real live producer honey! Go and do yourself some good! And the final scene in which Sanders asks Barbara Bates Do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?  More than anything else in the world! she answers. Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one he replies. Miss Harrington knows all about it!It is often complained of Mankiewicz's work that it is too stagey and too talkative that there is not sufficient movement. There is some justice in this charge in the consideration of such films as Five Fingers The Quiet American House of Strangers and Dragonwyck certainly Mankiewicz's two spectacles Guys and Dolls and Cleopatra are much improved by sharp editing. But in his best films The Late George Apley A Letter to Three Wives All About Eve People Will Talk which I regard as his masterpiece  it was too offbeat unfortunately for contemporary audiences or critics to appreciate and The Barefoot Contessa any trace of over talkativeness is more than offset by the range and variety the unusualness of the characters. Moreover it is the characters themselves that determine the plot  not the fate or some external force.Thus in All About Eve Margo Channing is the victim of her egocentricity Sampson the victim of his own cynicism and Richards the victim of his own ingenuousness. Eve Harrington is cunning and ruthless enough to exploit these traits in her climb to stardom. Besides Mankiewicz's two awards All About Eve also won statuettes for Best Picture Best Supporting Actor George Sanders Best Costumes and Best Sound Recording. Also producer Darryl Zanuck won the Thalberg Memorial Award for consistent highquality production over the previous three years.The film also won the New York Film Critics' Citation for Best Picture Best Direction and Best Actress Bette Davis. Actually I thought that Miss Davis' performance fine as it was was overshadowed by Anne Baxter's interpretation of the scheming Eve. To cover with a winning veneer of innocence a character that would not stop at blackmail or adultery to win stardom cannot have been an easy assignment for a young actress yet Miss Baxter brought it off flawlessly.OTHER VIEWS I'd had the general idea for All About Eve in mind for a long time. But I never had a middle a second act. Then our New York office submitted a short story by Mary Orr called The Wisdom of Eve  later a radio script  and I had my second act. Incidentally Zanuck deserves some credit for what happened. He was the only studio head in town with the courage and intelligence to try new things. I don't think I could have made this picture on any other lot but 20th Century Fox.  J.L.M.".

Maybe the camera which does nothing but sit there as the actors act could have been made a little less static. But the story screams stage play which implies lots of talk and not much action. The film doesn't pretend to do all things. But what it does do it does extremely well.As Margo Bette Davis gives what I would consider one of the best performances if not the best performance in any film I have ever seen. She truly becomes Margo that fixture of the theater so beloved yet so insecure. And as Eve the mousy one with the trench coat and the funny hat breathy Anne Baxter proves adept at subtleties that allow her character to change gradually over time.Then there's George Sanders who effortlessly slips into the role of witty urbane pompous Addison DeWitt columnist magnifico a man whose high opinion of himself allows him to declare to us as viewers that he is essential to the theater. Celeste Holm and reliable Thelma Ritter give topnotch performances as well.And the Mankiewicz script which tells the story of a group of theater people is heavy on dialogue but it's totally believable as characters talk shop and interrelate by means of suitable verbal conflict and subtle subtext. Even more than that the dialogue is witty and clever with tons of theatrical metaphors like when Bill Gary Merrill angrily tells Margo And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me it spells a paranoid insecurity that you should be ashamed of. To which Margo just as angrily spits out Cut print it what happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?One of my favorite scenes has several people sitting on a stairway at a party. A curvaceous but birdbrained Miss Casswell Marilyn Monroe from the Copacabana school of acting desires another drink. Oh waiter! she yells out. Addison schools her That isn't a waiter my dear that's a butler. To which she fires back Well I can't yell 'Oh butler' can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler. Addison then concedes You have a point an idiotic one but a point.I'm not sure I really like the characters in this film. Generally they're selfabsorbed vain haughty and backbiting. They're not all that likable. And that would be my only serious complaint.Otherwise All About Eve is a film that excels at great language and great acting. If ever there was a film that deserves the status of classic this is surely it.".

The fact is it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on.  It's an incredibly engrossing moving and often comedic experience but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted.  The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly naturalseeming most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to act too much only enhances it that much more.  With this film you can really imagine the people the actors are portraying.All About Eve shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films A Face in the Crowd.  Both are studies of fame and celebrity.  Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrityobsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly Eve predates A Face by several years.And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed the strength of their character and the power they wield.  The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so liberated today.  So what more can I say?  If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it you've suffered long enough don't wait another day.".

	schema:reviewBody "this might contain spoilersThe movie Perfect Stranger opened today and as many critic noted the script was not up to standard. But then again one is always reading how today's script's just don't cut it. And one wonders why? Surly today's directors can draw upon previous movie scripts if no more than to see how well they are constructed. And no script was more in it's craft that Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve. I could also point out Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity and a few others but All About Eve is one one Mankiewicz's best along with A Letter to Three Wives and the charming People Will Talk. But as many a poster knows All About Eve garnered 14 academy award nominations winning 6. Bette Davis was robbed! Sure Gloria Swanson was dazzling in Sunset Boulevard but she didn't have the competition Miss Davis had in All About Eve. There was Anne Baxter reprising a similar role she played in the 1944 film Guest in the House. And George Sanders playing a variation of his role in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I think the academy members gave him his award for his magnificent body of work. His award was well deserved. But miss Baxter couldn't hold a candle to Miss Davis who essayed her role in 14 days. And out of sequence. The first scene filmed for the movie was Miss Davis encountering Addison De Witt in the lobby of the theatre. The producers could only get the theatre for a certain time not on it's schedule so did what it had to do. Film that scene. The interior of the theatre scene was filmed at a later date. Many people don't know that Hollywood is a very small town. And the academy award members is not a large body at all maybe a little over two thousand. But at that time the members had long memories and since Miss Davis was no longer Queen of Hollywood let alone under a contract to a major studio they knew they had no allegiance to her. She had stepped on too many academy members toes and some still felt the sting. Gloria Swanson well she just came out of retirement for this one film and so they felt no allegiance to her either. Neither studio backed the two stars. And the award went to Judy Holliday for a very boring movie called Born Yesterday. A role that Miss Holliday had performed on Broadway many many time. It's hard to watch Born Yesterday today and you really wonder why the members didn't give the academy award to Miss Davis. All About Eve is a timeless movie a classic and a gem and the towering performance in the entire film is by Bette Davis. To go further in the case of vendetta the members did give Katherine Hepburn an award for her unforgettable performance in The Lion in Winter but to make sure Davis couldn't catch Hepburn she got another award for the insipid Guess Who's Coming to Dinner a role not worthy of an academy award. Still Miss Davis somehow comes out a true winner when all one has to do is to watch All About Eve. We are her academy award.".

The acerbic wit that runs through the film always has a ring of truth to it the characters overblown as they are are always recognizably human.The acting alone is to die for. Can you believe that other actresses were once considered for the role of Margo? Claudette Colbert?. Davis makes it her own not by acting Margo but by being Margo. I can't think of another role more indelibly suited to an actress than this. In a lesser film she might have swamped her costars but Mankiewicz who wrote and directed gives everyone equal credence.Anne Baxter was never better than as the poisonous Eve Celeste Holm wonderful as the clipped sophisticated Karen George Sanders oozing epigrams as if from every pore as the screen's most famous critic Addison DeWitt what a name!. These were careerbest performances and in smaller parts Thelma Ritter's cynical wisecracking Dresser Birdie and Marilyn Monroe's vacuous Miss Caswell 'a graduate of the Copocobana school of dramatic art' are just as unforgettable.

There've been a number of films that explore the passion for success on the stage Stage Door 1937 and A Star Is Born first made in 1937 and made several times thereafter being two of the most notable. And other films have also taken an introspective look at the machinations of the acting profession  The Player 1992 and even the goofy but entertaining Get Shorty 1995.This one however is the definitive voyeuristic analysis of why actors will do anything to get to the top for three reasons. First it has a script that is flawless in its construction logic and plot development to use a hackneyed phrase  it all hangs together seamlessly showing  and telling with three different voiceovers  the depths to which some go to reach the heights of narcissistic glory. Second such a film required a strong hand to keep the actors in check to prevent it from descending into farce and that's why Joe Mankiewicz was needed well it was his script anyway  so who better to direct with his fine record of films? And third the main protagonists never before I think has a script followed so closely the juxtaposition of a true star Bette Davis in her waning years playing an actress in her waning years and being challenged by a relative newcomer Anne Baxter playing a newcomer challenging the aging star. Such delicious irony I think is rare to see on screen. Add to that a collection of actors George Sanders Gary Merrill Hugh Marlowe Celeste Holm the irrepressible Thelma Ritter of the time who ably and professionally flesh out a drama about the reality of life in fiction.Perhaps even more interesting than the actual film would have been a documentary filming the action on the sets as the film was made... One can only dream I guess to have been a fly on the wall.A word about the dialog checking the above link for Quotes I see that all of the lines I rate as some of the best I've heard all show up in the list  which is also one of the longest list of quotable film quotes I've seen. If you're hesitating about seeing this film just scan through those quotes to get a sense of what is in store.As implied the direction from Mankiewicz and the acting  particularly Davis Baxter and Sanders  are riveting. Bette Davis is the personification of diminishing selfconfidence as the onset of age dominates and depresses Baxter is almost sociopathic in her portrayal of naked ambition disguised as sycophantic concern for one and all but particularly for those who will advance her ambitions and George Sanders does give the performance of his career and deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actor. Other actors Dick Powell or Claude Rains for example could have played that role for sure Sanders however does such a good job it's a though the character of Addison DeWitt what a play on word sound  Addison the wit and critic given a name that sounds like a New Yorker's disparaging putdown. Was Mankiewicz having a bit of fun at New York's expense? morphs into George Sanders completely. And viceversa...So treat yourself to a filmic experience that you'll never see repeated  for obvious and sad reasons. But also this type of narrative is long gone from the Hollywood scene talky movies are boxoffice death these days as we all know  unless you're in a Phone Booth 2002 or on a Cellular 2004.One can only hope that nobody attempts a remake of this masterpiece. Highest recommendation...".

But there are plenty of moments when the film simply dissolves into talkiness and it gets a little slow and boring.  The film is at its best when Bette Davis giving no doubt her best performance as fading star Margo Channing really lets loose and lets her costars have it as in the scene where she fights with Marlowe in the theater.  She is also good when being vulnerable and revealing in some of the quieter scenes but the talkiness factor does override her a little bit.

	schema:reviewBody "Joseph L. Mankiewicz was a genius and this is his masterpiece without a doubt! Mr. Mankiewicz's timeless tale for this film was something that paralleled the great writing of another author that knew the inside of the human race Honore de Balzac.In this story about the theater all the elements come together to weave a perfect movie one that will endure the passage of time. Mr. Mankiewicz's screen play is about blind ambition and to what extremes does a person goes in order to realize that goal. The writer seems to be telling us that to Eve Harrington her end justified the means by which she arrived at getting where she got.The cast assembled for the movie was the perfect blend of styles and acting ability. This film is dominated by Eve Harrington who Anne Baxter plays to perfection. We first see her as the adoring fan to Margo Channing the star of the hit play on Broadway. She will do anything to get to where Margo Channing is. In a way Eve is a user of the worst kind. She used Karen Richards Margo's best friend in order to get in the theater world where she finally makes a splash.In that theatrical world we encounter all kinds of sub species that tend to gravitate toward the limelight where others are shining brighter. They will do anything in their power in order to 'belong' to the glamour and all the things that go hand in hand in that circle.Anne Baxter was an amazing Eve Harrington. She was a young actress then who showed a lot of talent and was perfectly cast for that role. Bette Davis makes Margo Channing come alive. Ms. Davis shows us what is to be at the top of her class and suddenly see her world begin to crumble which in a way it's the way of the theater. The theater and the movies are cruel to the stars that dare to age in front of our eyes. There will always be prettier and younger actresses to bask in their moment of glory in front of the adoring public but watch out never get old!George Sanders as the bitchy Addison Dewitt is the maker and breaker of many a career. He has the power to destroy anyone that doesn't play by his rules. Mr. Sanders was excellent by being the cynic in a make believe land. In a way the writer is telling us that even then there was something rotten in theater critics that will ruin a play by just disliking it in the press. Celeste Holm is also effective as Karen Richards a friend indeed until she is used to give Eve her big break. Thelma Ritter is a delight to watch as Birdie the wise maid that sees right through a phony when she sees one. Gary Merrill George Ratoff Hugh Marlowe and a young and fresh Marilyn Monroe complete the cast.Never before did a movie packed such an impact to reveal so much about the human comedy as in this one. After all that comedy or call it tragedy has existed since the beginning of time. All this because a brilliant Joseph L. Mankiewicz brought to the screen to dazzle audiences forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never watched this Best Picture of 1950 until a couple of years ago because it just looked like one of those 1950s melodramas translation soap operas that I can't stand and it starred an older Bette Davis who was only appealing to me in her youth in the 1930s. However after hearing and reading so many rave reviews of this especially on the IMDb Classic Board and the fact it was out on DVD I decided to check it out.I was glad I did. I liked it thought it was entertaining and worth the 138minute investment. I still didn't find it as good as advertised  at least for my tastes  but it was still a pretty involving story with good acting. How it could have been up for so many Academy Awards  14 I believe  is beyond me however.Neverthess it's main attribute as advertised is the dialog which sparkles with intelligence as the Liberal film criticelitists like to refer to it. It's a smart comedy they say from their ivory towers. Make no mistake the dialog is good but I've heard just as good from some film noirs and other movies. Movies put more of a premium on that sort of stuff back in the days before computerized specialeffects and limited attention spans took over.The best dialog came from George Sanders playing a sharptongued theater critic. Davis was next which is no surprise. Her career thanks to her own real life efforts to get good roles was doted with characters that had good dialog. This role kept her Hollywood career going as it had been fading as she approached 40 years of age. She was beginning to look older than her years and many times that spelled death to an actress but she was not the average actress.The only character in the film I couldn't stand was Eve by Anne Baxter not for her role but for the way she delivered her lines. Baxter didn't do this at first but as the film went on she kept finishing sentence after sentence with a whisper. It was extremely annoying and affected. People don't talk like that!Overall for a film dominated by dialog for almost two hours and 20 minutes it did a great job of holding one's interest. I only found one part that really lagged. It's a good movie  a wellcrafted story  but putting in almostmythical status as one of the greatest of all times as some have is a bit exaggerated.".

He was a brawler who practiced martial arts and was as likely to slum around in the filthiest of rags as he was a suit.It wasn't until after Doctor Watson took him in hand that he truly refined himself and became a respectable member of society. And yes we can tell that this movie takes place THAT early in their relationship because Watson has not yet married his wife the retconning did annoy me too by the way but you just can't avoid a little reimagining here and there.Speaking of unavoidable Irene Adler Holmes' one uncapturable is that a word? simply had to be cast as a potential love interest. The flirting the romance and the nearmakeout session were irresistible to the director and to all of the audience who're honest with themselves.That being said I felt Robert Downey Jr. played Sherlock Holmes to perfection. His characteristic caustic attitude towards Lestrade and even Watson at times was exactly how I'd imagine him. He gives several summations of his observations and deductions that brought Holmes to life in an almost unparalleled way. His fight scenes preceded the first few times by superhuman calculations show both the mental and physical sides of Holmes in ways that Watson's notes can't quite convey but at which they constantly hint.As for Watson himself Jude Law delivered a wonderful performance. I was a little skeptical of how well he fought given Watson's wartime injury but his character and demeanor were entirely on the nose. His loyalty to Holmes despite his frustrations with him could not have been captured more expertly I feel. No one no matter how patient or forgiving could endure Holmes forever without the occasional confrontation. The original Holmes after all was not above insulting his best friend or even deriding his deductive capabilities at times. Nevertheless Watson never could abandon his friend in his time of need.This version or vision if you will of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation may be more swashbuckling more thrilling and more edgy than any other incarnation but that doesn't make it any less faithful to the original. Aside from a little revisionist history in the cases of the female leads nothing is that far out of the ordinary and no amount of references to Madonna will change that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly hundreds of actors have played Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson and it may seem rash to call Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law the best HolmesandWatsonduo so far. But I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan my whole life and most of the portrayals I've seen of the character only focus on an aspect or two of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character. In Guy Ritchie's film as in Doyle's canon Sherlock Holmes is an avid boxer a martial artist a dabbler in many sciences and a master of disguise. Most importantly he's an expert in logic and deduction. He playfully torments his housekeeper Ms. Hudson Geraldine James and shares an antagonistic but symbiotic relationship with police Inspector Lestrade Eddie Marsan.The movie opens with Holmes and Watson apprehending serial killing Satanist Lord Blackwood played broodingly by Mark Strong. Blackwood is executed but when he seemingly rises from the dead the deductive duo must determine whether it's a supernatural occurrence or if there's a logical explanation. It's exactly the type of mystery Doyle would have devised with plenty of twists and opportunities for Holmes to show off his genius as he races to stop a plot to take over England and gasp! America. Everything from the experiments Holmes performs in his Baker Street flat to his climatic revelation of the mystery on the Tower Bridge seems perfectly in line with Doyle's writing.One of the only departures from the canon that bothered me was Sherlock's introduction to Dr. Watson's fiance Mary Morstan played as a delicate English rose by Kelly Reilly. In the stories Mary was Holmes' client in The Sign of Four before Holmes first encountered Irene Adler Rachel McAdams in A Scandal in Bohemia. Then again the continuity of the stories was rarely important to filmmakers or even to Sir Arthur so I'm just nitpicking.As a film on its own merits Sherlock Holmes is almost perfect. The movie's opening shot grabs you and Guy Ritchie's directing stays gripping all the way through the end titles. His version of Victorian London is moody and atmospheric. Hans Zimmer's quirky score blends well with the film's tone and Downey Jr.'s offkilter Holmes. Meanwhile Jude Law transforms Dr. Watson from the bumbling comic relief of most movies into a cool competent sidekick. Perhaps owing to his own considerable acting chops he's the rare Watson who manages to be as interesting and watchable as Holmes. When he leaps into action he relies on a swordcane and a trusty revolver while Sherlock favors a riding crop which diehard fans will recall was his preferred method of selfdefense in the canon. Rachel McAdams manages to tweak Sherlock's classic adversary into a feisty action heroine. All the while another familiar adversary skulks in the shadows.Even when Sherlock Holmes feels a little bit more like James Bond he doesn't feel any less like Sherlock Holmes. Ritchie finds a way to depict Sherlock's fighting as a mental exercise as much as it's a physical feat. In the same way though Sherlock Holmes is grander and more commercial than Guy Ritchie's usual films it doesn't feel any less like Guy Ritchie.".

The movie's opening shot grabs you and Guy Ritchie's directing stays gripping all the way through the end titles. His version of Victorian London is moody and atmospheric. Hans Zimmer's quirky score blends well with the film's tone and Downey Jr.'s offkilter Holmes. Meanwhile Jude Law transforms Dr. Watson from the bumbling comic relief of most movies into a cool competent sidekick. Perhaps owing to his own considerable acting chops he's the rare Watson who manages to be as interesting and watchable as Holmes. When he leaps into action he relies on a swordcane and a trusty revolver while Sherlock favors a riding crop which diehard fans will recall was his preferred method of selfdefense in the canon. Rachel McAdams manages to tweak Sherlock's classic adversary into a feisty action heroine. All the while another familiar adversary skulks in the shadows.Even when Sherlock Holmes feels a little bit more like James Bond he doesn't feel any less like Sherlock Holmes. Ritchie finds a way to depict Sherlock's fighting as a mental exercise as much as it's a physical feat. In the same way though Sherlock Holmes is grander and more commercial than Guy Ritchie's usual films it doesn't feel any less like Guy Ritchie.";

Holmes' mindset such as the steps he takes to neutralize a suspect interpret clues follow the deceptive also brings out Ritchie's ability to create an ultrastylized flashback. There are also a few really thrilling action setpieces involving a boat and an unfinished bridge. The plot by three screenwriters is a little on the convoluted side but it gets the job done with plottwist ontop of plot twist. With all the brutal violence and style you can be sure this isn't your Grandpa's Sherlock Holmes but it will have you drooling for a sequel nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somehow i've always avoided the cinematic or TV presentations of Sherlock Holmes. I find the character fascinating but i always felt it was more invested in literature not cinema. His deductions the way he surrounds the worlds he investigates are a feast for thinking minds. Even when the deductions are over the top which happens often! one can't stop smiling at the cleverness. More than that the character is a perfect piece invested in a clever irresistible and fascinating world. London. That part is visual and a good ground to invest a cinematic world. But unlike for example anything by Agatha Christie Doyle's cleverness is rooted in pure deductive logic not on the mechanics of the world. Notice that Christie's crimes are many times a matter of understanding how things happened spatially murder on the orient express is the zenith of that. I suppose Doyle formed his mind before cinema had any significant impact on how our minds work.So the challenge for any modern filmmaker and actor who wants to update Holmes is to make the character more cinematic more appealing. Several tricks are used here most of them successful even if straightforward. One is the most obvious making Holmes an action character which actually is in its original dna even though TV productions usually ignore that. This might be a flop and make the version laughable but by now there is a sense of irony and self awareness in Ritchie's films sincer Lock Stock that allows him to support a xxi century action figure in Holmes clothing that actually is watchable. A minor trick here is the association of the deduction with the very process of physical fighting which creates some Matrix moments. Well their watchable though not particularly interesting. In the greater arc there are good action sequences because as any competent action these days considers the elements of the surrounding space and uses them.But there are two big things in this film which take it to new levels of interest.One is the acting. Jude Law is a clever guy an interesting actor whose greatest quality is how he merges anonymously with the context he is intended to integrate. He willingly becomes a piece of a larger tapestry and that really is something to look upon. There are not many actors who can claim they can do this competently. But the king of the game is Downey Jr. He is the gold piece in the puzzle of updating Holmes. There certainly will be a beforeafter Holmes character with this film. The man is capable to work his performances on several directions and each of them is a perfect link to its surroundings. So he gives in to Ritchie's demands and introduces humour irony and selfawareness in the character to make it usable for the director's winks at ironic action. He invests totally on the creation of a character who merges with the textures of the context while being distinct from it. And while doing it he folds us into his game so we do everything with him side by side. We deduce we smile we run all with him. So if the film hadn't other qualities Downey Jr would still make it worthy because he alone solves one the most basic problems with any film to find a channel audiences can safely cross into the game someone director proposes. He is one of the best ever.But there is another great thing here which i suspect has a lot to do with several guys involved in the process of making the film. The result is an incredible sense of placement. London XIXth century. All those dirty muddy streets all the dirt. The fascination of the inner locations namely the midget's laboratory. How those sets are usable in the action scenes. That's all competent more than competent. It's perfectly rendered carefully photographed it sounds overly artificial but it's a matter of taste i suppose. But what was really striking was the use of the London bridge. Notice how it is announced early in the film with a similar perspective to the one we'll get in the end. Than the great sequence when Irene Adler goes through the sewage goes up and we end up with a close up of her in an unidentified location. The angle opens we move away and we are set up in the location for the final fight scene which in its own merits is interesting enough. So this was a unique way to actually use an establishing location instead of merely showing it. I mean how many films have shown the Eiffel towers? countless. How many actually use it? not so many. This is one of the best London cities we've seen lately.My opinion 45httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

However great literature in the right hands can make for very entertaining cinema. Such is the case with Guy Ritchie's interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest character.Mr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce Holmes and Watson. Here we get dazzling special effects and near superhuman feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous fastidious bore in real life. In fact he lives more like a frat boy or rock star  replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.What is not missing is Holmes' world class attention to detail. The story here is multilayered and actually very interesting if not a bit highminded and highconcept. The stillunderconstruction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.Of course I won't reveal any details of the story other than to say the good guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey's physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too prettyboy for me but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills.This is a BIG movie! It is made to be a rollicking good time with tons of popcorn munched. Smaller kids will not be able to follow the story but anyone who has read a Holmes story and isn't against a little artistic license should see the film. It is extremely entertaining and fun to watch.".

It always bothered me that Holmes's eccentricities and druguse seemed to be shelved on the screen in favor of a more wellput together stern man who would never deign to get his hands dirty. Holmes was never meant to be a symbol of stiffupper lip Britain yet that's what he became.

This is an invigorating reboot that reminds us why the detective is such an icon. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have perfect chemistry like an old married couple. Mark Strong plays a chilling villain and one lament is that as part of the film is spent trying to find him his performance is surprisingly brief. Rachel McAdams is the one part of casting that feels disingenuous. She's not quite devilish or sensuous enough to be the one woman that outsmarted Sherlock Holmes. Still a thoroughly entertaining film for the head and heart. I look forward to the inevitable sequel. A".

	schema:reviewBody "It came as a surprise when Guy Ritchie was chosen as the Director of 'Sherlock Holmes.' Known primarily for his work on indie crime films such as 'Snatch' or last year's 'RocknRolla' Ritchie had never taken on a mainstream franchise film the likes of which 'Sherlock Holmes' promised to be. Thankfully Ritchie was able to mesh the two genres on some level with his trademark style of filmmaking ever present in his latest outing. The result is a film that will surely prove the most popular take on the character outside of Conan Doyle's original novels and will also likely spawn a franchise.Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson have been successfully solving cases throughout England for years. Their most recent case was that of Lord Blackwood a man who murdered in the name of his black magic. Finally hanged for his crimes it comes as an unpleasant surprise when he literally rises from his grave. And so it is up to Holmes and Watson to find him and stop him before his killing spree devours the whole of England.Robert Downey Jr. is right at home in the role of the infamous detective. Swapping out futuristic armor for a pipe and fiddle he plays another character with the wit and confidence of his Tony Stark persona in 'Iron Man.' This makes sense because to some degree what is 'Sherlock Holmes' if not merely the Tony Stark character set back about a hundred years? Regardless Downey Jr. is excellent providing an effervescent wit and supreme charm to his latest role. Jude Law plays his right hand man Dr. John Watson in a role much smarter than past incarnations of the Watson character. The two are more equals than hero and sidekick and their chemistry is indelible. Even when the narrative becomes a bit erratic the pleasure of seeing the two stars' continuous verbal quarrels is worth the price of admission alone. Together they inspire numerous laughs and clever rebuttals to an unrelenting degree allowing many of the jokes to pass unrealized saved for the treat of a second viewing.'Sherlock Holmes' has a method completely reminiscent of Director Guy Ritchie's earlier films. In the style of show firstexplain later Ritchie has effectively applied his trademark fast cuts to the mind of his lead protagonist. Much as Watson is often catching up to Holmes' various schemes so must the audience sit in question for a large portion of the film waiting for Holmes to reveal his motivations. Particularly similar to his work on last year's entertaining 'RocknRolla' along with many of his other films Ritchie takes the first hour of his endeavors laying out the dots to be connected in his lengthy but fastpaced crescendo throughout the second half of the film. With 'Holmes' he has compromised nothing rather managed to find a better balance between build up and climax. With various fistfight intervals dissecting the chaotic mystery Ritchie keeps the audience entertained even when they're unsure about the direction of the plot. That being said many viewers will begin to question their purchase throughout the films first half hour as the story puzzles more than entertains. But rest assured a satisfying finale follows with so many pieces coming together that a second viewing is a necessity to begin dissecting the intricacies of the case being solved if that only means better understanding Holmes' course of action.Visually Ritchie has constructed a film in the shadows only occasionally getting out into spanning shots of daylight England. This like the rest of the film settles into place as the film develops. His infamous lightning cuts allow no slow moments even when the pace would typically meander in the hands of a lesser Director. Holmes also riddles off explanations so rapidly that audiences can hardly pick up on all of what he is saying or all of the nuanced humor during the interplay between Watson and him. Unfortunately much of the laughoutloud humor as been divulged in the trailer but a film should not be penalized for the faults of its advertising campaign. The musical score is supplemental to the frantic convolutions of the film's earlier scenes providing a spirited tune that rides the energy of fiddling and poses as anything but generic. The locations are likewise smart the costumes are admirable and the effects are gritty proving to be another benefit of having an indie Director helm an event film. Ultimately there are no blatant shortcuts in the way of computer generation only clever sets and a brilliant Art Direction.'Sherlock Holmes' is refreshingly less conventional than one might guess even if some viewers may find themselves a bit lost by Ritchie's unforgiving cuts and unrelenting energy. It jumps right into the tale no origins told and no flashbacks necessary relying on Holmes renowned history. Furthermore many subtle elements of the various characters' past interactions are left for the audience to deduce in the fashion of Sherlock Holmes himself. And while the film may not be the grand epic some may have hoped for its sheer entertainment value is undeniable. From the moment the credits roll it's apparent that 'Sherlock Holmes' cannot be full appreciated in one screening and will likely grow in favor upon further viewings. It further presents itself as a gem of home entertainment in the long run as a film that can be enjoyed on any occasion in any company even with its hefty twohourplus runtime. This is a byproduct of the wonderfully gritty action Ritchie brings to the tale and the uncompromising portrayal of the classic characters by the films superb leads. 'Sherlock Holmes' won't be quite what you expect and you may even be dismayed by the films feisty narrative style but more often than not you'll be completely entertained by the characters on screen in this fun addition to the loaded Holiday season.".

	onyx:emotionText "It came as a surprise when Guy Ritchie was chosen as the Director of 'Sherlock Holmes.' Known primarily for his work on indie crime films such as 'Snatch' or last year's 'RocknRolla' Ritchie had never taken on a mainstream franchise film the likes of which 'Sherlock Holmes' promised to be. Thankfully Ritchie was able to mesh the two genres on some level with his trademark style of filmmaking ever present in his latest outing. The result is a film that will surely prove the most popular take on the character outside of Conan Doyle's original novels and will also likely spawn a franchise.Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson have been successfully solving cases throughout England for years. Their most recent case was that of Lord Blackwood a man who murdered in the name of his black magic. Finally hanged for his crimes it comes as an unpleasant surprise when he literally rises from his grave. And so it is up to Holmes and Watson to find him and stop him before his killing spree devours the whole of England.Robert Downey Jr. is right at home in the role of the infamous detective.

But the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long so there's the problem. There are so many plot holes that a mack truck could drive through and even with suspension of disbelief it is truly a hodge podge of dreck with loud noises interspersed amongst the dreck to keep you awake. We are supposed to believe that Irene Adler is so strong as to heave a drugged and outofit Holmes from off the floor by the fireplace and onto a bed and then strip and handcuff him to the bed posts. They don't show you any of this because it would be laughably unbelievable. She must be super human to accomplish such a feat. There are other ridiculous stupidities that I thought perhaps were aimed at teens but the teens that were with me actually fell asleep because it was so boring. Every once in a while one of the sleeping teens would nod awake at a loud explosion. One such explosion completely engulfed the major characters yet in the next scene not a burn mark is to be found. Apparently people in Holmes' day were made of asbestos. Don't waste your money. I like R.D.J. but this was a waste of time and money.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am so very tired of people reviewing movies which are subjective by nature as blanketly best ever this and best ever that. That's simply a case of small minds and big egos at work. There are so many great Holmes films and portrayals out there that it's asinine to declare any one film or one actor as the best. Most reviewers who rave about this film claim how it finally got it right. Got what right? Your personal interpretation of Sherlock Holmes in your mind? What about Jack's mind? What about Sally's? Some go so far as to claim this film merits something extra because it debunks the very debatable myth that Holmes never wore the famous deerstalker cap. For the record Holmes was described as wearing a hat made of cloth that was an earflapped traveling cap in the story Silver Blaze. Original illustrator Sidney Paget saw that as meaning a deerstalker in his mind and an image even more famous than the writing on the page was born. Sounds like Paget made a pretty sound deduction too if you ask me. Regardless if you personally don't think Holmes ever wore a deerstalker in the stories would facts like that alone or in combo boost a film so much as to make its interpretation the best. Equally valid claims can be made that Basil Rathbone Jeremy Brett Arthur Wontner Douglas Wilmer Peter Cushing Clive Merrison and others depending on your taste are the best. The question is was the movie any good on its own and were the performances fun. I don't give a hoot if it was exactly how you pictured Holmes in your mind or if you thought it was betterworse than other Holmes' films or that it somehow isn't as authentic because it wasn't a verbatim dramatization of a Conan Doyle tale etc Jeremy Brett fans you know what I'm talking about. If you liked the movie great. If you like other Holmes' a lot better more power to you. I personally think the new Sherlock Holmes film took a lot of hinted at bits of Holmes' personality and skills from the canon and gave those characteristics the spotlight. That's fine. Those aren't the qualities that took reign when I read the stories but who cares? Why would I want to see the exact same thing I saw when I read the books? That would make for a monotonous world. Hurray for everybody's various interpretations and subjective and wonderfully different tastes! There are no gospel truths about movies or books or art so please just say you liked it a lot instead of it was the best. That's so unhelpful. Just tell me what you liked about it as a film on its own without comparing it to any books or other versionsinterpretations. That's like saying one food item is the best. It's ridiculous. On a final note this new interpretation is a welcome addition to the world of Sherlock Holmes. It doesn't diminish any of the older films or television series. It stands on its own as another fun ride for fans of mystery action and those who love many things Sherlock.".

Sounds like Paget made a pretty sound deduction too if you ask me. Regardless if you personally don't think Holmes ever wore a deerstalker in the stories would facts like that alone or in combo boost a film so much as to make its interpretation the best. Equally valid claims can be made that Basil Rathbone Jeremy Brett Arthur Wontner Douglas Wilmer Peter Cushing Clive Merrison and others depending on your taste are the best. The question is was the movie any good on its own and were the performances fun. I don't give a hoot if it was exactly how you pictured Holmes in your mind or if you thought it was betterworse than other Holmes' films or that it somehow isn't as authentic because it wasn't a verbatim dramatization of a Conan Doyle tale etc Jeremy Brett fans you know what I'm talking about. If you liked the movie great. If you like other Holmes' a lot better more power to you. I personally think the new Sherlock Holmes film took a lot of hinted at bits of Holmes' personality and skills from the canon and gave those characteristics the spotlight. That's fine. Those aren't the qualities that took reign when I read the stories but who cares? Why would I want to see the exact same thing I saw when I read the books? That would make for a monotonous world. Hurray for everybody's various interpretations and subjective and wonderfully different tastes! There are no gospel truths about movies or books or art so please just say you liked it a lot instead of it was the best. That's so unhelpful. Just tell me what you liked about it as a film on its own without comparing it to any books or other versionsinterpretations. That's like saying one food item is the best. It's ridiculous. On a final note this new interpretation is a welcome addition to the world of Sherlock Holmes. It doesn't diminish any of the older films or television series. It stands on its own as another fun ride for fans of mystery action and those who love many things Sherlock.";

I was pleased almost the whole way through this movie without caring much about character. Still even though Sherlock Holmes sometimes was a bit too 'ambiguously gay' and had an annoying modernlike personality he continued to be funny strange and as intelligent as I thought Sherlock should be. Jude Law did a good job as well as others on the cast.I loved the plot. It was obvious to me at times how the story would unravel but then it hits you again in the end. It was a subtle hit however. Anyways my favorite part of the story was mainly the broad scheme of things and the people involved. Sherlock goes deep enough into the world of conspiracy to keep me interested.My only gripe with this movie is sometimes the humor. A lot of the 'humor' came out during conversations. People would laugh at the wittiness spewed by the main characters and it just felt too much like a modern sitcom. Today American society and culture is infected with internet memes battles of quick wit and straightfaced jokes that provoke a lame laughter from me one not deeply felt. You could compare what I am saying to the dialogue in 'The Big Bang Theory.' Hollywood could maybe tone down a bit on dry and clever jokes especially when they poke out during unnecessary times.In conclusion I enjoyed this movie enough to rate it an 8 out of 10 and although I did complain more than I gave praise I just didn't want to give away all of the good parts. Go see this movie. It's fresh isn't based in America and doesn't trail off there either. There are twists excellent action scenes lots of fun moments sweet investigation and some analogous material better discussed in a forum of theorists.".

What is it about Hollywood that thinks we want to see vast conspiracy cults intent upon taking over the city the world the universe? Why do they continue to turn already entertaining stories into total mishmashes of roller coaster smashboombah adventures? Whether Dragnet or Temple of Doom or National Treasure it seems that the Suits in Hollywood want every film to imitate the original Indiana Jones with a measure of Da Vinci Code on the side.Granted I have been a major Holmes fan ever since seeing the Basil Rathbone version of Hound of the Baskervilles long ago and then reading Red Headed League in grade school. Since then I've read the entire collection and enjoyed more Rathbone and the wonderful Jeremy Brett interpretations on PBS as well as some other more forgettable consulting detectives. What they all have in common what makes Holmes such a memorable character is their reliance of the cerebral to solve the crime not the physical. Ritchie gives us a few inklings into Holmes deductive reasoning to show us that the little details can contribute to an overall portrait of who what when etc. But he also more frequently has Holmes punching villains brawling in the betting ring dodging a massive ship's hull as it lumbers towards him in dry dock leaping head first out an upper window of the House of Parliament into the Thames and concluding with a literal cliff hanger atop the then under construction London Bridge. By coincidence today my cable was also showing a recent James Bond film and that film offered fewer explosions and violent encounters per minute than SH.I love Robert Downey and Rachel McAdams is a fetching actress but both are wasted in this film. I am reminded of a comment made long ago about the filming of Gone With the Wind which more or less said The audience will forgive you for what you leave out but they will have a hard time with what you put in. I'm sorry but everything that was put into this mess was a travesty to everything that Sherlock Holmes has been for all these years. What were they thinking?Cerebral Holmesgood Action HolmesBMW ad.

The answer of course is obvious to me at least it's a name that sells. Mr Ritchie would most likely tell us that he wanted to bring the great detective to the attention of a whole new generation whilst simultaneously making it appealing to the youth of today. Not elementary my dear Mr Ritchie it's a cash in if you please. A cash in further aided by the casting of the talented and in vogue Robert Downey Jr as Holmes. Whilst casting Jude Law as Watson so effectively a secondary role that suits Law perfectly also carries some aesthetic weight for a younger audience.The film does pretty much what one expects of a family blockbuster in short simple frothy fun that's sadly devoid of any mystery or intelligence befitting the once Deerstalker attired one. There's action and explosions even good old fist fights given the Ritchie slowmo make over but these are either preceded or followed by long bouts of tedium. Not helped by an unadventurous  dull plot involving Mark Strong's value for money performance black magic shenanigans as Lord Blackwood and the pointless inclusion of the anonymous Rachel McAdams as Holmes' ex love interest Irene Adler. All of which comes together for a rather uninspiring show down on a half built Tower Bridge. The set design is smart and on the money Sarah Greenwood as are the costumes Jenny Beavan but the same can't be said for the sound mix which is quite frankly skewy and renders some of Downey Jr's brainy ramblings inaudible. Same for the score Hans Zimmer goes for bombastic which would have worked if it wasn't in conjunction with diddly daydiddly doo Celtic music. I mean this is Victorian England right? You could have set the film somewhere Celtic Mr Ritchiesince you have changed most of the essence of the character anyway. Hmm.The sequel is inevitable given that the film has made monster amounts of cash and no doubt about it Law  Downey Jr have great chemistry. But this is comic book Sherlock an attempt at an action comedy mixing brains with brawn. The end result being almost a cure for insomnia. 410".

This is the end the limit the bottom of the calciumencrusted barrel. Holmes admirers those who understand and appreciate the fine originals will stay away in droves if for no other reason than the hilarious miscasting of the lead characters. Mr Downey as Holmes and Mr Law as Watson rank right up there with such inspired casting choices as Tony Curtis playing a medieval knight and Sharon Stone playing a gunfighter of the old west. Ridiculous.I doubt that Hollywood's renowned contempt for its audiences can be better illustrated than by this movie. Do moviegoers really enjoy having their intelligences insulted with such grand insouciance?It is both pointless and useless to go on. We have given up what little culture we have left by allowing these amateurs to take great classics and turn them into idiotic rollercoaster rides. A paying public that can applaud let alone part with the money to see such a movie is clearly a public that can no longer recognize quality. Some years ago just before he passed away the great producer Darryl Zanuck said I know audiences feed on crp. But I cannot believe we are so lacking in ability that we cannot dish it up to them with a little style. Why bother Mr Zanuck? Apparently anything thrown out to movie audiences today will be lapped up like cream.Stay home and read a Conan Doyle original.".

He teaches Zarina music and in the process they fall in love. But then Vijayendra comes on the scene and he is ready to marry Zarina....It is the presentation characterisation and acting where the movie really shines. Amol is great as ever. Dina Pathak is delightful as the mother who is in a dilemma over allowing her daughter to meet Amol openly. Zarina also gives an excellent performance.The movie has excellent songs which are largely based on classical Indian music notable being Jab Deep Jale Aana Gori Tera Gaon Bada Pyara Aaj Se Pahle etc. Yesudas enthralls with his rich mellifluous voice in these songs. You can't find a Best of Yesudas album without these songs from this film.All in all a light heartwarming movie which is a mustsee for every hindi film buff. It is a far cry from the regular stuff churned out by Bollywood. Excellent stuff!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sooraj Barjaatya has directed some good movies over the period spanning from 19892006 but his work includes one let down also in the form of Main Prem Ki Deewaani Hoon 2003. With too much unnecessary glamour body expose theatrical performances and average musical score MPKDH did not have anything worthwhile to offer to the audience who approached the theatres with high expectations and quite naturally it bombed on the box office. However anybody who has been following the movies of Sooraj's banner actually his grandfather's banner  Rajshri Productions could easily see that MPKDH was actually an urbanized remake of an old classic of this banner which kept the flag of simplicity high values of life and Indianness high in Hindi cinema for around two and a half decades. The original classic movie in this context is Chitchor 1976.Chitchor heartstealer is a lovely movie which got turned into an unforgettable one by the brilliant performances and the excellent music. The pivotal character of the story is Geeta Zarina Wahaab who lives with her parents in a small town. Her father Pitambar Chaudhary A.K. Hungal is a schoolmaster who alongwith her mother Deena Paathak is concerned about her marriage like any traditional Indian parents. Her married elder sister Meera Ritu Kamal informs them from Mumbai then Bombay a suitable boy who is an engineer is coming to their place for work and he should be welcomed and treated properly by them to woo him for consenting to marry Geeta. The parents do the same. The arriving person is Vinod Amol Palekar who does not know the background behind his welcome and hospitality but through his nature and behaviour he is able to win the hearts of all including that of Geeta. But the twist in the tale comes when the case turns out to be that of mistaken identity. Actually the person who was suggested by Meera as the prospective groom for Geeta is Sunil Vijayendra Ghaatage and not Vinod who is not engineer but his subordinate overseer. Sunil also arrives at the place and now Geeta's parents are in a fix as to how to deal with Vinod whom they had been treating as their prospective soninlaw because quite naturally the more suitable boy is the engineer and not the overseer forg tting the fact that the heart of a girl once gone for a boy it's gone. She cannot change her feelings according to the post and the status of the boys. After an emotional drama the movie reaches its happy ending when Geeta asserts herself and disallows others to decide her destiny.This simple yet highly touching love story has been penned by Subodh Ghosh which ace director Basu Chatterjee has adapted for the screen with finesse by writing the screenplay and the dialogs himself. It's the simplicity of the story the characters and the complete milieu which makes this movie a winner all the way. The characters are innocent ones with hearts of gold and they effortlessly take the viewer away with their talks gesture and activities towards the desired culmination of the story. The spectator becomes a part of their psyche desiring the same which is bound to happen ultimately.This was the first movie of Vijayendra Ghatage whereas Amol Palekar and Zarina Wahaab too were in the initial phase of their respective careers only. And all three have delivered outstanding performances with ample support from seasoned character artists like A.K. Hungal and Deena Paathak and also from the number one child artist of his time Master Raju. This movie despite Rajshri's penchant for the traditional social values prevailing in India which expect the daughter of the house to bow before the decision of her parents regarding her marriage surprisingly makes the audience hear the footsteps of the womanlib movement in which the girl wants to decide her groom herself. Zarina Wahaab with her girl next door looks has delivered a highly confident performance in her role which in the climax set the bells of womanlib ringing for the middle class Indian girls who wanted to be the decider for their fate but could not being caught in the shackles of social tradition where the parents only could decide what's good for them. This way it was a pathbreaker in the regular Bollywood cinema.The movie could not be such a grand success as well as considered a classic if not for the unforgettable music of Ravindra Jain. This blind music maestro not only composed great melodies based on classical Raagas but also wrote heartsoothing lyrics of high literary quality for them. Gori Tera Gaaon Bada Pyaara Tu Jo Mere Sur Mein Sur Mila Le and Aaj Se Pehle Aaj Se Zyaada Khushi Aaj Tak Nahin Mili. If you ask for my favourite song from this movie it's Jab Deep Jale Aana Jab Shaam Dhale Aana which is based on Raag Yaman. Ravindra Jain introduced K.J. Yesudaas and Hemlata as playback singers from this album.True to its title this movie is a CHITCHOR who will steal your heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chitchor is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a tender story set somewhere in middle India. Nice story terrific performances and wonderful songs make me give this movie a 10.Why am I reviewing Chitchor now? I saw the movie as a kid in the early 1980s. Well  I have Zee movies on Dish now and was flipping channels when I saw this movie was due to start in an hours time. Set the timer and recorded it  so I can watch it a leisure and maybe a few times.SPOILERS BEGIN The story revolves around an Engineer Amol Palekar who arrives in this town for a construction project. A schoolteacher's family has advance notice of his arrival and are also told that he would be an ideal groom for their daughter Zarina Wahab. They basically wine and dine him and encourage their daughter to get close to him. However turns out he's not the engineer but merely the overseer. The engineer Vijayendra Ghatgearrives a few weeks later but by now the girl is basically in love with Amol Palekar's character. I'll leave the rest for the viewers to figure out SPOILERS END The songs are amazing. Jab Deep Jale Aana is an all time classic. Other songs including Gori Tera Gaon Badaa Pyaara Tu Joh Mere Sur Mein and Aaj Se Pehle are also very nice. This movie really highlighted the greatness of Yesudas' voice. It is an enduring mystery to me as to why he did not make it big in Hindi movies  maybe he did not pursue it aggressively.The acting is understated and wonderful. Amol Palekar is ideal for these kinds of movies playing the musical and romantic person who is typically unambitious professionally. Zarina Wahab echoes the energy of Jaya Bhaduri in her early movies Guddi for instance. The person who really acts wonderfully is Dina Pathak  the way she changes her behavior towards Amol Palekar's character once she realizes he's not the big shot she thought he was.All in all a terrific film".

Set the timer and recorded it  so I can watch it a leisure and maybe a few times.SPOILERS BEGIN The story revolves around an Engineer Amol Palekar who arrives in this town for a construction project. A schoolteacher's family has advance notice of his arrival and are also told that he would be an ideal groom for their daughter Zarina Wahab. They basically wine and dine him and encourage their daughter to get close to him. However turns out he's not the engineer but merely the overseer. The engineer Vijayendra Ghatgearrives a few weeks later but by now the girl is basically in love with Amol Palekar's character. I'll leave the rest for the viewers to figure out SPOILERS END The songs are amazing. Jab Deep Jale Aana is an all time classic. Other songs including Gori Tera Gaon Badaa Pyaara Tu Joh Mere Sur Mein and Aaj Se Pehle are also very nice. This movie really highlighted the greatness of Yesudas' voice. It is an enduring mystery to me as to why he did not make it big in Hindi movies  maybe he did not pursue it aggressively.The acting is understated and wonderful. Amol Palekar is ideal for these kinds of movies playing the musical and romantic person who is typically unambitious professionally. Zarina Wahab echoes the energy of Jaya Bhaduri in her early movies Guddi for instance. The person who really acts wonderfully is Dina Pathak  the way she changes her behavior towards Amol Palekar's character once she realizes he's not the big shot she thought he was.All in all a terrific film";

It failed to give a clear message about the intention of the movie. It was no doubt much better than any commercial venture because of its music narration and acting.

	schema:reviewBody "Chitchor is a wonderful comedy directed by the great Basu Chatterjee and as you would already predict it is one small and authentic picture which tells its story through its presentation of everyday realism and its ability to captivate without ever overdoing its story. There is something in this simplicity that is really engaging. Chitchor is a light musicallyabundant tale of a village couple who want to marry their growing daughter Geeta to a young successful engineer named Sunil only that for quite some time they mistake him for his supervisor Vinod who comes to the village several days before. The story deepens upon the arrival of Sunil and follows the proceedings when Geeta is already very much in love with Vinod.Chitchor is aided in equal parts by Chatterjee's wonderful direction the great cast and of course the classic soundtrack composed by Ravindra Jain. K. J. Yesudas and Hemalata perform brilliantly their numbers. Eash song is totally melodious and pleasant. Do take a listen to Gori Tera Gaon Aaj Se Pehle Jab Deep Jale Aana and my personal favourite Tu Jo Mere Sur Mein. Where acting goes every actor does well. A.K. Hangal and Dina Pathak are excellent as the loving parents. Amol Palekar is fantastic as the kindhearted and talented Vinod. Zarina Wahab is outstanding in a restrained performance which is mostly nonverbal. Vijayendra Ghatge lends adequate support and child actor Raju Shrestha also does exceedingly well.There's one aspect in the film that really struck me and it's the running time. At a little more than one hour and a half Chitchor is one of the shortest movies and it's great because so many Hindi movies are too long for the story they tell and here's a nice exception. The word chitchor means a heart stealer and the movie lives up to the premise. It is enjoyable simple and heartwarming and is without a doubt an amusing tale worth revisiting. Go for it.".

Well Godzilla comes and saves everybody and they start fighting really bizarrely similar to the Saturday night wrestling scenes from King Kong vs. Godzilla. They wrestle and wrestle some more. Though released in 1971 this is very sixties. Director Yoshimitsu Banno blends mind twisting images real scenes of Tokyo bay covered with sludge the scenes with the hippies disturbing scenes with dying babies on mutiple screens gory scenes of Hedorah's victems being reduced to skeletons scenes with the kid and his scientist father trying to figure out how to stop the monster and scenes with a newscaster. This is very poetic bizarre beautiful and sometimes extremely disturbing and has about the strongest anti pollution messages I've ever seen Japan was polluted the most back then.

Godzilla and the Smog Monster as it is sometimes referred to as start fighting only 25 minutes into the movie. The Hedorah mutates from ocean dweller to reptile to flying creature and experts conclude that He is probably from a distant Nebula in outer space. Scenes of havoc and the Professor's family is intercut with cartoon style sequences with strong enviromental messages.One scene has the Hedorah flying over a group of people working out and they turn bluefaced and ultimately into gushy skeletons. A man at a construction site screams out  extremely loud and then falls to his death. Hedorah has the ability to corrode metal and people on TV  quarrel intensely on the fate of the planet. The Professors assistant knows the end is near and has a hippiestyled party on top of a mountain  Let's have fun as we die!! The party is interrupted by the spacepollution freak and most of the kids are melted by its poisonous vomitdroppings when they try to set it on fire.The Professor's kid has found the solution to defeat the grotesque beast  Dry it  it's only sludge! and with the aid of the friendly Godzilla it finally works. Some scenes as well as the sounds the Hedorah makes are beyond description like the scene were it's covering Godzilla with its tons of toxic puke and at the same time laughing diabolically. There are weird crosscutting throughout the kid yells Papa alot and the groovy rock score helps to its remarkably insane mood. The PG rating should be reconsidered. This one is too dark and demented in so many ways I don't think a ten year old should watch it. It's mad nightmarish artcinematic style could cause damage.A TV reporter calls the Hedorah a freak organizm  much like this movie itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Godzilla vs Hedora AKA The Smog Monster is less slick than many of the later productions. It is also somewhat less serious and features a Godzilla who is more mythic than consistent with his earlier and later portrayals. The Godzilla in this film is a force of nature in more than just a figurative sense. She is also highly intelligent and a defender of the earth and to some extent its people.Even from the title its easy enough to figure out what this film is about. Tadpoles mutate because of the mutagenic properties of pollution in Tokyo Bay interestingly this somewhat silly idea is far less absurd than most of the latter pseudoscience used in Godzilla scripts  almost as bad as Star Trek Voyager sometimes was. The mutant tadpoles fuse at the cellular level and grow into a giant tadpole which then mutates three or four times spewing out its own toxic pollutants first as terrestrial and eventually as air pollution. The visuals are good but the special effects are admittedly below even Toho's usual standards.Created in the early 1970s this film is metaphorical and symbolic although it is still at heart a Godzilla film. Hedora is an unsubtle metaphor for the ecological state of the world and is in that sense a monster of our own making. Godzilla is an embodiment of nature and is to be viewed as a positive force for all life on earth. These symbols are particularly apparent in the use of cartoons as transitional devices from one plot point to another.Godzilla Vs Hedora walks a very thin line between giantmonster violence and a kidoriented film. As somebody who has since his early teens been interested in the environment and as somebody who always liked Japanese Monster films I developed a sentimental attachment to this film very early on. In fact this is my alltime favorite Godzilla film and more than any other film it is the reason why I consider myself a fan of the big green lizard. This is the film which establishes Godzilla as an environmentalist and a friend to young people  his two best roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the Godzilla series entered the 1970s a retro and hippie feeling could be seen in this movie. This film starts off with a singer played by Keiko Mari singing a song titled Save the Earth. Like 1964's Godzilla vs. Mothra this film delivers a message of environmental danger. The story's about heavy pollution problems occurring in Japan. When an alien spore from outer space enters Earth and lands on a pile of toxic waste in the sea a towering monster of sludge crap smog and goo attacks Japan. This is the first Godzilla Gojira film in many years that depicts numerous human casualties. Scenes of humans deforming are a gruesome sight and echo elements in the original Gojira film. Like a viewer said the fish tank scene is a similar scene of the fish tank in the original Gojira film.The central character in this movie is a boy played by Hiroyuki Kawase who idolizes Godzilla. Godzilla by this time is portrayed as a defender of Earth rather than a destructive force. Mostly there are no hints of fears from the people upon Godzilla's appearances. The line Get'em Godzilla! is a real charmer making the monster look more and more like a hero and defender of Japan.Yoshimitsu Banno did a good job directing and assembling the cast out staging them in places like nightclubs hills and amusement parks. The retro feel could be seen in the nightclub scene where the singer sings the title song as blobs of retro paint move in a movie screen behind her. Also the scene of the teenagers celebrating on a hill like a woodstock is also a retro feel.Takeshi Kimura gave us a dark and scientific story but some lighthearted scenes can be seen like the scene where Godzilla flies I think this is the only time we see Godzilla fly. Teruyoshi Nakano's special effects were believable plenty of monster battles albeit slow in some parts. Some of the problems I have with the monster battles is the part where Godzilla and Hedorah virtually move towards each other staring at each other for several minutes. The movie's cinematography lacks a little spirit and color making this movie look a little dull and the overall momentum of the film was a little slow. And this film lacks an effective music score. The music is not really harmonic or melodic and lacks charm to it. Riichiro Manabe composed a theme for Godzillaa theme played by overblown trumpets. Though somewhat wacky this theme sounds heroic for Godzilla. Overall a somewhat slow but an interesting Godzilla movie returning you to the darker and more serious themes of the series.Grade C".

	schema:reviewBody "7.8 B I don't know if I should call this movie refreshing disturbing a work of diamondintherough art or simply a film to watch if you're on something. Something very strong I might add. Perhaps it's all of those wrapped in a messy yet effortful presentation. Some look at the rating I gave it and probably remark Is he high? No I am not. Compared to the MechaGodzilla films of the 70s era this movie remarkable holds its own. Although I will never say it really surpassed the epic Terror of MechaGodzilla by far.First off let me say this Sony is overchildizing the marketing on these DVDs. Films like this along with Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla II with all its blood and coarse language are far from a PG rating. This film is remarkably dark on both ends 1 we see many disturbing shots like crowds of people killed at once by inhaling sulfuric mist leading to complete skeletazation later 2 A shot of bodies half submerged in Hedorah's goop 3 The main scientist has his face badly malformed by acid very early in the film. I wouldn't recommend to the too young of viewers.Now the monster battles here aren't necessarily the best but very interesting to say the least. Watching Godzilla punch holes in Hedorah seems only natural but Godzilla takes a beating. He loses an eye gets burned several times by acid and lasers and look closely has one hand eaten down to the bone by the climax. It's pretty decent. Hedorah himself itself?? is an interesting monster with all the forms and I like the design really. Even the odd shriek. Godzilla flying was a fcking nogo but Banno had no choice to add it in. Camp level is moderate but not unbearable in the Monster King's movements.The message in this movie is obvious don't pollute the damn Earth people! There are some great shots of a heavily polluted ocean that are quite nice and fit the gloomy mood of the film. The little anime sequences are somewhat fun to watch but yeah a tad unnecessary. Got to love the movie for that scene where one of our main characters must be drunk and on LSD yet another reason why this is not a PG flick and then sees everyone wherein polluted fish mask. How unexpected for a Gfilm but I like it. It strangely fits in actually. One reason I have to rate it down is because of a butchered sound track. The theme song would've been nice to hear once MAYBE twice but otherwiseit gets a tad annoying. Godzilla's theme was far from forgettable but not in the good way. Over all the score is probably the weakest aspect of the film.CharacterizationI believe the cast was all right and got the job done. Not enough about them really. I just haste that annoying little kid Papa! Papa! Papa! then he says it twenty more times. Sony always delivers crappy dubbing stick to the Japanese track. So all in all I give this film a decent rating. All those rating six and lower are too hard on the film. Appreciate it as a different type of Gfilm and a memorable trip back to the 70s.".

Hedorah himself itself?? is an interesting monster with all the forms and I like the design really. Even the odd shriek. Godzilla flying was a fcking nogo but Banno had no choice to add it in. Camp level is moderate but not unbearable in the Monster King's movements.The message in this movie is obvious don't pollute the damn Earth people! There are some great shots of a heavily polluted ocean that are quite nice and fit the gloomy mood of the film. The little anime sequences are somewhat fun to watch but yeah a tad unnecessary. Got to love the movie for that scene where one of our main characters must be drunk and on LSD yet another reason why this is not a PG flick and then sees everyone wherein polluted fish mask. How unexpected for a Gfilm but I like it. It strangely fits in actually. One reason I have to rate it down is because of a butchered sound track. The theme song would've been nice to hear once MAYBE twice but otherwiseit gets a tad annoying. Godzilla's theme was far from forgettable but not in the good way. Over all the score is probably the weakest aspect of the film.CharacterizationI believe the cast was all right and got the job done. Not enough about them really. I just haste that annoying little kid Papa! Papa! Papa! then he says it twenty more times. Sony always delivers crappy dubbing stick to the Japanese track. So all in all I give this film a decent rating. All those rating six and lower are too hard on the film. Appreciate it as a different type of Gfilm and a memorable trip back to the 70s.";

I like Godzilla sci fi  B horror G horror it does not matter.  I would recommend this to any Godzilla crazed fan that have not seen it. I also would really like to recommend two more good giant beast movies War of the Gargantuas and also Gamera Guardian of the Universe. I really enjoyed the green Gargantua  in the first one if you see this one just take a close look at the Green one's faceHe is awful ugly like a beast should be  and I liked the camera work in the second movie.

Executive producer Tomoyuki Tanaka was in the hospital for much of the time while the film was being made so he didn't see the different direction which Godzilla vs. Hedorah took. For the first time since 1964 the film had a strong social message stop the pollution! A series of grim grungy images show the pollution which is seeping into the air and the sea. From it rises Hedorah the smog monster intent on gobbling down the world's smog and pollution whilst killing off Earth's people. Bullets go through it knives do nothing to it. Who will stop this demon of drudge? Why Godzilla of course! Yoshimitsu Banno pointed the series in a different direction which enraged producer Tanaka upon his release from the hospital inserting funky tunes a scene in a revolting dance club and entirely unnecessary animations. Then there's the creepylooking Hedorah which actually becomes quite scary when you see it's glowing eyes in the dark gray night sky while the eerie bass guitar plays quietly amongst the soundtrack's instruments. This is certainly the weirdest creepiest Godzilla flick of 'em all.A sequel to this film was planned hence the And yet another one? title at the end of the film. In it Godzilla would travel to Africa and battle another smog monster.

To my surprise my mom offered to take us kids in the neighborhood to see Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster at the Lake Theater matine. I was so excited. I was going to see Godzilla loved all his movies as a kid have popcorn and be inside a huge movie theater!This experience was 32 years ago! Until last Saturday I could only remember 4 things 1 Waiting in my seat seaming like forever for the movie to start 2 The Smog Monster sucking on a smoke stack 3 The Smog Monster sliming down a flight of steps withdrawing and a cat being stuck in the slime residue and 4 A psychedelic discothque.Fast forward 32 years to 2004. Last Saturday night I was surfing cable and stumbled upon Godzilla vs. Hedora. I said to myself HmmmmmI don't remember this movie and thought I saw them all. What the heckit's Godzilla and I am up for some cheese.To my utter surprise fascination and joy I quickly saw the monster suck on a smoke stack and I said Oh my gosh!!!! It's the Smog Monster!!!!I had sudden flashbacks of my childhood. All of my memories returned!OK it's a bad movie. But so what? It served its purpose. It was designed for a 9 year old child and gave him memories of a lifetime. As bad as it is it must have entertained more children than just me because it has stood the test of time returning to AMC and The SciFi channel.I say Thanks for the memories.".

Well to be frank I think you'll have to have been living in a cave for the past thirty odd years not to know that anyway so as a film with a message it's very dated. Then there's the fact that this is a Japanese Godzilla film  even as one of those Gojira tai Hedorah isn't that great the fights are weak  unimaginative  the human character's are rubbish with Dr. Yano seemingly the only person in the entire world who wants to do something about the Smog Monster  he is confined to bed injured for the majority of the film.

There are better Godzilla films out there so this one is probably one for the fans or if your very bored.Director Banno doesn't do anything special the fights aren't the most exciting  that kid Ken is probably one of the most annoying character's I've seen in a while although luckily he completely disappears about halfway through the film. The scene when Godzilla flies is just plain embarrassing  what the hell are those cartoon interludes all about? Then there's a hallucinatory bizarre sequence set in a Japanses nightclub which has be been seen  heard to be believed along with a 'groovy' party set on Mount Fuji by some Japanese teenagers  who the hell were those dirty faced people spying on them from behind the bushes?! Oh  the opening titles ripoff the style used by the James Bond films. The special effects are no better or worse than any other Godzilla film I suppose although I thought the Smog Monster looked quite good as the reptile thing with slimy dripping tendril's  giant glowing red eyes but when it's shaped like a flying saucer gliding through the air it looks odd  somewhat silly to say the least. This is one strange film overall with some bizarre filmmaking decisions  techniques.Technically the film is alright the 2351 widescreen photography is nice enough if you can see it that way although the dubbing is absolutely terrible  I have to mention the annoying music which I thought was awful. Since it was shot in Japanese it's hard to tell about the original performances.Gojira tai Hedora is a pretty weak Godzilla film it doesn't have the fun or entertainment value of many other films from the series. I consider myself a Godzilla film fan  even I found this disappointing.".

Its cool how the monster attacks and I also love it when he moves. The fights between the Kinbg of the Monsters and Hedorah is really good. The acting by the film's human stars are also good.

	schema:headline " Weird Godzilla movie and one of my favorites.";
	schema:reviewBody "This Godzilla film is one of my favorite Godzilla films of the Showa era of Godzilla movies. What I like about it is that it is totally unique from the other films in this era. Kind of like Godzilla vs. Biolante of the later Hensei series as there is nothing like it either. I kind of scoff when someone says this one is childish and the demise of the Showa era of Godzilla films because to me it is one of the highlights and honestly I thought the Showa era ended strongly with the two Mecha Godzilla films. As for childish people die left and right in this one just because there is a kid present does not mean it is in the same class as Godzilla's Revenge or Godzilla vs. Megalon. No this one has a dark edge to it and while not perfect for me it was a lot of fun. I do prefer the Hensei Godzilla films more but only because the story is a bit better as far as connecting all the films. These are all connected too just not as clearly. I do prefer the Showa era to the Millennial Godzilla films as they are not really connected at all with the exception of the two Mecha Godzilla films. Here we get lots of Godzilla action we get lots of other monster action and we get strange cartoon interludes and really bizarre nightclub scenes with people donning fish masks.The story has mysterious monsters destroying oil tankers out at sea. A small boy and his father who is a scientist get injured when the father tries to uncover the reasons behind fish dying and the strange creatures dubbed Hedorah by the kid appearances. The strange creatures are found out to have the ability to join together by the father and soon it evolves to have the ability to walk on land and soon it is flying and creating havoc everywhere it goes! The only hope is Godzilla who has taken it upon himself to rid the world of this menace that feasts upon pollution and creates even more deadly pollution in its wake! The story has some of the most strange moments one will ever find in a Godzilla film like the aforementioned club scene. The cartoon interludes are just weird not sure what the point is but they kind of make up the film's charm. The characters are okay as the kid when you watch the subtitled rather than dubbed edition is not annoying and there are a few other interesting characters and then there is the mysterious younger guy in the film. I think he is the boy's father's brother as I think they referred to him as that one time but I am not sure. There is a girl that accompanies him but she may be his sister or something their relationship is never really clear either. One thing I can say for a rather major character he is offed in very unceremonious fashion. Poor guy gets killed and no one even bats an eye not the kid or the girl that may be his girlfriend or sister.So this one was a fun Godzilla flick and one of my favorites from the era. I think Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla is my number one though. This film however was a more unique film than that one as it featured Hedorah a monster made out of sludge and for reasons unknown would always be portrayed as kind of weak in other media after this film. In games and in Final Wars. He gave Godzilla everything he could handle in this one and then some! I always loved it when they showed this on those old independent stations back in the day I remember Godzilla marathons and I always got excited when they showed this one and MechaGodzilla but later marathons would not have these and only do like Godzilla vs. King Kong and Megalon which was okay but not as awesome as this one!".

	schema:headline " A muddled seemingly drug fueled mess of a monster movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster is the kind of movie that doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It must be a kid's movie because the protagonist is an annoying kid who idolizes Godzilla. Yet some scenes would be more at home in a horror film as when crowds of people are asphyxiated and skeletonized by the smog monster's noxious emissions. At other times there are signs that this movie wants to be a drug fueled exploitation flick. There are weird cartoon sequences that seem inspired by Yellow Submarine and at one point a character in a dance club starts hallucinating for no apparent reason that his fellow partygoers have paper Mache fish for heads. There's also a perfunctory astronomy lesson with no real connection to the rest of the film plus a shot where Hedorah the titular Smog Monster flies through a construction site and the structure collapses but with no sound. Was the recording track for scene damaged at some point? If that were the case you would think the filmmakers could rerecord the sound effects or substitute a clip from the studio's library.But I'm forgetting what this movie is all about which is Godzilla and the need to protect the environment. In 1971 when the film was released this message had not yet become a clich in children's movies. It was also a very relevant at a time when there was little to no regulation of factory emissions and hazardous waste disposal and when rivers in downtown Cleveland could suddenly burst into flames.But Godzilla makes a very odd environmental spokesman to say the very least. When he first appeared in 1954's Gojira he was the embodiment of the death and destruction that nuclear weapons could and had unleashed on Japan and on the world. Now however he is Tokyo's savior a completely benign figure who doesn't knock over a single building even by accident. Godzilla doesn't always have to play the villain but he should at least be an antihero dangerous to man even when he's protecting us from other monsters. Godzilla also makes one of his least dramatic entrances in this film. Instead of slowly rising from the sea or bursting out of an iceberg he ambles out of the sunrise as annoying trumpet music blares. Regrettably this score will be repeated in most scenes where the big guy appears. As for Godzilla's opponent Toho has come up with one of its cooler ideas here. Hedorah is not a single organism but rather colony of billions of rapidly splitting microorganisms. This means that it can change form at will and can repair almost any damage suffered by producing new cells. Unfortunately the idea just didn't work. What we end up with at least in the monster's final form is a giant misshapen blob of rubber under which the actor can barely move. This brings us to the battles between the monsters usually the high point of any Godzilla film. Some of the earlier fights aren't too badly staged but once Hedorah learns to fly Godzilla's main tactic seems to be standing around and failing his arms angrily. And as for the final battle near Mount Fuji having the military build a pair of giant electrodes to dehydrate the Smog Monster is a fairly good idea since by this point it's clear that Godzilla can't do it on his own.But why oh why did this have to mean a protracted sequence in which our hero rips apart his now helpless opponent piece by piece twice! to make sure that every drop of moisture is evaporated? Wouldn't it have been more effective for Hedorah to instantly dry out and crumble to dust like a vampire exposed to sunlight? This isn't Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster it's Godzilla vs. the giant mud pie.There's also the question of how Godzilla knew the purpose and operation of the electrodes and why his atomic breath provided power to them rather than blasting them to bits like everything else it touches. But this isn't where our suspension of disbelief is really tested. I mentioned earlier that Godzilla had to go through the process of drying out Hedorah twice. This is because the first time there proves to some life still left in the blob of filth and its prior flying form escapes into the sky. So how does Godzilla catch up to his rival and bring him back? Simple he flies after him. That's right Godzilla actually flies by using his atomic breath as a form of jet propulsion. This may be the single most ridiculous sequence in the history of Japanese cinema.I'm not recommending that no one ever see this movie. It achieves a sort of campy grandeur almost to the point of being so bad that it's good. I would suggest viewing this film just once so you can gawk in amazement at its sheer awfulness. Or if that's too much for you just type in Godzilla flies on YouTube. You won't be disappointed by the result.".

	schema:headline " A unique entry in the Godzilla series.";
	schema:reviewBody "For Godzilla's first entry into the 1970s amateur director Yoshimitsu Banno was chosen to direct. Banno was a rather different breed of director inspired by films such as Africa Addio and other exploitation and arthouse cinema. Helping him create the story was veteran Godzilla screenwriter Takeshi Kimura who read Rachel Carson's call to arms for the environmentalist movement Silent Spring as inspiration for his story treatment. Banno created an extremely unorthodox film combining splitscreens to show people's reactions to Hedorah's rampage with odd anime sequences to show random parts of Hedorah's attacks as well as poetry in one scene. What is unique about Godzilla vs. Hedorah's story treatment is how the film parallels to the original 1954 opus. The scientist Dr. Yano played by television star Akira Yamaguchi is an eyepatched scientist and the devastation wrought by Hedorah has elements unseen since the original namely on screen human deaths depicted in rather graphic fashion by effects master Teruyoshi Nakano who specialized in showing hideous injuries to both monsters and humans as well as pyrotechnics. Godzilla is portrayed as a hero for the first time in the series an image which both benefits and harms the character. Providing the music for the series was Riichiro Manabe a composer known for being Nagisa Oshima's composer of choice. His Godzilla theme derived from a cue culled from the 1970 war film A TURNING POINT IN SHOWA HISTORY THE MILITARISTS is unorthodox utilizing trumpets light synthesizer work and pipe organ. The films theme song Taiyou Kaese is sung beautifully by famed nude model and singer Keiko Mariwith backing from the male choral group Honey Knights who also do renditions of the song in various points of the film who also acts in the film. His score is very fitting for such an unorthodox film. The acting is well directed with Hiroyuki Kawase being not that annoying as young Ken Yano. Also in a lead role is teen idol Toshio Shiba who seems rather happy and carefree as Ken's uncle. Teruyoshi Nakano's effects are well done considering the restraints put on him timewise. He filmed much of the scenes with director Banno giving them a much larger scope. I recommend this film it's bizarre and very avantgarde but very fun.".

What is unique about Godzilla vs. Hedorah's story treatment is how the film parallels to the original 1954 opus. The scientist Dr. Yano played by television star Akira Yamaguchi is an eyepatched scientist and the devastation wrought by Hedorah has elements unseen since the original namely on screen human deaths depicted in rather graphic fashion by effects master Teruyoshi Nakano who specialized in showing hideous injuries to both monsters and humans as well as pyrotechnics. Godzilla is portrayed as a hero for the first time in the series an image which both benefits and harms the character. Providing the music for the series was Riichiro Manabe a composer known for being Nagisa Oshima's composer of choice. His Godzilla theme derived from a cue culled from the 1970 war film A TURNING POINT IN SHOWA HISTORY THE MILITARISTS is unorthodox utilizing trumpets light synthesizer work and pipe organ. The films theme song Taiyou Kaese is sung beautifully by famed nude model and singer Keiko Mariwith backing from the male choral group Honey Knights who also do renditions of the song in various points of the film who also acts in the film. His score is very fitting for such an unorthodox film. The acting is well directed with Hiroyuki Kawase being not that annoying as young Ken Yano. Also in a lead role is teen idol Toshio Shiba who seems rather happy and carefree as Ken's uncle. Teruyoshi Nakano's effects are well done considering the restraints put on him timewise. He filmed much of the scenes with director Banno giving them a much larger scope. I recommend this film it's bizarre and very avantgarde but very fun.";

The director leads the viewer through some profound aspects of humanity with such brilliance and in my opinion swiftness that to pass it by would be a shame.";

	schema:reviewBody "It seems to me that I see Tarkovsky' movies differently from many other people. For me this film is not too long or boring. For me this is one of the best movies ever made.Western culture has a very long tradition of filmmaking. Usually typical western movie is focused on story. Of course  not always The sharpness and tension of the movie are achieved by the big number of cuts or by the fast varying of shots or by the sudden varying of plans or by some surprising angle of camera etc. Tarkovsky don't like cuts. The number of cuts is minimal. His camera is moving like in dream Bergman envied Tarkovsky for that it has no angles at all. Colours are pale dirty very tender soft almost blackandwhite.In a typical western movie dialog is followed by the camera. Picture is illustrating text and is subordinated to it. In Stalker text and visual image are coexisting cooperating with eachother. Both are moving on their own ways but at the same time somehow  harmonically. Text and picture are not subordinated they are both independent.Why is Tarkovsky using such a weird language? Surely not only because he wants to opposite the dogmas of western cinema. He has a positive message too. Audience of his films has to understand his films not only at the level of thinking or emotions but at the level of much deeper consciousness. Therefore watching his movies means rather meditation than watchingTVandeatingpopcorn. The purpose of Tarkovsky's films is to loose the mind of audiences to wake it up to much deeper attention. So that audiences can simply watch and see.Stalker is not an entertainment and is not supposed to be. It means there is no sense at all to watch Stalker when you need some amusing entertainment. Stalker is a serious movie. It is very narrowminded to evaluate movies on the assumption of entertainment only. Of course we live in the world of movieconsumers produced by powerful filmcompanies demanding more and more and more exciting entertainment. Consumer doesn't understand this movie. For him it is big bore.".

	schema:headline " The Zone";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is loosely based on Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's Road Side Picnic and Tarkovsky tried as he did with his Solaris 1972 to downplay the science fiction aspect of Stalker. Except for a brief explanation at the film's beginning Tarkovsky chooses to ignore the speculations as to what could have created The Zone and the changes within it.With Stalker Tarkovsky marks the shift toward his later style with the long takes throughout the film averaging one minute in length with many four minutes or longer. These long scenes in turn rely heavily on the talent of the actors to sustain the mood like Writer's long monologue in the sand mogul room. In Stalker Tarkovsky is definitively more systematic in his use of blackandwhite sepia and color stocks than he had been in his previous works. In the swamp scene and Stalker's dream Tarkovsky reverts to is more usual convention where dreams are shown in blackandwhite and reality in color. However the last scene is in color implying a leakage of the powers of The Zone into the outside reality.As always in Tarkovsky's films the natural world is present. Water which used to be the source of life a redemptive force and a center of regeneration is now mostly a symbol of decay and pollution. The only exception is in the dream scene in the swamp where the water is somewhat restored to its positive symbols. In the last scene in The Zone the men resigned to their limitations and weakness sit outside The Room as the rain falls inside gently blocking them from entering.The wind is associated with the spiritual and the earth is a positive force. Upon arriving in The Zone Stalker's first act is to lie down and embrace it and in the swamp all three men lay on it. Like a miracle there is the luxuriant if dangerous Nature ever present in the Zone in contrast to the polluted outside world where it is totally absent.And then there is the mysterious dog which first appears in the swamp scene. Up to this point the men felt totally alienated from their environment outside and inside The Zone and it is at the very moment when they start to meditate and remember that the dog appears The Zone is its territory. But at the end of the film the dog has followed Stalker outside the Zone showing that even there the hope that the men were looking for inside The Zone must somehow also exist here outside as the dog establishes its own space even though it becomes domesticated in the process.Although Tarkovsky usually favors classics by such composers as Bach Pergolesi or Purcell the musical score in Stalker consists almost exclusively of Eduard Artemiev's electronic music mixed with some folk melodies contributing efficiently to the hypnotic atmosphere of the film.The performances of Nikolia Grinko and Anatoly Solonitsyn as two lost souls in search of an answer are convincing. Aleksandr Kajdanovsky is outstanding in his role of a tormented and somewhat pathetic Stalker. Although Alisa Frejndlikh's appearance in the film is restricted to only few scenes there are most powerful.In Stalker Tarkovsky opposes a world in decline polluted and sterile to a verdant Zone which has gotten the better of any human enterprises. He portrays a society which has severed all links with nature with its own past and lost its spiritual or moral bearings.Stalker explores the conflict between science rationalism materialism and cynicism versus spirituality faith art and love. The three men embody different philosophical principles. Professor is a rational being who tries to understand the world according to the law of physics. He justifies his going into The Zone as purely scientific curiosity. Writer belongs to those people who cannot accept the world as it is. He is well aware of humanity's decay and of his own as well but he abhors science which he does not understand and would rather look for answers in the supernatural. Writer believes in the redemptive power of art but he has lost his own inspiration.Stalker is alone in showing an inclination toward faith. He knows The Zone and has total faith in it speaking about it as if it were a living being. Stalker respects and fears The Zone at the same time as he recognizes its potential to provide comfort to the wretched ones who like himself have lost all hope but at the same time it punishes who so ever infringes its rules. This of course is how most religious people see their own Gods.The redemptive power of love is personified by Stalker's wife. Her love and devotion is the final miracle which opposes cynicism and the emptiness of the modern world. All these ideas are clearly expressed at the film's end as she addresses the audience in her heartfelt monologue.As the three characters reach The Room they can ask for their dearest wishes to be granted but this would require a painful and searching selfexamination with the realization that what they thought they wanted was not exactly what they now really want. For Professor his true aim was to destroy The Room which was beyond his scientific understanding. Writer had said that the purpose of his journey was to regain his genius his inspiration. However on the threshold of The Room he realizes that he may not worthy of accepting The Room's gift. As for Stalker he asks for nothing of The Room his only purpose to make the trip being to bring hope and happiness to those most retched than he.Stalker is certainly Tarkovsky's most complex and most beautiful film and is worthy of many viewings to appreciate its aesthetic and depth. Unfortunately the word limitation of this review does not allow one to explore all the intricacies of this extraordinary film and do it justice.".

Much like Kubrick in terms of directive style and character study Tarkovsky puts the viewer in a kaleidoscopic landscape of mood and emotion. No clichs here though. I have not read the story which the movie is based upon but from what I understand the characters in the film all develop a healing understanding of each other.

	schema:reviewBody "My first Tarkovsky experience and I'm overwhelmed by its imagery power. The film is pure joy which admittedly requires some time and open mindness.'Stalker' begins when the camera navigates into a room as if we are entering an art gallery. In those images of introduction there is a strange tension between calm peace but also a threatening feeling of mysteriousness. It is a feeling which goes throughout the whole film some sort of a basic flow or vibration which keep fantasy and thoughts of the viewer always busy. The picture of the three persons in the bed the Stalker and his family appears as a painting or a collage showing primary luck and happiness but being now doomed to downfall. This extremely intense atmosphere is capturing and therefore very 'joyful' to watch and go through.I won't get into plot details. Just some things on the characters first The three persons who enter the Zone are representing different kinds of human ideologies coming along as a soul trip. We have the Stalker the one who leads the other two into the forbidden area. He stands for individuality. He is an obsessive a desperate who escapes his real life and believes he can only exist and unfold himself in the Zone. The writer cynical and sarcastic a quitter embodies the nihilistic ideology of the civilization. The professor represents the scientific conscience.The Zone sometimes appears to be as not real but maybe also shows the inner cosmos of the three men. Tarkowsky kind of abolishes the difference between inner and outer world by permanently switching from monologues to dialogues from blackwhite to color from closeups to totals and the other way round.That's not it not only a soul trip of three failed men and in that respect of human conscience but it's also the urge to get to the insight the truth the veracity of the damaging progressive human civilization. You see rotting industrial constructions and instruments you see how the nature takes back what it has lost captured in beautiful picture compositions i.e. the fish in the river surrounded by cans a Christ figure coins and oil.What makes the film quite intriguing is that it's not only an apocalyptic description not only all negative. In the stunning imagery especially the image of water you see the miracle of life something wonderful and esthetically very appealing.At the end the wife of the Stalker asks him 'What would be life without harm?' A life without harm would be also a life without happiness and hope. She who didn't want him to go welcomes him again and brings him to bed.His daughter without legs and that is the most powerful and enthralling shot I hardly have seen before in a film sits at a table we see her profile of the face and she is silent. She looks at three cups moves them with the power of telekinesis one falls on the floor and breaks into pieces. Is that the will of God? The power of free will? The influence of the Zone? Do the three glasses represent the traveling men? Maybe this picture alone is the expression of the mystery of life the question on how we effectuate what we cause and what we shall effectuate in this world and in it's nature. Maybe it is the question on the ranking of love and passion when Stalker's wife doubts a life without harm and happiness and hope. Maybe Tarkowsky hits on his own society in the communist totalitarian Soviet Union. Maybe the film goes beyond that and doubts other promises of fortune of other societies. Maybe. Certainly.".

The debates between the characters are intriguing. The journey into the zone is one of the finest dream pieces I've ever seen on film. The problem is that these parts cannot save the whole. STALKER contains far too many mood sequences in which the plot takes a break and poetry takes over. The film's symbolism is all glaringly obvious and can't justify the monstrously bad pacing. The ending is also a major letdown. What the hell happened? Tarkovsky started his carreer with brilliant promise. Then it all went to hell with SOLARIS. This is better in spots than SOLARIS but not much better. The story could have been told more effectively in the space of 85 just over half its running time. I usually enjoy long movies but this one was death due to pacing and an overdependence on meaning. Skip this and see ANDREI ROUBLEV instead.".

The most important which could be found in many comments  is that he does not offer us a very clear interpretation  leaving us to guess wonder and question ourselves.My interpretation of this film is that the whole trip to the Zone and to its core the Room its a metaphor for the dangerous trip the human soul takes in searching the redemption and finally the Kingdom of Heaven. Stalker like Jesus is the one who shows the way to this kingdom  and there are some arguments to this idea. First before entering the dangerous Zone he lies on the grass thinking or praying? just like Jesus did in the garden of Ghetsimani before being crucified. Stalker is the one who shows who could reach the final point of this trip not the good or the bad but the desperate ones. Stalker is the one who fights with the professor another metaphor for the rational and logical part of our minds who wants to destroy the Zone and also Stalker is the one who in the end laments over the lack of will people have to enter the Zone and to believe in its powers.There are so many powerful shots in this film and I choose only some who really got to me 1. the destroyed tanks in the first part of the trip are for me the communist weapons who tried to destroy the faith and the church in Russia and in the other communist countries. They failed. 2. the objects shown in the water when the 3 heroes sleep near it the money the weapon the tiles under the water describe the precarity of our material world. 3.the water in the film from the beginning until the end  it is pure poetry. 4. one dialog between the writer an Stalker the writer is saying who needs your room i don't need your room  it reminded me the dialog between Ivan Karamazov and Alexei Karamazov the first saying to the other I don't need your GodBut this is only one interpretation and if it would be the only one we would not be talking about a great great film.".

I am not a hater of slow paced movies my favorite film of all time is 2001 a space odyssey but some movies like this one manage to drag you through what seems like five hours of mud without any payoff that you expect from a movie directed by a snail. This film very easily could have been a short story or a novella as the whole film was just simply walking and walking and then an occasional pause that the characters would take to reflect on universal truths and the meaning of their lives. Two hours could have been edited out. There are shots that last over five minutes where the camera does not move the least bit and there seems to be no motive whatsoever for this decision. I felt many waves of pretentious as I sat through these laboriously long takes that gave the impression that the director did not in fact no how to build tension or emotion in a scene except by letting the characters handle it. This works in Woody Allen movies but in this film since the dialog is so repetitive and there is rarely any dramatic movement from the characters you are left with the urge to gouge your own eyes out. I would rather eat my own flesh than watch this pointless exercise in pretentiousness and boredom.

	schema:reviewBody "Taking its inspiration from an Eastern bloc scifi novel entitled The Roadside Picnic by Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky Stalker is a film that literally typifies Andrei Tarkovsky's approach to filmmaking. Mysterious personal elliptical beautiful philosophical disturbing inspiring  all at the same time. But there are two factors above all others that make this film truly a work of genius. Firstly if Tarkovsky ever intended the audience to glean one specific interpretation of his film he never shows his cards thereby inviting every individual viewer to undergo an experience vastly different than the person sitting next to them. Secondly Stalker is one of those rare films that replays and resonates in your mind long after it has finished. You may be driving along months after you last saw it and an image or idea from the film might suddenly pop into your mind. You may be running a bath one morning and for no obvious reason find your musing about one of the many mysteries generated in the film.In a small unspecified country there exists a Zone where the laws of science and logic cease to hold true. The Zone was formed following a meteorite strike or possibly a celestial visitation. Now the border of the Zone is continually patrolled by armed guards with instructions to prevent anyone from entering. And there are plenty of people who WOULD like to enter for rumours abound that at the centre of the Zone lies a Room where innermost wishes can be granted. Stalker Aleksandr Kajdanovsky makes a living by smuggling people into the Zone and guiding them through its hazardous landscape to the Room. His wife Alisa Frejndlikh has grown to detest his frequent absences on such dangerous jobs more so because while he is away she must tend to their daughter Monkey Natasha Abramova physically disabled yet in possession of telekinetic powers due to her father's exposure to the Zone. Stalker finds himself taking two new customers into the Zone  Writer Anatoli Solonitsyn who wishes to find fresh inspiration and Professor Nikolai Grinko who claims to be fascinated by the scientific mysteries within the Zone but is in fact on a secret mission to blow it up in order to prevent the potential for an evil person to have their darkest wishes granted at the Room.Tarkovsky presents the outer world as an impoverished litterstrewn dump shot in endlessly dull sepia colours while the scenes based in the Zone are filmed in striking colour to emphasis the lush greenery. But he also makes the Zone seem permanently dangerous with Kajdanovsky uttering cryptic warnings about its everchanging pathways and wearing furtive fearful expressions upon his face all the time they are there. By having his camera more often than not positioned at some distance from the characters Tarkovsky makes the audience feel like spies and this in turn creates paranoid suspense as if the three main characters are continually being watched by some unknown force. In the film's stunning climax Stalker assumes messianic characteristics  he breaks down in tears and laments the fact that nobody he has taken to the Room has fulfilled their dreams. Nobody believes. Nobody! Who am I going to take there? Oh God And what's most awful is that noone needs it. Noone needs that room and all my efforts are just in vain. Like Jesus Stalker is trying to convince people that they MUST have faith. Tarkovsky's shattering conclusion is that he cannot win in the face of a cynical society but the one redeeming fact is that his daughter's amazing powers may give her strength to succeed where her father has not. This is challenging essential cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrei Tarkovsy's STALKER is one of these films whose reputation is entirely confined to that of Universiy level film studies . It's a film that remains unknown to people who visit multiplexes on a Friday night to watch the latest blockbuster from Hollywood and is rarely shown on network television . I think its only broadcast on British television was on Channel 4 in 1990 or 1991 . Nevertheless it was well regarded enough to make it in to the the lower reaches of the IMDb Top 250 for a couple of years but I'm rather puzzled as to why ? It's not a film produced for the masses which possibly sums the up inherent irony of communism The story starts 20 years after a meteorite has landed on Earth and when people have started disappearing in the crash zone the authorities quarantine the area which is now referred to as  the Zone  . A trio of men sneak through the blockade determined to find out the secret of the Zone This is communist science fiction based upon a story written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky . Communist science fiction differs quite markedly from its Western counterpart by concentrating on metaphysics  man's relationship to the natural order rather than plot driven concepts . In many ways it's introspective humanism rather than mind expanding and imaginative . This type of story would appeal well to Tarkovsky since his volume of wok centres around elemental imagery such as water and wind . He is a film maker who is the archetypal auteur The problem with all this is that it makes for a rather unengaging piece of cinema . If you're expecting to see aliens you'll be disappointed . There is an argument that science fiction doesn't need aliens in order to work and this is certainly true  think of the number of novels by people such as John Christopher that feature Earth shattering eco disasters for a premise . But if you had three men in Soviet Russia escaping in to a forbidden zone where they walk around discussing the human condition for three hours then you'd have the exact same story devoid of any science fiction heading . In short STALKER isn't really a science fiction film at all At least the film sets out its stall right from the very beginning . We're treated to the type of camera work seen in films by luminaries as Bela Tarr where the camera moves about for several minutes without cutting . We don't actually get any dialogue until ten minutes in to the running time and if you're bored senseless by then then it's perhaps a good idea to watch something else because the pace doesn't really improve much One of the comments on this page states that STALKER is  Like Last Of The Summer Wine set in Russia  and that's a very accurate description of the movie . It's composed of three philosophical men wandering about the countryside making profound statements on the nature of existence . You might rub your chin and nod in agreement but you might also have to rub your eyes in order to stay awake too".

No Mostly I hated it because i just finished reading the book it's based on Roadside Picknick. I love this Book because you rarely come across a more chilling or atmospheric story about an alien culture meeting ours. I thought a movie made from this book must be great because you could do something outstanding even on a low budget. So I really looked forward to watch this one. What did I get? 3 Guys talking endlessly. It felt like being back to school and forced to watch a philosophical stage play of three hours length. The worst thing is that the strugatzkibrothers themselves screwed this up. It almost seems as if they wrote the screenplay with the intention to eliminate everything which was great about their own novel. I keep it short and give you a list of the outrageous decisions they madeIN THE BOOK the main guy Roderic is a hardarsed scavenger who is sort of addicted to the bizarre Nature of the Zone. IN THE MOVIE he is a whimsical biblequoting coward in search of some sort of divine illumination. IN THE BOOK you experience the deadly traps and anomalies of space and time the Zone is contaminated with. IN THE MOVIE you don't see SHT and nobody even hurts his ankle  despite HOURS of dialogs emphasizing how dangerous the slightest movement can be. IN THE BOOK the Zone is a lifeless industrial wasteland where not even birds are to be seen. IN THE MOVIE you have the impression of a nice stroll through a green landscape with some bunker ruins in it. IN THE BOOK there are lots of alien artifacts that most effectively create an impression of their culture and technology. IN THE MOVIE you get some strange sounds also the aliens are completely reduced to a humble meteorite. IN THE BOOK Roderics Daughter is disfigured by the strange effects of the Zone on human beings. IN THE MOVIE she's mentioned to be mutated too but looks perfectly normal. IN THE BOOK you have really creepy stuff like the meatmincer or the walking Dead  IN THE MOVIE you don't.I could go on like this for hours. Let me just put it like this If they just had made a lousy Bmovie I would be perfectly OK. I don't blame anyone for screwing up it doesn't suit me. But this Disgrace of a movie was done this way ON PURPOSE! It is simply a violation of a great ScienceFictionNovel and can only be enjoyed by Philosophystudents who mistake everything for high art as long as it's boring enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading the reviews on IMDb has cemented what I have always felt about this film and about art in general. It is not always about a product that sums things up in a tidy sentence or a two hour film. It is possible to criticize this film based on the conventions of the medium but thats besides the point. Sure the stalker is the only fleshed out character but the writer and the scientist are not even supposed to be characters to begin with. I think its fairly obvious they are archetypes that represent a conflict. Some people have said that the science versus religion thing is tired this is missing the point completely!!!! Its the absurdity of trying to reduce any conflict to a duality to begin with. The scene where we observe them sitting together makes it all very clear. We are observing them from the very room itself where our innermost desires are laid bare and revealed. With this insight we can see that there is no duality to begin with but only different ways to strive towards an understanding the characters are joined together their separation dissolves. Someone mentioned that this film is straining for deepness and many a viewer will constantly feel this strain. They seemed a little confused because most films strain for this as do most people!!!!! A successful film will always have this strain because that is part of our existence. Stalker evokes that yearning and allows us to feel it and that is one of its best qualities I think. To actual visually embody the yearning for meaning thats what A.T. has done here.Stalker vs. Solaris Another point of contention on IMDb Most people seem to like a Solaris more...all I will say is this Solaris is much more obvious and much more straightforward. I guess people find it easier but in its supposed humanism its actually quite sterile its clean. It presents human problems but through a haze of greatness that you will find with a lot of art. Its filmed from a further distance is what I am trying to say.Stalker is the down and dirty the swamp the overgrowth insects water rotting rust. Its a much more dynamic world just like our striving is much more dynamic than duality. Its dark confusing musty a little frightening but extremely beautiful. I would like to mention the use of the word pretentious. If you have you used the word pretentious in your review please read a dictionary and understand a word before you use it. That word is used constantly to instantly demonize something. It is the equivalent of calling someone an antisemite. It is loaded and works against serious discussion and observation. THIS FILM IS NOT PRETENTIOUS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS OR HOLD ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE!!!!!!! It just exists as it does and its people afterwords that attach importance to it. A.T. refused to ever state clearly what this film is about. So you can discount everything that I just said and anyone else said about it. Like life like existence itself there is no clear meaning.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this enchanting film for the first time when I was 10 or so and I've been fascinated with Leslie Caron's characterization of Cinder' Ella ever since.  Those beautiful expressive eyes!  Some have called Caron's portrayal bratty' but I think her Ella is not only convincing but also heartwarming.  Of course you are supposed to feel bad for this dirty little servant girl who is forced to take out the ashes but instead of feeling sorry for herself she continues to act out' against those who shun her which I think gives her an appealingly strong character. The art direction and costuming are gorgeous!  Cinderella's massive pink and frilly borrowed' ball gown is exquisitely detailed with crystals and roses and the glass slippers are pure magic! As a dancer I find the ballet dream sequences quite impressive and exciting to watch but my one main problem with this film would have be casting Michael Wilding as a ballet dancer in the Princess Tehara dream sequence. Wilding is obviously not a dancer and I wished they had cast someone who could actually hold his own next to Caron's wonderful technique. Estelle Winwood as Mrs. Toquet is certainly worth the price of admission.and then some!  She is a funny poignant and an amusing fairy godmother. Overall I find The Glass Slipper a wonderfully delightful diversion!".

When she helps Ella the 'Cinder' prefix comes later go to the ball she 'borrows' a coach and steals a gown and has something of a needleinahaystack challenge in fixing her charge's unruly hair. Leslie Caron a positively beautiful dancer in her early years is made to look less pretty than she really is and the film throws a symbolic moral at the viewer by making the stepsisters conventionally beautiful but still harboring nasty personalities. With this scenario we are allowed to judge the central character by her spirit and intelligence something that would be reimagined 40 years later in the film EVER AFTER. It is not meant to be taken too seriously how can it be with Walter Pigeon's extremely dry narration? I didn't care for the Petit fantasy ballets they just seem to interrupt the action instead of advancing it but loved the fact that the prince and Ella meet in the glen before seeing each other at the ball creating something of a real love story. It is a shame that Leslie Caron did not continue to dance on film after this year as all of her subsequent films were 'Gigi' and then straight dramas. Check this out it is one of MGM's lesser known but every bit as impressive.".

The local villagers are likewise indifferent to her and as narrator Walter Pigeon dryly observes her spirit is in danger of being broken as a result. Enter local madwomankleptomaniac Estelle Winwood who simply by reaching out to the defiant girl gives her confidence and hope. Yes she's the film's equivalent of the fairy godmother and she is wonderful in the part. Although the prince a mature Michael Wilding leaves a bit to be desired in the ''Charming''department he is perfectly all right otherwise. Keenan Wynn is wasted as his companion but Barry Jones is amusing as the prince's father and Miss Lanchester makes a suitably nasty stepmother. what of Leslie Caron? Well she goes from neglected little spitfire to luminous princess effortlessly and her appearance at the ball is a treat. The ballet sequences do tend to slow the film down but Miss Caron did begin her career as a dancer and she has a grace few others could match. The music by Bronislau Kaper perfectly enhances the mood as does the modest but tasteful production. Strangely enough this could be called the original Ever After because except for a delightful twist at the end the tale is told as if it could have happened. All in all a captivating version of Cinderella and one which will linger in your memory.".

He had a nice career going for himself in England before marrying Elizabeth and moving to the US. Hollywood didn't quite know what to do with him and he didn't have that many good or even likely roles here. In England he and Britain's favorite blonde Anna Neagle made several films in which she sang and the two of them danced kind of a poor man's version of Rogers and Astaire so he did dance in films before this picture but I'm afraid he wasn't terrifically impressive as a dancer. But boy he had charm!When I first saw this film I thought it was a bit simplistic but I was won over by Leslie Caron a favorite of mine. And it was gratifying to see Michael Wilding though he didn't get to do much here. Loved Estelle Winwood she too was always good. Altogether a very pleasant movie pretty to watch if just a little slow. Or maybe it seemed that way because with this story there are no surprisesyou know how it will end!".

In England he and Britain's favorite blonde Anna Neagle made several films in which she sang and the two of them danced kind of a poor man's version of Rogers and Astaire so he did dance in films before this picture but I'm afraid he wasn't terrifically impressive as a dancer. But boy he had charm!When I first saw this film I thought it was a bit simplistic but I was won over by Leslie Caron a favorite of mine. And it was gratifying to see Michael Wilding though he didn't get to do much here. Loved Estelle Winwood she too was always good. Altogether a very pleasant movie pretty to watch if just a little slow. Or maybe it seemed that way because with this story there are no surprisesyou know how it will end!";

	schema:reviewBody "Why wasn't this film more successful and why isn't it more well known  than it was and is?  It is an utterly delightful and original take on the Cinderella story in which almost every element is just right.  Leslie Caron is completely enchanting as Ella.  True she may not be an amazingly gorgeous beauty in her ball gown but she is radiant nevertheless. Especially those eyes.  Oh those expressive eyes!  They show you the true beauty beneath her outward plainness.  She is a wonderful actress and phenomenal ballet dancer as demonstrated in the wonderful dream ballet sequences in which she dances with the Roland Petit ballet company.  These sequences may seem unnecceasry at first but they turn out to do exactly what the ballet dances in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals do They express the character's emotions in ways that not even dialogue and music can.  They are indeed a vital part of the film.  Estelle Winwood is charming as Ella's eccentric fairy godmother.  Walter Pidgeon's uncredited narration is pithy and wise.  True Michael Wilding is indeed a bit bland as Prince CharmingCharles though not really all that bad and this is one of Kennan Wynn's weakest appearences except for his reaction when he sees Ella at the ball but all in all these are tiny flaws in one underrated gem of a film.".

For instance Cinderella is NOT a very nice person in this film. As a result of being made fun of for her frumpy appearance she is a rather shorttempered personmaking her more complex and interesting compared to the perfect version in the Disney film. Her sisters too are NOT uglyjust vain and selfcentered. It's also nice because unlike the traditional story this one is much more romanticand this is probably the best aspect of the movie. Seeing Leslie Caron in love scenes with the Price though she thought the character played by Michael Wilding was just a cook was delightful. The only serious problem with the film were some of the dance sequences. The dream sequence with the ballet just went on way too long and I am sure it tended to alienate many in the audienceI know it did that for me. In many ways this sequence was so long and overdone it reminded me of the big dance scene from An American in Pariswhich you either love or you hate guess which applies to me!. As for the acting Caron is her usual wonderful self and she made the film a delight. I also adored Estelle Winwoodshe made for a very funny and more human sort of fairy godmotherwonderful and very very different.This is a hard one to rate. While I loved the film it really melted my heart it should have been tightened up by either eliminating or trimming all the fantasy dance sequences as they tended to make the plot grind to a halt.".

	schema:reviewBody "In some ways better than Lili but it still seems lowbudget when compared to Gigi. Beautiful story of Ella dubbed CinderElla by a callous boy in town. Here she has a cindersmudged face and is impish as always with two fantasy ballet sequences as Leslie Caron was a great ballerina after all. The first fantasy dance could be called The Cook's Son Palace Ballet and involves her visiting the palace to see the cook's son who is actually the prince. It involves a great cooking sequence with a chorus line of ballerinas and ends with Leslie dancing on wire and flying off the top of a huge wedding cake. The second dance is the Dance of the Egyptian Princess who in reality is Ella's mistaken identity. This dance is not as imaginative and is almost unnecessary to the story. A good supporting cast Estelle Winwood as the funny absentminded Mrs.Toquet fairy godmother. Elsa Lancaster as the mean stepmother. Amanda Blake as Birdena one of the two very pretty but uglyinspirit stepsisters. A surprisingly good narration by Walter Pigeon. A good musical score. The movie falls down with too much dialog not enough action and no magical transformation of the pumpkin mice and lizards into coach horses and coachmen. It all happens off camera. Where are the great special effects possible with Famous Studios and MGM Movie Magic? Missing scenes that should have filmed Ella as a 6yearold running into the Prince for the first time. Her clothes turning back into rags as the gown was borrowed and was maybe magic? The coach dissolving. The pumpkin is shown smashed. The happyeverafterending seems slowly staged and less than triumphant but I am not sure why. The castle doesn't seem grand enough and very little of it is shown beyond the ballroom kitchen and the Prince's study. Michael Wilding or his dance double? is o.k. but the whole production seems slow moving and lethargic. The magic sparkle of the fairy tale is somehow missing. A procession to the castle but no triumphant wedding? Worth watching just to see the captivating Leslie Caron dancing on toe once again. Not heroic or dashing enough for boys so little girls might like it better. The broadcast print shows a lot of wear and tear and has not been wellrestored.".

	schema:headline " This glass slipper fits absolutely beautifully";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of Cinderella has always been one of my favourites both the Charles Perrault and Grimm Brothers versions. An adaptation of Cinderella should ideally enchant and The Glass Slipper certainly does that.It does just fall short of being perfect. Wasn't entirely about Michael Wilding as the Prince the character is a little bland to begin with but Wilding plays the role rather charmlessly and seemed somewhat too mature. Was also mixed on the ballet sequences they are exquisitely designed beautifully and cleverly choreographed and danced with grace but had a tendency to go on for a little too long and to slow the film down.Otherwise The Glass Slipper is a lovely film and for me one of the better versions of Cinderella. It looks absolutely fabulous with elegant costuming truly beautiful and charming scenery and settings and it is very lovingly filmed with a warm hazy glow and sumptuous colour with every transition flowing well into the next without looking choppy. The music has a good amount of whimsy which is a good match for the story also managing to be perfectly pleasant and hummable Take My Love is quite sweet.The script has some clever touches that should be done more like what is done with the Fairy Godmother Ella and the Prince's preball encounter the villagers' treatment of Ella and the idea to have the stepsisters beautiful on the outside and has far more depth that one would think. Although I do wish there was more done with the transformation scene one of the best bits of the story The Glass Slipper manages to the magical and enchanting spirit of the story while having a bit of freshness something that I loved about the recent adaptation which is amazing considering how often this story has been done on film and how potentially narratively sketchy the story can be. It may be a bit staid and measured for some but for me it was not a problem only in the ballet sequences did the film feel a tad draggy.Wilding aside the performances are great with particular mention going to Leslie Caron's very charming Ella still looking beautiful even in rags and covered in soot there is a certain brattiness at times with Caron which is unusual for Cinderella but considering Ella's predicament it is somewhat realistic and Estelle Winwood's splendidly daffy and affecting Fairy Godmother. While the stepmother has been more strongly written elsewhere like the quite creepy characterisation in the Disney version Elsa Lanchester is genuinely beastly in the role and the stepsisters of Amanda Blake and Lisa Daniels show strong comic timing and real nastiness. Barry Jones is amusing as the King and it was nice to see Keenan Wynn so subtle.All in all The Glass Slipper is a lovely if not flawless adaptation of a justifiably popular and oftfilmed fairy tale standing out as one of the better versions too. 810 Bethany Cox".

	onyx:emotionText "The story of Cinderella has always been one of my favourites both the Charles Perrault and Grimm Brothers versions. An adaptation of Cinderella should ideally enchant and The Glass Slipper certainly does that.It does just fall short of being perfect. Wasn't entirely about Michael Wilding as the Prince the character is a little bland to begin with but Wilding plays the role rather charmlessly and seemed somewhat too mature. Was also mixed on the ballet sequences they are exquisitely designed beautifully and cleverly choreographed and danced with grace but had a tendency to go on for a little too long and to slow the film down.Otherwise The Glass Slipper is a lovely film and for me one of the better versions of Cinderella. It looks absolutely fabulous with elegant costuming truly beautiful and charming scenery and settings and it is very lovingly filmed with a warm hazy glow and sumptuous colour with every transition flowing well into the next without looking choppy. The music has a good amount of whimsy which is a good match for the story also managing to be perfectly pleasant and hummable Take My Love is quite sweet.The script has some clever touches that should be done more like what is done with the Fairy Godmother Ella and the Prince's preball encounter the villagers' treatment of Ella and the idea to have the stepsisters beautiful on the outside and has far more depth that one would think.

But like his fellow Britisher David Niven Michael Wilding has charm in abundance and carries the part off somewhat.In this version the two meet earlier by a stream and Wilding says he's the cook in the palace of Duke Barry Jones where a great ball is to be held and he invites her. Caron's own natural beauty shines through all the dirt she's covered with doing all the work in her household while the stepmother and stepsisters frolic and play.A slightly dotty Estelle Winwood is the fairy godmother and she's a treat.

The Lausbuben movies are based on the autobiographical work of Ludwig Thoma who wrote about his pranks but also about his perception of society decades before these films were made. Fittingly the main character's name is Ludwig as well. This film here is very Bavarian in terms of humor but also dialect. You recognize this as the a is usually pronounced like an o. And also you see it is from another time as the way people speak in terms of vocabularies and phrases is just completely outdated compared to today's standards. And this also applies to behavior in society. In one scene a male character puts a hat in front of his and his girl's faces before he kisses her. It was just not appropriate to show affection in public.However as a whole this movie is really only worth a watch for nostalgic value. Even if I liked the boy's presence and comments occasionally I found none of the pranks really funny but you should decide for yourself if cutting somebody beard off while he sleeps or putting a hedgehog in the bed or using glue to stick a chair to a teacher's pants is your cup of tea. There's a lot more like this. I personally would not recommend watching these 1.5 hours.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Good!";
	schema:reviewBody "When I was growing up one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote he invented the three laws of Robotics as the very beginning of the movie tells us they are 1 A robot can never harm a human. 2 A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3 A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. I did get that or at least the explosions part but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with if the three laws can be made they can be broken. And it was an Asimovish whodunit as well. Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as Del Spooner a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in Enemy of the State than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks Independence Day and Men in Black. He is a believable character one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why exactly he hates robots so much.A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well delivering a wooden robotlike performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot Sonny who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a good guy or not. This movie which I've now seen twice has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence but I felt that Isaac Asimov if he were here would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict perhaps would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story he was never that violent in his short storiesbooks and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax which yes smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending I felt repaired and wrapped up nicely making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.Two notes about the cinematography in this movie first of all the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in midair pose which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas which was the camera moving with moving object shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake even for a moment. In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that I Robot was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters including the hero are black males one woman and one male robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character but after thinking about it I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows to me that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that even 1015 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gendersocial equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.Now of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servantslave class out of robots etc. but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie any movie that gives you fun drama action mystery and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I Robot is all of the above.".

	schema:headline " Excellent film";
	schema:reviewBody "The maker of a film adaptation has three choices. First he can try to translate the original medium as faithfully as possible striving as much as possible to preserve the spirit and content of the original while reimagining the story as a film. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films exemplify this approach. Second he could instead try to capture the essence of the original while largely abandoning the particulars of the original as in the intelligently satirical but hardhearted film version of Starship Troopers. Third he can try to do something original with the material drawing inspiration from the written story but creating a unique film with a unique vision. I Robot is more the the third than the first or second. While little remains of Asimov's stories in this killer robot metropolitan fantasy the film is informed by and offers no disrespect to the good Doctor's creations. Will Smith plays a Jack Slaterstyled maverick cop. If it's old it's good.He wears vintage converse listens to Stevie Wonder and apparently regards sweet potato pie as a food group. Will Smith's acting is a naturalistic shuffle a Columbolike pastiche of mumbling sarcasm and unexpected outbursts of charisma and offbalancing interrogation techniques. He delivers his oneliners with unnecessary seriousness. While in Men in Black he aimed for the ballparks with his powerswinging actioncomedy style here his conscientious style gets in the way suggesting a character who stands in front of the mirror practicing his zingers like a Tuesday night comic. It's not entirely Smith's fault as the movie itself can't seem to decide if he's standing in for Bogart or Schwarzenegger or if the character had a life of his own before the film starts rolling. His performance is intelligent marred by occasional Gotcha suckaz! moments that remind us that all films made in Hollywood are made in Hollywood. His opposite Bridget Moynahan fits her role more surely. She's an ice queen in the classic action movie tradition a stiffnecked selfimportant lonely woman who has been absorbed by her work so completely she remains a teenager at heart awkward vulnerable and searching for the approval of others. Moynahan's bugeyed discomfort and clipped TVsarcastic delivery are those of the quintessential comedy sidekick. Nonetheless in rare moments she invests the character's personal revelations with warmth doubt and a glow of determination and moral purpose. While Smith vacillates between supercop and Bogie Moynahan seems to have found a happy medium between the Saturday matine and the midnight marathon a mixture of fun and humanity with a carriage of seriousness appropriate to what is essentially a monster movie.The robot Sonny is a character himself a curious frightened creature that seems capable of anything. Could Sonny be the murderer? We hope not and yet we see the grim possibility that a machine might consider itself more than a human being. We understand Sonny's drive to live and grow. As human beings we know what lengths we would go to to ensure our survival whatever the moral charges facing us. A top scientist has been murdered and there are no human suspects so the powerful US Robotics corporation no relation to the modem manufacturers convinces the powersthatbe to consider his unexpected death a suicide. Spooner Will Smith alone searches for the truth of the matter fueled by hatred for robots and a personal debt to the dead scientist. Dr. Calvin Moynahan feels his intrusive investigation is unnecessary although new pieces of evidence appear that gradually shake her confidence. Robots are programmed by the Three Laws to serve humanity but Spooner is convinced one of the new NS5 units a unique prototype is the murderer. As Spooner gets deeper to the heart of the mystery the story explodes with robotic violence. Like all good mysteries the real question is not Whodunnit? but Why? The heroes do some things for the wrong reasons and the villains do some things for the right rational reasons. Although I Robot hardly pauses for introspection it does asks us What makes a human being superior to a machine? There are twists and surprises although in the end the movie plays out in the only way it can a band of brave heroes trying to throw the ring into Mt. Doom while the armies of evil march. And yet the movie leaves us wanting more. What is the future of humanity? How will we control our machines and how will we prevent the machines from becoming our masters? While not as ambitious as A.I. it is more successful and while not as intelligent as Robocop it is better played. While the movie does suffer from inconsistencies in mood and philosophy such hiccups are secondary to the emotionality and drive of the film its fury of thought as well as action. In moments I Robot is a terrifying vision of the future. Too few sciencefiction movies manage to scare us with the power of technology but future shock is vital to the sciencefiction story. Modern sciencefiction truly began with the detonation at White Sands. The Atomic Age has given way to the Digital Age but we still have not solved the problem of how to wrest the power of technology from the creatures of the id.".

	schema:headline " A clichd cop thriller crossed with scifi but it is noisy enjoyable fun  all a summer action film should be";
	schema:reviewBody "It is the year 2035 and the world has forgotten the lessons we learnt in the 20th Century from films like Bladerunner and Terminator. Robots are the new must have accessory carrying out menial tasks for households and boosting profits for businesses that have workforces not requiring payment. While this is now the norm Officer Del Spooner refuses to move with the times and due to an incident in his past refuses to accept the robots as anything approaching human. When an old friend Dr Lanning  head of the robotics company is found dead everyone suspects suicide but Spooner suspects a robot that flees the crime scene. Despite the robotics company lawyering up Spooner continues his investigations and several more malfunctions later he begins to uncover a much bigger problem with the robots.When the film opens with a flashback scene that cuts to a bitter oldfashioned cop who dresses like Shaft and don't take no rubbish from his weary captain I immediately started to worry that this would simply be a clichd cop thriller in fancy clothes and in some ways that is what it was. But it is also good fun and along with Spiderman 2 stands out as one of the best of this years generally disappointing crop of blockbusters. The plot is interesting enough to keep the film going and although it goes just where you will expect it to if you've seen Terminator or had any involvement in popular culture it builds gradually with an intriguing investigation leading to a very impressive climax. The set pieces are well directed and are mixed well with the drama and the film delivers just what I had come expecting  fun excitement effects and an involving story.Of course this is not to ignore the fact that the film has its weak points. The worn 'tough cop' clichs are heavy on the ground and show a script that hasn't put as much effort into its characters as it really should have  this is also seen in Calvin who's background with Lanning is hinted at but never followed though. The film also hints at a very intelligent story around the robots but again it never totally follows through in as much detail as it could have done. The structure of the society is not clear  if robots have taken many jobs how can everyone afford a robot? Spooner lives in a poor overcrowded area with graffiti on the walls but yet everyone owns a robot. While I accept that the film couldn't go into the whole universe behind the scenario it could have shown us an underclass just as easily as it showed us what I suspect were the middle classes. Likewise the final shot of the film implies that there is more to the robotethics of the story but mostly this is put to the side in favour of running and shooting. But these are minor complaints when you accept that this is not art  it is a blockbuster and in this way it succeeds and is an enjoyable film. Matching the lazily written character that he is given Smith plays it like Shaft. He eats pie and takes lots of sugar but yet has a superb body  can't wait for that part of the future! makes wisecracks and sneers a lot.He tries to bring something individual out in Spooner but mostly he settles for playing along with the clichs and delivers a familiar performance but one that fits well with the aims of the film. Moynnahan is a bit dry but actually works better than the usual screaming love interest that we get served with  thankfully the film resists the temptation to impose a romance on us. Tudyk looks the part and does a very good 'HAL' voice but he is constrained by his character and can only work within that  but he works it well enough. Greenwood is a good part Cromwell's familiarity helps us care for a character who has died before the film even starts McBride is the gruff weary captain but basically the film is Smith's and his Shaft is quite fun. Outside of the real things the effects are great  they look real and match the design of the future which is at the other end of the scale from the usual grim future that we all suspect will be nearer the truth! Alex Proyas may not be a great master of the narrative but he does OK here while also indulging his first love  the visual effects and style.Overall this is an enjoyable summer blockbuster and stands out in the crowd of average sequels and trashy attempts at blockbusters that have crawled in and out of our cinemas this year. Yes it's full of the usual tough cop genre clichs and the scifi element doesn't get as interesting or morally complex as it should have done but this is an action movie and I found it to do all the things I needed to do to entertain me  set pieces interesting story fun effects that are actually special and a film that builds to a satisfying if overblown conclusion. In the cold light of day it is an imperfect film but it is easily one of the better blockbusters of 2004.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Alex Proyas helmer of such cult favorites as 'Dark City' and 'The Crow' steps into the Hollywood limelight with his first attempt at a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.'I Robot' chronicles the life of Detective Del Spooner Will Smith who has a technophobic view of the world's newest appliance a lifelike robot created by the world's leading technology giant US Robotics. A link in Spooner's past is linked to his phobia of the automaton movement sweeping the nation. According to US Robotics there will be eventually 1 robot to every 5 humans.Spooner is called to the offices of US Robotics when a leading scientist James Cromwell with a secret link to Spooner has apparently committed suicide. His death seems to have mysterious circumstances which could link to a robot. With man's complete trust in the new robot technology it seems too ludicrous to every one except Spooner.As the mystery deepens Spooner unravels the very fabric of the robotic giant locks horns with CEO Lawrence Robertson Bruce Greenwood and learns more about his automated enemy with the aid of scientist Dr. Susan Calvin Bridget Moynahan. Through the course of these events he may learn more than he could ever imagine.It is hard to defend a film like 'I Robot' but I am going to try. For scifi purists Isaac Asimov's legendary work about the robot and how he will intricate into our society has filled the minds of readers for over 50 years. But the similarities between the film presented here and his work are few and far between. Kind of like last week's release of Jerry Bruckheimer's 'King Arthur'. Both films take sacred subject matter and reinvent it with a new twist. I would have to say that 'I. Robot' is better in a lot ways.At the core of 'I Robot' beats the soul of Asimov as his 3 laws regarding robots are sacredly left intact and the film does abide by them. Also a lot of the characters have similar names to the people in the text. It is almost like taking Star Trek's 'prime directive' and some of the now classic characters and setting them in a new idea of the future. The core is left intact but in some ways it has been updated and refreshed.The story special effects and extremely zealous direction however all seem to be brought forth by the collaborators who cobbled this film together. There are influences of 'Robocop' 'Short Circuit' 'Blade Runner' and even the classic comicbook series 'Magnus Robot Fighter'. Each of these robot influences echo back to what makes 'I Robot' so intriguing a joy to watch and memorable. Sure the story does have a lot of scifi influences and clichs aside from robot films including 'Star Wars' and 'Planet of the Apes' but don't these benchmark scifi films influence everything coming down the turnpike these days. It even has the classic scifi clich of the social outcast claiming there is an invasion coming except no one believes him. But that is not what should bring us into the film.You really need to give credit to director Alex Proyas because it is his magic as a filmmaker that holds this film together. He knows where to play it straight and where to let his lead actor bring on the charm. Also you really have to admire the man's technical ability. His brilliant interlaying of robots into the photography is astounding. Proyas is an Alist director in the making and 'I Robot' shows that he can deliver a big Hollywood film.I also give credit to Will Smith who starts out being very unapproachable with his character but as the film goes we really become fond of his hero. Smith's Spooner does have a lot of his previous scifi heroes interlaced into Spooner but it comes off as more of a homecoming than an annoyance. In some ways I think Proyas had something to do with that especially in the chase down scene towards the beginning of the film. It almost felt like 'Men in Black' again.As for Smith's costars Cromwell's Lanning is a throwaway character used mainly for effect Moynahan is timid and sometimes robotlike but it is a sturdy performance and Greenwood is menacing and a good match to face off against the rebellious Smith. The reason I was so fond of 'I Robot' is because for once it was a summer film that didn't apologize for trying to be entertaining. The special effects the performances and the direction are all what people want to see in the summer and this film is loads and loads of fun. It is a great giant popcorn film with a light layering of message. My only small problem with this film was that it is supposed to be set in Chicago in 2035. I didn't buy it but if it was 2135 then maybe.Sure the film doesn't pave new ground but why does every film have to. It is pure summer fun and what is wrong with that.If you want Asimov and scifi purism then you can always read the novels. Stop apologizing and most of all stop bellyaching just give the film a chance. If you like science fiction films and want to be remembered how much fun they used to be then this picture is the perfect ticket for you. So Says the Soothsayer.".

	schema:reviewBody "From reading the comments posted by others I got the impression that people mainly rated it low because it did not follow the book. Just because a movie does not follow the original work like the Bible does not mean that the movie should not be given a chance. I read the Asimov book and I went to the theater with my friend who has not. She enjoyed the movie just as much as I did if not more. I was fascinated by the angle Proyas approached in the novel and I did not mind one bit that the movie was completely different than the book.Another element of the movie that receives an unfair bad rap is the acting. It's no worse than the acting in the SpiderMan movies. I am by no means a fan of Will Smith but I was a fan of Willem Dafoe and that mirror scene in SpiderMan made me cringe. Might of worked on stage Willem but not on the big screen. I did not find myself cringing at any acting in I Robot. In fact the only thing overthetop sometimes was the special effects. Other than that nothing made me slink down in my seat and cover my face in shame.One actor that deserves a shout out is Alan Tudyk. I read many comments where people think he just voiced the character of Sonny. Actually Tudyk pulled a Gollum. This means he put on a weird looking body suit and actually acting out the scenes. Later CGI used his performance to model the computer graphic robot. Except for a few obvious actions scenes Tudyk was Sonny. My complements to his performance.Hopefully people will give this movie the chance it really deserves and not base their decisions on how close it followed the book. I give I Robot a 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me say that it is an OK flick with excellent production design reasonable acting big action scenes excellent CGI from Weta Digital etc. But oh! the screenplay.Fair dinkum Isaac Asimov must be spinning in his grave so fast you could use him to power a small city. The screenplay is laughable and is everything that Isaac Asimov's writing is not. It is clichd to the point of ludicrousness maverick cop with bad attitude that noone believes? Again?. Stupid to the point of being unintentionally funny the writers should have checked out the Galactic Overlord's 100 mistakes to avoid website to remove the more risible plot devices.Unintelligent well mostly unintelligent. The one time they strayed from attempting to rewrite one of the I. Robot short stories such as 'Little Lost Robot' they did OK. The scene where Will Smith describes his main motivation brings up a number of interesting philosophical questions. But this exception only serves to illustrate how much better the screenplay could have been.And it has corny dialogue. Cheesy is another word that comes to mind.The screenplay also completely misrepresents the I Robot books. Susan Calvin is a brilliant but cold person. With a wit like a scalpel and the sort of psychiatric knowledge to intimidate others. Not the sort of emotion riddled halfwit as she is portrayed here. The three laws are built into the substructure of the brain. To violate the first law ALWAYS causes the robot to seize up they can not be subverted just by downloading a new set of instructions. The stories are meant to get away from this dull hundredtimesold tale where Robots were created and destroyed their creator both quotes taken Isaac Asimov's introduction to The Rest of the Robots. But the movie does just that. The robots are not supposed to be terrifying. But in the movie they become a sort of terrifying monster part Terminator and part soldierant colony.I'm looking forward to the Director's cut version where they remove all mention of Isaac Asimov and change the names of all of the Asimovian characters to nonAsimovian ones. They can keep the Three Laws. After all they are so common as to be nearly ubiquitous. Then and only then would I consider it worth the overall rating that this movie has.Now I'm going to read my copy of 'I Robot' to get the awful taste of this appalling travesty out of my mouth.".

	onyx:emotionText "First off let me say that it is an OK flick with excellent production design reasonable acting big action scenes excellent CGI from Weta Digital etc. But oh! the screenplay.Fair dinkum Isaac Asimov must be spinning in his grave so fast you could use him to power a small city. The screenplay is laughable and is everything that Isaac Asimov's writing is not. It is clichd to the point of ludicrousness maverick cop with bad attitude that noone believes? Again?. Stupid to the point of being unintentionally funny the writers should have checked out the Galactic Overlord's 100 mistakes to avoid website to remove the more risible plot devices.Unintelligent well mostly unintelligent. The one time they strayed from attempting to rewrite one of the I. Robot short stories such as 'Little Lost Robot' they did OK. The scene where Will Smith describes his main motivation brings up a number of interesting philosophical questions. But this exception only serves to illustrate how much better the screenplay could have been.And it has corny dialogue. Cheesy is another word that comes to mind.The screenplay also completely misrepresents the I Robot books. Susan Calvin is a brilliant but cold person. With a wit like a scalpel and the sort of psychiatric knowledge to intimidate others. Not the sort of emotion riddled halfwit as she is portrayed here.

The special effects were a little... fake and overdone. The action was cheesy and out of place. The story was a bit well predictable and the acting left much to be desired.Perhaps worst of all were the characters of the story.Sonny the main robot of the story was perhaps the most realistic and human character of the story. Great... But aren't robots not supposed to be very human? It just didn't work for me at all. The robot was the character that I related to the most. That just shouldn't happen! Now there have been many robot movies where the robots are portrayed as having humanlike qualities such as blade runner. That was good. The androids in that movie were closer to human than they were robot anyway. But the robots in this story we're supposed to be robotic.Moving along the worst character in the story was of Del Spooner the main character of the movie played by Will Smith. Will Smith played the same exact character he has played in just about every other movie he has ever been in. You'd think that they'd give him more original roles by now. But instead we get the same old wise crackin' main character that Smith has portrayed in every movie he has ever done.Alright... this is getting a bit lengthy so I'm gonna rap it up. I Robot was a disappointment. It was in all definitions of the word meh.".

	schema:reviewBody "What on earth has this movie to do with Isaac Asimov? I've read some of his stuff but other than his three robot laws I see no similarities between his work and this 115 minute commercial. Acting is poor no better than in your average TV show the dialogues are crap either there to remind of us the stereotypical 'cop with a grudge' Smith is performing you might forget that when he keeps talking about his vintage 2004 shoes or... I actually don't know why there is dialogue at all really.Worse is this movie revolves around a plot that is broken at the level of it's foundation. This plot is build on a 'logic' which you can't deny that is simply false. Because spoiler ahead the whole idea is that this robots turn society into a fascist state to protect human kind from itself in order to uphold the first law which is 'not to allow harm to happen to human beings'. Yet a they harm tons of human beings in the process of their revolution and the law specifically states individual human beings not human kind at large so where did they get this utilitarian notion that it's OK to harm a whole bunch to protect a slightly bigger bunch? and b harm comes not only through physical injury it also comes through psychological injury and massive oppression and containment does just this which is why people rebelled against it then and always will. This is wellknown of course we need the freedom to express ourselves and explore our social environments we need a freedom to interact with and challenge the world around us it is in our human nature! This has nothing to do with the romantic babbling of free will that is being used in the movie this is a matter of human psychology and if the robot superbrain would have actually studied some of the many documents on psychology there already were in vintage year 2004 she would have come to this conclusion herself. Or hey why not send in someone with understanding of human society and behavior to have a chat with this robot brain which would have no doubt been open to such audience or was the entire world suddenly comprised of tinheads like mr. Smith here who rather brings his point across using bullets?Asimov took care of building a philosophical foundation for his works have the dialogues bring out the mature personalities of his characters have social and political developments actually make sense in a broader scheme... none of this can be found in the movie. Frankly I find it a disgrace to see his name attached to a movie made by folks who I doubt even read any of his work.If you're looking for a cheap action movie this one fits the bill. If you're looking for thoughtthrough science fiction spare yourself this travesty. If the makers had spend as much time on the story and it's underlying philosophy as they did on product placement it might have... well.. actually no I don't see how these folks could have ever made something out of this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rule  1 Hollywood shouldn't make some books into movies.Take for example science fiction author Isaac Asimov's I Robot a classic collection of cautionary short stories about the unforeseen complications in a robot's logic as it tries to obey the three laws of robotics. Even when the robots appeared insane Asimov was careful to show that by the lights of the robot's positronic brains they are behaving logically.Rule  2 Movies with multiple stories don't make millions.Too many characters. Too many ideas. Too much originality. Too much segmentation. Consequently when Hollywood lays its hands on literary legends like Asimov they dumb down his work and turn it into a sprawling saga with brash loudmouthed characters that audiences can laugh with so they can forget about the summer heat.In the Will Smith movie I Robot Australian director Alex Proyas of The Crow Oscarwinning scenarist Akiva Goldsman of A Beautiful Mind and Final Fantasy scribe Jeff Vintar have retained the three laws of robotics but have turned an otherwise literary classic into a shallow uninspired paintbythenumbers potboiler about an heroic wisecracking Chicago cop in the year 2035 who abhors robots. I Robot opens with the three laws of robots.1. A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.An alarm clock awakens divorced homicide detective Del Spooner Will Smith of Ali to another wonderful day. After a shower scene designed to display Smith's buff body especially his curiously scarred Rambo pectorals our swaggering stereotypical lone wolf hero dons his ghetto black street clothes unpacks a vintage pair of 2004 Converse AllStar sneakers and cruises off to his first crime scene of the day in his tricked out Audi.The headquarters of the U.S. Robotics Corporationa Microsofttype companystands in downtown Chicago. U.S. Robotics plans to put a robot in every home. Apparently U.S.R.'s chief robot designer Dr. Alfred Lanning James Cromwell of Babe committed suicide. The visionary scientist hurled himself through his office window and fell hundreds of feet to the lobby. Spooner learns that Lanning had requested him specifically so Del could listen to a message Lanning recorded for him on a preprogrammed hologram. Initially Lanning's cryptic remarks make no sense to Del. When he visits Lanning's office he discovers that the good doctor couldn't have jumped through the window. Del tries to break the window next to the window that Lanning shattered and barely makes a dent when he smashes a chair against it. No sooner does Del realize that the killer may still be in the room than the killer surprises him and escapes.Eventually Del captures the robot and interrogates him. Before he can get far U.S. Robotics' CEO Lawrence Robertson Bruce Greenwood who played JFK in Thirteen Days storms into the police station. He demands the return of his property. Robertson reminds Del that the authorities cannot charge robots with murder. Not only have robots never posed a threat to humans but also only humans can be charged with homicide. Inevitably Del's worldweary boss Lieutenant John Bergin Chi McBride of Gone In 60 Seconds chews him out for crying 'robot' every time something happens to him. Del remains far from convinced however about the innocence of robots. He bears a grudge against them. During an accident a truck rammed both his vehicle and another car with a 12year old girl inside. Both cars sank into a river. A passing robot witnessed the accident and dived in to rescue Del. Our protagonist told the robot to save the little girl instead so he feels guilty about her death and despises robots.Gee doesn't this sound familiar? Like a movie from the 1980s? A rebellious but maimed cop battling a corporation with a dark secret. Hey didn't Tom Selleck do something like that in the 1984 epic Runaway? Or what about 1982's Blade Runner? Or Westworld where the robots cannot kill humans either. Del spends the rest of I Robot's predictable 115 minutes trying to prove to everybody that robots are dangerous. He worries especially because his mother Adrian Ricard of Bulworth has won a robot in lottery. Meanwhile despite all this horrible publicity Robertson plans to market a new line of robots and he wants Del off his back permanently. Of course hardheaded as Del is he doesn't take no for an answer even when Bergin takes his badge and suspends him from the force.Basically aside from a fairly lowkey performance Will Smith's futuristic detective doesn't appear too far removed from his wealthy playboy cop in the Bad Boys movies. Unfortunately he doesn't have a sidekick like Martin Lawrence to take up the slack in this occasionally exciting but largely superficial scifi saga. Not even his quips seem catchy. Smith spouts lines like Does believing you're the last sane man on the planet make you crazy? 'Cause if that's the case maybe I am.  Probably his best line and that isn't saying much is Somehow 'I told you so' just doesn't quite say it. I Robot looks okay if you don't think about some of the gaping plot holes. Wait until you see what Del's secret weapon is. Talk about a copout! The robots are marginally intimidating but two action sequences a careening chase scene in a freeway tunnel and a demolition robot that destroys a mansion look cool. Despite its plea for tolerance which was handled better in Bicentennial Man I Robot breaks no new ground in the robots on the prowl genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really can't begin to judge this as a film in it's own right because the whole watching experience was spoiled by thoughts of Asimov turning in his grave. Anyone familiar with the book will know that a film based exactly on the book itself a collection of short storieswould never have worked and it is not his I take issue with. But the whole spirit of Asimov's robots is ruined. Most of his robot stories involve in some way circumventing the Laws of Robotics to make robots act in a way that seems to contradict the laws but in fact doesn't. They're logic puzzles basically typical of Asimov. The I Robot film shows no regard to the Laws having the robots not appearing to break them but actually doing so. The justification to this is that the robots have taken it upon themselves to make the decision that humanity should be prioritized over individuals.Now Asimov fans will recognize this logic Although not from I Robot. It is of course Zeroth Law the brainchild of Giskard who upon discovering it was forced to permanently shut himself down robot obviouslybecause it so badly contradicted everything he had been built to follow. The only observer to the revelation of Zeroth Law being R Daneel Olivaw the R standing for robot who managed to incorporate that belief into his existing laws and over many centuries started making small yet significant mostly behind the scenes changes. This is all shown in the Robots and Empire and The Foundation books. So you may wonder why I have issues with I Robot the film when OK it may not all be in the book of the same name but its all there in Asimov somewhere. I'll tell you why. Giskard and R Daneel were the greatest most advanced robots ever. Zeroth Law destroyed one of them and the other felt only able to implement it over great amount of time with the least interference and with the greatest respect to the other laws. Contrast this to the film. And don't even get me started on Susan Calvin.So I suppose my point is it might be a perfectly good film but don't pretend it's I Robot and don't pretend it's Asimov.".

Zeroth Law destroyed one of them and the other felt only able to implement it over great amount of time with the least interference and with the greatest respect to the other laws. Contrast this to the film. And don't even get me started on Susan Calvin.So I suppose my point is it might be a perfectly good film but don't pretend it's I Robot and don't pretend it's Asimov.";

	schema:reviewBody "I Robot directed by Alex Proyas takes place in the not so distant future specifically 2035 Chicago. Del Spooner Smith is a police detective who has a prejudice against robots which is kind of an issue since they are basically everywhere. Robots have replaced humans in doing manual labor jobs garbage men etc. and have become personal assistants and even companions to many people. On the eve of the release of the latest model that will not only replace the old models but will be featured in one in five homes the chief scientist and inventor of the robots allegedly commits suicide by throwing himself out of his office window. Spooner is the detective on the case because the scientist has left a holographic message for him that leads him to believe that there is more to this death than a suicide. The head of the company the scientist worked for is Lawrence Robertson Greenwood who appoints one of his primary employees Susan Calvin Moynahan to assist Spooner with his investigation. When Spooner discovers the crime seems to have been committed by a robot Sonny one who seems to have feelings and more importantly disregards the three laws of robotics he and Calvin find that there may be much more on the new robots' agendas than they thought.Boy where do I start with this one? I really intensely disliked this film as a whole. There were so many clichs that were invoked from the cop that everyone thinks is crazy to the evil corporate magnate who may not be so evil. The script for I Robot is rife with bad puns Sorry I'm allergic to bullst and at least ten Oh hell no's from Smith. There were several completely inane plot points Shia LaBeouf's role which was essentially a walkon where Smith repeatedly tells him not to curse was baffling for one and frankly Smith's argument for his prejudice against the robots was not remotely convincing to me something that was a pretty big deal since it was a big part of the plot. The acting in I Robot was absolutely reprehensible. Will Smith has proved with his nonaction films that he can act. Although he has done mostly actionoriented films and therefore can't really show too much talent in that genre his performance in I Robot just plain sucked. And shame on the casting directors for picking Bridget Moynahan to costar in this film. In fact let's go back farther  shame on her agent or whoever decided that she COULD act. Her role as a scientist was about as believable as Denise Richards was in whatever Bond film she was in only she was somehow worse in this movie. I kept asking when she was going to reveal the fact that she was actually a robot because that was the only thing that would have explained her wooden delivery. If they simply wanted someone with a pretty face they could have at least gotten a marginal actress like Kate Beckinsale or something. They would have just had to make the character Hungarian since she can't seem to shake that accent.Meanwhile Proyas' direction was rife with groaner moments. Anything that was supposed to be a surprise! moment Sonny surviving the chair after a scene where he was supposed to be killed that I dubbed Dead Bot Walking or after his car was totaled Smith cracking out the trusty motorcycle was just a big letdown because it was unfortunately apparent these things would happen long before the reveal. I also question the decision to make Chicago look virtually unrecognizable a mere thirty years from now. I guess the Sears Tower was spotted but other than that it could have been any city. Other than the vague reference to a dried up Lake Michigan which I still don't get  perhaps I missed something when I was trying to burrow into the couch to escape this movie. Honestly I didn't think the movie could actually take a turn for the worse three minutes until the end but it did with something as simple as a really stupid and corny handshake between Smith and Sonny that was inexplicably in slow motion invoking my memories of other films of the same mettle who also enjoyed unnecessary slomo like Glitter or Battlefield Earth. The only thing that saved this stinker of a movie from a spot in my coveted dungeon of films I loathe with great malice that include My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Escape from L.A. was the fact that the special effects were indeed fantastic. The entire reason why I watched this film at all was because of its Special Effects nomination for an Oscar and after seeing the film it was clear that it was far superior to its fellow nominees Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Spiderman 2 which it eventually lost to. The CGI work is topnotch particularly anything to do with Sonny. Even the scenes when reality and CGI mixed were fantastic. Not enough to save the film not by a long shot but definitely the only positive thing I can say about the film.Other than the Special Effects work I Robot is absolutely terrible. I wouldn't watch it again on a bet. Knowing that in an action film the story and acting are usually put on the back burner I will generally give some leeway that I don't allow for regular dramas. But there is no excuse for the deplorable appalling and abominable product that Proyas churned out and expected us to watch. I couldn't tolerate it must less enjoy it and now I plan to try to forget I ever saw it. I'm giving this film a 410 only because of the superior special effects otherwise it would have gotten no more than a 2.Shelly".

From the first scene of Smith leaving his apartment he walks down the street with a scowl on his face bumping into people and dewrag over his ear just dripping with 'thug'. Just like in ID4 and Men in Black Smith faces lifethreatening circumstances with a sarcastic and improbable facade. Nothing is ever scary or serious to the characters he plays. Not the aliens chasing him in Independence Day not the giant killercockroach in Men in Black and not hundreds of killerrobots in this movie. Smith retorts to ever threat with a stereotypically black attitude. His confrontation with his boss when he loses his badge is nothing short of ridiculous. He stomps off shouting and throwing a tantrum like a stereotypical overentitled minority. For me it's disgusting and tired. I think Will Smith can be funny and charming. I like that he took a break from music during the early 90's when hiphop was saturated with hateful ganstarap finally returning when things settled down with a decent album. I don't know why he continues to play roles where he assumes these arrogant roles fronting everyone off wherever he goes.True to her character in the book Bridget Moynahan plays a decent Dr. Calvin.

One can imagine what kind of soulful performance that coaxes from an actor.

The rise of CGI technology in moviemaking has made it possible and even profitable to make movies that are nearly purely eyecandy with no story no dialog no ideas no thoughts.

You would especially think so after reading the other comment which compares Brderna Lejonhjrta to Ingmar Bergman  HELLO?!? We do have other directors than Bergman and to compare him to Brderna Lejonhjrta is like comparing American Pie to Spike Lee or something. Please don't think you know EVERYTHING about swedish moviehistory just because you've heard of Bergman there is so much more to it and this movie has virtually nothing in common with Bergman's work.I am also sorry if people are too destroyed by American blockbusters and can't handle the fact that this movie is for an audience of youngsters and that it's about death. I must also say that grownups as well as kids can enjoy this movie. It's very good to see with your children to then discuss it afterwards.Astrid Lindgren was without comparison Swedish literature's queen and when she died last year it seemed like we couldn't stop mourning. Brderna Lejonhjrta The Lionheart Brothers was maybe one of her most important books because it handles such heavy subjects in such a great way. When Olle Hellbom's movie came in 1977 it caused a mediastorm Sweden had never seen before. First of all it had a completely new way of speaking to kids about death a movie that took children seriously and didn't treat them like they could handle only joy and happiness.Second of all back in those days the only agelimits on cinemas were 15 11 and under. They made Brderna Lejonhjrta available only to people over 11 and this caused such a storm that they actually changed the swedish law so that a new agelimit came at 7! All this over one movie.You can't understand how many kids have found comfort in this story. To children that are about to die you read this novel or show  this movie and I don't know how often you read the inscription We'll see eachother in Nangijala on gravestones in Swedish cemeteries.This movie was groundbreaking and it's often wrongfully accused of being too dark and strange. Children can handle a lot more than you think when it comes to strong emotions like love and loss. The only thing that scared me as a kid was the sometimes graphic violence in the end. See this if you have a chance!".

And while it obviously wasn't the most outstanding production of its day it certainly wasn't the worst either.The English dubbed version of this film which is the only one I have seen seems to suffer from translation. I am much more fond of subtitling as the original actors' speech inflections are preserved as is the original music score.Having read the story by Astrid Lindgren from which this movie was made I was pleased to note that the producers followed her work religiously and did not make any significant deviations from the book except for the manner of Katla's death see spoiler below for details. This was refreshing as a very many Hollywood movies have been destroyed by taking liberties with their literary sources.THE SPOILER. If you don't care to have the story revealed skip on to End of spoiler.The film opens with narration by 10yearold Crispy The book calls him Rusky Lion. He's a terminally ill boy from whose viewpoint the story unfolds. Crispy and Jonathan his 13yearold brother have an extremely close bond. Knowing Crispy is aware of his impending death Jonathan has told him of the wonders of Nangiyala where people go after death.However in saving Crispy from a fire it's Jonathan who dies first. Knowing Crispy is saddened by their separation Jonathan sends his spirit as a white dove pigeon in the book to reassure him they will soon be together again.Crispy dies soon thereafter and is also transported to Nangiyala at this point the movie transforms from BW to color. Jonathan is waiting and the two now Lionheart brothers enjoy a happy reunion with Crispy being shown the beautiful Cherry Blossom Valley.But all is not peace and tranquility. Crispy soon discovers an evil warlord called Tengil who has already enslaved nearby Wild Rose Valley is now a threat to Cherry Blossom Valley. He also learns his brave and courageous brother Jonathan is a major figure in the resistance against Tengil.Presently Jonathan makes a dangerous journey to Wild Rose Valley and answering a call in his dream Crispy follows him. Along the way Crispy discovers the identity of a traitor in Cherry Blossom Valley Jossi but is captured by Tengil's soldiers.Thinking quickly Crispy outwits the dullard soldiers duping them into taking him to Wild Rose ValleyAnd as luck would have it directly to the house where his brother Jonathan is in hiding. Pleased that his younger brother possesses the same qualities of courage and honor as he Jonathan includes Crispy in his mission to free Orvar a captured resistance leader from Wild Rose Valley from Katla's cave.The brothers ride to Tengil's land of Karmanyaka where Crispy beholds for the first time Katla an evil dragon held in Tengil's power by a battlehornFinding a back entrance to Katla cave Jonathan and Crispy manage to free Orvar just in the nick of time before he is to be sacrificed to Katla. Here the movie deviates just slightly from the book by having the boys leave their horses behind before crossing the bridge. In the book they camp their horses next to the back entrance..Now with Orvar free to plan and guide preparations are made to battle Tengil's men and free Wild Rose Valley. The battle rages and it seems as though the rebellion will succeed when Tengil appears with Katla. The rebels have no defense against the dragon. But in a oneonone dual with Tengil Jonathan manages to snatch the battlehorn from him. Jonathan then turns the dragon's wrath upon Tengil. Tengil's time had come.After the battle Jonathan uses the battlehorn to return Katla to her cave but a mishap causes him to lose the horn in the boiling mud pool freeing Katla from all control. Calling upon his innermost strength Jonathan manages to roll a boulder down upon Katla knocking her into the boiling mud pool. An end to Katla. Here is where the movie deviates most noticeably from the book. In the book Jonathan loses the battlehorn on the bridge and barely manages to get across. He then sends a boulder down which knocks Katla into the raging river where she fights to the death with the sea serpent called Karm.Jonathan does not escape unscathed however. He is burned by Katla's fire and paralysis sets in but he knows if he dies he can get to the world of Nangilima where all is peace and tranquility again. Crispy conquers his fear and helps his brother jump from the mountainand into Nangilima. The movie does not actually show the jump but mentions it so you know what occurs. The movie adds a scene of the boys' gravestone which is not mentioned in the book.END OF SPOILERThe movie seemed to have a little more depressing mood to it than the book did but this did not seem to detract from it.There is a definite enchantment to this film which will appeal to anyone who enjoys fairy tales. Also the theme seems to go beyond most fairy tales to deal with the idea of death from the perspective of a child. There were also several touching scenes showing the affection the brothers held for each other.For literary critics This is one film that conforms solidly to the sourcealmost wordforword in many instances. Usually I am disappointed with the movie version of a literary work but not this time.It seems to me this film would be suitable for almost anyone to watch. Possibly very small children may be frightened by the Katla scenes.I have this on a VHS tape which isn't in prime condition. I would enjoy having this movie on a DVD in widescreen format.".

It was on a BetaMax tape and was dubbed in English. I had to of watched this movie at least once week. The story is great and the relationship between the two brothers is rather touching. Despite the fact that even as a child the dragon who used to remind me of the secret weapon from An American Tale looked terrible it was one of my favorite movies for years. If anyone can find a copy of this movie I suggest you watch it. Also the synthesized soundtrack is quite good arpeggios reminiscent of Philip Glass or something.".

I remember as a child seeing this film on video and feeling totally absorbed with it as I had never until then seen a movie that dealt with such issues for a child my age.Thoughts moving around life and death are issues that all kids are confronted with and are issues which evokes questions in the minds of children. Many grownups are unable to handle questions from kids regarding death in these cases I think this film is an exquisite piece of art.But of course the film is not all about death it is also a movie about bravery go about and dare to do what frightens you in life and of course the life altering condition of love the love between two brothers.It's interesting to hear how Lindgren imaginative work started for this book. She told a Swedish newspaper many years ago that it started out with her walking through a cemetery which was something she liked to do and seeing the grave of two brothers. Then a time after that she attended a press conference for the casting of a film based on one of her books after the press conference the leading actor a sevenyear old walked down the stage and sat down in his older brothers knee and the older brother kissed him on the forehead which was something she found very moving by then she knew her next story was going to be about two brothers. The final imaginative episode was when she went with the train in northern Sweden she told it as being a cold winter day a day when it was as beautiful as if it wasn't of this earth by then she knew that the story was to involve the question of death and a life after this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sweden may be famous for a lot of things but when it comes to cinema it isn't exactly the first country that comes to the minds of most of us. I know very little of Swedish cinema and I am not Swedish myself so I'm probably not the right person to speculate on this but it seems to me that even if Swedish films achieve success in their native country outside they are largely unknown. This is a world and society much too focused on the always and eternally popular American cinema.This is deservedly one of the most famous Nordic films as well as an fabulous mix of visual art. The beginning is in black and white however colored in sepia tone  like in 'The Wizard of Oz' 1939. The fantasy sequences are colored which means that most of it is like that. The ending is in black and white this time the classic black and white without sepia tone.This is a very artistic movie in other aspects as well. The cinematography is one of the most beautiful and magical I know. No need to say more images speak for themselves and there is nothing like seeing with your very own eyes and get stunned.This starts off as a sad story about a cute 9year old boy Karl Lejon Skorpan who is dying from tuberculosis. His much older brother Jonatan promises him that someday they'll meet in a magical land named Nangijala. During a house fire the older brother dies and the younger dies of terminal illness shortly after being rescued. Then the movie jumps literally into the dreamy land and almost the rest of the thing takes place there. The two brothers are there as the older promised now as Jonatan and Karl or Skorpan Lejonhjrta. They live adventures fight against evil knights and become local heroes.This touching film rightfully won an award for Best Direction in its country. No wonder Swedes are so found of this one. Unfortunately like so many other really good movies it's really hard to find. These sohardtofind movies deserve simpler access to be better known and to be discoveredrediscovered.Lars Sderdahl is terrific as Skorpan. Staffan Gtestam is excellent as Jonatan. Allan Edwall has the same level of excellence as Mattias. The dragon Katla is clearly mechanical which you can tell by the primitive animation and walruslike awful appearance. But it certainly intimidates.One final word for the soundtrack. The main theme is strong emotional and beautiful. Combines well with the film's mood. The rest of the soundtrack too.I have no idea what is the title of this in my country.".

As to why it isn't in other places I believe it has to do with people's general lack of knowledge on foreign cinema. People's obsession and fixation on American cinema surprises me being such that they often forget that other countries and cultures have their own cinema. That can also be because there are so many really good movies that are hard to find and this is one of them.The cinematography on this is some of the most beautiful I've ever laid my eyes on. The story and pacing are practically perfect and the movie is touching. The dragon Katla looks hilariously dated and almost resembles one of those strange creatures from 'Star Wars'. Its animation is purely mechanical and would be considered by many as too crude for nowadays's ultrademanding standards but was effective for its time and still is for those who don't care about progress. The soundtrack especially the main theme is somewhat odd but haunting.The main actors who portray the brothers are authentic. The younger is tenderly called Skorpan by the older. Skorpan means Rusk which has different meanings apparently a light softtextured sweetened biscuit a sweet raised bread dried and browned in an oven.The story is about the Lionheart Brothers. Skorpan is very ill and won't live much longer but his older brother Jonatan tries to calm him down and convince him that death might not be such a bad thing as he will go to a beautiful place. Very shortly after Jonatan dies while saving Skorpan from a house fire and Skorpan dies not long after. As promised by Jonatan they meet in the beautiful land and Skorpan is strong and healthy. Together they go through moments of peace and tenderness but they also face risky adventures and fight against evil knights to save the magnificent land.Technically the movie is distinguish and unique. What other movie has the sophisticated sepiatone bright colors and the classic black and white? And all in the same movie! You name me one which combines all these techniques.This should definitely be on Top 250.".

There the world is a much more clear place of good and evil but also much more cruel and more beautiful than the one they've just left. Here the evil stonehearted knight Tengil rules with absolute ironfisted power.But there is also an existing hidden movement among the peaceful farmers almost like in a strange sagaversion of WW2 France there is a La Resistance that works to hinder the dark and violent forces of Tengil. Among the heartachingly beautiful valleys of Cherry Blossom Valley and the BriarBush Valley there grows an ever stronger but silent cry of freedom from the oppressors. But it is so beautiful here that one cannot even start to suspect that anything else can be evil not in such a warm cosy world such as this?Not until you meet the darkhelmed darkmantled warriors of Tengil and learn their cruel ways of vile heartlessness. Then you understand how incredibly fragile the farmers world are how defenseless the warm and friendly people of the two Valleys are. Ripe for the taking by the mailed hand of Tengilhis cruel warriors and as if that isn't enough also their immensely powerful ally Katla the Dragon.This story is like an early but very successful paralelled story to the Lord of the Rings only in a much smaller scale. But that doesn't matter as the heartpounding feelings of righteousness are just as strong here. You want the weak ones to carry the torch in just the same manner as in LoTR and burn down evil against all odds in the same way. The only real difference lies in the start of this story as the two brothers live in our world. And that makes the 'reality' of it all so much more true. You can understand the hopelessness here the hatred the cold cruelty the love for beauty of the heart  because it all comes from people of our own world. No CGIcreated computerized creatures here even if the dragon is really badly made. None.And this is only understandable when you see it. So do not miss this for the world. You win the views of two worlds here. With tears.".

Then you understand how incredibly fragile the farmers world are how defenseless the warm and friendly people of the two Valleys are. Ripe for the taking by the mailed hand of Tengilhis cruel warriors and as if that isn't enough also their immensely powerful ally Katla the Dragon.This story is like an early but very successful paralelled story to the Lord of the Rings only in a much smaller scale. But that doesn't matter as the heartpounding feelings of righteousness are just as strong here. You want the weak ones to carry the torch in just the same manner as in LoTR and burn down evil against all odds in the same way. The only real difference lies in the start of this story as the two brothers live in our world. And that makes the 'reality' of it all so much more true. You can understand the hopelessness here the hatred the cold cruelty the love for beauty of the heart  because it all comes from people of our own world. No CGIcreated computerized creatures here even if the dragon is really badly made. None.And this is only understandable when you see it. So do not miss this for the world. You win the views of two worlds here. With tears.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a favourite of mine when I was a kid and it's still a haunting and beautiful story. This adaption of Lindgren's story which I owned too has to be considered a success if not wholly a triumph. In our sanitised world a children's film that contains death loss pain illness treachery and sacrifice seems strangely out of place. It takes a heart of stone not to tear up not even 5 minutes into the film and again at the end. In my opinion children are very well capable of bearing the weight of death in story as well as in real life. Maybe they have to be accompanied but keeping such themes from them makes for a poorer education. The film itself still holds up remarkably well. The sets the horses and the outdoor scenes are beautiful. The costumes are rather laughable and the monster looks as if escaped from SpectroMan but at the point where we first see it you're so deep inside the story it really doesn't matter much. The camerawork is simple but effective. The acting is soso but mostly adequate. The music isn't good except for a few moments where it's really gripping.I heard that there's a new adaption of this book in development and while I'm curious as to what better production values and a professional soundtrack can do for the story I wish they'll stay with the dark and haunting mood and maybe even incorporate more of the book.".

There is one apparently nude scene of the boys by the lake although nothing is showing...this type of scene is more acceptable by Swedish standards and 3. There is killing by arrows spears burning...no gore however.Have you ever wanted to see a movie where the heroes die?  Well this is it. The Lionheart boys die...twice.  It seems every time these boys die they go to a different world.  The first time to Nangiola and then at the end of the movie to Nangalima.  Now if this movie were from Hollywood I'd smell sequel.The majority of the movie takes place in Nangiola where Karl Crispy and Jonathan Lionheart help the good guys the folks from cherry blossom valley  wild rose valley.  They are fighting an evil warlord Tingle who...what else...wants to take over the whole place.  Tingle just happens to have a dragon too...a sorry beast that looks more like a stuffed walrus on fire.This movie is a sorry mess.  The music score is just plain dreadful.  The acting...well...my dog is better.  Were those kids wearing wigs?  And effects?...what effects.  They even tried unsuccessfully the old Wizard of Oz trick using sepia tone at the beginning and then changing to colour when the boys enter Nangiola. But those black capes worn by Tingle's bad guys which had purple linings were hilarious.  This one gets a 2 out of 10.If you can find this movie it's worth a laugh or two just for its weirdness.  I actually found this one on a cheap DVD in Singapore...dubbed in English no less.  It might have been a bootleg!  Naaa...nobody would bootleg such a bad movie!".

His older brother Jonathan tells him not to fear. When he dies he'll go to some place called Nagliomi I think that's how you spell it.Jonathan dies trying to rescue Crispy from a fire.  Crispy dies shortly after.  They meet up in Nagliomi.  The scenes in the afterlife are shot in color but their just as dreary.  The brothers live in a medivel village called Cherry Valley.  Aparently the neighboring vilage Wild Rose Valley has some kind of warlord that enslaves it's people.  He rules over them with a big dragon called Catla.The brothers end up going to war with the bad guy.  The dragon makes the Toho monsters look like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.  I do know that in Norse Viking mythology the greatest honor is to die and go to some place where your always at war.  Compared to this the films of Ingmar Bergman look like The Care Bear Movie.".

	schema:headline " Brit Wit Rom Com in one of London's most famous districts";
	schema:reviewBody "After reading the synopsis 'Notting Hill' sounds like just another melodramatic Julia Roberts rom com. Fortunately that ain't the case. 'Notting Hill' is fun sweet intelligent and  well simply said very entertaining. London's Notting Hill does seem like a street you'd like to walk on.While the storyline itself is larger than life the characters are real. There is no overt melodrama. We can see that Curtis put a lot of heart and some Brit wit humour into the writing. After meeting William Anna Spike Max Bella and Honey we as audience really connect to these very interesting characters and care about them. The table discussion in Honey's birthday scene shows how all the characters connect. While a nervous Anna is new to the group we see that she eventually gets a hang of them and feels comfortable enough to talk about herself.Hugh Grant isn't anything different from his other rom coms. Julia Roberts is brilliant. I never liked any of her romantic comedies e.g. Pretty Woman I Love Trouble Something to Talk About etc but 'notting Hill is an exception. She gives a subtle portrayal as hugely famous but very vulnerable Anna Scott and does full justice. This indeed is one of her finest performances. Rhys Ifans as Spike is standout! While Tim McInnerny Emma Chambers Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee love her are excellent. McKee's comedy is extremely subtle and her character is one of the most appealing. She underplays her part with tremendous grace and maturity.All the actors share a very warm chemistry that just keeps adding on to its quality. The relationship and friendship between the characters is shown in a very sensitive way. While Spike and William are roommates who just seem to get along we know that they like each other. Also William is about to cancel a date with the world's most famous actress to attend his sister's birthday party. The relationship between Max and Bella is beautiful.Additional credit must be given to Coulter's amazing cinematography and the visuals. Watch the scene where Thacker is walking through the market and we see the weather change indicating the passing time. There's a beautiful soundtrack that recites the moods of the scenes. And last but not least thanks to Roger Mitchell for putting it all together to tell us this sweet entertaining story.".

	schema:headline " Sparkling romance at a deliberate British pace";
	schema:reviewBody "It may be a paradox to say that a film can sparkle slowly yet that's the only way I can describe this charming romantic comedy. The stardomcrossed lovers don't know that they are Meant For Each Other ... yes this is the standard RomCom setup. But the way they don't know? That is put across in a most British and deliberate pace and setting. And it makes the ending that we all know is coming gather color and charm.Notting Hill takes over a third of its running time to show William Hugh Grant as he is immersed in his daily life wanting to be supportive of his friends yet searching for his own inner life. The five closest friends all show something he lacks happy conformity a loving marriage transcending obstacles a sister who takes bold risks for finding love and a roommate that sees through pretense and says so and yes is delightfully vulgar.That very British characterinawrysetting pattern borrows from Four Weddings and a Funeral but the only friends there that I could consistently believe mattered to Grant's character were the gay couple one comic the other showing profound emotion. Here all of the lead character's circle deeply cares about him as he does about them. This makes all the difference.Where it matters most is in giving him support when the American film beauty Julia Roberts comes into his life then out then in then ... and all in ways that are believable for such dissimilar lovers. The romantic turns are more plausible because Grant's character has such support and a place for sharing his emotional rollercoaster ride. He isn't crushed by the down moments but picks up his individuality and moves on. And his friends tell him sometimes with only searching looks just when he's picked up too much of being on his own. Okay the moment towards the end when Spike puts his exasperation into three pointed even vulgar words is a refreshing change. Sometimes when a friend lets loose with the pithy truth it hits the needed spot.All this backstory character richness and pointed use of the right words are British qualities that we don't get with the standard American RomCom setup.Gina McKee's turn here as Grant's wheelchairbound female friend is of someone with deeply felt individuality and unique perceptiveness including her own tender perspective on loves past and present  especially her husband. It's a glimpse into a woman with distinctive qualities that she has chosen. This makes her both appealing to all her friends and forceful by quiet understatement. She also ends up being much funnier when you've rewound the tape and end up thinking about the story. Listen for her spoken turn on standing up. No it's not a cheap play on her limitations. Not in context. And that's subtle comic acting.Richard Curtis's inventive screenplay is one of the best in years and would reward a look in book form as well. He takes this backdrop of supportive friends puts in the sparkle of Roberts invading and shaking up their world and creates a skein of personal truths and imposed celebrity nonsense.Grant and Roberts are both passionate and bemused observers of the absurdities of fame that end up surrounding them but they act this out in comic byplay and inventive responses. This isn't an American breakneckpace or screwball comedy and their subtle discovery of each other's minds and substance wouldn't work in such a setting.Roberts has both the easy familiarity with and the hairtrigger of frustration from fame both coming out to undermine her when she least expects it. But she shows that she can grow and learn from her mistakes. Unlike her wellacted but overexplained realization at the end of Runaway Bride. She even has one scene sans makeup that is a genuine romantic turning point. I don't see many other actresses being willing to try that.Grant shows an astonishing inner strength and selfawareness not being willing to hide how he sees reality. He did the same realistic turn in Four Weddings but didn't try nearly as effectively to figure himself out.The photography and settings show off London beautifully and the story's interior scenes make highly imaginative use of a narrow stackedup Notting Hill minitownhouse.I do feel the director fails to take up some opportunities to build on the comic or dramatic moments in the screenplay. He coasts on the words. They're excellent words but they need a twist at times.My only takeoffapoint quibble is with the music. It's mostly popular tunes that underscore the action. One of these is luminous and frames the story perfectly  Elvis Costello's cover of She. Others though use their lyrics to overstress plot points. Some are performed too high in volume sometimes lapping against dialogue.The two original themes by Trevor Jones are beautiful lushly written and quite fitting to the main characters. We should have had more of his work but they're less than a fourth of the film's music.The British often put more creativity below the narrative surface and into the setting than Americans do and often get beyond formula. To discover this in a film is joyous. You'll feel this when you find yourself compelled to see this deeply felt yet very funny film twice thrice or more. For me it's still delightful after nine months and nine viewings. Edited on 21 April 2011 After another decade and another ten viewings this love story has only become more resonant and beautiful. The popsong choices feel notably less obtrusive. The acting of both Roberts and Grant has evinced more depth. And I see no reason to not give it a full 10 rating.".

	schema:headline " Warm and Human British Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Notting Hill is a district of west London that was built as a fashionable Victorian suburb became very run down during the mid twentieth century and is now once again fashionable but which retains a distinctly cosmopolitan atmosphere with London's biggest street market and many small specialist shops. My wife and I sometimes go there to shop for bargains. The hero of the film William Thacker is the owner of one of these shops a travel bookshop. The film concerns the romance which develops between William and a young woman named Anna Scott whom he meets when she comes into his shop.As another reviewer has pointed out 'Notting Hill' is based around a theme love between people of unequal social standing which has provided literature with some of its greatest works both comic and serious dating back at least to the tale of King Cophetua and the beggarmaid. Although many of these stories tell of a poor but honest lad who aspires to the hand of a princess or titled lady Anna is not part of the Royal Family or the British aristocracy. She rather belongs to an even more exclusive elite the Hollywood starocracy. She is a hugely popular film star who earns at least 15000000 per film and pops into William's shop during a brief stay in London to publicise her latest movie. Although Anna is played by a reallife Hollywood superstar Julia Roberts the film is very typically British. William is similar to an number of other Hugh Grant characters being a shy diffident middleclass Englishman probably publicschool and university educated. Despite this background he is not particularly wealthy following a divorce from his first wife and is forced to share his lodgings with an eccentric Welsh flatmate Spike. The humour of the film particularly the dinnerparty banter between William and his friends is mostly of the typically ironic selfdeprecating variety popular in Britain especially in middleclass circles. Rhys Ifans's Spike by contrast typifies another strand of British humour the eccentric zaniness found in the likes of 'Monty Python'. Spike's strong provincial accent suggests a more workingclass background this possibly accounts for the teasing that he has to put up with from the other characters although he takes it all in good part. William may be diffident selfdeprecating and unsuccessful but he is probably the stronger of the two main characters. Anna is beautiful and successful but underneath it all she is insecure worried about losing her fame and fortune and about her inability to form lasting relationships with men. Early on in the film she has another boyfriend Jeff but it is clear that he is only the latest in a long string of unsatisfactory romances which have left her emotionally and in some cases physically bruised. The scene where Anna says to William 'I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her' is the one where we see her at her most vulnerable. Although both characters are in their late twenties or thirties it is noteworthy that Anna refers to 'girl and boy' rather than 'woman and man'. Anna's vulnerability also comes through in her reaction in the scene where hordes of paparazzi appear on William's doorstep William tries to play down the incident and Spike finds it hugely amusing but Anna is horrified. The film was made shortly after the death of Princess Diana this scene possibly reflects British disgust with the antics of the paparazzi who were regarded as being partly to blame for the Princess's death. Like others I found myself wondering how much Anna's personality reflects Julia Roberts's own she too has had a number of unhappy relationships. Important roles are also played by Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as William's best friend Max and his disabled wife Bella the love of this ordinary couple for each other provides a more realistic downtoearth counterpart to the fairytale romance of William and Anna helping to anchor the film more firmly in reality. The main charm however lies in the relationship of the two main characters as Anna comes to realise that the seemingly ordinary William has a kindness and decency which count for more than the monstrous egos of Jeff and his like. Like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' which was also written by Richard Curtis and starred Hugh Grant 'Notting Hill' is one of the warmest and most human British films of the nineties. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Visually lovely Notting Hill becomes an enchanting fairy tale.....a magical and endearing love story from the opening credits to an afternoon of quiet sharing in a London park.  Being a romantic at heart I was emotionally drawn to this well produced and entertaining motion picture enticing me to view it a number of times more.Some friends have indicated that the plot is boring and in 2 hours and 4 minutes takes too long to come to an expected conclusion.

I understand he wrote this screenplay and completed it before he realised just how similar it was to his previous hit Four Weddings and a Funeral.Let's examine this a second Hugh Grant is the hero There's an elusive and glamorous American that he falls for He has a circle of friends each in their own way a success AND a failure in life and yet Hugh's character William Thacker is somehow trailing them all there's the kooky yet endearing sister the character with a tragic disability a complete buffoon of a sidekick and several nearmisses.Yet it's all so thoroughly entertaining AGAIN. It's like a delicious dish and its recipe for success is cooked up time and again by Curtis as Jamie Oliver's older and wiser brother.As a single bloke in this day and age I AM William Thacker and I AM Charles in Four Weddings. So on the one hand you'll have parts of the audience identifying with the hero and parts of the audience wanting the hero to be their reallife partner. Yet character empathy alone is not enough to carry a film.The path that the hero follows needs to be a rollercoaster ride. Sometimes it's up sometimes it's down but it's never boring. In fact the pacing is assuredly steady just as in one excellent scene we see the indication of time passing in an extremely effective way. I feel that Curtis learnt from Four Weddings and tightened the strings on the time line in this movie. Where Four Weddings very occasionally crawls Notting Hill paces along assuredly.In addition our hero's rollercoaster ride must be believable. Could this really happen? Why not? Do movie stars ALWAYS fall for other celebrities? So what of the performances? Well Hugh Grant is really Hugh Grant again in this role. But isn't that why we go to see Hugh Grant movies? He's funny yet tragic vulnerable yet assured and I can't imagine anyone else playing William.Julia Roberts is one of those stars who love her or hate her delivers in every role. She's very believable as Anna Scott showing the resolute public charm of a movie star whilst exposing the hidden human frailty behind Hollywood's finest. And this despite the undoubted and wholly false criticism that she's simply playing a movie star like she in fact is. She perhaps COULD have leaned back and simply ambled through the movie expecting it to be an easy role for her but in a truly professional manner she's sought to add depth and weight to her character.The rest of the cast sparkle in their roles most notably Rhys Ifans as Spike. But even without the requisite comedy set pieces that Rhys revels in actors of class such as Tim McInnerny James Dreyfus Gina McKee Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville expertly fill in the noless important landscape of this joyous and warm piece of art.Watch out too for memorable cameos by Alec Baldwin Mischa Barton and Matthew Modine.So who is Cinderella and who is the Prince? At first glance William is the hopeful nobody. But really as the story develops we'll see that there are two character's dreams unfolding in Notting Hill.Why then not 10 out of 10? Well full marks would have been ME starring as William Thacker... ".

But it is a good film thanks to the strong performances fresh script and the film's look. While not laugh out loud funny Notting Hill is nonetheless warm and charming. The script is fresh sometimes funny sometimes insightful. The part where Anna says I am just a girl standing in front of a boy waiting for him to love her may be cringe worthy to some people but for me no matter how clichd it is it shows a vulnerable side to Anna's character. The film is based on love revolved around unequal social standing William being diffident and unsuccessful Anna being the complete opposite. The photography is fabulous and the direction is excellent. Hugh Grant is charming as William and Julia Roberts is positively luminous as Anna and the two have strong chemistry. Out of the supporting performers Rhys Ifans stands out in a very zany turn as Spike. The music is lovely too. All in all this is very warm charming and pleasant yeah the ending is predictable but this is a well written and quite irresistible film. 8.510 Bethany Cox".

I was not disappointed.  Hugh Grant's jittery bumbling charm has never been more endearing.  The vulnerability Grant infuses into his character is definitely his best quality and it's perfectly understandable that he might decline the opportunity to date a megastar actress out of trepidation.Julia Roberts' legions of fans will not be let down by her character.  It's deadon Julia.  But those who are not among her fans will be slowly but surely won over by the honesty and directness of the character.  I don't care what your testosterone quotient is there won't be a dry eye in the house when she almost whispers nervous smile masking the hurt that she's just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her.The story is by the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary so it's a sure bet from the start.  But Grant and Roberts take what might have been a slightly weak treatment and make it sparkle.I get so sick of everyone who poohpooh's a happy ending because it's somehow so unbelievable that things ever work out right.  Instead we demand tear jerker disappointment at every turn and end up with Kevin Costner drowning like a sacrificial lamb at the end of Message in a Bottle to satisfy our lust for tragedy.  I love it when things work out well in my life and sometimes I like to see films about things working out.  If a bookstore owner in London can actually end up with the top actress in Hollywood then maybe I'll get that promotion or that beautiful new associate might actually talk to me.  Is that so bad?".

	schema:reviewBody "  After suffering a divorce a marriage between a best friend and an exlover not to mention living with a complete slob for a roommate travel bookstore owner William Hugh Grant was just trying to live a peaceful existence in Notting Hill England with his disastrous lovelife and a fledgling bookstore.  When American film megastar Anna Scott Julia Roberts comes in to browse for books about Turkey the two sense a mutual attraction and begin a delicate love affair that threatens both their complicated lives.  The crux of Notting Hill is this  can two exact opposites in the complex world of publicity and disposable relationships stay together forever? Screenwriter Richard Curtis's Four Weddings And A Funeral goal this time around seems to be a sharp satire of the Hollywood starlets and their psychotic relationships with the public and themselves and the old wacky English humour we've come to expect from any film with Mr. Grant.  It's a very odd mixture of the audiencepleasing easy comedy and something more sinister  possibly due to both lead's past public lives.  He creates two compelling characters in Anna and Garrett.  They both have very convincing motives for the courtship it isn't just a roll in the hay and then the aftermath like most films.  Director Roger Michell keeps the flow nice and the two leads make good on their promise for charm and beauty. I'm a little irritated that so many would consider this a big step for Julia Roberts in the acting department.  She already gave a commanding performance in last year's Stepmom.  With Hill Roberts continues her impressive growth spurt into real adult acting and role choices.  Her work with Grant here is the most easy going I've even seen her doMaybe one too many closeups of that smile though....  Hugh Grant does his stammering best to make William seem lovable.  I'm not a fan of Mr. Grant but I will easily concede that this is his best performance to date.  Rhys Ifans is disgusting a good thing as Spike William's flatmate.  He brings some very much needed brevity to the proceedings.  If anyone ever needs an actor to represent an English skuzzball they should call this guy. If the charming Notting Hill suffers from anything it might be the She's All That syndrome.  Whenever you get the relationship ball rolling it seems in everyone of these movies we need a forced situation to break up the two leads just so we can cheer when they reconcile.  That's fine no complaints.  In Hill this syndrome is put to the extreme test.  We follow this romance through I believe at least three breakups.  That's too many for a two hour film.  We never get sure footing on to why these two should be together and that is a frustrating element.  Director Michell tries to hold onto the reins but the climax of the film is forced and seriously uncharacteristic of the movie. Notting Hill has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts's character embraces her superstardom or is oppressed by it.  Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within the fishbowl. When you think about it William was a fan of Anna before meeting her yet that subject seems too taboo for the film. What we get is just puppy love no strings.Notting Hill is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. It's a concoction that's hard to resist.  You'll come out of it with a warm fuzzy feeling in the tips of your toes.  It's nice to have a film that just wants to please I just wish they didn't lay such a heavy topic wet blanket over the proceedings.  8".

Hugh Grant is lovely in a part destined to seem Hugh Grantish with all the clipped bit of nonsense that have made Grant a household name. The quirky friends and bizarre room mates are the questionable salt and pepper of this romantic tale. I found myself smiling getting impatient and enjoying it all at the same time. I'm too much of a Preston Sturgess fan to be able to sit through a modern comedy in the way I did with The Lady Eve for instance. My favorite moment The Horse and Hound sequence. Very funny.

	schema:reviewBody "Notting Hill this totally implausible happily improbable feel good flick does more to influence positive attitudes about people with disabilities than any all day sensitivity training seminar could ever hope to accomplish.As significant as the two leading characters is the everpresent fanciful circle of friends. Wouldn't we all love to have a close group of intimate chums like these! The collection of assorted characters includes Bella a woman who uses a wheelchair a sleek Quickie Ultralight at that. I love the easy nonchalance of her introduction to the viewer. She is merely one of many diverse folks in the daytoday life of William Thacker the film's protagonist.In one afterdinner scene the group sits around a big friendly worn farmhouse table consuming way too much wine and sharing what stinks about their life. Bella reveals that she and her husband discovered they cannot have children. I like that she also dares make a complaint about sitting in this damn chair. She is being honest she is not burdening herself with feelings that she should sugarcoat her life for others. Nor does she feel compelled to be upbeat and cheerful no matter the cost to her own integrity.This character lives a typical dare I say normal life. She is married throws parties gets drunk on occasion and interacts with the able bodied world around her . . . all with unaffected naturalness. I like the message this sends to the viewing public people with disabilities are a whole lot like people without disabilities.In a scene when Anna Scott and William Thacker leave the birthday party celebration the very first words out of Anna's mouth are Why is Bella in a wheelchair? This is precisely to the letter as it would be in real life. When folks come in contact with a person with an obvious disability they understandably want to know what happened.Bella's husband tenderly lifts her out of her wheelchair to carry her up the staircase to bed. My thermometer was on . .. testing for feelings of excessive sympathy or sorrow in myself or in the audience. There were none. There was only empathy warmth and tenderness much of what one would feel watching any loving couple where the man lifted the woman over a doorstep for instance into their first home. Kudos to the director and the actors for not playing the pity card here. Thankfully no soaring violins tugged at our tear ducts.As the culminating scene of the movie approaches the group of friends all impulsively jump into a small European car to race off. There was Bella left waving goodbye from her Quickie. No wait a minute. This was not to be. They wanted Bella with them she belonged with them on this mission. There were no complicated maneuvers of how will we squeeze her into the car what will we do with the wheelchair no exasperation from the characters. They just did it. They made it happen. Before we knew it Bella was sitting in the front seat a few others had rearranged their positions and crammed into the back seat and off they all went charging away full speed ahead.In a final scene the friends are attempting to 'crash a private party' so to speak and having trouble getting past the hotel management. In a boldly triumphant move Bella comes wheeling authoritatively toward the hotel bureaucrat confidently announcing in a power voice He is with ME. I am soandso from suchandsuch journal writing an article on how your hotel treats people with disabilities.Swoosh! All doors opened to the group! Bella saved the day in her quickwitted plot to get past the hotel magistrate. Aside from the glee I felt at her being the savior of the day I also applaud the embedded message Disability rights are expected don't tread on disability civil rights disability access is what's happenin' in the Nineties.This film has broad crossclass mass appeal from the teenybopper to Joe Six Pack to the intellectual and therefore has the power to impact the sensibilities of millions of viewers. I applaud Notting Hill for its contribution toward influencing positive attitudes toward people with disabilities.".

Wouldn't we all love to have a close group of intimate chums like these! The collection of assorted characters includes Bella a woman who uses a wheelchair a sleek Quickie Ultralight at that. I love the easy nonchalance of her introduction to the viewer.

	schema:reviewBody "Whether or not realistic this is a wonderfully touching fairy tale like story of the romance between two people of unequal social and financial standing. The beautiful rich and famous American movie star is superbly captured by the incomparable and always endearing Julia Roberts who brings such a wonderful vulnerability to her roles. Hugh Grant is perfect as the shy stammering bumbling unassuming obscure and not very affluent London bookseller who shares a flat with his zany weird roommate Spike.The tale revolves around the world's most famous actress Anna Scott who visits a Notting Hill travel bookshop and thereby meets the very ordinary British bookseller William Thacker. Improbable as it might seem the two fall in love despite the fact that Anna already has a 'significant other' in the form of the obnoxious star Jeff who treats her poorly. Alas Anna and William's romance is of course subject to hounding by the ubiquitous media making the course of true love definitely not run smooth.Just an aside but did the screenwriters get Hugh Grant's character's name from the Victorian novelist William Makepeace Thackeray? It seems quite a coincidence. Ha ha. Anyway nice name...The film does a marvelous job conveying what must resemble Julia Roberts' own fishbowl life subject to constant media scrutiny and innuendo. She must have identified strongly with the character she was playing not only the media nuisance but also the failed relationships so common among film stars. Her hounding by the paparazzi is also of course reminiscent of that plaguing the late Princess Diana and of course sadly resulting in her death.The portrayal of William's friends is very touching here as their reaction transforms from understandable awe at socializing with such a famous star to accepting and treating Anna as basically an ordinary person and good friend. The viewer gets a sense of how much this response this genuine friendship means to Anna. One of William's friends is a disabled wife in a wheelchair. Her normal ordinary life and attitude are well captured and would be well received I believe by viewers with physical disabilities.The love story is beautifully depicted. The sadness of Anna's failed past romantic involvements is conveyed and despite the fame her vulnerability as being really just 'an ordinary girl in love with an ordinary boy'. The portrayal of William is touching as he copes with all the media attention sees the actual person behind all that fame wealth and glamour and tries to give Anna the genuine security and the 'ordinary life' she so desperately craves. A fabulous moving and ultra romantic film with a relevant message regarding modern society's perception and treatment of its movie stars. We can all learn a lesson here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Julia Roberts is the queen of Romantic Comedies. Her iconic role in Pretty Woman should give her the title alone but she's been in tons some good while others weren't. However she chose a good one in Notting Hill. Notting Hill is a sweet goodnatured romantic comedy that succeeds on every level it is trying to be. The story is wellwritten and more original then it may come off from the trailers. This is a film about movie stars that actually have meaningful conversations about being movie stars. Hugh Grant is also dashing in the leading man role. Roberts actually gives best RomCom performance here aside from the OscarNominated Pretty Woman. She restrains herself and isn't loud or obnoxious just true to the character. This is some of her most underrated work. With beautiful shots of London and a sweeping romance Notting Hill is an example for future romantic comedies. I only had one problem there is a huge gap in the middle where Roberts is off in America. I understood it was important to the story but it didn't have to last 20 minutes. This is her story as much as it Grant's but the writers put her on the backburner. While the ending is predictable it's sweet and makes you smile. Wonderful film 8.5".

	schema:reviewBody "A wonderful movie about celebrity meeting normality. Nothing Hill stars Hugh Grant as a book store owner whose life is changed when an international movie star Anna played by Julia Roberts walks into his book store. By fate William collides into Anna knocking his lunch all over her. William offers Anna the opportunity to clean up in his flat across the way. Anna agrees.Suddenly William has an international celebrity in his house. He desperately tries to keep her there by offering everything in his refrigerator. Anna leaves but comes back and they kiss. Seems a bit Hollywood am I right? No I'm wrong. Nothing Hill's a wonderful film from start to finish. William tracks Anna down and they start dating.The movie basically has the same premise as Woody Allen's wonderful Purple rose of Cairo even though Purple rose leans more towards fantasy than reality. Both movies contain quiet humble perfectly normal people confronted by celebrities.Nothing Hill perfectly nails the relationship between celebrity and normality. Not just on a romantic level but on a general level as well. In a wonderful scene Anna's invited to William's sisters Birthday party. At the table she's filled with happiness and joy by how happy and simple it is to be normal. Opposed to living the false life of celebrity. I'm sure 98 percent of society would love to be in Anna's position but maybe being a celebrity is not what is appears to be. Not everyone thrives off celebrity getting a great deal of pleasure out of the shallowness of fame and fortune. Not everyone worships their own celebrity status like the Paris Hilton's of the world.But on a romantic level Nothing Hill succeeds amazingly as well. Just seeing William and Anna walk down the road sit together in a restaurant together has amazingly wonderful charm to it. It's easy to put your self in William's shoes and feel his pleasure and excitement basically why I loved this movie so much. I felt William's excitement the same way Cecilia felt everyone's on screen in the Purple Rose of Cairo. I escaped my own normal existence through William's wonderful situation with Anna.It must be every man's dream especially a humble man like William's to have a beautiful superstar walk into their life and fall in love with them. Oh how'd I love for Natalie Portman to walk into my bookstore and kiss me. It won't happen because A I don't have a book store and B because reality bites. But why not dream? Anyway William and Anna fall in love share intimate moments and the shallowness of celebrity mixes in. Anna pisses me off towards the end of the movie when the paparazzi show up at Williams's door snapping a photo of him in his boxers with her upstairs. Anna suddenly puts her career before the likes of William. Anna leaves William mopes around but his flat mate and sister track down Anna for him.Of course William tracks Anna down on a movie set a few months later after she wins an academy award which Roberts would win in reality a year later for Erin Brockovich but mistakenly hears her say a rather rude remark about him. Little does he know it was in character. But Anna once again returns to Williams's book store confesses her love for him he turns her down his friends make him realize how dumb of a mistake it was and then he tracks her down at a press conference. And they live happily ever after.Of course in reality this probably wouldn't happen. But why couldn't it? Why can't celebrities and every day people fall in love? Like Anna says she's just a small town girl. Nothing Hill's a wonderful movie no matter how you look at it. Everything about it's perfect. Julia Robert's and Hugh Grants best work. 1010".

And to make it even easier her role here is to be a huge megastar actress. Which she already is. Voila a perfect fit.The magic and romance that is meant to spark between the two leads isn't always convincing but there is a sparkling kind of dialog between them and among extended family that keeps it going. There is some really sharp writing here.And there is some really stupid acting. The goofy roommate is just too goofy and caricatured for the rest of the cast and he is given some of the weakest script to read as well. The first appearance of Grant's family might strike you as forced as well but they gradually work their way into the film and are actually warm and very funny. I wish they had been larger and the roommate smaller in the plans.Director Roger Michell has a short resume including a wellregarded Persuasion which didn't persuade me I like Jane Austen too much I think. But there is a sensibility in that film that carries over here in some of the family scenes. Well done as far as the script takes it.Don't expect a great movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Notting Hill 1999 directed by Roger Michell is a showpiece for Julia Roberts and for London. Hugh Grant is pretty good too.The movie is undoubtedly formulaic. From the moment Julia RobertsAnna Scott the most famous woman in Hollywoodsteps into Hugh Grant's bookstore we can pretty much predict how the rest of the movie will turn out. My comment about this is So what? No one wants a romantic comedy with a sad ending and no one wants to think about whether the most famous actress in the world could really enjoy life with a kind and gentle man who lives and works in Notting Hill.The movie has some real strengths William Thacker Grant has a loving lovable sister Emma Chambers and some great friends. The Portobello Road market and the Notting Hill section of London look colorful and authentic. London gleams in the sunshine and the posh hotels look well posh. Most important Julia Roberts is perfect for the part. The clich is that the camera loves Julia Roberts. I would say instead that WE love Julia Roberts. The camera just transmits her beauty and charm so that we can appreciate it. Note Watch for the lovely Emily Mortimer who plays Perfect Girl. That is she and William are brought together after Anna breaks his heart and she would indeed be perfect for him. However who wants to see a romantic comedy where the hero says Sure who needs Anna Scott when Perfect Girl is around? It just wouldn't be romantic and it wouldn't be comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bookshop owner William Thacker's Hugh Grant life is turned upside down when Hollywood star Anna Scott Julia Roberts ventures into his shop.By definition Notting Hill is crowd pleasing fluff for the romantically inclined. Nothing wrong with that of course chances are that if you have tuned in on TV or loaded this film on your player you are fully expecting a fluffarama with lots of toothy smiles. Sure enough Notting Hill written by Richard Curtis and directed by Roger Mitchell delivers everything that the wish fulfilment plot synopsis suggests it will. And nicely providing a few laughs into the bargain as well.That it stops short of being a top line romcom falls at the feet of Curtis and his over egged script. The comedy is razor sharp and the romance is excellently fleshed from start to finish but in his need to add drama via media intrusion and a woe is me life of the actress Curtis comes dangerously close to fluffing his well fluff piece.Still it's a flaw that doesn't sink the film because hey! We want feelgood and that's what we shall bloody well get! Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts take the lead roles of our mismatched matched coupling and as it turns out it's a fine bit of casting. Roberts is not asked to do much other than smile and work well opposite Grant's wonderful foppish charm while both actors benefit from an excellent supporting cast who rise above what in essence is a roll call of rallying around your mate mates!Especially praise worthy is the efforts of Gina McKee and Tim McInnerny whose subplot story could have been twee but thanks to both of them it actually adds an emotional pull rather than being a shoehorned hindrance. Cringe comedy comes courtesy of Rhys Ifans owning every scene he is in and James Dreyfus adds extra light relief as William's assistant at the shop Martin.There's no Wet Wet Wet theme tune to outstay its welcome and Roberts says her cringer line with far more oomph than that of Andie MacDowell. To which all told it makes Notting Hill no masterpiece in a much loved genre but crucially it is however a delightful frothy film that hopefully makes you smile as much as it does yours truly. 710".

However there are hundreds of films on this site that in my opinion are far inferior to this gem. I am not a fan of romantic comedies in general as the vast majority are so much shallow pond water  full of rather tasteless odds and ends and leaving a bad taste in the mouth. There are some exceptions and this is one. Julia Roberts plays the part of the flawed but beautiful film star and Hugh Grant plays his diffident best as the understated dry humored Englishman. But what makes this film great is the whole cast from the effeminate book shop assistant to William's quirky sister Rhys Ifan's delightful gently crude and socially inept Welshman Bernie the failed stock market trader Played immaculately by the now famous Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville I could go on!The genuine and realistic relationships that the group of friends has contrasts with the world of fame represented in a somewhat satirical fashion. This only serves to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy with the thought of ordinary wellmeaning people who love and appreciate each other and stand together through life's vagaries. How anyone cannot be moved by the response of Anna Julia Roberts at the end smiling like 'a little girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her' and what's more to a stirring rendition of 'She' by Elvis Costello Come on there is enough cynicism in the world not to delight in this gem of a film that oozes happy endings and feel good lives! This is probably the 5th time I have watched it and I admit unashamedly to tears welling up at the end.Give it another viewing you won't be disappointed".

What results is a coming of age story with a certain twist.Twist in that these men have already come of age  they are adults working tending the family and all of life's problems. The coming of age comes in that they are men locked in their past still reminiscing of the good old days when they were young and life was easy fun and there was little if anything to complain about.

	schema:reviewBody "I got this film from Amazon not knowing anything about it other than John C McGinley was in it and that was my reason for buying it. So when the DVD arrived I read the synopsis on the back to see what it was about and it boasted all sorts of 'hilarious' adventures like the film was some wacky comedy. When I started to watch it I didn't feel like I was watching anything too hilarious or wacky but thought once the road trip started it would be funnier. However that wasn't the case. The film in my eyes is misrepresented as a hilarious road movie. I think it's got some nice funny moments great acting but I don't think it's been labelled correctly and I think that will make some people miss this film when they'd likely enjoy it. It's a lot more serious than I thought it would be especially the story arc involving the character Mark. I do have one or two slight niggles with it. I found it hard to see any chemistry between McGinley's character and the actress who played his wife. She seemed so cold even when she was supposed to be concerned and loving and that made it hard to care much about their relationship. The kid playing their son was obviously picked for his 'cute boy' look and his lines were a little too syrupy sweet for my liking. I also found it annoying that upon reaching the films conclusion the character of Jason was omitted from having anything after the hospital scene. We see what becomes of the other two characters but there's no follow up with him which seems like we shouldn't even care about that character. Why have him in the film if in the end it doesn't really matter what happened to him?Besides from that it is a good film and the main three actors are great in their roles. It's nice that the film is allowed to just coast. It never drags on and the conversations seem realistic and genuine as the characters themselves do. But ultimately people getting this film based on how it's been sold I think could be disappointed. If you expect 'hilarious road trip' I think you'll be disappointed. But if you go in wanting something a little bit more genuine from a film then this won't disappoint.".

The characters were entertaining and everyone will identify with one of these guys.If I had to find something negative about the movie...and it's hard.... the ending was a little abrupt. But I guess that's because it was the whole snapshot of life kinda movie where the characters continue living long after the credits rollI hope that doesn't give away anything??!!! Anyway excellent movie. I highly recommend it. Can't wait to see it again!".

Much like the moments that nudged these high school stars away from their predetermined greatness. There is great honesty in this movie I think because the lessons they learn are subtle and it takes time for all of them to learn from their past mistakes as well as the mistakes they make on this road trip.".

I was surprised in Two Tickets To Paradise I was able to look past that and thought he did a good job.I can't imagine this picture cost a lot of money to make but it was a great story not to mention funny that I think everyone can relate to. It amazes me they spend so much money on the big blockbusters that don't even compare.Maybe it's just me wanting to see a slice of life story and not things blown up. I'd definitely go see whatever DB Sweeney directs next. This movie was such a nice surprise.";

The trials we had through the years keeping our friendships together and how we made it through the roughest spots and remained friends. I thank you DB for making this film and your kindness in talking to me at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I am looking forward to your next project. Please contact me when you release this film I would like to purchase a copy for my friends in Oklahoma. Continued success in your career and life.

I found it to be a moving story about male friends and their experiencing the growing pains of life and its changes together. I loved the reunion of D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly from The Cutting Edge as husband and wife. Classic! It's great to see a story about men that doesn't JUST revolve around drinking beer  though there is beer as there should be for a trip like this one. I laughed harder than I have in ages while watching this movie but I wouldn't call it a comedy. I would say it's more of a drama with comedy  which is great because it occasionally catches you off guard  for the good and the bad times. A real solid movie about real emotions and friendships and I highly recommend it to the guys and the ladies. I'd definitely see it again.".

Oh well this movie is like watching an elaborate theatrical stage production. It really feels like you are in the theater it does not feel like a movie. It has that stage drama vibe. Mesmerizing. You will definitely also love the cinematography on this one. I am not joking when I say that you can actually freeze frame and print screen every frame on this movie! The colors and the perspective the light and shadows the objects everything is like a moving painting. I got no idea what kind of genius is required to do so but Agelopoulos has done it! The story is easy to follow but as you expect from a European production is very delicate and presented with flashbacks and allegories.If you are a person who likes Hollywood movies then I suggest you skip this. If you are in to European cinema then this movie is for you. And if you are interested in Art painting mesmerizing visual images and theater then you should really should watch this movie!".

Their love child has become a movie director whose sole purpose in life is his career in the West while their granddaughter has to live the teenage life of divorced parents lost in a life with no purpose. These social changes accompany political changes somehow West starts resembling East. Siberian gulag security has now become Western airport security while the Russian secret police did turn into Berlin police. On this gloomy background Angelopoulos is not too pessimistic there is a glimmer of hope the only generation that can save the Gen Xers from their selfish Baby boomer parents are their grandparents. Overall a wonderful movie by one the greatest directors of our time not only packed with strong historic and political content but also beautiful poetry with many dramatic scenes one especially standing out.

	schema:headline " Angelopoulos' Cinematic Legacy";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2012 the legendary Greek filmmaker Theodoros Angelopoulos was shooting a film called The Other Sea which was supposed to complete a trilogy which he started with The Weeping Meadow 2004 and The Dust of Time 2008. Unfortunately on 24th January he passed away due to which the film got canceled and the trilogy was never completed. Thus The Dust of Time remains as Angelopoulos' final film  his cinematic legacy to us  which we can observe as a summary of his style and a reflection of his oeuvre.Angelopoulos was one of those few surviving masters who had the ability to form a fruitful synthesis of personal and collective experience. He was a poet of time in an ontological sense but also a vital interpreter of our time giving a unique perception of reality which many of us share but find hard to express. The milieus of his films always exhale misery but still include breathtaking ubiquitous beauty. The images of wind snowfall and rainy roads do not give form to a mere landscape  for the landscape has a soul of its own. The viewer looks at the landscape and it gazes back to him. It is an elegiac moment of cohesion with the universe.In brief The Dust of Time is a story about a film director and his life. There are two different time levels the director is making a film in the present about his parents' life in Europe after Stalin's death in 1953. Knowing Angelopoulos' style it is not surprising that these two levels are overlapping. However understanding the details of the story line isn't important. What is essential is to see and experience. It is as if each image was a cloth hiding the absolute image that will never be seen. Each image works as a continuity of its own.The fact that the protagonist of The Dust of Time is a filmmaker associates the film with Angelopoulos' two earlier works Voyage to Cythera 1984 and Ulysses' Gaze 1995 both of which deal with the possibilities of the cinema to depict reality. However in The Dust of Time Angelopoulos concentrates more on man's loneliness with his memories. Another characteristic theme for Angelopoulos is the relation between past and present. In The Dust of Time this theme is treated through dialog between the two time levels. In numerous scenes time and space change abruptly without a word of explanation as characters from different periods may come in physical contact with each other. It is never clear whether it's dream or real but such clarity is unessential and would harm the film to a large extent.In a word The Dust of Time studies the emotion of existential loss. In his poetics of space Angelopoulos studies thematic contrasts of appearance and disappearance absence and presence distance and intimacy. People are constantly separated by objects that are sometimes concrete sometimes abstract. This is veritably philosophical but this film isn't intellectual by any means. To my mind The Dust of Time can be easily understood on an emotional level. All it requires is an open mind and a soul capable of receiving beauty. The whole film is more like an ongoing poetic impression rather than a strict story. During the film the spectator goes through emotions of despair remorse and yearning for touch with the characters.Although these themes are very universal some viewers find The Dust of Time hard to watch. Arguably it is a film that most likely isn't for everybody but I would still recommend it for anybody since it asks so little and gives so much in return. All in all it's a film made by an aging man studying the loneliness of being in the universe as the dust of time sweeps across space  sometimes so quickly that we hardly pay any attention to it sometimes so slowly that we seem to wither away with it and sometimes the dust seems to remain stagnant as though not moving at all.".

It was produced by Theo Angelopoulos' frequent collaborator and wife Phoebe Economopoulos and is Greek Italian German and Russian coproduction.

The international cast primarily consisting of American actor Willem Dafoe Swiss actress Irne Jacob German actor Bruno Ganz German actress Christiane Paul and French actor Michel Piccoli delivers affective acting performances in this somewhat elegiac at times humorous humane and moving historic drama from one of Greece's most reverent and important filmmakers which is seen from varied points of view.".

I have to admit it's pretty heavy and hard to watch!Which made me admire the actor even more he also played Hitler in the movie Downfall. And considering the ending of this movie is really lyrical and aspirational it's almost a shame that I really had to fight myself during other parts of the movie. It's an odd movie which definitely will strike a nerve with the viewer. The only question is will it be an enjoyable enough experience or not? I can't answer that for you but it's slow pace and a storyline that is anything but linear will confuse and appall more people than it will attract".

Cinematographer Andreas Sinanos does his usual good work and the film is radiant in its 1.851 aspect ration but the best part of the film is the scoring by Eleni Karaindrou which is unfortunately never put to the best possible use due to the visuals that Angelopoulos and editors Yannis Tsitsopoulos and Giorgos Chelidonides pair it with. Also this film has substantially more shorter takes than most of Angelopoulos's canon and far fewer longer ones. The script by Angelopoulos with some help apparently from Tonino Guerra and Petros Markaris is not up to the usual standards of these men. The DVD by Artificial Eye has no extra features and is in a Region 2 format so North American viewers will need a codeless DVD player. Languages used are English Russian German and Greek with subtitling as necessary.Overall The Dust Of Time has glimpses of what made Theo Angelopoulos one of the all time greats of cinema but not enough to make this merely solid but frustrating film great. It is not a bad film like the later films of other cinematic greats like Ingmar Bergman Saraband nor Federico Fellini Intervista but it definitely is an 'old master's film' in the worst possible and most self indulgent ways. Still for its moments and its technical skills it should be seen. More importantly though it should have been better. Much better.".

	schema:headline " One of the greatest kickass scifi action movies of all time my personal favorite number 1 action film";
	schema:reviewBody "Predator 1987 stars Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers and it is directed by John McTiernan. Predator is one of the greatest action films of all time it is my personal number 1 favorite Schwarzenegger movie in the scifi action genre. It is also my favorite action film of all time. This movie is a perfect 10 it is the finest action movie of all time! I grew up with the film it was my first Predator film I saw as a kid in the trilogy. We can say it is the best one in the franchise it is people's favorite movie in the trilogy. Major Alan Dutch Schaefer is my comic book hero this is my hero I grew up with it.I agree it is still the best one today and I love love love love this movie to death!!! It is the best of the best ever it has balls. There are so many explosives weapons and automatic weapons used in this movie and they are used well with thousands of bullets fired.In the remote jungle of a Central American country team of soldiers lead by General Jim Hopper goes missing in the jungle of Central America. So Major Dutch Schaeffer Arnold Schwarzenegger and his elite group of commandos are called in a rescue mission for cabinet minister and his scantiest men who are out in a guerrilla stronghold held by their will.. Once commando team are there they start to investigate what happened to Jim Hopper and the rest of his team. When Major Dutch Schaeffer Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team go there they realize there are some secrets going on and Jim Hopper and his men are skinned alive. Something is rotten definitely. The hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch's team.When Predator come out Arnold Schwarzenegger was at top of his game the guy couldn't miss. Every time he put an action movie people run in to the theaters to see it because he was large men and he looked like a real life superhero. The only actor who come close to him was Sylvester Stallone Rambo and he looked like 50 pounds less than Arnold Schwarzenegger. He done Commando before but Predator was really the movie that set him to super star. He carry's the movie like an leading A list actor.Really cool about Predator is it is the mixed of genre it is not just an action movie it is also an science fiction movie it is also a horror slasher movie. The first third act of the movie is where you get the action and Dutch's team go in to rescue mission there are explosions real practical effects guns blazing and you get M134 Minigun with Duke. When Dutch Billy Duke with Minigun and automatic weapons are shooting in the jungle on unseen creature you can see thousands of bullets fired in the movie real guns everything was done for real. Creature for Predator was designed by Stan Winston who was played by Kevin Peter Hall R.I.P. who is no longer with us anymore. The second third is where the horror elements kicks in it is like a slasher flick. Predator starts picking off Dutch's team one by one off. The last third it is better than anything before it is men VS alien the Predator in this movie was a horrible villain. Predator is the most iconic villains in the history ever. He is so great that you actually feel for Arnold's character you feel Arnold might not be able to stand up to this guy.Predator stars Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers Elpidia Carrillo Bill Duke Richard Chaves Jesse Ventura Sonny Landham  Shane Black R. G. Armstrong  Kevin Peter Hall  SvenOle Thorsen they are all believable. Sonny Landham also started in 48 hrs.  Southern Comfort and Lock Up also passed away and it is no longer with us anymore.I love the third act in this movie because Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't use his mussels he uses his wisdom to take down Predator he sets booby traps a long the way in the jungle and I love the part in where he figure is out how too hide him self from Predator he falls in the water and he has to wipe a mud on him to cover him self and that scene is just so nail bidding and tension it truly feels a horror movie on the end. Arnold's team every character in this movie has a persona on their own they are all extremely interesting and way different from each other. I got to hand down that too the writers Jim Thomas and John Thomas they both did an amazing job flashing out each one of these characters. It is great sense of paranoia since they all start losing their minds each one of them gets picked off. Alan Silvestri made a wonderful music score for the film which I am listening every time on YouTube.Predator come out the same year as RoboCop The Running Man A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 The Dream Warriors the 80's were the years for action movies.John McTiernan also later directed Die Hard another action movie that become famous and of the greatest action movies of all time with Predator. The movie is Rated R it is bloody and it feel at time like a slasher film. It was a box office success it made 98235548 that time of it is release.Predator is one of the greatest scifi action horror slasher films of all time it is my favorite action film off all time.".

This movie never gets boring as we watch the characters interact with each other it brings to mind the feeling I got when watching the Marines from Aliens a great feeling of comradary and gruff friendship.  The special effects while dated in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy futuristic effects we are seeing today.  The Govenator is perfect for the lead role in this film he commands a certain respect both from the characters and audience alike.The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards.  The filmakers knew how to use the Predator makeup they shadow it in as much darkness as possible cover it in mudd and grime which hides what could have been very obvious makeup guy in a suit effects.  The guy who plays Predator did everything he could to add some life to the creature to make people think he could stand up against Arnold in the end.  Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.As we watch the downfall of summer popcorn movies its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Predator is the classic action film.  What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved.  The genius of that!  The cast is wonderful Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding yet humbled and lowkey in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover he's the leader of the group and he survives at the end.  He was 'one of the crew' instead of a oneman wrecking machine like in so many of his other films that was very nice to see.  Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon as does Bill Duke as Mac Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy.  The whole cast worked very well together. The one thing that still astonishes me to this day 16 years later is indeed the Predator.  The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time the camouflage was pure genius.  I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.  I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage to the suit.  I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??! Predator is evidence of how action films should be done.  A great story and relentless action all progressing the story along. A timeless classic one of the best films of all time. out of  starsP.S.  The 'forest massacre' scene is one of the funniest scenes in movie history!!".

Predator is Epic Scifi Action movie of the 80's my number 1 personal favorite best action scifi classic film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers and the rest of his team are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator that's what makes this film and story more interesting than. This is very fast paced action flick you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action SciFi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. Is my number 1 Schwarzenegger best Action SciFi Epic movie. The best action movie ever made! Major Alan Dutch Schaefer is my comic book hero this is my hero. The hunted becomes the hunter on the end of the film when he camouflage with mud to defend him self against the Predatorultimate hunter and hunts him down by setting boobytraps for him the best! If it bleeds we can kill it. In the remote jungle of a Central American country an elite group of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer embarks on a CIA mission to clear out a guerrilla stronghold and rescue the remaining hostages. However the hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent otherworldly being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch's team. Possessing a chameleon like camouflaging ability and a deadly alien arsenal the creature tracks down the soldiers one by one.This is the finest action movie of all time. And yet believe it or not it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with an 98 million budget in 1987! with multiple huge explosions with thousands of bullets fired and scores of stuntmen used.This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers Bill Duke Jesse Ventura Richard Chaves Elipidia Carillo Shane Black Sonny Landham and Kevin Peter Hall they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall who died a year after he had made Predator 2.Predator is the 1980's most adrenalinepumping actionpacked violent mainstream film of the decade a film replete with nearly nonstop action loud messy violence huge muscles big guns and an extraterrestrial killing machine with infrared sight and a laser cannon on his shoulder thrown in for good measure. The film's budget was around 15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12 1987 where it grossed 59735548. Initial critical reaction was mixed criticism focused on the thin plot.Predator is a 1987 American sciencefiction action directed by John McTiernan.1010 My all time favorite action film I love it to death it is my personal favorite action film of all time. Predator is a masterpiece one of the best SciFi action films of al time. I own the DVD and I also own the Bluray disc. I used to had ultimate hunter edition on Bluray but the subtitles were awful and the picture was lousy and wax like plastic. I sold it to someone that need it and I bought the original early release version on Bluray instead.".

The film's budget was around 15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12 1987 where it grossed 59735548. Initial critical reaction was mixed criticism focused on the thin plot.Predator is a 1987 American sciencefiction action directed by John McTiernan.1010 My all time favorite action film I love it to death it is my personal favorite action film of all time. Predator is a masterpiece one of the best SciFi action films of al time. I own the DVD and I also own the Bluray disc. I used to had ultimate hunter edition on Bluray but the subtitles were awful and the picture was lousy and wax like plastic. I sold it to someone that need it and I bought the original early release version on Bluray instead.";

	schema:reviewBody "First of all if you haven't seen this action suspense and violence extravaganza you most certainly are not a true action movie afficionado. The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest.  Take note of Sonny Landham's commentthere's something out thereand it ain't no man.The action is fast furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one leaving Arnie Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down.  Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other.  There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning assault on the terrorist camp but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle or should I say outer space the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter continually pursued by the Predator.   All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors.  Very very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.I shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potentialvirgin viewers to find out for themselves. Predator is essentially one of the few action movies that truly lives up to its name and delivers the thrills and spills in no small amount and at breakneck speed.

	schema:headline " Arnie is at his best in this scifi classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film will always have special place for me as aside from being one of the best horrorscifi films of the eighties it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine. Despite the fact that I've seen it dozens of times as a kid I have only seen it once during adulthood and that single viewing was more than enough to remind me what it is that I love about this film! Predator works as a macho action film gory horror and intriguing scifi and despite it's short running time of just 100 minutes it somehow manages to find room for all three. The fact that it stars action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger ensures that the film will always be favourably remembered. He's not a good actor but Arnie always manages to bring that extra something to his movies. The plot is deliciously simple and follows a group of commandos that go off into the jungle on a secret mission. However things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there. Finding the skinned bodies of the last group of men that entered the jungle is about to become the least of their worries...The jungle makes for a great setting for an action scifi flick such as this. These sorts of films tend to be set in space so seeing the action down here on earth is different and the fact that it's set in the jungle with it's dense foliage ensures that Die Harddirector John McTiernan is able to bump up the suspense as just like in the Vietnam war the soldiers are dealing with an unknown enemy. The atmosphere really is excellent and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. Predator was released hot on the heels of the success of James Cameron's amazing 'Aliens'  but don't be thinking this film is merely a rip off following a trend Predator has more than enough up it's sleeve to ensure that isn't the case. The action is great and director McTiernan clearly knows what he's doing. It's fast and furious and the amount of weapons on display ensures that the film is sure to delight fans of macho action films. The fact that the lead actor is a monster of a man doesn't exactly hurt the film either! Now Arnold Schwarzenegger may well be a terrible actor but it doesn't matter because it's his screen presence not his acting ability that makes his performances what they are. At times he's cringeworthy but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences and that is all a film of this nature needs. Arnie isn't the only big man in the film either as an assortment of muscle men including exwrestler Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers Rocky's Apollo Creed among other Bmovie actors join him. The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally in the form of the movie's central alien. The Predator may not be as beautiful as the creature from 'Alien' but it's just as inventive. Here we have an extra terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed or to 'phone home'  but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport! Aside from being ingenious the idea also borders on frightening. The gore here is gratuitous but never goes over the top and on the whole Predator is a film that never really got the credit it deserves. It's mindless fun  but its damn good mindless fun!".

When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages but eventually once getting older came to like it. The Predator played by Kevin Peter Hall is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s when this movie was created. I like how humanlike its form is and how unhumanlike it is at the same time. The creature's four mandibles were a great idea for its distinct facial characteristics and the creature's roar is awesome one of the best ever produced. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers Bill Duke Jesse Ventura Richard Chaves Elipidi Carillo Shane Black and Sonny Landham and they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall who died a year after he had made Predator 2.".

	schema:reviewBody "Predator is a genuine Classic. Action Horror SciFi it's all there. Lets see for starters we have Arnold Schwarzenegger on top form riding to the peak of his action status leading a team of tough Commandos. Made up of a great cast including Carl Weathers Jesse Ventura and Bill Duke. They're on a mission to rescue Hostages from Gorilla forces but are double crossed by the C.I.A stop there and you already have a great action movie.But oh no this film also has an Intergalactic Alien Big Game hunter equipped with plasma cannons Stealth Invisibility and Thermal Vision. It would be so easy to imagine this film going nowhere if it where to have fallen into the wrong hands. You could really imagine a plot of an Alien hunting Commandos in the jungle coming off a bit lame but no Fox thankfully had faith and McTierman had a vision. Fox's faith may have been down to there two previous unexpected big hits Aliens and Commando which you could possibly say this film is a hybrid of.Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously. One minute we see a fairly realistic use of of weapons and tactics the next Arnie throws a truck down a hill equipped with C4 and Jesse Ventura pulls out his M134 Mini Gun and shreds some Gorillas.The Predator it's self is a classic design thanks to the genius Stan Winston and in my opinion never looked better than in this movie. It looked slightly fake in Pred 2Not a bad film too and don't get me started on the travesty that is AvP. It could have been a different story if they had stuck to the big rubber turtle they had shot scenes with thank god Arnold himself suggested Winston.I won't spoil the plot for anyone who's not yet seen it I just urge you to see this movie.".

	schema:headline " Really cool action with unforgettable characters";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger was solidifying his position as an action superstar with the releases of the epic Conan the influential Terminator and the somewhat mediocre Commando that was still fun to watch anyway. However that position wouldn't be fully cemented until the arrival of Terminator 2 in 1991 which forever raised the bar for the action genre. But plain and simple Predator is a staple for Schwarzenegger's profile. It introduced the ultra cool Predator to the world and changed the popular culture's perspectives on alien movies. But the movie itself isn't just known for the central character like the crappy Friday the 13th movies that are only known for the murderous Jason Voorhees and his stupid hockey mask. But Predator is known for the movie as a whole with a great simplistic plot awesome characters and great action that will make people want to see this again and again.The movie is a about a former soldiermercenary named Dutch Arnie who has been involved in a lot of conflict and has since decided to settle down and be the leader of a rescue team. He goes to a South American country to participate in a mission that would supposedly rescue a Cabinet Minister and a few other hostages but later on he finds out that he's been set up and it was actually a mission to destroy a rebel base that would've invaded sooner or later. And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle but they're then being pursued by an alien who hunts rather than kills. As the situation escalates Dutch starts to lose his sanity and that's totally evident in the final showdown with the creature.Like James Cameron's Aliens that came out the year before Predator is shaped by it's excellent characters Dutch is the great silent leader who is somewhat broken inside from all the combat that he went through in the past and his quote If it bleeds we can kill it is among the greatest. Blain is the totally cool tobaccochewing miniguntotting guy who spewed out 2 of the movie's best lines I ain't got time to bleed and This stuff'll make you a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus just like me. Mac is pretty much Blain's best bud and frequently shaves with his razor and without the shaving cream to show his manliness. Hawkins is the supernerd of the group who reads comic books and occasionally makes some sick jokes about his girlfriend. Billy is the silent nononsense spiritual dude. Dillon is the dirty CIA agent who was best pals with Dutch a few years back and then sets up Dutch and his team which leads to their demise and his as well. And finally Poncho is the sympathetic yet sarcastic soldier who connects with Anna their hostage during the course of the film. And these guys are great characters and they each have their own personalities which makes you want to see more out of each guy.And of course I can't forget about the Predator. The hightech alien that hunts other creatures for sport was a very creative and original idea. It also held a very intimidating presence and the special effects were very well done especially the camouflage. And I'm still wondering how that managed to do that in 1987.And last but not the least the action really stands out thanks to the direction of John McTiernan who directed this right before he made Die Hard. The scene when the team attacks the rebel camp is without a doubt one of the best in cinema since it shows each team member providing something in the attack and it's not just one guy who acts like a oneman army and destroys everything in his path all by himself. Also Dutch's confrontation with the predator at the end which displays more prehistoric styles of combat with the setting of the boulder and spike traps. And this movie makes up the modern warfare action and the caveman action so well.Any actionscifi junkie should watch this and they will be HOOKED. And you will want to see this again and again.".

The team is not there to rescue anyone but stop an arms deal. Someone begins picking off the team one by one and and to quote Billy Sonny Landham who provides the spiritual insight There is something out there and it ain't no man. The action begins...Alien hunters on safari CIA operatives professional black ops soldiers South American rebels and a whole lot of hot steamy jungle in the mix and you have one of the greatest scifi films ever made.The 80's style testosterone fueled acting gives great insight into the period and musclebound cast perform well and this must be Arnie's finest performance. Thankfully there isn't much of the of cheesy 80's dialog like that painfully delivered by Bill Paxton in Aliens and Predator 2.Like Ridley Scott's Alien the franchise has only gone downhill since and fans have eagerly been waiting for Robert Rodriguez and Nimrd Antal to restore the franchise to it's former glory with the release of Predators.A timeless classic and scifi masterpiece. 1010".

Once Dutch understood the trick the predator began to reproduce these mistakes. Dutch became invisible and the predator tried to blast everywhere as if he was blind by his confidence on his technology. To sum up my ideas  Nature vs Technology Unconsciousness vs Rationality Confidence vs Fear.

	schema:headline " Welcome to the jungle baby";
	schema:reviewBody "Consider that so many of the roles that Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on are so similar including Predator and yet this film is so much better than most of the others. I enjoy watching his movies just because he's such a watchable guy even in his bad movies which are many but I think the thing that really makes Predator stand out is its simplicity. The movie starts the guys get dropped in the jungle lots of blood and carnage flies across the screen and the movie simply ends. No romance no complex back story no soldier struggling with problems in his past or even trauma caused by the horrible things he experiences during the movie. This is one of the things that made First Blood so good. It may turn out to be a movie about a lot of musclebound meatheads in the woods but it doesn't insult the audience or try to apply complexity to a story that can't support it.Interestingly the movie features two eventual governors. Jesse Ventura even wrote a book which was released while he was the governor of Minnesota and he used his favorite line in this movie as the title. And the book's actually pretty interesting there are some funny stories in it about things that went on while they were filming this movie. Arnold on the other hand is actually and thankfully given a relatively small amount of stupid oneliners which are an idiotic byproduct of hard action movies that I've never really understood the necessity for. They don't reveal anything about the characters who say them they don't add to the story or further the plot and with rare exceptions they're not funny. But I guess comic relief has to come from somewhere and since complexity is not a requisite for movies like this I can't really expect a lot of thought being put into the comedic content either.I watched Predator having never seen it from beginning to end and having just rewatched the original Alien. I am currently in the process of rewatching both series' for obvious reasons. One thing that I notice about both of them is the way they take their time in introducing the enemies which in both films are aliens. Predator doesn't waste much time dwelling on the origin of the alien we pretty much assume it came from a space ship that flashed across the screen at the opening of the movie. Alien on the other hand went into remarkable detail about where its alien came from. What Predator does do very effectively I think is that it has the guys fighting some very human enemies which allows the movie to later take its sweet time in having them realize that the new enemy is not human at all. This is also incidentally weakly rehashed in the sequel using the secrecy of this mission and team as an excuse to have more guys who don't know what's going on.The death scenes are actually pretty tasteful given the genre. They are just gory enough to illustrate the violence of the enemy without being gratuitous. Just enough is shown to show how vicious the alien is and there are some strange things done to and with the bodies that make you wonder about the alien's intentions or needs. The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his or her victims. Oddly enough it is not until the awful Predator 2 that we learn that it kills for sport.Yes the movie occasionally gets embarrassingly macho but the skill with which it is put together far overshadows any toughguy goofiness. Consider for example the ease with which the movie switches from showing the guys hunting the alien to their realization that they are the ones being hunted. In some cases this transition takes place during a single shot and with virtually no movement in the shot at all except a change in someone's expression. It is truly a fight between a group of predators which we understand because they are human like us and a single predator whose powers and weaknesses are unknown. It's not Oscar material needless to say but it's a great action movie in part because it already knows that.".

Thinking this is the end they proceed to the check point where the Helicopter will take them home. But they are then hunted down one by one by an invisible enemy. Then find out this thing isn't human and is a hunter of unstoppable and futuristic tactics never seen on are planet. A Hunter from another world!My Spiel This movie is absolutely one of my favorites. From a time I watched this movie for 3 straight months for every day. Some days I watched it more then once. I had this on a terrible VHS tape. But for some reason having to rewind it and in the rewinding time span I wanted to watch it again and again. This movie is full of everything from bloodgutsbulletsknifesalienswarsoldiersdeath. All those mix to make the true Guy Movie. Granted this movie has it's flaws but come on this is one of those ultimate badass movies where none of that crap matters. There have been tons of movies to try to duplicate this movie and all fail. I can't urge people enough to just watch this for what it is. The ultimate what the hell else could go wrong for a special elite team lead by Dutch Arnold Schwarzenegger. That has already been tricked into doing a job also in 115 degree heat and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces. From the attack on the base camp that they completely demolish to the destruction of a square block of jungle with the mini gun scene. But this movie true message is the fact that Dutch is left to fight the Predator without the use of military weapons but has to make his own out of the supplies and natural surroundings around him which completely throw the Predator for a complete loop or does it!After screening this movie to many times to count I have come up with a conclusion about the end. I believe that Poncho Richard Chaves the soldier with the automatic grenade launcher Survived at the end. Well I believe he was in the lap of Anna Elpidia Carrillo in the helicopter at the end. Because you can see the hair of someone laying down but no face. And the only one with that short of hair at the time was Poncho and heck I think Anna came back for him granted he did get hit by a huge log but who the hell else could it be. Also on another note in Predator 2 they talk about only two special mission force members survived and I don't know what this means to you but Anna is no special forces member! This is truly something that has bothered me for some time. But this movie had given me days of satisfaction and a must watch for anyone who likes ScifiHorrorAction. Predator 1987 Review 1010".

So with that I give it a personal rating of 1010 it's faultless for my needs in a genre I indulge and lose myself in on a frequent roster. For any other movie fan aware of the genre's traits and peccadilloes without being a fan of sorts then I rate the film easily at 7 or 8 out of 10 what's not to like here?The film is without a shadow of a doubt another allegory of Vietnam a crack unit of soldiers are stuck in a central American jungle being killed off by an invisible enemy the soldiers are there after being lied to by the powers that be tactics are paramount but the enemy that stalks them holds all the aces. This crack special rescue team are a testosterone fuelled band of beef Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers Sonny Landham Bill Duke  Jesse Ventura these five alone have a combined muscle weight heavy enough to have sunk the Titanic and McTiernan uses the beefcakes to the max in a series of joyous ball busting sequences.The dialogue is sharp and funny with Schwarzenegger quipping his way thru the first reel and the score from Alan Silvestri pumps the blood at just the right time whilst the effects crew have done sterling work to bring this hardest man in the world versus bad ass alien predator to life none more so than when viewing POV heat seeking infared shots as our deadly alien killer. The end throws up some interesting thoughts that have for better or worse? Been fleshed out with further films involving the predator of the title but one should judge this film as a single entry because it sits at the top of the tree as one of the best of it's kind so truly this is a benchmark for the genre that will take some beating as far as I'm concerned.Enjoy 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "With the release of Alien Vs Predator i decided to watch the original Predator movie today. I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time. I think Predator 2 has a slight edge over this but Predator has a slight edge over Aliens BUT i think they are all extremely excellent films.Just in case you don't know it's about a big alien whose race lives to hunt worthy prey and Arnold Schwarzenegger's team of commandos are that such prey. The commandos are sent into a South American jungle to find some missing airmen who are being held by guerrilla's. They do what they got to do which attracts the attention of the predator who is hunting in the area. So the predator goes and hunts the commandos with the aid of his kick ass weapons and cloaking device. The commandos also have a female prisoner.I think the whole subplot about the so called missing airmen isn't too important to the viewer but makes it possible for the commandos to be there. The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time. It is kind of spooky in a terrifying way as we don't see the predator properly for ages but see through his eyes which adds to the tension.The effects are great the acting is OK and the story is cool too. I really like the music and especially the spooky twisted jungle sounds that we hear when we see through the eyes of the predator. This is a scifi action movie that isn't just full of cheap explosions. It really does have great atmosphere. Everyone who likes scifi andor action movies should like this. If you don't then your taste in movies suck! This in my humble opinion is probably the second best scifi movie of all time.Alien Vs Predator has little of what made this so excellent so if you haven't seen Predator and thought AVP sucked don't think that this will. Predator is absolutely fantastic viewing. 1010".

Since no bad guys on earth could stop him in 1987 a logical choice was made let Arnie do battle with an alien. The result is predator one of the best action movies of the 80s.From the very beginning the machismo and hard boiled dialouge comes thick and fast and things escalate getting more intense and action packed as the movie progresses. There's serious air of tension and mystery too as the script wisely keeps the predators appearance secret until the films thrilling climax.The well assembled cast consisting of real life tough guys play their bad ass roles brilliantly and Arnold schwarznegger handles his part with his unique charisma he has a screen presence strong enough to hold the movie when every other character has been killed by the predator. And speaking of which the titular predator looks awesome to this day very few computer animated creatures can hold a candle to the human hunting extra terrestrial bad ass.Preadator is awesome its a tough talking exciting action packed thrill ride from start to finish.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilersPredator is arguably the best of the '80searly '90s action bonanzas. Wellconceived psychologically taut visually vibrant and deeply entertaining it has aged remarkably well. The direction screenplay special effects and general production values of Predator are just as muscular and confident as its cast. Even when the movie slips into excess which it frequently does with gratuitous flexing absurdly overthetop firefights and unabashed macho banter it does so with such a boisterous swagger that you can't help but hop on for the ride. This is filmmaking at its most selfassured and unapologetic. Director John McTiernan has said he set out to make a classic popcorn movie and he succeeded in spades.The story is surprisingly thematically strong and believe it or not it owes that to the depth of Schwartzenegger's charactera monstermovie hero who's actually on par with the monster. Every action hero has to have his requisite humanizing momentsit's par for the course. Smiles at a kid saves a puppy blah blah blah. But Dutch's are more effective than any other instances I can think of because they are so believable and unforced. I don't do this kind of work Dutch says indignantly after he learns his team We are a rescue team not assassins. has been duped into attacking a rebel camp on the pretense of rescuing hostages. It's really a great momenta simple unexaggerated statement of ethicsas tough as Dutch and his team look they derive real pride from the fact that they are in the business primarily of saving lives rather than ending them. It's not shoved in our faces we don't have to watch Dutch cradling a tattered child's doll in the wreckage or anythingit's just there. This crucial humanizing moment makes Dutch's struggle with the Predator all the more strikinghe has to give in to that part of himself that he rejects early on in the movie the aggressor the killer the hunter the savage. He has to allow this part of himself to take over in order to survive. The ensemble cast deserves kudos too especially Bill Duke in the performance of a lifetime as the smoldering Macthe film is much deeper and richer thanks to their spirited characterizations. We ACTUALLY CARE when these guys who would be called side characters in most other action movies are picked off by the malicious demon that hunts and haunts them. Again the characterization is effective and feels genuine which lends greater meaning to the central action of the movie. As screen writing formulas go this is definitely not rocket science and most action and horror films attempt it in some form or fashion but surprisingly few do so successfully.And of course the other star of Predatorthe creature itself is masterfully conceived and designed both with and without the mask. It still stands along with yes the Alien as one of the coolest and most imaginative monsters ever put on film.This is a very important movie to people especially guys of my generationI remember rewatching it repeatedly when I was ten or eleven probably too young! totally fascinated and drawn in to the primal story of killorbekilled. I can honestly say that this appeal has not dwindled one iota. If like me you grew up on Predator I highly recommend picking up the new DVD so you can see for yourself how well it has stood the test of time. If you haven't seen it and have any respect for action films or thrillers whatsoever check it out.".

It was the case when they transmitted Predator back in 19881991 don't remember the year exactly. The image became weaker and very soon the signal was lost. It was lost completely during the helicopter scene. Deep frustration it was. Then years later it was possible to get a VHS on the local markets. But that was not enough of course. Now we have a DVD release. No extras  just the movie itself like Commando. Quite happy with that.Knock knock! and Stick around are charmingly cruel jokes delivered by youknowwho in a usual easygoing manner. All the characters in the movie are real tough. They look tough they talk tough and they can kill all right. There is no stupid love story attached. The only detail which is not very true to life is the way the Russian men are shown. If the Russian men had dusted at least one or two persons from Dutch's team  it would have been more believable as well as Dutch's death at the end. But that is a matter of personal preference In First Blood also would like to see Rambo die not because dislike him  consider it would have been more tragic and cool.The design of the title monster is quite good. The little painless is superb. The choice of the actors surpasses any expectations. The music is very to the point  in a movie like this it is just priceless it seems to be in jungle trend. All in all this movie is of the highest class and can kick the hell out of nearly any actionhorror of today's cinema. The second part doesn't get close to the original  it never had a chance. It could not have reached the heights of Predator even if the big Dutch would have been there.After numerous watching still cannot see any interfering drawbacks.It is a definite 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prior to this release Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like come on! You may not like the new one but if that's your favorite soundtrack I don't know if I want you to like my film. Neil a word. You might want to sit down for this too as Lord Summerisle says shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See Neil the thing about the original is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical.

	onyx:emotionText "Prior to this release Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like come on! You may not like the new one but if that's your favorite soundtrack I don't know if I want you to like my film. Neil a word. You might want to sit down for this too as Lord Summerisle says shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See Neil the thing about the original is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical.

	schema:headline " Five reasons to watch The Wicker Man";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wicker Man starring Nicolas Cage is by no means a good movie but I can't really say it's one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence with a hallucination etc. but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man even though it's bad 5. It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is based.4. For a cheesy horrorthriller it is really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of his or not it seems as if it's impossible for Cage to play a normal guy. There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays and personally I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man but in the most wonderful kind of way.2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest antifeminist movie ever made. See? you could write this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society! Also the similarities between this Summersisle society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.1. If you're reading this there's probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular a collection of highlights from the movie including Cage running around in a bear suit and of course the infamous AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!! line. These scenes are hilarious out of context and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety.I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out it's about a dollar per reason. It's a pretty good deal.NOTE The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch and it's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue which features a cameo from James Franco.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Wicker Man starring Nicolas Cage is by no means a good movie but I can't really say it's one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence with a hallucination etc. but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man even though it's bad 5. It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is based.4. For a cheesy horrorthriller it is really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of his or not it seems as if it's impossible for Cage to play a normal guy.

It's actually hilariously awful.First off...Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the OverEmoting Category in his acting class. Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a hero character that you have no vested interest in.I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all bes a few times too. I've enjoyed LaBute's early films and a few of his plays...but it's a strange fascination he has.I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn's performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead it seems like all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue white and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well.This movie is so wrongheaded and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.Highlights include Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a oncepromising acting career in a brawl with Cage.Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.Nicholas Cage screaming Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it? for no reason.Nicholas Cage in a bear costume I'm not kidding running through the woods taking off the costume but leaving the bear feet on and then doing some karate moves to some villains.And you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement.Needless to say if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate sendup of hysteria films...only to be reminded when Cage would screamshoutwhisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously.I think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again...just because it's so dreadful.".

Horror movies are not always scary but mostly because audiences have become desensitized to the tricks and traps of filmmakers over the years trying to give us the willies. That said The Wicker Man is one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of the year and well worth your time if only to be mocked.Officer Edward Malus Nicolas Cage finds himself in the middle of a drugaddled bender after failing to save an atypically creepy horror movie child from an exploding car. He grieves and pops pills probably because he wasn't harmed in the blast despite having his head in the car window. Then he receives a letter from his exgirlfriend Willow Kate Beahan. It seems Willow is living on a private island now and her child is missing possibly secreted away by the very people she is living with! As an audience we already know that the daughter belongs to Cage since such a thing would be far more dramatic and give him ample reason to turn Summerisle upside down. But Edward Malus does not realize this. Perhaps he is too busy being distracted by the NeoPagan Amish community that lives on the island where men are kept submissive by the powerful female Sisters that run the place. Or it could be he is preoccupied by all of the bee hives around the island since the Sisters of Summerisle deem it to be their most important crop. Are we surprised that Malus has an allergy to bees? It never really is explained how the people of Summerisle sustain themselves on just honey.Whatever the reason Malus bumbles around the island growing increasingly more and more horrified by the events transpiring around him. A feminist bitch teaching an English class about the atrocities of men? Clearly this island is the bastion of Satan himself. Ah but we find a clue here. Despite the fact that all of the residents of the island insist that there is no girl there is a single unoccupied desk in the middle of class. Cage then opens the desk only to be startled by a crow and screams What?! At that point we are thinking along the same lines.But hold on these are the best parts of the film. Up until now the plot hasn't started to collapse in on itself though we can see the stress fractures running along the edges. Malus spots a girl in the distance after popping some more pills in the middle of the night and gives chase into a nearby barn where he barely escapes death and completely fails to thrill us. Undaunted he continues to be lied to by everyone on the island including his exgirlfriend who seems to watch everything transpire like a deer in the headlights. We know she is up to no good though she could at least pretend to care.Finally we have some revelations. It seems young misplaced Rowan was born during a harvest year when the crops failed. Dear god they are going to sacrifice her to save their honey! Based on this hunch Malus then punches out an Innkeeper karate chops Leelee Sobieski into submission ducks into a bear costume and sneaks into the ceremony to save the little girl that may or may not be the subject of a sacrifice. But then we stopped taking The Wicker Man seriously a long time ago. Perhaps it would be easier to take the movie as seriously as it does if Nicolas Cage wasn't flailing around like a drunk in half of his scenes. Or maybe the movie is just bad by default.I wouldn't dream of giving the ending away but it is far less effective than that of the original movie which I decided to watch after seeing this. It almost feels as though this version of The Wicker Man was pulled together through vague recollections of the original after a long night of alcohol abuse. It's not necessarily a bad thing to try out new stuff with old material but the minute your hero comes to the rescue dressed as a bear you should know something has gone horribly awry.".

I wasn't going to comment but the film just bugs me so much and the writerdirector in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.I saw the original Wicker Man and really loved the cornucopia of music sensuality paganism in a modern world and the clash of theological beliefs. This said I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. For example I liked the original 1950's Invasion of the Body Snatchers but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is The Thing. The original as campy as it looks compared to today's standards has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell my all time favorite horror movie. So that small minority of people who like The Wicker Man remake can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a remake.This film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives wanting to make a serious thriller would green light a product that is so antifemale. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy.The metaphor of bees drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient The drone must die! especially when Cage's character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers and half of them seemed to be pregnant the other half old and fat and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. That movie was made already. The Stepford Wives anyone? Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sht together and were truly equal citizens.The problem with the manhating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused thus an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fianc and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search. I don't think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage saves ultimately brings him death.The dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed and later booed at the end. I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We don't need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen Law  Order and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery.So much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angstridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey. I'll watch that.".

So bad that when sitting down to write this review I thought to myself If I had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes I might actually go for the red hot needles.Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind Yeah that's some bad direction right there.I think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line Some Sacrifices Must Be Made. Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen. Trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime..or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment. Seriously! The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. That's not a joke nor is it fictional. I've never been to a thriller and heard so much laughter through out the entire film. I can't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly. I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films write to your congressman today don't delay. At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show upoh how I wish.Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today. To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a dck for slamming Nic's acting oh he's still a dck just lesser of oneyes Sean Penn's dck was lessened because of this film. Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks. You cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars. His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit like the fart not a joke or a functional moment during this review then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around. Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just spoiled the ending for youand if you knew any better you'd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend. I sat through this crapfest so you don't have to.About half way through this little misadventure I kept thinking to myself Jack Bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time..OK 35 minutes if Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured this out in under an hourand you Sir are no Inspector Clouseau.If for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet take the bullet.Somewhere Uwe Boll is laughing at us all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the rerelease of The Excorcist really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character Scuzzlebut the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend Keith got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness the outstanding original music the originality the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichs affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground playing Wickerman.The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop Cage is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his exgirlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north alone to help his exgirlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad remake of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '911' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so.".

	schema:reviewBody "I forgot the fact that I didn't do a review on this movie. If I hadn't seen the original a couple of days ago it would have probably stayed that way. This movie is... weird. But unlike the original which the weirdness in that adds to the film's strange qualities about it this one does weirdness in such a way that makes it enjoyable to watch just not in the way the director intended.So the plot a cop troubled with the death of a mother and child via truck that he was partly responsible for he is sent a letter by an exgirlfriend that reports her missing child on the island she lives kind of outside his jurisdiction really that may or may not be his. So when he gets there he finds that it's run by some kind of neopagan cult that's entirely made up of women and men are a minority to do work or some crap.This movie is awful. Nicholas Cage spends most of the movie just fumbling around barely doing anything. When asking someone if he's seen the lost child and they don't answer  he just changes the subject and we're supposed to believe his intentions are sincere after that. The reason why the original does this better is that the remake pads out him not having any luck in finding the child to questioning whether he cares.Although... This movie gets hilarious. Do I even need to tell you about the Not the bees! scene the How did it get burned?! or even Nicholas Cage in a bear suit punching people. And this was meant to be serious? Well there are scenes like this that thanks to Nicholas Cage mainly  just become funny.Aside from that there isn't anything else to comment on. I'd say don't see it if you're a fan of the original or anything like that see it if you're a Nicholas Cage fan. This movie showcases his allout craziness like no other movie I've seen him do. There is just so much reasoning to see it if you're a Nick Cage fan that it's well worth the watch. Everyone else... You won't enjoy this.".

	onyx:emotionText "I forgot the fact that I didn't do a review on this movie. If I hadn't seen the original a couple of days ago it would have probably stayed that way. This movie is... weird. But unlike the original which the weirdness in that adds to the film's strange qualities about it this one does weirdness in such a way that makes it enjoyable to watch just not in the way the director intended.So the plot a cop troubled with the death of a mother and child via truck that he was partly responsible for he is sent a letter by an exgirlfriend that reports her missing child on the island she lives kind of outside his jurisdiction really that may or may not be his. So when he gets there he finds that it's run by some kind of neopagan cult that's entirely made up of women and men are a minority to do work or some crap.This movie is awful. Nicholas Cage spends most of the movie just fumbling around barely doing anything. When asking someone if he's seen the lost child and they don't answer  he just changes the subject and we're supposed to believe his intentions are sincere after that. The reason why the original does this better is that the remake pads out him not having any luck in finding the child to questioning whether he cares.Although... This movie gets hilarious. Do I even need to tell you about the Not the bees! scene the How did it get burned?! or even Nicholas Cage in a bear suit punching people. And this was meant to be serious?

The aforementioned bear scene Nicholas Cage pointing his gun at an unarmed woman to apprehend her bike and telling her to step away from the bike the villagers and their cuckoo ways it all adds up to some comedy gold.But make no mistake. This is poor stuff. You gotta wonder why Nicholas Cage agreed to appear in this. Maybe he thought there was potential. It evokes the 1998 Psycho as another pointless poor remake.".

	schema:headline " Director's autobiographical portrait of her 11th year really sings";
	schema:reviewBody "It's 1977 and Stella Vlaminck begins her first year in a prestigious Parisian secondary school. Home for her is a boisterous working class caf on the edge of Paris. This is a chance. Can she make it? That's the premise of this buoyant touching autobiographical film by Sylvie Verheyde which has to be one of the best movies made from the point of view of a preteen girl. It's on a par with Julie Gavras's very fine young girl's political biography Blame It on Fidel and depicts its family with the same unwavering eye.To understand why this is such a terrific movie begin with Lra Barbara the young actress who plays Stella who's superb. Sometimes she's plain. Sometimes she's lovely. Sometimes she seems tiny. Sometimes she's big. Always she's present. And she narrates a device that's seamless and delicate guiding us often but never intruding.The essence of the story is that though Stella happens to find her one friend in Gladys Melisa Rodrigues a more middleclass girl from an intellectual Argentinian Jewish family and Gladys is the best student in her class Stella finds out she doesn't know a lot of things she needs to know. She knows about pinball and cards and pop music and TV and football and how a bar is run. European history and Greek mythology Balzac and Cocteau are a mystery to her. And at first she doesn't care and she comes home with all F's. Her father played charismatically by cool singersongwriter Benjamin Biolay is sexy and wellliked and her mom Karole Rocher runs the caf and is good looking. They're stars in the neighborhood. But she's angry and sad and is twotiming him with one of the regulars and dad drinks too much and is weak. Her older brother Loc Johan Libereau tries to help but can't. Very kind to Stella is another local Bubu Jeannick Gravelines but his motives turn out to be ugly indeed.Under Gladys' influence Stella begins to read. Marguerite Duras and Balzac become her friends. But they don't yet help her in French class where the teacher finds her spelling utterly pathetic.Life at the caf is entertaining to come home to. And there's AlainBernard Guillaume Depardieu sadly dead four months ago at 37 the kind charismatic regular Stella's got a crush on. She plays cards and is good. She plays the pinball machine with AlainBernard too. There's always something going on. It's fun but it's chaotic and it distracts Stella from studying or keeps her from going early to bed. There is TV to watch Gladys' family don't have one they're against it. Sometimes the workingclass patrons seem more childish than the bourgeois kids at the school whose teachers are imperious and demanding gatekeepers of French high culture. This is a contrast to the presentday 'banlieue' school depicted so accurately in Cantet's recent prizewinner The Class. No teacher is going to bend to Stella. Some of the teachers are abusive and throw tantrumsor throw a kid's stuff out the window.In the summer Stella's parents dump her off somewhere in the country with her grandmother her father's mother who steals from the till when she visits them in Paris. At school Stella's a hick a nothing not too smart and not too cool. In the country she's rich because from Paris. But here too she's a misfit because her only friend is a girl with a retarded brother and a nasty scary alcoholic dad Genvieve Laetitia Guerard who herself is shunned by most of the other kids in the northern French village.Verheyde shows a masterly ability to film all these milieus and make them seem like it's just happening and the camera's a fly on the wall. The cinematography by Nicolas Gaurin is light as a feather. This filmmaker creates a turbulent world yet knows how to stop and let her story breathe. There were many moments that reminded me why I love French cinema.Stella opened November 12 2008 in Paris to excellent reviews. There's not much you can say against this film though some thought the screenplay ought to have been less episodic. Shown as part of the RendezVous at Lincoln Center March 2009. No US distributor but this is highly recommended. 103 minutes.".

	schema:headline " Stella the difficulty and the beauty of growing up";
	schema:reviewBody "This French movie reminds me of an Italian movie Diari I have recently reviewed and appreciated so much for its intelligence in portraying the world of the teens. Stella set in another context and in a different historical time being it 1977 Paris and not contemporary Italy shows that same intelligence together with intensity. What I noticed and struck me in both movies is the perception that the emotional fragility and the sense of uneasiness proper of the young is always the same in any historical moment but more striking is the fact that behind that world of uneasiness does always lie a world of confused and still emotionally fragile adults who have grown old but not grown up yet adults by age but not by mind. Diari teaches that an encounter between the world of the adults and that of the adolescents is possible through care for others. In Stella does this encounter appear more difficult and painful but in the end a very moving and emotionally intense end actually the comforting idea emerges that children can forgive the mistakes of their parents in such a natural way. What both the young and the adults are looking for is just a single sign of care from others to give back mutually and when there is love between these two not so distant worlds it is always possible to find the right time and space to start everything anew. Growing up has always been a difficult and hard path but it is always worth setting out. Part of my emotional involvement was also due to the tender scenes of the first dances with a boy accompanied by the still moving song Ti amo by Umberto Tozzi which reminded me with a touch of never embarrassing nostalgia of my adolescent years. In the end I would underline Guillaume Depardieu's performance as truly moving and intense and also the actors playing Stella's parents are good and involving. I am happy that this movie after having been censored to people under 14 has been later been recognized as suitable for all people I think it's a movie that the teens could really appreciate and learn something from.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in Paris in 2008 and it was in my top two or three for the year. It tells the story of Stella a girl who is on the cusp of adolescence trying to navigate the difficult path we all must travel during this time.Stella does not have the best guidance from her parents and in reality has to figure out a lot of things on her own how to cope in school with friends with boys with adults.The movie has so many poignant scenes but for me none is as moving as the very last one. I will not give it away but the last line in my opinion sums up the writerdirector's viewpoint on this period of our lives in a simple and beautiful way. I wasn't the only one with tears in my eyes in the theater.Stella narrates the film and her voice is a powerful one. The actress who portrays her is absolutely amazing so real so unaffected. No Hollywood types in this movie. It all feels gritty and genuine. It is filmed with a sense of upclose and personal realism that is refreshing.I have not seen a version with subtitles so I can't comment on that aspect and I don't know if this movie is going to be released widely in the U.S. I have seen it playing selectively in NYC. But if you have a chance to see it run to the theater or rent it on DVD. It is one of the few films I have seen in recent years that has really stayed with me.".

They eventually arrive on the Pacific coast of Central America where the HMS Lydia has been sent to arm Don Julian Alvarado who is planning an attack against France's Spanish allies on the North American continent. The hope is that Alvarado's forces will require the French to divert some of their military resources to North American defense in the aid of their Spanish allies. He arrives to learn that a Spanish Galleon is en route and he no sooner captures it and hands it over to Alvarado that he learns the Spanish are now England's allies and he must take it from Alvarado.

F. Forester. Walsh depicts Hornblower fantastically incarnated by Gregory Peck as a modest man characterized by a sense of duty and honor. Peck is perfect for the role. Aided by stunning Technicolor scenery and marvellous score this simple epic on the high seas navigates through several battles in Spain France and South America. Walsh's staging of the battle scenes is flawless. But I was really impressed by the romantic moments by Hornblower and Virginia Mayo's Lady Barbara Wellesley. Their love scenes are wonderfully gentle and moving without being forcefully sentimental. Captain Horatio Hornblower is a great timeless classic from a master director.".

	schema:reviewBody "C. S. Forester was the Patrick O'Brian of his day. Like O'Brian he was the author of a series of novels which had as their hero a British naval commander of the Napoleonic Wars and like O'Brian he was highly popular with the reading public. Although the exploits of Forester's hero Horatio Hornblower have recently been made into a television series they have only served as the basis for one feature film.I have not read all the Hornblower novels and it is a long time since I read any of them. It is however quite clear that the film was based upon episodes cobbled together from at least two different novels. During the first half of the film Captain Hornblower is commanding a British ship off the coast of Central America where he tangles with a local ruler who has declared independence from Spain and made himself dictator. In the second half Hornblower leads a daring raid on a French naval base and is taken prisoner by the enemy but manages to escape back to Britain. The lack of any real connection between the two halves of the film means that it is not completely satisfactory in terms of structure it might have worked better as two separate films.There is one thread that links the two halves the love affair between Hornblower and Lady Barbara Wellesley the sister of the Duke of Wellington. The two fall in love after the unhappily married Hornblower rescues Lady Barbara the fiance of his superior officer Admiral Leighton during his Latin American adventure. Following their return to Britain Lady Barbara and Leighton are married but Hornblower's wife and the Admiral both conveniently die before the end leaving the lovers free to marry. Hornblower's wife does not appear in the film so there is nothing to suggest what sort of a woman she was and why he was so unhappy with her. Again I found this ending unsatisfactory for two reasons both because it was too neat and because it seemed heartless to kill off two people to provide a happy ending for two others. The scriptwriters seem to have been following the plot of the novels too slavishly it might have made for a better film if they had felt free to depart from Forester's text and make one or both of the lovers single.This was the first of two successive films in which Gregory Peck played an officer in the armed forces the other was Captain Richard Lance in Only the Valiant. The two characters however are quite different with very different styles of leadership. Whereas Lance is a strict disciplinarian Hornblower is more liberal. We do see one seaman being flogged but the order for this punishment is given by a junior officer. Hornblower reluctantly allows the flogging to go ahead on the grounds that to countermand an order given by a subordinate would undermine discipline and in the hope that the barbarity of the procedure will persuade the young man to be more humane in future. Although there were exceptions such as his excellent Ahab in Moby Dick Peck was often at his best playing rational liberal men of integrity and I found this a better performance than the one he gave in Only the Valiant. Most people will not however watch this film either as a love story or as a study in leadership but as a swashbuckling historical adventure and on this level it works well. Although they are not quite as realistic as those in a modern film such as Master and Commander the battle scenes are well done. Forester was capable of writing stirring tales of adventure and at its best this film succeeds in capturing his spirit of excitement. 610".

	schema:headline " Splendid and Stirring C.S. Forester's Hero Brought to Vivid Life";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hornblower series of sea novels written by C.S. Forester are among the most admired adventures in the English language. There are eleven in all which can be read independently or in series although they were written out of sequence. In this attractive rousing and wellacted compilation of two of the novels the screenwriter Aeneas Mackenzie has taken liberties of course. But what we have substituting U.S. accents for some upper class British types is I assert a faithful and exciting realization of the Forester vision. Having read the series more than once I suggest that Gregory Peck was almost a perfect choice for the hero's part apart from not being British. Others in the cast include Robert Beatty virile as Mr. Bush First Mate and Terence Morgan.

	onyx:emotionText "The Hornblower series of sea novels written by C.S. Forester are among the most admired adventures in the English language. There are eleven in all which can be read independently or in series although they were written out of sequence. In this attractive rousing and wellacted compilation of two of the novels the screenwriter Aeneas Mackenzie has taken liberties of course. But what we have substituting U.S. accents for some upper class British types is I assert a faithful and exciting realization of the Forester vision. Having read the series more than once I suggest that Gregory Peck was almost a perfect choice for the hero's part apart from not being British. Others in the cast include Robert Beatty virile as Mr. Bush First Mate and Terence Morgan.

	schema:reviewBody "The books of Cecil Scott Forrester were brought to my attention by my first English teacher and I am still thankful for that. The books about Hornblower are in a series of 12 volumes and they are all great. The strength of the 8 episodes TV movies with Ion Gruffith are very very well in there description of the characteristic doubtfulness of the character Horatio Hornblower. In this movie however there is not as much time as in the latter TV series... where the TV series only describe part of a book this movie is the story of 3 books in all. Keeping that in mind Gregory Peck makes quite a good Hornblower in a great story that more takes the action from the books then the doubts of the main character. But what great actions! This movie is really even after more then 50 years worth to watch. It hardly has aged.... it is an excellent movie... and I wonder why is it so hard to get? I had expected that this movie would be for sale on DVD in all regions. Pity it is only a hard to get movie on NTSC VHS tape because the movie is of such quality that it can most certainly be compared with the TV series and... of course keeping in mind it is 50 years older with Master and commander the far side of the world from that other great novelist in this topic Patrick O' Brian.".

	schema:headline " A Good Sea Yarn Two Of Them In Fact";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think the good citizens of the United Kingdom with their proud tradition of sea power could complain too much about the American leads in a film about one of their popular fictional heroes. You can't get too much more heroic than Gregory Peck on screen and he certainly does fit C.S. Forrester's conception of Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.In fact even recently with Russell Crowe's Master and Commander kind of reinvigorating this genre of literature I still kind of like what Gregory Peck did with the role. The age of Napoleon where Great Britain stood for a time very much alone against his domination of Europe was another their finest hours. The film is taken from two of the Hornblower novels and sad to say the film's weakness is that the first part of it is much the superior of the second. Personally I think they should have padded out the first part and dealt with it alone. Recurring characters from the Hornblower novels appear here such as the Duke of Wellington's fictional sister Lady Barbara Wellesley played by Virginia Mayo and members of Hornblowers crew played by Robert Beatty James Robertson Justice and Terence Morgan among others. There's also a very touching performance by young James Kenney as the midshipman on board the HMS Lydia.The first part of the film deals with Hornblower sailing the Lydia to the western coast of Central America in secret to reach a potential rebel ally against Spain which has joined with France. Hornblower makes contact with Don Julian Alvarado the selfstyled El Supremo. Hornblower captures a Spanish ship of the line and gives it to his new ally.Then he learns that Spain has switched sides in the Napoleonic War while he's been at sea and now this heavily armed vessel is in the hands of a real psycho. Now he has to undo what he did.If you don't see Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N. for any other reason than see it for Alec Mango's over the top performance as the psychotic El Supremo. It's a piece of scenery chewing for the ages and it fits with the character. You take your allies in war where you find them and Spain was not the first or the last country that ever switched sides during a conflict.The second half concerns Peck and the crew in action off the Bay of Biscay and the vessel Lydia runs aground. Peck and the crew are taken prisoner and the rest of the film concerns with their escape. These are in fact two different Hornblower stories and the first is much the superior of the second.Of course another viewer might feel differently and the film is recommended for all of you who like a good sea yarn.".

This classic film is grand in all ways and is one of the very best films of it's kind that being a naval seafaring adventure which is similar to but NOT a swashbuckler movie. Captain Gregory Peck runs a tight ship in this rollicking seafaring classic and was reportedly one of his favorite roles of his long and successful career. Gregory Peck and Virginia Mayo the two leads are the only two American actors in this movie the rest is made of an entirely British supporting cast which certainly helps since it's based on an English naval hero. Warner Brothers entrusted directorial duties to the eyepatch wearing veteran director Roul Walsh so they say he lost his right eye by an errant jackrabbit which jumped through the windshield of his car while driving! who had ample experience with expensive largescale productions. The film is a deft blend of many aspects such as great acting especially Peck terrific ship battle sequences the last one is the best of it's kind ever filmed miniature effects i.e. the model ship sequences a bit romance great scenerylocation filming and a highspirited musical score by the relatively unknown Robert Farnon.Taking place in the Napoleonicera the year 1807 to be exact. The beginning of the film captures well the air of a sickly ship that's running desperately low on provisions and to enforce the captains order aboard we get a taste of the catofninetails early on as well.

With it's opulent sets and costumes stirring ship battles and striking scenery I find this to be one of the most handsomelystaged films from the Technicolorera  there's no weak link in The Captain. And little not to like.....................";

I loved it from start to finish how can you go wrong with Gregory Peck at the helm! He was an awesome actor at 35 too! I wish they would redo the hornblower movies with modern technology.The naval battle scenes are excellent and demonstrate the correct sailing tactics near flawlessly. The outcomes are realistic for example after sailing into an enemy port and blowing up 4 enemy ships at anchor it is shown just how suicide this would have been as the fort quickly destroys them as they try to escape.The damage these old ships took when in battle is shown well the only thing not properly shown likely due to censorship rules at the time is the blood. This makes the movie enjoyable for the girlfriend though and the nice thread of a love story through the movie keeps her entertained while I watch the kewl ship battles.".

The film basically resolves itself into a series of vignettes designed to showcase the many facets of Hornblowers personality able navigator disciplined commander and clever strategist. However it takes care as well albeit less successfully to promote his human side  not merely through the alltoopredictable romantic complications involving the Virginia Mayo character but the Captains rather silly idiosyncrasy of clearing his throat whenever he finds himself at a disadvantage!CAPTAIN HORATIO HORNBLOWER therefore is an incidentpacked and generally entertaining ride  albeit longish at nearly two hours for the record Walsh and Peck would collaborate on another adventure film with the same milieu  THE WORLD IN HIS ARMS 1952  while the star had one of his most atypical and challenging roles in the best cinematic adaptation of an equally famed seafaring source Herman Melvilles MOBY DICK 1956".

It's simply more noticeable with Eliza because it's more frequent it's newer with Eliza because the other principal characters have known Higgins longer and thus take it in stride.

If that were the case I doubt Alfred Doolittle would have cause to sing Get Me To the Church On Time as he'd hardly be getting married.

	schema:reviewBody "There's a lot of negative things been said about Audrey Hepburn's interpretation of the role of Eliza. Perhaps she's not ideal in the earliest scenes of the movie  her dirtiness is never quite believable  but it has to be said that despite this smallish drawback she still glows and makes an amazing Eliza overall.The reason for this is simple Audrey Hepburn brings her own spark of divine fire to quote Higgins to the role and her vulnerability mixed with her sweet naive charm and even her wonderfully juvenile pettishness shown in Just You Wait all prove what a talented actress she really is. For an example of this just watch Eliza's facial expression at Ascot when she realises her opportunity to demonstrate her newfound mastery of the English tongue  sweetly hilarious.MFL has been criticized as being too romanticized too overblown. I disagree musicals are suposed to be lavish affairs and none pull it off quite so well as My Fair Lady does. It's a momentous film but it has its subtle points watch the way in which Eliza's eyes are centred on Higgins when she enters at the ball and the way in which the two of them stare at each other for a few seconds at the top of the stairs a few moments later.It musn't be overlooked that thanks to its being based on a Bernard Shaw play My Fair Lady has what the great majority of musicals lack a deeper meaning and something really quite profound to say.The actor in the role of Colonel Pickering is a little weak but it must be said that Rex Harrison IS Henry Higgins. In a lot of ways in fact in most ways Higgins has an objectionable personality rude snobbish impatient and even misogynistic but somehow Rex Harrison pulls it all off and makes us like Higgins without betraying the character. As to romance his song I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face is an ode to the kind of love which sneaks up on you. Overall this movie is romantic but not too sentimental. It has just enough romance to be dramatically fulfilling but it never becomes soppy or mawkish. The word love is never mentioned at all and the two leads never even kiss. The famous end sequence is perfect and does the movie justice after all a big happy bow tied around a perfect romance at the end would simply not fit with everything we have learned about the two protagonists.".

I recently special on MFL on AMC and they showed Wouldn't It Be Loverly and Show Me with Audrey's voice and though Audrey may not have the perfect melodic voice of Marni Nixon her voice was much more Eliza. I really do think they should have just used her voice. If you watch Funny Face you get a good feel for voice which I think is beautiful in a unconventional way. Then there is the question of whether Julie Andrews should have played Eliza in the film version of MFL. I've gone back and forth on this issue. Now Audrey Hepburn is my favorite actress of all time and Julie Andrews is a close runnerup so it really is hard to choose. Of course Julie's voice is much better than even Marni Nixon's... but like I said before I don't think a perfect singing voice really would suit Eliza. And as for which would play a better Eliza overall.. I really don't know. I wasn't alive to see MFL on Broadway so I really can't compare the two.

Especially in long movies the squirm element is always a threat. My Fair Lady bringing the most tuneful of Broadway scores to the big screen really big at the time was as perfect as movie entertainment could be. The old furors over Audrey Hepburn seem silly in hindsight. Hepburn replaced Julie Andrews a wonderful singeractress who had created the role not only on Broadway but in London. But Andrews was not a familiar face to moviegoers and no one knew if she'd hold an audience in the movies as in the live theaters. Too Hepburn was an inspired choice since her background probably would make Eliza Doolittle's transformation from flowerselling guttersnipe into a lady of quality more believable Hepburn's mother was a baroness. As far as her singing voice the new DVDs of MFL have her acting to her own recordings of a few of the songs and while it's not bad at this level of filmmaking expense and prestige not bad is no good.Surrounding her are a magnificent cast. Stage and screen pros Rex Harrison Henry Higgins and Stanley Holloway Doolittle were carried over from Broadway after some initial and rather foolish questions about both. Joining them were veteran droll actor Wilfred HydeWhite as Col. Pickering and an amazingly youthful Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes as Freddy.The book and lyrics were by Alan Jay Lerner and the music by Frederick Loewe Brigadoon Camelot Gigi etc. based on George B. Shaw's best play. A fully integrated musical where the songs advance the story or reveal character the nonpareil lineup of songs include I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face The Rain in Spain I Could Have Danced All Night and On the Street Where You Live.Because of its theatrical origins there is an unavoidable stagebound look to some scenes. But the designers have done their best to keep this from being a detriment. The interiors look like real houses the Covent Garden set is a masterpiece of openness. Only the Ascot scene retains its staginess but its black and white palate and stylized look adds variety to the movie.The restored DVD version looks great. I saw a print of this movie in a revival theater in the early 1980s it was blurry and broken and the colors were faded and inaccurate. Yet the designers used a rich tapestry of colors and wood tones giving every corner of the movie's wide screen something worth seeing. MFL was a spectacle well worth the struggle and expense of restoration. Everything about MFL was firstclass the cast script costuming sets music. For someone who enjoys musical there's not a dull moment.".

The story begins as Henry Higgins Rex Harrison makes a bet  that he can transform flower girl Eliza Dolittle Audrey Hepburn into a high society lady.  Henry Higgins is the perfect example of high society snobbery of the times.  What he wasn't counting on was falling in love with his project. Some people may find this film to be sexist but it is really quite the opposite.  While it is about a sexist person it is not actually sexist at all.  In fact it is all about the irony in the relationship between that of Eliza Dolittle and Henry Higgins.  It is not unbelievable that Henry and Eliza should fall in love because they are not compatible. Opposites often attract after all.  Even though there is an antiromantic disclaimer in the original play Pygmalion  it is obvious that Eliza and Higgins are meant for one another in the end of My Fair Lady.  My Fair Lady is really different from Pygmalion.  There is a movie version of Pygmalion which is the dull nonmusical version of My Fair Lady.  Rex Harrison is simply wonderful as Henry Higgins.  He is not one bit tired with his role.  And even though Julie Andrews originated the role of Eliza on Broadway Audrey Hepburn is great in the role.  It would be unfair to say that she didn't deserve the role just because her voice was dubbed.  The supporting cast is first rate as well.  This film is more than just good it is great.

	schema:headline " Wonderful but I missed Julie Andrews";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought the music was wonderful. I thought Audrey Hepburn was just adorable and so full of energy and grace and just fascinating to watch. Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character. My problem a minor one is with the ending and with the dubbing.The story is brilliant of course taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy. The contrast of the unschooled street urchin Liza Doolittle and the stuffy selfpossessed confirmed bachelor a kind of nineteenth century British man of science wonderfully accomplished in his profession but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people made for a most interesting match. And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl. The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.But there are some problems. Freddy is needed of course as another objectifying character to make it clear just how desirable Eliza really is and how foolish and blind Professor Higgins is in not seeing thisin theory of course because in practice with Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews as Eliza this would seem entirely unnecessary. And indeed without Freddy we do not have the beautiful On the Street Where You Live. But even with him Prof. Higgins does not see and indeed even at the resolution of the story he still does not see as he asks for his slippers. If this were presented to current London and Broadway audiences it would never play the way it was written. Professor Higgins would need to see the light and he would have to get his own slippers!The dubbing and the need for it is curious. There is no doubt that Marni Nixon who did the singing has a beautiful and commanding voice and we are the better for having heard her but why is the dubbing so obvious? It's almost as if Miss Hepburn is saying to the audience they said it would be better if Miss Nixon sings instead of me because her voice is stronger and so very well trained. And so Hepburn does not completely lipsync some of the opening words of songs as though to remind us that she is not singing. And the contrast between her delicate voice and then the sudden power of Marni Nixon's is obvious. Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage. Still as another reviewer has so acutely noted if she had been asked we would have missed her in Mary Poppins which was made the same year. I should also note that Hepburn was 33 or 34 years old when this was made although she looked almost ten years younger. Nonetheless she was playing the part of a good girl I am whom Pickering identifies in his call to Scotland Yard as being 21 years old.Curious.

	onyx:emotionText "I thought the music was wonderful. I thought Audrey Hepburn was just adorable and so full of energy and grace and just fascinating to watch. Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character. My problem a minor one is with the ending and with the dubbing.The story is brilliant of course taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy. The contrast of the unschooled street urchin Liza Doolittle and the stuffy selfpossessed confirmed bachelor a kind of nineteenth century British man of science wonderfully accomplished in his profession but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people made for a most interesting match. And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl. The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.But there are some problems. Freddy is needed of course as another objectifying character to make it clear just how desirable Eliza really is and how foolish and blind Professor Higgins is in not seeing thisin theory of course because in practice with Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews as Eliza this would seem entirely unnecessary. And indeed without Freddy we do not have the beautiful On the Street Where You Live. But even with him Prof. Higgins does not see and indeed even at the resolution of the story he still does not see as he asks for his slippers. If this were presented to current London and Broadway audiences it would never play the way it was written. Professor Higgins would need to see the light and he would have to get his own slippers!The dubbing and the need for it is curious. There is no doubt that Marni Nixon who did the singing has a beautiful and commanding voice and we are the better for having heard her but why is the dubbing so obvious? It's almost as if Miss Hepburn is saying to the audience they said it would be better if Miss Nixon sings instead of me because her voice is stronger and so very well trained. And so Hepburn does not completely lipsync some of the opening words of songs as though to remind us that she is not singing. And the contrast between her delicate voice and then the sudden power of Marni Nixon's is obvious. Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage. Still as another reviewer has so acutely noted if she had been asked we would have missed her in Mary Poppins which was made the same year. I should also note that Hepburn was 33 or 34 years old when this was made although she looked almost ten years younger. Nonetheless she was playing the part of a good girl I am whom Pickering identifies in his call to Scotland Yard as being 21 years old.Curious. But all is forgiven because Audrey Hepburn is just so beautiful so elegant and so delightful in the part. I especially loved her in the opening scene in her soiled clothes and hat and her sour voice. By the way I have heard Julie Andrews sing the part although I never saw her on the stage and the way she meow's Eliza's accent like a cat's claw on a chalk board is really amazing.

Lerner and Loewe its creators probably never thought they had the tremendous hit it became at all. The film version of My Fair Lady came to the screen via George Cukor a man who knew about the movie business well.The film resonated with audiences because of the immensely elegant finished product Mr. Cukor offered the world. Of course the film is helped by the genius of Cecil Beaton who had the eye for the right style. Mr. Beaton served as art director and had a thing to say about the fabulous costumes assembled for the movie. The Ascot race sequence is a tribute to his sense of elegance.Rex Harrison repeating the role of Professor Higgins that he originated on Broadway gives a stellar performance. Not having seen him on stage at least one can imagine how he amazed audiences that flocked to see the show. In the film he makes an absolutely delightful Higgins a man of science who can't see what's in front of him. The transformation he achieves in turning the Cockney flower girl into a lady of elegance is perhaps something he didn't even think he would be able to pull. In Mr. Harrison's performance one can see how Eliza warms this confirmed bachelor into accepting her in a romantic way.Audrey Hepburn was chosen over Julie Andrews the original Eliza on Broadway in a move that puzzled everyone in the theatrical world. How could Eliza be played by anyone else let alone that someone else would be that charming actress Audrey Hepburn? Ms. Hepburn's Eliza is a delicious characterization her take on the poor flower girl starts slowly taking us with her all the way. We fall in love with Eliza the character as played brilliantly by Ms. Hepburn who knew how to charm us with her beauty and easy elegance in everything she did.The English cast was wonderful. Stanley Holloway a veteran of the English cinema played Alfred P. Doolitlle Eliza's father. Mr. Holloway is charming every time one sees him. Gladys Cooper one of the first ladies of the English stage is seen as Mrs. Higgins a grande dame of society who is charmed by Eliza and knows her son will end up loving the girl of his experiment. Wilfred HydeWhite another distinguished actor plays Col. Pickering Higgins' ally and friend. Jeremy Brett plays the playboy Freddy the man that loves the street where Eliza lives!Of course what makes My Fair Lady special is the great musical score by Mr. Loewe with lyrics by Mr. Lerner. Most of the songs are by now standards that have delighted us since they were written and have been sung by practically all the best singers of the world.Mr. Cukor deserves credit for directing this film with his usual flair as he feasts our eyes with a stunning film that will always be loved by whoever watches it.".

	schema:headline " MY FAIR LADY lives because of Audrey Hepburn";
	schema:reviewBody "Marni Nixon's singing in both THE KING AND I and WEST SIDE STORY sounded purer to me than did her work in MY FAIR LADY I thought this was fine but somewhat thinner and less rich the voice may well have thinned a little by then. It's lovely to hear Hepburn in Just You Wait as it comes as something of a surprise if you had thought all of her singing was dubbed as I once had. The dubbing and acting do seem to come to a perfect luminous moment at least once at the end of I Could Have Danced All Night it seems as if Audrey Hepburn is really singing it and gives the impression that possibly no one else ever had. It is possible that the best result might have been to let some of the other simpler songs like Wouldn't It Be Loverly be done by Hepburn and leave those obviously requiring a more technically accomplished singer to Nixon. It is interesting that Hepburn's Moon River is not included on the old soundtrack of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. Similarly I went to her memorial service at the 5th Avenue Presbyterian Church here in New York in 1993 and uncannily the entire program was listed EXCEPT that... all of a sudden they played her Moon River and the whole church became very emotionally charged. I think we were grateful that this let us experience our grief directly by forcing something immediate but not cruel on us like that.I have always been glad anyway that Hepburn did the part and it is certainly the only real reason the film still has lifethe controversy about her getting the part may have as much to do with that life as anything  it would be a mere artifact a duplicate of the stage production had Julie Andrews been chosen. Andrews still seems primarily a stage star despite all the movies she made. Most of them are mediocrea few of them quite good even if I haven't found them interesting myself she is perfect in THE SOUND OF MUSIC but the phenomenal appeal of this film is based on something considerably less sharp than what made the earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein masterpieces great even when they weren't quite as lavishly produced. Clearly for example the score of SOUTH PACIFIC is lightyears beyond that of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Admittedly Andrews's singing of the score is better than Mary Martin's was. And the voice you can still hear on the Broadway and London cast recordings of MY FAIR LADY is far more complex and rare than Nixon's is. Still she wouldn't have made the film unique while it may or may not be a great film it has managed to retain a oneofakind quality and is kept from being a mere facsimile. It is certainly true that Ms. Nixon should have been credited for her  work whatever our other reservations are. I nevertheless think that some of the lighter opera voices of the timemaybe Anna Moffo or Mirella Freniwould have been better I don't think Ms. Nixon was too fine but rather not quite as good here as she once had been. Dubbing doesn't have to match all that perfectly of course certain exampleslike Giorgio Tozzi for Rossano Brazzi as Emile de Becque do seem perfect. And if the case of MEETING VENUS is somewhat different no one ever would dream of worrying about Kiri TeKanawa's voice not matching Glenn Close Ms.Close unfortunately let us hear her real one doing Wagner on Entertainment Tonight when plugging the filma harsh and strident moment...This is one of quite a number of cases in which the original star was controversially replaced. The strangest may be the rejection of Ethel Merman for GYPSY although Rosalind Russell was excellent. The smartest may have been Barbra Streisand for Carol Channing for HELLO DOLLY! She was highvoltage enough for the gargantuan production and her trumpetlike singing was magnificenta number of us think this is her best filmand it ages fantastically. And while it is not a matter of replacing a role originated by someone else Hepburn herself was loudly denounced for BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S by Truman Capote we think of the role as her indelible mark and surely it is in some ways but his preference for Marilyn Monroe could have unquestionably led to something extraordinary alsoand maybe that idiotic ending that is so hard to overlook would have been replaced by the much more subtle and meaningful one Capote wrote.It really is Audrey Hepburn who makes MY FAIR LADY continue to do its work. And in it we may have well seen the most gloriously ripe moment of her incredible beauty.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have the DVD of My Fair Lady and watch it all the time. Its one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get sick of.The beautiful and graceful Audrey Hepburn is perfect as Eliza Doolittle and although there was controversy over the role she was the best choice even if her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon. Professor Henry Higgins is portrayed wonderfully by Rex Harrison he is the only person I can ever really see in the role. The other characters were well cast too.Lerner and Loewe created beautiful music for a beautiful movie. Rex Harrison perfected talksinging to music and his songs are clever and well written. There are lots of great songs such as 'I could have danced all night' 'a little bit of luck' 'wouldn't it be loverly' 'show me' 'on the street where you live' and 'without you'.It is a long movie and the plot slows down after the ball. And although I am not totally happy about the ending because it is left very open I cannot think of another way to end the film that would be better.My Fair Lady is a terrific movie.

Its one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get sick of.The beautiful and graceful Audrey Hepburn is perfect as Eliza Doolittle and although there was controversy over the role she was the best choice even if her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon. Professor Henry Higgins is portrayed wonderfully by Rex Harrison he is the only person I can ever really see in the role. The other characters were well cast too.Lerner and Loewe created beautiful music for a beautiful movie. Rex Harrison perfected talksinging to music and his songs are clever and well written.

The entire production is so slowly paced and unexciting that you feel that director George Cukor who won an undeserved Oscar embalmed the show. Horribly studiobound there is nothing that distinguishes this as a film. It is void of everything that made the show an exciting stage experience. Many of the sets look like sets and the makeup hairstyles and many of the costumes on the women is very 1960's and silly looking for 1912. Eliza Doolittle is the heart and soul of this musical but Audrey Hepburn's performance of her is so false that the very life of the show is gone. She's all wideeyes and and inappropriate smiles watch the LOVERLY number with carefully placed smudges. She growls and clenches her fists when she's supposed to but it just ends up being Audrey Hepburn play acting at being Eliza. She never ever makes you think she IS Eliza. Also her accent is wrong. She would never have fooled anyone with her European sounding English accent. The dubbing of Miss Hepburn done after the film was made is almost as bad as watching a Godzilla movie. It always looks out of sync and never sounds right. When one remembers Broadway's original Eliza Julie Andrews who should have been in this film it makes Hepburn's casting even harder to take. Rex Harrison and the supporting cast are first rate but it is Eliza who must be perfect and she isn't. Hepburn's miscasting Cukor's plodding direction and the failure to recognize that they were making a film make this a disappointment of the highest degree. NOT recommended!".

Adapted by Lerner and Lowe from nonmusical Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw it is filled with clever witty dialogue. Lavish sets a superb cast and wonderful songs make this film a masterpiece. Even sceptics of musicals those who say they can't stand them because nobody bursts into song will enjoy it.You can get the plot from the myriad of other reviews so let me comment on what makes this musical such a treat for the mind as well as the eye and ear.The intelligence comes from the satire of the British class society the hilarious comments on morality from Doolittle and the comments about the roles of the sexes in the songs of Henry Higgins. People men especially will roar at his comments about women. Sure they're stereotypes incorrect generalizations. But do men think that way? Well what do you think of his claim that She will beg you for advice your reply will be concise she will listen very nicely and go out and do precisely what she wants!Rex Harrison's Higgins is such an interesting character. Certainly he's insulting and insensitive. But what makes him fascinating is that he knows he is like that. The moment I make friends with a woman I become selfish and tyrannical he says. Does he treat Eliza poorly? Certainly but no more poorly than he treats anybody else which is therefore giving her equality with everyone else despite her lower class origins.A wonderful poignant scene occurs as Eliza returns as a lady to the streets before dawn where the working class is setting up for the days market. In her earlier life she would have been there buying the flowers to sell to the upper classes. Now as the people hum and whistle a song we heard her sing at the movie's start she finds she can no longer fit in. This is no place for a lady ma'am a bloke says to her gently. So what has her education got her?The stage version of My Fair Lady held the record for most performances for a decade. The LP became the highest selling LP ever of all genres not just cast recordings.Please watch My Fair Lady especially the restored DVD version. It's a true classic. You will see the character that Rex Harrison was born to play and the character that Audrey Hepburn became. Upon her death Time Magazine remembered her with the photograph of her from My Fair Lady. Note No review is complete without pointing out that true musical fans know that Julie Andrews who played the role on Broadway SHOULD have had the film version. Jack Warner wanted a bigger name. So Andrews became Mary Poppins and accepted an Oscar for best actress with a thank you to Jack Warner for making it possible!".

	schema:headline " Perhaps My Favourite Musical of the Sixties";
	schema:reviewBody "Shaw's Pygmalion was written in support of its author's controversial thesis that class divisions in British society could be overcome by encouraging the use of Received Pronunciation supported by reformed spelling in a phonetic alphabetin place of regional and class accents. The story concerns a professor of phonology who accepts a bet that he can teach a Cockney flowerseller to speak like a duchess. This makes it a curious basis for a Broadway musical given that most Americans have little interest in the linguistic aspects of the British class system and little ability to distinguish British accents. It is therefore hardly surprising that Audrey Hepburn does not sound much like a native of Lisson Grove a predominantly workingclass district of NorthWestLondon with an accent slightly different to the betterknown East End Cockney. She was clearly under instructions to exaggerate her accent to such an extent that even an American audience could not fail to appreciate the contrast with the accents of the posh characters.Despite its unlikely subjectmatterMy Fair Lady was a great success both as a stage musical and as a film. There are a number of reasons for this. Shaw was able to create witty dialogue and interesting characters even when he was writing a didactic piece which most of his plays are. The songs are unfailingly tuneful. In my opinion however the main reason for the success of the film version is due to one factor the casting of Audrey Hepburn. Although Hepburn held British citizenship she was on her mother's side a member of the Dutch aristocracy and had spent much of her youth abroad so she might not have seemed the most likely choice as a London flowergirl. She was also in her mid thirties considerably older than the character she plays. At the time many felt that the role should have gone to Julie Andrews who had played the part in the stage version. Hepburn was however the most beautiful elegant and charismatic actress of her generation with an uncanny ability to make a film by her presence alone. Try imagining Breakfast at Tiffany's or Roman Holiday with any other actress in the lead. Or Sabrina.Actually someone obviously did try imagining Sabrina with another actresswhich is why we ended up with that embarrassing Julia Ormond remake.My Fair Lady is another example of Audrey's gift at work. Although to British ears she might not seem entirely convincing as a Cockney in the earlier scenes she dominates the latter part of the film when Eliza has been transformed into a gracious society lady.I have never heard the versions of the songs that Audrey recorded herself so I cannot say whether the decision to have her singing dubbed was the right one. Certainly Marni Nixon does a fine job although on the evidence of Funny Face and Breakfast at Tiffanys Hepburn had a better voice than popular belief has given her credit for. Of the other characters I particularly liked Stanley Holloway8217s comic turn as Alfred Dolittle Elizas old reprobate of a father. In an inversion of the normal generation gap the teetotal virginal Eliza is far more puritanical than her father. Rex Harrison makes an amusing Professor Higgins even though he was obviously no singer and was rather older than I had imagined Shaws character.When I first saw the film I disliked the decision to change Shaw8217s ending which I saw as a surrender to Hollywood sentimentality. Having seen it again I am inclined to change my mind. A romance of sorts between Eliza and Higgins is by no means inconceivable. Higgins may be a sexist and a snob but he is certainly not gay as some have speculated. Why Cant a Woman be More Like a Man is quite a common sentiment among male heterosexuals. Higgins reminded me of those representatives of modern British lad culture who choose potential wives and girlfriends on the basis of male rather than female attributes. A woman is valued less for her personality or sex appeal than for her interest in such matters as alcohol and sport. It is the same with Higgins except that he will expect Eliza to be able to discuss not lager and the offside rule but labiodental fricatives and the First Great Sound Shift. Eliza might be a beauty but far more important to Higgins is the fact that she is the first woman he has ever met who shares his interest in linguistics. If Eliza can adapt to Higgins expectations there is no indication that he will ever adapt to hers there is no reason why their union should not be a happy one.This is also a very attractive film visually especially the two famous showpiece scenes at Royal Ascot and the Embassy Ball. The former is particularly striking with the black and white costumes creating a remarkable stylised look. Cecil Beaton well deserved his Oscar seldom can costume design have contributed so much to the success of a film. On the subject of Oscars the great scandal of course is that Audrey was not even nominated perhaps the Academy felt embarrassed by the number of leading ladies in musicals who did not do their own singing. I felt that Harrison was a rather fortunate winner against some very strong opposition but the Best Picture award was well deserved. This is perhaps my favourite musical of the sixties. 910".

A woman is valued less for her personality or sex appeal than for her interest in such matters as alcohol and sport. It is the same with Higgins except that he will expect Eliza to be able to discuss not lager and the offside rule but labiodental fricatives and the First Great Sound Shift. Eliza might be a beauty but far more important to Higgins is the fact that she is the first woman he has ever met who shares his interest in linguistics. If Eliza can adapt to Higgins expectations there is no indication that he will ever adapt to hers there is no reason why their union should not be a happy one.This is also a very attractive film visually especially the two famous showpiece scenes at Royal Ascot and the Embassy Ball. The former is particularly striking with the black and white costumes creating a remarkable stylised look. Cecil Beaton well deserved his Oscar seldom can costume design have contributed so much to the success of a film. On the subject of Oscars the great scandal of course is that Audrey was not even nominated perhaps the Academy felt embarrassed by the number of leading ladies in musicals who did not do their own singing. I felt that Harrison was a rather fortunate winner against some very strong opposition but the Best Picture award was well deserved. This is perhaps my favourite musical of the sixties. 910";

Particularly since Julie in an obvious sympathy vote got the Academy Award that year for Mary Poppins and Audrey wasn't even nominated. Yes Audrey was dubbed and Marni Nixon the dubber on the DVD speaks at great lengths about how it was done. Also included on the DVD are Audrey's actual vocals of Loverly and Show Me. While she wasn't bad in the first the second was somewhat beyond her vocal ability.In fact it seems that Audrey might have originated the role on Broadway were it not for a false rumor that she was pregnant at the time. Incidentally John Gielgud remarked in one of his letters that he thought Audrey was better than Julie!I thought the film was excellent dubbing or not and the casting was also excellent. I had two small reservations about the film The first was the fantasy scene where AudreyMarni sang Just you wite 'enry 'iggins which Cukor hated and with good reason. It should have been done without the oil on the lens and probably without the enactment. The other was the race at Ascot where the horses were shown briefly twice and perhaps the turning binoculars would have been sufficient and funnier as on the stage.But I suppose they didn't want to appear cheap.The ending was I think pretty close to the film of Pygmalion and the musical was based on the film and not the play in which I think Eliza marries Freddie. I do think there's a certain amount of ambiguity in this ending and I don't think Shaw's estate would have allowed much else. G.B.S. himself would not have accepted Eliza marrying Henry and he said as much.According to the DVD Cecil Beaton who did actually design the stage sets did virtually nothing on the movie except take the credit and a terrific still of Audrey in costume according to the commentary. In effect the DVD plays the film over while 4 people Gene Allen the art director of the original film and Cukor's assistant the restorers Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz and the aforementioned Miss Nixon. comment on each scene and I think that's overkill but one doesn't have to watch it.

	schema:reviewBody "Although my personal favorite among Errol Flynn's films is The Sea Hawk most will argue that his career role was this one in The Adventures of Robin Hood. It certainly has a deserved enduring popularity that's lasted for generations.Just about every version of the Robin Hood legend from Douglas Fairbanks's silent classic to the one in 1997 with Kevin Costner deals with the same story facts. A young nobleman deprived of his lands and title by Prince John and his cohorts takes to Sherwood Forest and gathers a band which practices their own form of financial leveling. Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor until the day comes when good King Richard the Lionhearted comes back from the Crusades and sets things right.Were there ever a more attractive and idealistic a pair of young lovers on the screen than Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland? If there were I'd be hard pressed to name them. They did eight films together from 1935 to 1941 and this one is probably the best. Errol all dash and charm and shy and retiring Olivia who just lights up the screen with beauty and romance.Directors Michael Curtiz and William Keighley photographed this in some gorgeous technicolor. And they put together an almost perfect cast. You can't tell at all which scenes were directed by Curtiz and which by Keighley so seamless is the film's fabric.The small roles are truly memorable. The best comic moments in the film come from Melville Cooper the not quite so bold Sheriff of Nottingham and from Herbert Mundin and Una O'Connor as Much the Miller's Son from Robin Hood's band and DeHavilland's maid. Herbert Mundin was the first one in this cast to die he was killed in an automobile accident just two years after this film was finished. He was a funny little man who played nervous types a kind of English Don Knotts. But in what was probably his career role he literally decides the fate of English history here in a superb act of bravery. We expect bravery and courage from the Errol Flynns on the screen but Mundin's performance shows the virtue can be found in some of us you wouldn't expect. His is my favorite performance apart from the leads.Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains make a superb pair of villains as Prince John and Guy of Gisborne. Rains covets the throne and Rathbone covets Olivia. They both provide the right touch of menace and make their performances real.As I write this Olivia DeHavilland is the last surviving member of this classic film. During her career she fought hard with her studio to get roles where she would be more than the crinoline heroine waiting for her man to finish his brave deeds. She knew her worth and talent and got a pair of Oscars to prove it.Back in the day DeHavilland dismissed films like The Adventures of Robin Hood. But several years back she attended a revival of both The Adventures of Robin Hood and Dodge City two very different type films she did with Errol Flynn.As she watched it she saw the reverence and respect the audience had for both of these classics. When they were over she got a stunning ovation and she confessed that looking back now she was real proud to have been associated with these films.You have every reason to be proud Olivia. And we're real proud of you.".

	schema:reviewBody "What an amazing experience to see The Adventures Of Robin Hood 80 years after its original release. How can one explain the longevity of its relevance. Relevant in every department. Acting to start with. Errol Flynn was not considered a great actor never an Oscar nomination or anything like that. Bette Davis was always frustrated for having to work opposite him rather that Laurence Olivier. But look at him now 80 years later  Erroll Flynn' s performance is as fresh today as the day he filmed it. Compare that with Oscar winner Russell Crowe's Robin Hood 2010  Russell Crowe even had the impertinence of mocking Erroll Flynn's version. This bit of tribia kuind of depressed me after the high of seeing again this Michael Curtiz's masterpiece. Here everything works.

	onyx:emotionText "What an amazing experience to see The Adventures Of Robin Hood 80 years after its original release. How can one explain the longevity of its relevance. Relevant in every department. Acting to start with. Errol Flynn was not considered a great actor never an Oscar nomination or anything like that. Bette Davis was always frustrated for having to work opposite him rather that Laurence Olivier. But look at him now 80 years later  Erroll Flynn' s performance is as fresh today as the day he filmed it. Compare that with Oscar winner Russell Crowe's Robin Hood 2010  Russell Crowe even had the impertinence of mocking Erroll Flynn's version. This bit of tribia kuind of depressed me after the high of seeing again this Michael Curtiz's masterpiece. Here everything works. Other than Erroll Flynn  even if when's he is on the screen is difficult to pay attention to anyone else  we do. Mostly because Claude Rains Olivia de Havilland Basil Rathbone and the rest of the sensational cast. This adventure film will continue to captivate audiences for years decades centuries to come.";

	schema:headline " In like Flynn  the ultimate Sherwood classic";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is the Robin Hood of the screen it's merry and witty tender and bold impudent dashing and brightly clad... and an undoubted legend in its own lifetime! I recently had the chance to see it in the cinema for the first time with the release of the remastered print and wondered if it could possibly hold up to televised childhood memories. The joyous answer is that indeed it does. It's not only the breathtaking adventure I remembered it's a fiery and surprisingly gentle romance that isn't afraid of laughs.It's unthinkable once you've seen it to imagine this film with anyone other than Errol Flynn. Every subsequent interpreter has had to struggle to reclaim the part from the memory of his roguery and grace  and most modern 'Robin's have been handicapped by an insistence on authentic mediaeval murk and grime. In the 1930s with Technicolour the latest craze mud and homespun were the last thing a studio wanted. Flynn's Robin Hood sports the Lincoln green of legend and a forest as brightly coloured as a painted backdrop and the rich furs and silks on show at Nottingham Castle are straight out of fairytale or an illuminated manuscript.The story itself is purest escapist magic. Greedy barons a wicked usurper a rightful king in exile and a proud beauty in distress... and of course England's eponymous outlaw hero robbing the rich to give to the poor with a jest on his lips in true swashbuckler style. The script sparkles. And the stunts in those days before wirefu or CGI are all for real and still take the breath away. Flynn was in superb physical condition at the time  costar Basil Rathbone who played his proud opponent and wouldbe suitor to Marian's hand Guy of Gisbourne described him simply as 'a perfect male animal'  and misses no opportunity to show off his flamboyance.Unlike today's prettyboy heroes however Flynn shows a surprising talent for acting with his face alone. The expressive reaction shots throughout his boudoir scene with Marian tell a different tale to the quickfire banter of his words and like Marian despite ourselves we are drawn in. Olivia de Havilland as Marian is somewhat illserved by her period costume  she is at her most beautiful in this scene without her hair confined in her wimple  but together they duel their way through a classic tempestuous romance of the highborn lady and the outlaw ultimately risking their lives to save each other. Marian is no anachronistic action heroine but noone not even Robin can keep her from what she thinks is right.As Guy of Gisbourne Basil Rathbone is also playing one of the landmark roles of his career and gives a superb performance. His Gisbourne is no cardboard villain but a clever arrogant man who matches wits and blades with Robin as a worthy rival and whose courtship of Marian is not without grace. And his wily master rufous Plantagenet Prince John Claude Rains in a small but wellcast part is no fool either. He knows precisely what he wants and what he can get away with wasting no time in bluster or empty threats.Comedy of a broader nature is provided by the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham and by Bess Marian's maid. But even Bess's farcical courtship with timid Much she has buried more husbands than he has had kisses is not without its tender moments and perhaps only the Sheriff is entirely a cutout figure of fun.Few people can whistle 'the theme from Robin Hood'. But the famous Korngold score with its full orchestral depth and rousing fanfares is as familiar today as it was seventy years ago when it won its Academy Award. From the faultless casting through unforgettable pageantry and timeless romance to the final spectacular duel when Robin and Gisbourne meet once too often this picture richly deserves its reputation as the Robin Hood on film  from which on present showing it is unlikely ever to be dethroned.".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one start a commentary on such a perfect specimen of film making? Is this exaggeration. I think not.Every aspect and element of the movie is absolutely top of the line in the cinematic Arts  Sciences. Once again where to start? Casting is so important. Who could find a better line up of Actors than this. Starting with Errol Flynn. Never was there a better screen Robin Hood not Douglas Fairbanks not Richard Green not even Kevin Costner. Mr. Flynn was sure a handful for the studio in real life and a lot of this surely rubbed of on his screen persona. Added to a great Athletic ability probably a natural athlete. Next we have delicately beautiful Olivia de Havilland who brings not only her feminine pulchritude to the movie but also an innate sense of class and intelligence too. Her Lady Marion was much more than a helpless female. Was she a damsel in distress? Oh most surely she was that but not a screaming whiny helpless girl.Basil Rathbone Sir Guy of Gisbourne was perhaps the best villain in the business. Next to his characterization of Sherlock Holmes in all those films and some Radio  TV work as well as well as being a top fencer. Ironic it is that this master swordsman lost so many screen duels with the likes of Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power THE MARK OF ZORRO.Claude Rains as Prince John gave th story a somewhat foppish prim and prissy version of a Bad Monarch which this future King John surely was. His type of person could never do some of the assignations and executions that he ordered but saw no difficulty or remorse in ordering underlings to do so.The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British Actors in Hollywood or a role call of regular Warner Brothers players. Just consider the following Melville Cooper Sheriff of Nottingham Una O'Conner  Alan Hale Little John Eugene Palette Friar Tuck Patric Knowles Will Scarlet and so on and so forth en ad infinitum! To these talents add the great sets and the forest of the Pacific Northwest. They had such great Castles Towns and Tournament Fields. And how could simple B  W film do any justice to the beautifully tailored multi hued costuming. This is Technicolor Work at its very best! Please let's not go any further without remembering our sense of hearing or namely the musical score. The theme Overture and the incidental music by Erich Wolfgang Kornkold is at once classical exciting and multifaceted. It plays no small role in moving the story along as well as underscoring action danger solemnity and even humorous moments. It belongs right up there with compositions by some of the guys like Mozart Beethoven Brahms Tchaikowsky Chopin Rossini etc. you get the idea!.A well written tight intelligent script was the foundation for this once in a lifetime true work of Art. When a fine script meets able talent in the Director's chair the two elements act to make the final product even better and better and better............. Errol Flynn was a member of the 1928 0r 1932 Australian Olympic Boxing team a talent that no doubt made him a candidate for the Lead in GENTLEMAN JIM four years later. Alan Hale an all purpose supporting player who portrayed a tremendously wide variety of types. From Mongol Chieftan Kaidu in MARCO POLO to James Cagney's Father in THE STRAWBERRY BLONDE. He must have really liked portraying Little John for he was the Big Quarter Staff Man in Douglas Fairbanks' silent screen ROBIN HOOD1922a role he re prised not only for this picture but also for ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FORSET 1950.".

Add to that Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as Sir Guy and Prince John two of Hollywood's best character actors. 102 minutes of pure fantasy from a creative team totally on top of it's game not forgetting the marvellous Korngold score!OK all well and good but the HD DVD version I bought this week was restored using a process invented by someone at Warners called Ultra Resolution that digitally realigns the three strip Technicolor film to the original state it was in when shot in 1938. The result is amazing the detail is such that you can count the chain mail rings and see the embroidery on the costumes. As for the colour you can see why they used to call it Glorious Technicolor it's like a painting brought to life. Stunning. Even my gf who normally won't watch anything made before about 1980 came in when the film was just starting and ended up watching the whole movie with me and enjoyed it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The other early romanticism take on the Robin Hood legend aside from the silent Douglas Fairbanks version. This one puts famed Hollywood hell raiser pirate Errol Flynn in the title role of Robin Hood. As would be expected of that scoundrelscallywag Flynn's famous devilmaycareheroics the Flynn Robin Hood outrightly refuses to support Prince John when he commits what Robin views as treachery  trying to get himself made king and abusing the land and the people in what may or may not be the aftermath of his older brother King Ricahrd the LionHearted's death while battling in the crusades. After nearly getting killed by John and Gisbourne's men Robin goes on the run with Will Scarlet and along the way acquiring Much Little John a cantankerous Friar Tuck and a whole army of merry men in tights. From there he becomes the great outlaw we all know and love fighting Gisbourne the bumbling Sheriff and Prince John anyway which way he can and sweeps that adorable sweetie pie Maid Marion off her feet.Sure the costumes may look fake today and the film itself overly colorful but it's still a fun time. Sure Errol Flynn doesn't have a well articulated British accent either but at least he doesn't sound like he's from the heart land of America. Flynn is certainly a lot quicker on his feet than Kevin Costner was which comes in handy when you're in a duel to the death. Basil Rathbone is a fairly menacing Gisbourne smarter than the Robert Addie or Michael Wincott versions he looks kind of like Christopher Lee and Olivia de Havilland is a very pretty Marion without being overly sexual and slutty about it as was the case with many leading ladies back then. Out of the versions I've seen this is probably the only one where the Sheriff is an idiot and Gisbourne is the real menace Gisbourne died early in the Kevin Costner verison of Robin Hood and on TV's Robin of Sherwood he was just this weird neurotic guy and I'm afraid I don't remember the Patrick Bergin version of Robin Hood very well.There are least five big action sequences here namely Robin's two escapes from Nottingham an ambush in Sherwood Forest and the climax between Robin's  King Richard's men at Nottingham castle. Naturally there is a duel to the death that features shadows on the wall going at it while the actors are off screen. Good stuff especially for the children.".

	schema:reviewBody "Historically this film is a heap of hooey. If Robin Hood ever existed he would have lived about 150 years after the period in which the film is set. Modern historians are of the opinion that good King Richard and bad King John should be the other way around. This film should be thus regarded as fantasy.The fact that so many Robin Hood films have been made since and not one of them remotely measures up to The Adventures of Robin Hood shows just how good the film is.Favourite scenes? Well there's the scene in the great hall at Nottingham castle where Errol Flynn gives cheek to everyone. The escape the ambush and the final showdown with Sir Guy of Gisborne. Basil Rathbone makes a superb villain. I'm very impressed with the sharpshooting. This was done by Howard Hill. Howard Hill appears a few times in the film. In the escape from the great hall he is the only archer among Guy of Gisburne's crossbowmen. In the archery tournament scene he is Owen the Welshman in spite of what it says in the credits at the end. It has been said before and I'll say it again Errol Flynn did not play Robin Hood he is Robin Hood.Performancewise the cast are superb with hardly a poor performance among them.I did at one time think that Una O'Connor was hamming it up a bit. However I have recently worked in Buckinghamshire with a woman with exactly the same accent and  yes  exactly the same laugh. Absolutely true. Therefore Una O'Connor who plays Marian's servant who resembles Chaucer's Wife of Bath is brilliant!".

Robin Hood is definitely the role Errol Flynn was born to play and here he is at his most handsome athletic and charming. Additionally the supporting cast is just superb.

Curiously enough the film was started by William Keighley apart from having helmed the Flynn swashbuckler THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER 1937 he had been responsible for Warners' previous venture into threestrip Technicolor GOD'S COUNTRY AND THE WOMAN 1937. However studio executives were dissatisfied with how the action sequences had turned out and summarily handed the film over to Michael Curtiz  who had directed Flynn in his two most popular vehicles up to this point CAPTAIN BLOOD 1935 and THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE 1936 neither he nor Flynn apparently were happy with this decision as they despised one another nonetheless they made all of 12 films together several of them bonafide classics.In the end this has certainly made me want to pick up the Errol Flynn Signature Collection also featuring a documentary on the notorious star a.s.a.p.  especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages  but I won't be doing so immediately given that a second set is actually coming in March that said of the 10 films included only 1 will be a firsttime viewing for me  THE DAWN PATROL 1938  but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium rather than in the worn and often colorized prints I've had to make do with up till now! Needless to say there have been scores of films about this popular character and going by the IMDb apart from the aforementioned 1922 Douglas Fairbanks ROBIN HOOD I've also watched the following THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRIE MEN 1952 a liveaction Walt Disney version SWORD OF SHERWOOD FOREST 1960 a Hammer Films effort directed by Terence Fisher and costarring Peter Cushing as the Sheriff of Nottingham! ROBIN HOOD 1973 the Disney animated feature ROBIN AND MARIAN 1976 ROBIN HOOD 1991 TV and ROBIN HOOD  PRINCE OF THIEVES 1991. Still the IMDb listings appear to be incomplete as at least the first two among those I would like to watch are omitted THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST 1946 ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST 1950 Alan Hale's third and last stab at the character of Little John following those of the 1922 and 1938 classics!

	schema:headline " The Classic Robin Hood";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1938 Australianborn motionpicture actor Errol Flynn won the heart of Maid Marian Olivia de Havilland and defeated his evil foes as Robin Hood in The Adventures of Robin Hood a legendary motion picture about a Saxon knight who steals from the rich and gives to the poor oppressed people of England based on the well known English medieval legends. Released in 1938 the film won 3 Academy Awards for art direction film editing and musical score and it was nominated for that of Best Picture. It was also Selected for Registry by the National Film Preservation Board 1995. The Adventures of Robin Hood is listed among Warner Bros. Studio's classic films and biggest hits and solidified Flynn's image as the dashing young swashbuckler hero who always saves the day. Robin Hood played by Errol Flynn fights against the villainous Prince John Claude Rains who took control of the kingdom as regent when King Richard Ian Hunter was captured in Austria during his return from the Holly Lands after Third Crusade's end . Prince John conspires with Guy of Gisbourne Basil Rathbone and certain Norman Knights against his brother Richard the Lionheart so to become a King and oppresses the poor yet faithful to Richard Saxons. Robin Hood and his brave men waylay caravans that travel through Sherwood Forest including one carrying Maid Marian Olivia de Havilland. Robin Hood woos Maid Marian and helps King Richard regain his throne. Even based on legends the movie has a quiet accurate historical set and a very interesting depiction of the conflict between Norman conquerors and Saxon vassals in medieval England. In my opinion this is one of the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Undoubtebly it's the definitive Robin Hood version where Errol Flynn surpassed Douglas Fairbanks who had played the same role in 1922. Kevin Costner's remake of this movie and newest version 1991 on the same medieval legend although is quiet interesting and entertaining seems to be inferior and mediocre in all comparison to this excellent and brilliant largescale epic. Flynn's accent which sounded very English to most Americans and the fact that he brought athletic exuberance dashing good looks and a sense of boyish fun made him a natural choice to star as Sir Robin of Locksley. He plays one of his best roles with bravado and charisma appearing his great talent that made him a legend. Olivia de Havilland who's really of Norman descent!! gives an other great performance as the definitive Maid Marian a sweetly beautiful romantic Norman heroine who's loyal to Richard and Robin's love interest. Claude Rains Basil Rathbone Melville Cooper the coward High Sheriff of Nottingham and Montagu Love as the Bishob of Black Canons are simply perfect as villain conspirators and Rathbone displays his great talent in sword fighting in the magnificent final fencing between Gisbourne and Robin Hood which is one of the most famous scenes in cinema's history. Great and brilliant performances too from Alan HaleLittle JohnEugene Palette astonishing as Friar Tuck Una O'Connor Bess Herbert MundinMuch the Miller's Son and Patrick KnowlesWill Scarlett as Locksley's loyal companions. Curtiz's direction is marvelous and authentic art direction and costumes are splendid Korngold's music score is unique and the Cinematography Color is astonishingly beautiful so that deserved to be awarded. The movie is excellent and give it all the stars that I can.".

Miller.Released in 1938 in the new Technicolor of the time The Adventures of Robin Hood was the one film that not only launched the career of actor Errol Flynn but that of his costar Olivia De Havilland as well as director Michael Curtiz and even elevated Warner Bros Studios to a new level of greatness simply because this film boasts a strong cast and oozes with grand old Hollywood spectacle. The popular folk legend of the heroic outlaw Robin Hood is an old one dating back to the time of the Medieval Crusades and the reign of King Richard the LionHearted. Errol Flynn brought the familiar character to brilliant life in every detail of his performance from the physicality of his acting he did all his own stunts! to the accurate Robin Hood mannerisms language accent and even laugh. He was exactly what audiences felt Robin Hood should be. It's even likely he inspired the later Disney animated version of Robin Hood in the 60's in which the characters were animals. The story of Robin Hood has endured over the years because it's at heart a classic tale of heroism. The social outcast Robin Hood and his band of Merry Mendespite lacking the comforts of home and titles save a then feudal England from the corruption of the Sheriff of Nottingham and the usurper Prince John. While righting wrongs Robin Hood falls for the noblewoman Maid Marion. Can he defeat the evil Prince John and restore the rightful king Richard to the throne ? A notable cast heads up the film. Rising star Olivia De Havilland is pretty elegant charming and yet very resourceful as Maid Marian and her chemistry with Robin Hood is electrifying. She would later become far more than just Errol Flynn's leading lady and win two Oscars for strong dramatic performances in the 40's for To Each His Own and The Heiress and her acting career lasted over 30 years. What we see in her as Maid Marian is a young Olivia De Havilland a new arrival in Hollywood. But the rest of the principals were established stars. Actor Basil Rathbone who plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne had been a silent film star of swashbuckling adventure films. Claude Rains Prince John was popular at this time and would continue to enthrall audiences with great performances over the years including his memorable films The Invisable Man and the talkie Phantom Of The Opera. Claude Rains as Prince John is a nasty piece of work blinded by ambition and ruthless in his pursuit of power hoping to rule England in the absence of King Richard Ian Hunter who is portrayed as a lost adventurer himself. Having fought in the Crusades he comes home to an England he hardly recognizes and one that does not recognize him. Melville Cooper portrays the corrupt Sheriff of Nottingham.The Merry Men of Sherwood Forest including Patrick Knowles as the dashing Will Scarlett Alan Hale as the burly Little John and Eugene Palette as the godly Friar Tuck are also what audiences imagined they would be. When the characters are not fighting plotting or saving the day there is a considerable amount of humor especially in such characters as Bess portrayed by Una O'Connor who serves as ladyinwaiting to Maid Marion. This film had two directors Michael Curtiz and William Keighley because during this time in Hollywood the more ambitious expensive or difficulttoproduce films normally needed extra direction. But it is Michael Curtiz who garnered fame and he would later direct Errol Flynn in other successful films such as the Elizabethan adventure The Sea Hawk and the preCivil War epic Santa Fe Trail in which Flynn was once again paired with Olivia De Havilland. This film is a winner and a classic slice of old Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "When King Richard is captured while abroad his treacherous brother Price John uses the situation as his opportunity to seize the title for himself. With his wicked ways he oppresses the people boosts taxes hangs those who refuses to pay them and generally rules with an iron fist. Out of this situation a hero arises Sir Robin of Locksley who forms a band of outlaws to disrupt the actions of Prince John's men and steal the money back that they have stolen from the citizens of the land. However with Guy of Gisbourne and the Sheriff of Nottingham Prince John makes plans to capture Robin and make an example out of him  but they've got to find him first!This film often sits high on many critics' lists along side many films that would be considered worthy because they would be called 'art' or generally be classic films in the traditional sense indeed this film also sits high on the top 250 list on this site  and long may it continue to do so! Although this film is hardly the sort of stuff that the highbrow critic would pick in his top 100 list the fact that it usually appears there says a lot for just how good it is  not as a classic and deep piece of art but as a really enjoyable adventure film. We all know the basic story and the film sticks to it well  although to be honest I can never remember if I know it from this film or from the legend itself! The plot is engaging but it is the manner of delivery that makes this film so much fun to watch.The action is hardly groundbreaking how could it be after 60 years? but given that it isn't based on effects it has stood up really well and is enjoyable to watch  it's an overused term but the action here is what I would define as 'swashbuckling' fun! For my money the even better aspect of the film is that it manages to take this vein of good clean fun and run it through the entire film. Most enjoyably for me was the dialogue that was often laugh out loud funny  some lines were hardly of the period but were funny none the less! Outside of the comedy in the dialogue the film manages to retain the sense of fun in all but the odd darker scene. This sense of fun is passed through and sustained by the performances which are led by a typically cocksure pardon the pun Errol Flynn. He plays Robin larger than life and rightly so. He is tremendous fun in the lead and he is major part of making sure it all comes off. Rains has a minor role but he is not a straight bad guy and has a strange humour about it  he may not have the ham that Alan Rickman would later bring to the role but he does it very well nonetheless. Playing a more traditional bad guy was Basil Rathbone  a good actor and made all the more enjoyable performance for me because I rarely see him in anything but the Holmes movies. De Havilland is pretty but doesn't make much of an impression as Marion but luckily Robin's merry men are roundly good with fun performances from Pallette Hale Knowles and others.Overall this is a great film  not because the story is really deep or the special effects are astounding but simply because it is a really fun and funny swashbuckling adventure. With a real sense of fun running though the script the cinematography and wondrous Technicolor the dialogue and the performances this film has stood up effortlessly over the past 60 years and it will continue to do for long after my generation are dead and buried and other ones come to discover it.".

For my money the even better aspect of the film is that it manages to take this vein of good clean fun and run it through the entire film. Most enjoyably for me was the dialogue that was often laugh out loud funny  some lines were hardly of the period but were funny none the less! Outside of the comedy in the dialogue the film manages to retain the sense of fun in all but the odd darker scene. This sense of fun is passed through and sustained by the performances which are led by a typically cocksure pardon the pun Errol Flynn. He plays Robin larger than life and rightly so. He is tremendous fun in the lead and he is major part of making sure it all comes off. Rains has a minor role but he is not a straight bad guy and has a strange humour about it  he may not have the ham that Alan Rickman would later bring to the role but he does it very well nonetheless. Playing a more traditional bad guy was Basil Rathbone  a good actor and made all the more enjoyable performance for me because I rarely see him in anything but the Holmes movies. De Havilland is pretty but doesn't make much of an impression as Marion but luckily Robin's merry men are roundly good with fun performances from Pallette Hale Knowles and others.Overall this is a great film  not because the story is really deep or the special effects are astounding but simply because it is a really fun and funny swashbuckling adventure. With a real sense of fun running though the script the cinematography and wondrous Technicolor the dialogue and the performances this film has stood up effortlessly over the past 60 years and it will continue to do for long after my generation are dead and buried and other ones come to discover it.";

Heck the Fox in the Disney version of Robin Hood and Cary Elwes as Robin Hood Men in Tights were better Robin Hoods than Costner! No Flynn was meant to play this role.The supporting cast is also incredible. Claude Rains as Prince John was priceless and charming in his own malevolent way. Basil Rathbone Alan Hale Patric Knowles and Eugene Palette were also memorable for me in the film.And of course you can't write a review of this film without mentioning the chemistry of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Past or present very few onscreen couples possess the natural chemistry those two had. They just looked at each other and you could tell there were unresolved feelings there and there were both admitted later on. They were just magic on screen together.There is really something for everyone in this film and I recommend seeing it.".

	schema:headline " The Character That Best Harmonizes Errol Flynn's Persona Also Bonus Information about Medieval England before and after Richard";
	schema:reviewBody "With the introductory credits highlighted in lush Technicolor and a grand musical score we know that we are in for a rousing swashbuckler adventure. A herald reads to crowds that King Richard I the Lion Heart Coeur de Lion as he was returning to the West from the Third Crusade has been captured 1191 in the movie but actually 1192 by his sworn enemy Leopold of Austria. He is being held captive for an incredibly large ransom 150000 marks or 100000 English pounds. Taking advantage of the situation Richard's brother Prince John Claude Rains deposes the legal regent Longchamps and seizes control of the Kingdom of England. John's chief henchmen are Sir Guy of Gisbourne Basil Rathbone and the Sheriff of Nottingham Melville Cooper. John promptly raises taxes ostensibly to raise Richard's huge ransom but in reality to build up the resources to maintain his power structure.When the English AngloSaxons protest the exorbitant taxes they are oppressed beaten and tortured and lose their properties. Taking pity on the oppressed Saxons Sir Robin of Locksley Errol Flynn and sidekick Will Scarlett Patric Knowles begin to protect them. Eventually known as Robin Hood he and his Merry Men inhabit Sherwood Forest and become wanted outlaws. King John confiscates Robin's properties. The revolt becomes fullfledged as new men are recruited like John Little or Little John Alan Hale and Friar Tuck Eugene Palette. In the meantime Norman Maid Marian Fitzwalter Olivia de Havilland is firmly in John's court and corner in the beginning. But after Sir Guy's treasure guard is defeated captured and temporarily held by Robin's forces she realizes that Robin is caring and is most sincere about real justice for the common people. She eventually falls in love with him. After being foiled many times by Robin King John advised by the Sheriff sets a trap at a national archery contest. He captures the outlaw. At a tavern Lady Marian tells Robin's men where he is held and thus just before his scheduled execution he is dramatically freed. Meanwhile King Richard Ian Hunter has been released by the Austrians. It is assumed that the ransom was paid by Robin's men. The rightful king and his entourage travel incognito in England gathering information relating to local events. Richard soon meets up with Robin's Merry Men who upon recognizing the king kneel in homage and express their loyalty to the true crown. They are determined to unseat the usurper. Meanwhile Marian is arrested and condemned to death for treason by John and Sir Guy. John falsely believing that Richard is dead by a failed assassination attempt plans a fullfledged coronation ceremony at his castle. The denouement involves the attack by Robin's forces at John's coronation when the disguised attackers appear and surprise John's knights. There is a spectacular swordfight between Robin and Sir Guy and Robin that ends the action. Richard is restored to his rightful throne as John and the Sheriff are banished. Robin becomes Lord Baron and Earl and Lady Marian and he have Richard's permission to marry. Errol Flynn as the dashing Robin Hood Sir Robin of Locksley is in his best role. He owns the part. His love interest is perfectly matched with lovely and petite 22year old Olivia De Havilland Lady Marian. Basil Rathbone a superb swordsman in real life is excellent as the haughty Sir Guy of Gisbourne. So is Claude Rains as the evil Prince John who persecutes the Saxons. The other castings are equally firstrate. In short there are superior photography by Gaudio and Polito in California not England! excellent Korngold music colorful Anderson costumes good direction nice script by Raine and Miller and great swordfights! What an adventure one of the best of the Middle Ages ever filmed! The American Film Institute twice issued its listings of the top 100 movies of all time. Both times The Adventures of Robin Hood did not make the list. But AFI's listings did include movies like The Apartment 1960 Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?1967 Network 1976 Tootsie 1982 and Do the Right Thing 1989. I assure you that The Adventures of Robin Hood was superior to those in virtually every method examined. Watch and compare. But one may ask Does this movie portray the real medieval England? Probably not and there are historical inaccuracies. But watch it anyway more than once as it ranks as one of the alltime great adventure flicks in world cinema!BONUS INFORMATION As written by the Venerable Bede the Angles and Saxons and Jutes from northern Europe invaded Britannia England in the fifth century and displaced the RomanoBriton population. The Jutes were soon absorbed by the Saxons. Over time the Angles and Saxons English became more civilized and in the seventh century England was reconverted to the old Christian faith of Roman times. In the ninth century King Alfred d. 899 united much of AngloSaxon England and fought invading Danes establishing Europe's first national State in the process. In 1066 the Normans successfully invaded the nation Battle of Hastings and consolidated their power. In 1189 Richard I inherited his kingdom from his Norman father Henry II. Upon his return from the Crusades and Austrian captivity Richard forgave his brother John and again made him his heir 1194. But Richard spent little time in England. In March 1199 as he was besieging a castle in France without wearing his chain mail he was struck by a crossbow arrow in his left shoulder and eventually died of gangrene poisoning in the arms of his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine. John became king but had his problems with rebellious barons. So it was that they forced him to acknowledge political reform the Magna Carta Great Charter at Runnymede near Windsor Castle 1215. John died of disease a year later while campaigning against the rebels in the First Barons' War.".

It's one of those movies that I can't pass up when it's shown on TV.I'm not a huge Errol Flynn fan but this movie hits all the right buttons for anyone that loves adventure. The correct elements are in place for fantastic entertainment and I can't imagine a movie that does fantasy adventure better. Lots of good guys killing bad guys in great fights no blood of course horse chases rescues the hero saves the damsel comic relief it's all here! No need for high tech theatrics.Naturally there is some suspension of logic here as is pretty much mandatory to keep a good fantasy movie moving along. One noticeable flaw is that Robin apparently has a neverending quiver of arrows something I never noticed until I was older. This is in plain view when Robin first comes to Nottingham Castle to confront Prince John. Upon close inspection we can see he has five arrows in his quiver with perhaps a sixth hidden behind others. During his escape from the castle he shoots 10 arrows and when he hops on his horse to escape to Sherwood Forest he still appears to have five arrows left. This is the Sherwood version of the 6 shot revolvers from 1930's western and gangster movies which could often shoot 1215 times without reloading.I cannot give a movie more than a classic rating but this one merits it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A comment made by Emma Thompson made me want to see Roman Holiday again. Miss Thompson said about Audrey Hepburn she has no bite Implying that Miss Hepburn wasn't much of an actress. Well I don't know what she was talking about or perhaps she doesn't either. To see Roman Holiday again in 2017 was a moving and wonderful experience. Audrey Hepburn's performance is as fresh and enchanting as I remembered. Perhaps even more. So I arrived to the conclusion that Miss Thompson is talking about a different kind of acting. When a performance travels in time with the same power decade after decade for me that's great film acting. In Roman Holiday she took me with her and convinced me heart and mind that she was that princess and I loved her. William Wyler the wonderful director knew what he was doing  he always did. By introducing us to Audrey Hepburn he reinforced and reinvigorated his own prodigious legacy. I love Emma Thompson as an actress but she's totally wrong about Audrey Hepburn.".

Hepburn was always beguiling but in some of her later roles she tended to overplay the winsomeness. Here every note she hits is just about perfect.And speaking of notes pay special attention to the score by the great Georges Auric. If the film had been produced in the manner of modern romantic comedies the sound track would have been larded with pop hits by Perry Como Dinah Shore and Frankie Laine which would have done an awful lot to destroy the magic. Instead Auric's complex vibrant evocative music complements the story's inherent lyricism without upstaging it. In an era of bombastic film scoring this seems a miracle.Someone once said that Audrey Hepburn's was the beauty of possibility and transformation  she was always in motion always becoming something else. Roman Holiday is very much of a piece with that notion. On the surface the film is about a princess who disguises herself as a commoner. But in truth she's actually pretending to be a princess at least at first. She finally becomes authentic  is transformed and prepared to deal with her destiny  only through the ennobling power of love and sacrifice. That's one heck of a mythic subtext and does a lot to explain Roman Holiday's enduring power.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Roman Holiday was in the planning stages William Wyler envisioned either Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons in the role of the princess. When neither proved available he and Paramount studios decided to do a Scarlett O'Hara type search for an unknown for the part. The film then would only have Gregory Peck as the star to draw the people in.But when Peck saw the screen test and also realized the film would rise and fall on the performance of the princess part he insisted on top billing for Audrey Hepburn. Audrey had only done a few small bit parts in some English films up till then however Peck insisted on the billing of her right after him with 'introducing Audrey Hepburn' as her title credit. In the same way that William Holden credited Barbara Stanwyck with helping him get through Golden Boy Audrey Hepburn credited Gregory Peck with her performance in Roman Holiday. As well as William Wyler who still has a record of more people getting to the Oscar sweepstakes for his films than any other director.Roman Holiday is simple and delightful film about a young princess of some unnamed European country who gets tired of her programmed routine and wants a break from it. In Rome while on a European tour princess Audrey fakes an illness and runs off for a day of fun.An American wire service reporter Gregory Peck finds her and realizes he's got an exclusive. So he chaperones her around without letting her know she's on to him. He even gets photographer Eddie Albert to help him out.Eddie Albert got the first of two nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Roman Holiday the second one being The Goodbye Girl. He lost to Frank Sinatra for From Here to Eternity. Though Albert is funny in this film for dramatic work I never understood why he was not nominated for Attack or for Captain Newman MD.If you're thinking that the film is starting to bear a resemblance to a continental It Happened One Night you would be right. And if that's your thinking it will come as no surprise to learn that Frank Capra originally had the idea to film this. The property reverted to Paramount as part of his settlement to leave that studio after doing two Bing Crosby films.I wish Paramount had done Roman Holiday in color though. Darryl F. Zanuck over at 20th Century did Three Coins in the Fountain in gorgeous color and later on MGM did The Seven Hills of Rome also in color. Still the Roman locations really add a lot to Audrey's adventure.When Oscar time Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role and really first role of any consequence won an Oscar for Best Actress. Until the day she died Audrey Hepburn had charm enough for ten you can't help but love her in anything she ever did. Even if the film she did was not that great Audrey sparkles through.Even in black and white the Eternal City with Audrey and Greg make anyone young at heart.".

He is a good balance for Hepburn's charm and energy remaining calm and logical without ever becoming cold or distant.  You feel as if you could spend a lot more than a couple of hours in their company. And how could you improve on Eddie Albert's performance as Peck's photographer friend?  The movie also adds in the atmosphere of Rome itself with some creative scenes that make good use of the setting.There are many fine moments in a story that at times seems almost like a daydream and then it brings the characters back to reality in a moving way.

She is without a doubt an angel who was sent to this earth to delight the movie audiences in whatever movie she happened to dignify with her appearance in.Some people have compared Audrey Tatou with the incomparable Audrey Hepburn. Seeing Ms Hepburn in Roman Holiday will certainly change the minds of those comparing fans. Audrey Hepburn was a star's star! She exudes charm intelligence elegance and beauty. Just one look from her could disarm Gregory Peck forever.The only wrong note of this production was the way the writer Dalton Trumbo was treated since he had been blacklisted by the anticommunist faction lead by Sen. McCarthy and company. In the end Mr. Trumbo was vindicated in having his name recognized as the writer of Roman Holiday.This film is a feast to the eyes in that glorious cinematography and Rome as a background. This was Hollywood at its best. Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn will be forever young any time we take a look at this classic that I'm sure will live and charm its viewers whenever they take a chance to see it for the first time or like some of us for another loving look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Audrey Hepburn burst onto the movie scene with this film her first role. She plays an English Princess traveling in Rome who is bored with her official duties and the tight schedule she's on. One night after getting a tranquilizer to calm her from the stress of it all she sneaks away into the streets of Rome. She's found by a newspaperman played by Gregory Peck who takes her to his place to sleep it off. When he finds out who she really is he realizes he's on top of a gold mine of a story and enlists his photographer friend Eddie Albert to get candid shots of the two while they sightsee. Hepburn and Peck are such an attractive couple and director William Wyler gets lots of beautiful shots of Rome including the Trevi Fountain Spanish Steps Castel Sant'Angelo and of course the classic scene they have at the Bocca della Verit. It all makes for a very romantic film. Hepburn played her part perfectly expressing frustration and joy with such economy as well as the restraint that comes from being a royal. Among several others the scene with her getting her hair cut short is captivating and it's no wonder that she won an Oscar for her performance. Peck's performance is also excellent and Eddie Albert pulls off the part of a young rogue quite well despite being 47 at the time. I won't spoil the ending except to say it's touching and poignant and so perfectly shot in the Palazzo Colonna. At the end of the day this is 'just a romantic comedy' with its share of silliness but it's so mature and magical and with these stars in this setting it stands head and shoulders above so many others.".

Just a fantastic movie both light hearted funny and a unique love story all in one film. Any fan of Audery can't miss her Oscar winning performance in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Roman Holiday 1953 Starring Audrey Hepburn Gregory Peck Eddie Albert Hartley Power Hancourt Williams Margaret Rawlings Paolo Carlini Tullio Carminati Claudio Ermelli Paola Borboni John Horne Henz Hindrich Alfredo Rizzo Laura Solari...Director William Wyler Screenplay Ian McLellan Hunter.Director William Wyler's 1953 Roman Holiday was yet another triumph for him as director it was the film that launched the career of Audrey Hepburn and a thoroughly wellmade and touching romance straight out of the early 50's so beloved by the public it won the Oscar for Best Picture. William Wyler had previously directed great stars before this film. In 1938 he directed Jezebel which starred Bette Davis in a role that she credited as her first great performance and gained her notoriety as a star earning her an Oscar. In 1949 Wyler directed Olivia De Havilland in The Heiress for which she also won an Oscar. For a star to work with William Wyler meant success one way or another. Audrey Hepburn walked away with the Oscar for Best Actress quite an accomplishment when you consider she had'nt made any American films and William Wyler for Director. In Roman Holiday Audrey Hepburn plays the beautiful and sensitive European princess Anne who tired of living a repressive public life and seeking to escape from its dull and stifling facade runs away during a European tour becoming familiar with the city of Rome on her own. The public press is totally unaware she has decided to quit the last leg of the tour and instead the press deceive the public by stating she's suffered a mysterious illness. She meets Joe Bradley a photographer for a paper that specializes in celebrity news like the Hollywood Reporter or People Magazine today. Together they roam the city of Rome and fall in love with the city and with themselves. Ann looks at the world with new eyes and finds herself doing things she had never been allowed to do before  getting a bold new short haircut eating ice cream and she is genuinely enthralled by the Eternal City. Joe has an ulterior motive. He is photographing her adventure in Rome and hopes to make good money off it but as they spend time together they fall in love and he has a change of heart opting not to expose the Princess. In its own way this film much like Sunset Boulevard criticized the movie industry this film criticized the paparazzi and Hollywood press industry. It's not long before her royal connections catch up with Ann and she is forced to return to the public life. Joe returns the photos to her during a Farewell Speech at an Embassy the last time they see each other. That long final overhead shot of Gregory Peck leaving the Baroque interior of the building is priceless and one of the few great endings that year. It was also the first of its kind for a romantic comedy which usually ended in happiness for the lovers. Gregory Peck was by this time an established star but the film was never about him because this is the first great film Audrey Hepburn made in the US and she would only move on to bigger and better things. The cinematography is absolutely exquisite expressing the new innovations in camera work as the decade of the 50's began. 1953 would see other great and modern films including director Zinnerman's From Here To Eternity. Roman Holiday also packed a powerful punch because that year '53 was the year that Princess Margaret sister to England's Queen Elizabeth II went public about her relationship with the commoner Peter Townsend. Many people believed Princess Anne is either consciously or unconsciously based on the real life Princess Margaret. And the ending which does not result in the lovers' happiness mirrored Margaret's real life tragic romance. Filmed on location in Rome we get nothing but gorgeous shots of the Trevi Fountain the Spanish Steps the Castel San Angelo and other monuments but never in a such a hurried or showy way. Instead each scene flows to the next as Ann and Joe journey from one tourist spot to the other. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck have strong chemistry and carry the film themselves. For me this is Hepburn's best work with a leading actor despite all the critical acclaim she received for later films with Humphrey BogartWilliam Holden Sabrina and with Cary Grant Charade. There is something truly moving about the unhappy princess who finds one fleeting slice of happiness in her life a moment in her life when she learned to live freely and to experience the world on her own without owing anything to the future. Being the early 50's we don't see Peck and Hepburn making love and we see them only kiss once but their feelings for each other are quite evident in subtle ways. This is an American movie classic and should be in every good classic film lover's collection.".

In addition to the wonderful Ms. Hepburn Gregory Peck does his typically superb job and Eddie Albert turns in a delightful but no doubt painful for him performance in this incredibly charming jewel of a film.  This film made me an incurable romantic for life!  sigh I'd better quit before my apartment becomes a windtunnel!  Joyously happily recommended!";

Suffice to state that it never loses its luster even though it is over sixty years since its original release.Every element of the film seems perfectly shaped from the memorable Hollywood debut of Audrey Hepburn to the nuanced support offered by Gregory Peck a witty script by John Dighton and Ian McLellan Hunter based on a story by the thenblacklisted Dalton Trumbo beautiful blackandwhite photography of a Rome that no longer exists by Henri Alakan and Frank F. Planer and taut direction by Wyler that gives plenty of opportunities for the actors to flourish while retaining the mystique of the Eternal City as a place where romance can occur however briefly.The film has memorable nuanced moments from the opening sequence where the Princess Hepburn undergoes an apparently endless series of presentations while trying to stretch her feet under her voluminous dress the sequence where she wears pajamas for the first time and falls asleep in Peck's bed during a chaste night away from the palace the sequence taking place in the sidewalk caf where Peck keeps telling his witless sidekick Nathan Eddie Albert to shut up about the Princess's true identity and the memorable moment at the Bocca della Verita aka the Mouth of Truth where Peck puts his hand in and brings it out abruptly scaring the living daylights out of the Princess as he does so.Nothing actually happens during the Princess's night away from her royal duties her virtue remains intact and she has a merry time dodging the Carabinieri and her Secret Service officers in a comic fight sequence taking place near the Castel Saint'Angelo which culminates in Peck and herself diving into the river and swimming to safety. ROMAN HOLIDAY conjures up a world that simply does not exist today of comic Italians waving their arms about expressively of obliging cabdrivers and locals selling everything on the street from water melons flowers and other junk. In these days of mass tourism commercial interests have taken over and Rome's innocence  as well as a lot of its allure  has been lost in the process. Nonetheless we can enjoy a nostalgic wallow in the past through this film.".

Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance the screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist he did not receive a credit instead Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003. On December 19 2011 full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.The DVD sat on my shelf for the longest time and I am so glad I took it out to watch. The screenplay is subtle filled with nuances that Hepburn and Peck teased them out beautifully. I can hardly detect an air of pretension and emotional manipulation. This is as romantic as it gets between a princess and an everyday man. The ending in the big hall really hits the spot. So much is left unsaid but yet what is said speaks volumes. It never betrays the tone of what the film sets out to be but yet my heart was beating with the full desire of wanting to see the relationship go a certain more familiar way. This is an amazing date movie with oodles of intelligence.".

I can watch this scene a dozen times and not get tired of it.Roman Holiday really is the perfect romance film. Hepburn and Peck are not only very attractive leads but also have a wonderful chemistry. Eddie Albert provides just the right dose of comedy as Peck's sidekick. And the location... I don't think Rome has ever looked more delightful on film. Sure there are a few Italian stereotypes but hey it was the 1950's and none of it's done with any meanspiritedness.Warning SpoilersThe ending of Roman Holiday while utterly heartbreaking is entirely fitting. This was a romance that was too good to last. And yet when I see the final scene where Peck trudges out of the press conference all alone I keep hoping that Hepburn will run after him and declare her love and renounce her throne or some such rubbish. If only they had DVD back in 1953 then they could have shot an alternate happy ending.".

Audrey's acting in that movie impressed me so I decided to watch Roman holiday too. Too be very frank I was not really looking forward to watching this movie. Like most people of this generation I dislike black and white movies.Man was I wrong. I have never seen a movie which had so much romance comedy and emotional drama. It would be fair to say that magic was created in this movie. The plot I guess everyone knows a young princes tired of her regulated life runs away and hooks up with a reporter Gregory Peck for a day of fun in Rome. The reporter lies to her that he is a businessman and she lies to him about her true identity. They both have fun visiting Rome's historic places. But the reporter has a hidden agenda. He wants to write a story on the princess's escapades in Rome and enlists the help of his photographer friend Albert. Things work according to plan for the reporter until he finds that he is really starting to fall in love with the princess.The story line may appear to be simple but take my word for it that Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn create magic and the movie will take a hold over you like nothing else you have ever seen. This is Audrey's best movie and the only movie she got an Oscar for and she was never so charming innocent and beautiful as she is in this movie.One of the reviewers has suggested that Cary Grant would have been ideal for the role that Gregory Peck plays. I only have to say this to the devotees of Cary Grant that he would never have worked as a romantic lead in this movie. He was 50 years old at the time this movie was made and the sight of him cavorting around with a girl half his age would have removed from the movie it's romantic element. It would have become perhaps a slightly funnier movie but without the heart wrenching almost magical hold it now has. Also it is my humble opinion after seeing Charade that Cary Grant is too suave to play the role of a struggling reporter convincingly.History has already spoken this movie is regarded as one of the all time greats why would we want to change something which is already perfect. Gregory Peck is ideal for the role of the reporter he is incredibly handsome in the movie a kind of man a young girl could fall in love with even after being with him only for a few hours. In this movie Gregory Peck acts his heart out especially at the end and he has a wonderfully chemistry with Audrey which is the reason this movie still seems so fresh and charming even after 50 years.This is one of those rare movies that works across cultural and national borders. I was surprised to learn that according to a poll in Japan even after so many years Roman Holiday still is the number one foreign movie of all time.This movie is simply the best.".

This gem has got more than all the ingredients that make a film of this genre successful because not only was it a hit it's a classic.";

	schema:reviewBody "I often go see advance screenings in my area especially now that I must officially be on the list as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like Superbad this did not disappoint. At the same time while many of the cast members may be recognizable there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of 40 Year Old Virgin Superbad or Knocked Up.For starters there was a definite presence of the TV actors on the big screen theme here but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall the iconic ex of the film but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow Russell Brand to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her nottoosmart and shallow role of That 70s Show didn't follow her to Forgetting's script. Kunis plays Racheal a hospitality girl for the hotel that Forgetting takes place and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent charismatic and appreciative of the good in people a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than American Psycho 2 and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.The star of the film in my opinion easily has to be Russell Brand who plays the overconscious oversexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates complete with perfect costume choices. The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.The writing flows with welltimed jokes apathetic digs and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas Segel did time on CSI and TV actresses in horrible horror movies Kunis did the atrocious American Psycho 2 not sure if it was intentional but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest however the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences like I noticed with Superbad. It also doesn't get very heavy in the least which is what I felt hurt Knocked Up. I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller  who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write Fun with Dick and Jane.All in all this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end just laughing hysterically.".

Kirsten Bell acts much better in this than Heroes and it's a nice change of pace to not recognize Paul Rudd in appearance and character immediately. Bill Hader is funny as always. What really comes across in this film is that everyone even Sarah Marshall seems like a 3dimensional character. Hopefully the days in comedies when people are bitchy or vile just for the hell of it are gone. Even the shallow pop star Aldous Snow Russell Brand who is the rival to Peter is likable.

	schema:reviewBody "Forgetting Sarah Marshall definitely the biggest movie that everyone was looking forward to seeing this year. Apatow has had nothing but big success with his comedies 40yearold Virgin Knocked Up Superbad Walk Hard and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall their next big hit. Also Jason Segal's first major script brought to life I have to say he's got talent the reason I say that? These characters... they're likable! Not only are the likable they are real and people you could relate too! For example Sarah Marshall's new boyfriend that she broke up with Peter for yeah he's a little bit of a moron but you know what? You could understand why people liked him he was pretty cool even the girlfriend Sarah yeah she was a jerk but so real and also you don't get too mad at her with her reason on why she fell out of love with Peter. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has great laughs and a fun story.Sarah Marshall hot actress beautiful and a fun person just broke up with her musician boyfriend Peter. He's just heartbroken and needs to get away for a while so he goes to Hawaii but guess what? Sarah is there with her new rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow and things are not seeming to go his way. But when he meets Rachel Jenson the nice and really pretty hotel clerk they go out and he ends up realizing that maybe this break up wasn't such a big deal after all.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a funny movie I guarantee you are going to laugh. I do have one complaint the male nudity now it's not that I'm a prude at all just this was more uncomfortable than funny with Jason exposing all his assets. I don't know just that type of humor isn't funny with me male or female just depending on the joke but this was more awkward. But I do think this is a fun movie it has a great story and really makes you laugh and just have a good time with these characters it's a good recommendation from me.710".

	onyx:emotionText "Forgetting Sarah Marshall definitely the biggest movie that everyone was looking forward to seeing this year. Apatow has had nothing but big success with his comedies 40yearold Virgin Knocked Up Superbad Walk Hard and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall their next big hit. Also Jason Segal's first major script brought to life I have to say he's got talent the reason I say that? These characters... they're likable! Not only are the likable they are real and people you could relate too! For example Sarah Marshall's new boyfriend that she broke up with Peter for yeah he's a little bit of a moron but you know what? You could understand why people liked him he was pretty cool even the girlfriend Sarah yeah she was a jerk but so real and also you don't get too mad at her with her reason on why she fell out of love with Peter. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has great laughs and a fun story.Sarah Marshall hot actress beautiful and a fun person just broke up with her musician boyfriend Peter. He's just heartbroken and needs to get away for a while so he goes to Hawaii but guess what? Sarah is there with her new rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow and things are not seeming to go his way. But when he meets Rachel Jenson the nice and really pretty hotel clerk they go out and he ends up realizing that maybe this break up wasn't such a big deal after all.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a funny movie I guarantee you are going to laugh. I do have one complaint the male nudity now it's not that I'm a prude at all just this was more uncomfortable than funny with Jason exposing all his assets. I don't know just that type of humor isn't funny with me male or female just depending on the joke but this was more awkward.

	schema:reviewBody "Prior to the release of The 40 Year Old Virgin it is likely that few people knew the name Judd Apatow. Now just three years later that name has become almost a stamp of comedy quality with such films as Knocked Up and Superbad following on the heels of The 40 Year Old Virgin. Now the Apatow steamroller moves forward with Forgetting Sarah Marshall and once again it has mined comedy gold with lots of laughs but also as with many of the previous film's from Apatow's company a nice streak of sweet romance to go along with the laughs.Fogetting Sarah Marshall focuses on Peter Bretter Jason Segel a Hollywood composer who's girlfriend Sarah Marshall Kristen Bell is the star of a CSIstyle police procedural series. Jason is a bit of a layabout who also isn't afraid to walk around his apartment naked and Sarah has decided she has had enough of him so she is breaks up with Peter leaving him in a seemingly unending pool of despair.To try to take his mind of Sarah he takes an impromptu vacation to Hawaii but quickly discovers to his horror that Sarah is also at the same hotel as him with her new boyfriend recently on the wagon British rocker Aldous Snow Russell Brand. However while doing his best to avoid Sarah Peter finds himself falling for a hotel staff member Rachel Jansen Mila Kunis.As with such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a comedy that isn't afraid to mine the more vulgar for comedy nor does it shy away from some rather frank nudity including plenty of footage of star Segel who is also the screenwriter. The upside is that unlike many other sophomoric comedies these days the raunchier material actually produces laughs. Much of the film's best humor comes from Brand's performance as off the wall Snow. The character has lots of great scenes and lines capitalizing on the characters seeming insatiable libido.Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't just provide lots of laughs it also features an involving and touching romance between Peter and Rachel. Both Segel and Kunis have a nice chemistry between them that fuels an involving romance. As the film progresses we can't help but root for the characters to find themselves together in the end.In addition to the previously mentioned Brand the cast of Forgetting Sarah Marshall gives us both great laughs and characters we can be involved with. Segel proves to be relatively low on insecurity as he puts himself almost completely on display literally. His Peter is an character whose rather unassuming nature wins you over. Kristen Bell makes the films titular character at times apparently selfinvolved but also someone who has a soft spot for her exboyfriend. Kunis' Rachel is a character that is both nononsense and full of sweetness.In the end Forgetting Sarah Marshall proves to be another winner from Team Apatow and belongs right next to the previous hits from his creative team. If you are looking for both laughs and a dash of romance look no further than Forgetting Sarah Marshall.".

It was consistently funny and highly quotable with a strong cast and well developed characters. I have been continually impressed with the multitalented young actors under Judd Apatow's wing and Jason Segelwho I'll admit has been one of my favorites since Freaks and Geeksdoes not disappoint. There are many familiar faces here from other Apatow projects but for good reason. Paul Rudd whom I love equally in comedy and drama true fans must view The Shape of Things but be prepared to be uncomfortable Bill Hadar and Jonah Hill hit just the right notes in their supporting roles. There's Russell Brandwhom I was unfamiliar with but apparently evokes strong feelings one way or the other across the pondis hysterical and delivered some of my favorite lines. Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis are sympathetic straight women to the goofy men around them. It was particularly nice to Mila Kunis outside of the 70's ShowFamily Guy worlds. And last but certainly not least there's 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer playing an equally lovable and funny newlywed version of Kenneth.Though I did feel that the film ran a little long it never once dragged. There were also a few shots that I am sure will not be available until the unrated DVD hits stores because though they are truly hilarious they are essentially the only thing keeping the film from a PG13 rating.Finally I will say that those who liked Knocked Up Superbad and 40 YearOld Virgin will certainly enjoy this movie. I personally would rank it above the other three and will enjoy debating my friends about that come April.".

It doesn't try to push the envelope of How immature and disgusting can we be? which was what I have come to expect from these sorts of movies. It's just funny actors doing a great job of telling a good story that most adults will relate to in some way.

That out of the way the pic was pretty affable containing more than a handful of good laughs as well as more than a lot of generally comically captured sex scenes. Many of the secondary characters also play enjoyably silly roles. And there is a funny musical component to the pic that also includes an amusing rendition of puppetrelated works.I suppose I do have to level a little criticism for the theme being a little slight but there still is something to be said for healing of personal wounds and learning to move on. Those that have seen other Apatow relationship pics will probably see a number of similarities slacker dude learns to grow up gross out comedy etc even though Apatow didn't write or direct this piece. The film is also a bit on the long side like many comedies that come from the Apatow crew and you do notice it. Some judicious trimming and relegating of some scenes including numerous flashbacks to DVD extras would've been helpful.Finally I wish that more character could be drawn from both Sarah Marshall and Peter's newfound love interest hotel employee Rachel as they played fairly twodimensional but I'm glad that Sarah didn't end up a onenote character as well. I didn't love the conclusion of the breakup story arc because I felt that it was a bit of a copout but it didn't ruin the film. Lastly Peter was written a little on the edge of believability in terms of being oversensitive so you really have to buy his character otherwise the film will break on you.Essentially this is a congenial enjoyable but rudecrude film with a share of laughs and more Jason Segel than you probably ever wanted to see. Recommended for those who like some story with their laughs and can handle the vulgar sexual and nude content. 810.".

The films continual crude scenes of awkward sex and the general focus on actual intercourse further added to its vitriol and made it seem like it was written by a 13 year old boy. which seems likely.

All in all plot vacuous acting bad bad horrible especially the vapid potato head who blessed the lead role  and don't  for the love of god watch this with your family. its so stupidly crude that you wont want to look each other in the eye after watching it. good lord what a waste of 1 12 hours..".

All in all plot vacuous acting bad bad horrible especially the vapid potato head who blessed the lead role  and don't  for the love of god watch this with your family. its so stupidly crude that you wont want to look each other in the eye after watching it. good lord what a waste of 1 12 hours..";

Surfers that have smoked themselves into a stupor are way eighties dudes. I think Paul Rudd whom I like knew his character was just another variation of Spicoli and phones it in a little. A weepy Emo rocker or even an angry white rapper would've been more contemporary than a sexobsessed British rock star. You would have to go back decades to find a musical artist that even remotely resembles him. They even miss chances to poke fun at reallife personalities. Sarah Marshall could have been one of those boozy ingnues that flash their privates as they get out of limos.Supporting characters are unnecessarily inserted into the story and eventually forgotten but they don't even provide an excuse for a clever joke. There is a Christian couple on their honeymoon that are completely pointless and they lead to some of the worst gags in the movie. All you are left with is something that is going to potentially insult a large group of people and you didn't even get a single laugh out of it. Jonah Hill and his infatuation with the rock star goes nowhere and is not particularly funny. The other characters have become alltoofamiliar in a romantic comedy. The toogoodtobetrue romantic interest. The henpecked husband and friend of the hero. Et cetera.There was a standup comedian on the talk show circuit a few years back who would make a joke about how people will get tattoos of symbols in foreign languages that have no meaning like the Japanese kanji for water. They shoehorn the joke into the film by having it spoken by an airhead who is suddenly translating tattoos in other languages. Maybe Carlos Mencia contributed to the movie?When Judd Apatow produced a good comedy show Freaks  Geeks it was largely ignored by the public and was quickly canceled after one season. When he started appealing to the lowest common denominator the same people were suddenly his biggest fans and praised him. You start to see why That 70's Show lasted 8 seasons and why Two and a Half Men is entering its sixth. Meanwhile Arrested Development barely makes it to 3. Almost every opportunity and setup the movie has to do something clever they take the easy and predictable route. I was actually surprised by how many of the jokes were just plain cheesy. The only thing you can say in defense of such a shallow movie is that it is comparatively better than Disaster Movie or Good Luck Chuck but that should not impress anyone. You would almost have to be trying to make a worse comedy than those. It is like when people orgasm because gas prices fall a little but they are still paying more than they should. People are becoming conditioned to bad comedy.And yes there is a token ethnic guy.".

Nothing will help so he is going on vacation at a resort in Hawaii  and nice coincidence  accidentally his exgirlfriend is in the same resort with her really dummy of a rock starboyfriend and on and on ... horrible. Rather not necessary to say that he stays all the time a real sissy. Strongly recommended  not.";

	schema:reviewBody "To be completely honest I went into this movie expecting to thoroughly trash it as soon as I walked out. I thought it was destined to be another cheesy romcom with a predictable ending and terrible acting. I was wrong. Little did I know this was another Judd Apatow produced comedy and almost everything he's touched over the past three years has turned into pure gold including The 40 Year Old Virgin Knocked Up and Superbad. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is no exception. Jason Segal of How I Met your Mother fame stars as a lovable but lazy music composer for a CSIesque television drama. After his famous girlfriend Kristen Bell dumps him he decides to take a vacation to Hawaii to deal with it. Little does he know that his exgirlfriend is travelling to the same resort as him  with her new overlyflamboyant musician boyfriend in tow Russell Brand. Mila Kunis That 70's Show plays a receptionist at the resort and proves she can actually play a likable role. Kunis has great chemistry with Segal and their budding relationship is surprisingly one of the highlights of the movie. The script which was also written by Segal is consistently funny throughout and really hones in on the hilarious one liners and awkward situational humor that seem to be the strength of most Apatow movies. Segal has definitely elevated himself into a solid comic lead. You can't help but feel bad for the guy as things gradually go from bad to worse for him. That said Russell Brand who plays eccentric musician Aldous Snow steals every scene he's in. He plays a character in which the viewer is supposed to dislike but it's virtually impossible. Everything he does from his words to his facial expressions to his ridiculous body language is hilarious. Now I may only be high on this movie because I had exceptionally low expectations going in but it's definitely a solid comedy from start to finish. With the exception of having to see Segal's junk at least six or seven times it was a gem.".

Thus there is much in this picture that deeply moves me. I still can not listen to the theme music piece played by John Williams Cavatina without choking up and weeping.I identify much with the characters in this movie. I grew up in a very small town and come from a working class  Norwegian ScotsIrish English background. Two weeks out of high school and at the age of 17 I enlisted in the Army. Like the men in this movie I came from a tradition of serving one's country in the military. Both my brother two cousins and my future brotherinlaw also served in the Vietnam War.I identify with Michael played by Robert DeNiro in his sense of honor in going back to 'Nam and trying to bring back his buddy Nick. Additionally I admire Mike when he visits Steven in the VA hospital and brings him back home. Honor is as mentioned in the movie Rob Roy a gift a man gives to himself. Michael and the movie doesn't waste time on whether the war in Vietnam is right or wrong. Michael just does what he thinks is right with respect to his buddies. Ask any one who has served in the military and they will tell you that you're sense of commitment to your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment to your country.I do not see this movie as either pro or antiVietnam War. To me the movie portrays how war affects three individuals. It is a movie about character honor loyaltywhat you are when everything around you is falling apart. I will continue to see this movie many times as I hope that the values depicted in it will still be reflected albeit weakly in me.In closing I can not help to remember that the politically antiVietnam War movie Coming home starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight was also up for the same Oscars. When Jane Fonda was asked what movie would win the Academy award that year she sneeringly replied that she hoped it wasn't The Deer Hunter. In the years since Jon Voght has transitioned from being a Liberal to a Conservative. Parenthetically Jane Fonda has never apologized for her proViet Cong actions. At the age of 66 I am still proud that I served my country and volunteered for the US Army and the Vietnam War.".

	schema:reviewBody "One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot.There's that particularly infamous scene in The Deer Hunter that seems to remain more disturbing each time we view it when Michael Robert De Niro a Vietnam veteran tracks down a friend of his named Nicky Christopher Walken who never arrived home after the war and is eventually found in Saigon playing Russian Roulette for money his mind an utter mess. He is unable to fully remember Michael and refuses to return home and what proceeds in the following sequence is a haunting example of gutwrenching filmmaking.The Vietnam sequences take place midway through the movie serving as a connection between the beginning and the end both of which study the lives of the men and not the war around them. Michael Nicky and Steven John Savage are young Pennsylvanian miners drafted into the war. Steven has just gotten married to the love of his life but has little time to celebrate as he is shipped overseas with his friends. They eventually all find themselves taken hostage in a Vietnamese POW camp where their captors force them to play Russian Roulette. The rules of the game? Put a single bullet in a random chamber of a handgun spin it snap it raise it to your head squeeze the trigger and repeat these steps until there's only one man left standing.After a series of fortunate events Michael Nicky and Steven escape and make their way downriver. All three men are eventually rescued Nicky via helicopter and Michael and Steven later on. Steven's battered infected legs are amputated and he is left helpless in a wheelchair. Michael returns home as well only to find that Nicky is still back in Vietnam.

However as many film historians authors and critics have already pointed out the film is never meant to be a 100 accurate depiction of the events in Vietnam. It is not really a Vietnam War picture at all. Instead it is a focus on the aftermath of war and how damaging it can be both physically and mentally to its participants. Because of the era that The Deer Hunter was released in Vietnam was a recent event the focus of the nation and is therefore used as a more convenient  and relative  backdrop much like Apocalypse Now. Unlike Platoon this is not a movie relating specifically to the Vietnam War in fact less than a half an hour is devoted to the war scenes. It is a character study and accusations of racism  although perhaps justified to some extent  are hardly convincing as the film itself is not concerned with bashing the participants of the war as it is the war itself.It is the film's necessary setup that is often called long and boring and ironically unnecessary but this is essentially where the nature of each character is examined for the audience. To launch directly into the war sequences would be sloppy and we would have a harder time caring for the characters.

The Deer Hunter is similar in approach but reveals more background this would be a suitable prequel of sorts if the names had been changed.Over the years The Deer Hunter has surprisingly gained a fairly bad reputation  most of which stems back to the controversy surroundings its release and protested accolades. Director Michael Cimino's followup Heaven's Gate was an enormous flop bankrupting United Artists and he had a hard time finding work afterwards. His first feature film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot which starred Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges was a buddy road movie that was also a sign of things to come in Cimino' later features most notably the process of male bonding which is a huge primal element in this project. Cimino was an extremely talented and visionary director and it's a shame that the ambition of Heaven's Gate cost him his career.And furthermore despite the negativity surrounding The Deer Hunter it is still one of the finest works of American cinema a touching poignant and ultimately depressing film that asks us if the effects of war extend past the physical and into the realm of human mentality. Yes I think they do.".

	onyx:emotionText "One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot.There's that particularly infamous scene in The Deer Hunter that seems to remain more disturbing each time we view it when Michael Robert De Niro a Vietnam veteran tracks down a friend of his named Nicky Christopher Walken who never arrived home after the war and is eventually found in Saigon playing Russian Roulette for money his mind an utter mess. He is unable to fully remember Michael and refuses to return home and what proceeds in the following sequence is a haunting example of gutwrenching filmmaking.The Vietnam sequences take place midway through the movie serving as a connection between the beginning and the end both of which study the lives of the men and not the war around them. Michael Nicky and Steven John Savage are young Pennsylvanian miners drafted into the war. Steven has just gotten married to the love of his life but has little time to celebrate as he is shipped overseas with his friends. They eventually all find themselves taken hostage in a Vietnamese POW camp where their captors force them to play Russian Roulette. The rules of the game? Put a single bullet in a random chamber of a handgun spin it snap it raise it to your head squeeze the trigger and repeat these steps until there's only one man left standing.After a series of fortunate events Michael Nicky and Steven escape and make their way downriver. All three men are eventually rescued Nicky via helicopter and Michael and Steven later on. Steven's battered infected legs are amputated and he is left helpless in a wheelchair. Michael returns home as well only to find that Nicky is still back in Vietnam. Nicky's girlfriend back home Linda Meryl Street begins to fall in love with Michael but Michael soon remembers his promise to Nicky If I don't make it back don't leave me over there and travels over 2000 miles back into the middle of his own personal hell to find and rescue his best friend.

	schema:reviewBody "1978's The Deer Hunter is one of the more polarizing movies to come out during the 1970's. It was the first movie with the deeply controversial subject of the Vietnam War to both become a critical and commercial success. However there were several people who expressed dissent ranging from its portrayal of the Vietnam War to the controversial involvement of Russian roulette to the singing of God Bless America. I remember not being too impressed with the film the first time I viewed it. I felt it was too long and violent. Years later I am singing a different tune. It's a difficult film to sit through because of its violence and the effects of PTSD posttrauma syndrome. But it is a highly engaging and effective film and I regard it as one of the more influential American movies of the 1970's. Not the best but the most influential because there will be more successful films tackling the Vietnam War on the horizon.You can call this movie a symphony of some sort. I sort this film into three major segments. The first segment is the longest because of its lengthy and effective characterization. We meet three Pennsylvania factory workers Michael Robert De Niro Steven John Savage and Nick Christopher Walken. They enlisted in the army to serve in Vietnam. Steven decides to marry before going off to war and this wedding also serves as the farewell party. This section is eerily reminiscent of the opening act of The Godfather. There is lots of partying and dancing. And we essentially get to know these characters. These men are hard workers who get drunk at the party because they deserve a night for themselves. After the party the trio of friends along with another friend Stan John Cazale go into the mountains to hunt for deer for one last trip. Hence the title of the movie. I found this section to be incredibly effective in characterbuilding. Director Michael Cimino took his time with his part because it was important to understand these men before they go into the horrors of war.The second movement of our symphony is the actual war. Just like that with a loud noise the film instantly changes its tone. From the foggy mountains of Pennsylvania to the tropical war zone of Vietnam we go. In one of the most terrifying sequences ever made the three men are taken prisoner and are forced to play Russian roulette while their captors are betting who will win and who will die. Just seeing the men's faces as they are waiting their turn in the ratinfested cages are undeniably scary. One of the film's controversies is that roulette was not actually played in Vietnam. According to Cimino he read articles saying they did play roulette although any of this has not been confirmed. But it's one hell of a way to add tension to the movie. You can also take this as a symbol for the war overall. Roger Ebert puts it perfectly in his review Anything you can believe about the game about it's deliberately random violence about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it will apply it to the war as a whole. Essentially this violence stands for the war itself and what these men face. Now our final act of the symphony is what happens after the horrors of the prison camp. Michael becomes a prominent character here as he returns home and is welcomed as a hero by his townsfolk and his girlfriend Linda Meryl Streep. But Michael does not feel like a hero. Steven is in the hospital after losing his legs and Nick is somewhere in Vietnam still. Michael eventually goes back to find Nick who happened to take his roulette experiences to heart by playing this game professionally. This section is incredibly sad and moving as here we see what exactly war can do to strongwilled men. It was horrible to watch this transformation on screen. To see these characters we got to laugh with in the first part to seeing them play with death in the final act is sad to see. We also get to see an act of patriotism or is it? when the survivors join in a ragged rendition of God Bless America in the very end. This movie has a very strong cast although the only star at the time was Robert De Niro. De Niro instantly became the film's leader and he played Michael very well. He became a bona fide star after his work in The Godfather Part Two and he put that stardom to work here. Christopher Walken had some of the strongest scenes in the movie because of his involvement with the deadly game of Russian roulette. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest actresses ever to grace our screens and this was one of her first big roles. We end this paragraph with a sad note. This would be the last movie John Cazale would play because he was suffering from terminal cancer and he died before the film was released. He was very good as Stan but you can tell in the movie that he was really sick.Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a incredible movie about the horror of wars and it effective covers themes ranging from PTSD to male bonding and friendship. It was one of the first movies to successfully cover the Vietnam War although I'd say this film may not be the most accurate regarding the actual war. I do commend its effort on conveying the themes of general war though. This film was nominated for nine Oscars and it won five of them including Best Picture. Walken took home the statue for his amazing and tense performance as Nick. The film may be controversial and it may be hard to watch but it's one you'll remember forever. My Grade A".

People always comment on the Viet Nam scenes and it's true that they are as powerful and intense as any war scenes ever filmed.  The Russianroulette betting game in both its upriver and Saigon venues may be the most riveting shattering plot device ever invented as measured by the pounding of the heart. But it's the 'home front' scenes that stick with me through the years.  I think all the steel town scenes are nearly perfect untoppable.  And that very much includes the Eastern Orthodox wedding and its sequel.  When anyone tells me they were bored I just shake my head.  There's no arguing with short and shallow attention spans.  You're either capable of appreciating art or you're not.   I do have a quibble or two.  The deerhunting scenes looked like nowhere I've ever seen in Pennsylvania or anywhere else East of the Rockies.  I think Cimino deliberately picked an ethereal location above the clouds as a contrast to the steel town.  When John Cazale and the others get loaded and act like jerks it jars on Michael because they have brought the stupid distractions of ordinary life to an extraordinary place.  This would matter less if the 'genius loci' were not so strongly present in the other home front scenes. I wish he had used the soft green forested hills of Pennsylvania for the hunting.

	schema:reviewBody "Most young people today need to learn that Robert De Niro was not just  the person in Meet the Parents or The Adventures of Rocky and  Bullwinkle but he starred in films like The Deer Hunter which got him  to where he is today. Not only is he a great actor he always picks  good films to act in. And with a strong supporting cast also you  can't really go wrong with The Deer Hunter.  Michael De Niro Nick Christopher Walken and Steven John Savage  sign up to go to Vietnam. They leave after a farewell partywedding  party for Stanley and Angela Rutanya Alda. Once in the  midst of the war they are forced into playing Russian Roulette and  eventually they escape but none of them can forget the experiences  from the war.  It's sad to see that Michael Cimino fade from view because his  direction here is really memorable and it's what holds the film  together. There's about 70 minutes in the beginning of the film that  has nothing to do with the rest of the film but it gets us to know  these three main characters and it seems like you wouldn't care if  they even went to Vietnam because you certainly were intrigued by  these three people. And once they're in the perils of war you feel  enough for these three basic people to get through the war.  The Russian Roulette scenes are harrowing even when it's a complete  stranger who has the gun to their head. I read that to get the tension  on set a live bullet was put into the gun but it was checked to make  sure that it wasn't the one about to be shot. And since you've known  these people for 90 minutes already you obviously didn't want them to  die making them all the more nervous.  The Deer Hunter is quite unlike another great Vietnam film Full Metal  Jacket. While FMJ just showed the immediate results this movie showed  the results immediately and in the future back at home. This helped  make everything seem more realistic which it was. For each of the  three main characters the war has changed them greatly and none for  the better.  De Niro is great but the stand out here is Walken who accurately  takes his role and makes it into something memorable. Thankfully he  won best supporting actor. Meryl Streep was nominated as a supporting  character deservedly. However this movie is not all about the acting  it's about the feeling you get. As one character says 'I don't know  how I feel.' That's exactly how you'll feel after seeing this  tourdeforce.  My rating 1010  Rated R for strong language and violence.".

	schema:headline " Touching drama about the ruin of a group of men's friendship by war";
	schema:reviewBody "The Deer Hunter is not a film about the Vietnam war as it is wrongly said in many cases.The Deer Hunter is a film tells the story of 3 friends within about 56 years during which their friendship is repeatedly put to the test.It is primarily a picture of the contemporary life of a group of people around 30 living in a small American town during the Vietnam war.The first hour of the film portrays the every day life of three friends Mike De Niro Steven Savage and Nick Walken who look forward to Steve's wedding but at the same time have to prepare for their commitment in Vietnam. The main actors above all De Niro and Walken perfectly picture the character's inner conflict between their easygoing home town life and the forthcoming assignment in Vietnam. Despite this conflict the characters don't show their concerns to their environment.Particularly Nick is worried about him and his friends leaving his home town and perhaps never coming back but he only tells his best friend Mike of his thoughts who is much more resolute and sees their engagement as a strong masculine act.Cimino manages to show the simple irrationality of young men going to a senseless war from which they might never return for the only purpose of glory and approval and abandoning their settled and happy life for it. The spectator just can't understand why those young men voluntarily sign for the army and give up everything they have. The passage from the smalltownidyll to the war cruelty is greatly pictured. Cimino does not show the three friends' way to Vietnam or the training he immediately switches from a happy gettogether to the cruel war captivity of the Vietcong. This passage perfectly underlines the contrast and the inexplicability of the three men's actions.Although the passage that is set in Vietnam is only about one third of the whole film long the war is omnipresent at any time which is probably the best benefit of the whole film Cimino does not need to bomb the spectator with pictures of crying children mutilated soldiers or desert battlefields in order to illustrate the cruelty of war. Far from it! The changed behavior of all characters after the friends' returns tell more about wars' capability of changing someone's life than anything else.And the fact that the many dreams that these three friends had before they went to Vietnam didn't come true because of their longing for recognition by becoming an acclaimed veteran can even pluck your heartstrings.Cimino's great directing and the cast's awesome acting provide for a touching and honest drama about the friendship of a group of young men that is destroyed by the Vietnam war.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of the first two American films about the Vietnam war with a priceless artistic weight the Deer Hunter wins hands down over Apocalypse Now 1979 although Francis Ford Coppola's work is very potent too.But would it be judicious to pigeonhole Michael Cimino's work in the category of the war movie? Unlike Coppola's visual nightmare only the central part takes place in Vietnam and the filmmaker barely shoots one fight sequence before Mike Robert De Niro Nick Christopher Walken and Stevie John Savage are prisoners of the enemy and are forced to play Russian roulette in the notorious unbearable scene. Actually the Deer Hunter is a film straddling two movie genres the war movie and the social drama. Rather than shooting a political film Cimino chose to represent us the deadly impact this nightmarish war had on an American community whose hopes and values disappeared.Dividing his work in three parts before during after and thanks to symbolical images scenes or even eloquent details Cimino used and honed his own cinematographic language to set out his stalls and the result can only command respect and admiration. Each sequence could be separately taken and carefully studied like the representation of the humdrum but reassuring living standards of the bluecollars with their everyday rituals Cimino's obsession with rites and customs revolving around factory bar friends and hunting you have to admire the startling contrast between the dirty little town and the gorgeous wild landscapes. Archetypal sequences that epitomize life and it reaches its height in the famous unusually long wedding sequence. Perhaps Cimino wanted to stretch this sequence to make his characters take advantage of this rapture moment. But even during this state of bliss that lives inside them the imminent tragedy ominously lurks Mike and Nick gently laugh at an officer who remains dumb and when Stevie and his wife have to drink in a dish some drops fall on her wedding dress. This sequence also epitomizes the polar opposite to the sequence of the Russian roulette in which death is just around the corner. After the war when Mike comes back to the small town he's completely altered. Before a devotee of deer hunting after his traumatizing experience he can't kill one. He's unable to talk about about what he went through and for his sidekicks the experience of a war like this one is incomprehensible. Cimino eschews classical predictable storytelling and hasn't recourse to psychological study. Nearly everything occurs in gestures and looks while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. Besides during the whole movie the topic of the war is barely mentioned by the characters. A lyrical whiff blows on the film dovetailed by Cimino's astounding directing.Cimino was consumed with ambition and went at it hammer and tongs to get his crew completely involved in his project. He was hard on his actors Robert De Niro has often said that the Deer Hunter was his most grueling role to date and was obsessed with absolute control. But the efforts weren't vain at all and gave a heartfelt invaluable yardstick in war movie even American cinema which reached the streets when America rose from its ruins. It was also the beginning of the end for Cimino a filmmaker ahead of his time and on the fringe of cinematographic trends.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of you after reading my title are already going to be upset. I do consider this to be the best film ever made about war. I do not look at this film being about the Vietnam War. I look at this film being about war Period.I think this film is as excellent as it is for one good reason showing the effects of war. True we see the films where men are shaped by war what events make them who they are and how the events of war transform them. It is mainly about what the war has done to them. The Deer Hunter takes a bigger step back from that and shows the entire character transformation. It does not just show the transformation of a soldier but also the transformation as a civilian. You spend a good 40 minutes in the Deer Hunter getting to know the main characters and getting a feel for their personalities. The first 40 minutes is about character development and almost getting an attachment to those characters. This makes their transformation more effective for the viewer and they almost feel for the character and what they are going through. Than those characters get thrown into war and you see the events that change them. The things they had to experience as a soldier. And than most importantly we see the changes in their characters after the war. And we do not just see the changes in the soldiers we see the changes that their friends and lovers undergo as a result of the war. We are not just looking at one soldier we are looking at a network of friends and how they are changed due to the war. Even those who did not go to war are still effected. And the fact all the characters are from a small town makes it that much more powerful. The Deer Hunter is a powerful film about how war effects everybody not just the soldiers involved in it.The cast is terrific! Robert De Niro John Cazale John Savage Meryll Streep and Christopher Walken. Need I say more. Christopher Walken won an Oscar for best supporting actor in this film. The script is beautifully written and the movie is filmed perfectly. I can find nothing wrong with anything about this movie. I mean it did win 5 Oscars in 1978 including Best Picture and Best Director for Michael Cimino.This movie is emotionally powerful. I can not say this film is accurate about war I can only give my opinion and take from the film what I can. I am an 18year old teen who has an almost complete control over his emotions. This film brought me the closest to tears I have ever been by a movie. It is an absolute masterpiece. This is one of the greatest films ever made. Take the time to watch this film it is a classic that hits you the hardest emotionally.".

I figured at the time I was too young to appreciate it. I saw it years later and was STILL bored.For startersit's too long3 hours. The wedding sequence at the beginning goes on and on and ON. You learn nothing more about the characters than you could have in about 10 minutes. Even after they return home it moves slowly. The Russian roulette sequences which were VERY hotly debated never happened in reality. There's no proof at all that it ever happened. Also one character makes a living out of playing Russian roulette???? Come on! The Vietnamese are portrayed as victims or monstersvery black and white. No shadings of character. With the sole exceptions of DeNiro Savage and Meryl Strepp the acting sucks. SeriouslyHOW did Walken get an Oscar for this? DeNiro should have gotten it.

But this movie just didn't make sense.The editing is terrible.. The wedding scene just goes on and on. I suspect it was the best footage they had shot and they just couldn't bring themselves to cut any of it. Then the war starts.. We see a brief helicopter scene and next thing we know our heroes are in a POWcamp? Excuse me?! What just happened? After that point the movie just gets progressively worse.The plot is just outrageous. You don't have to be a statistician to understand that Walken having a successful career in Russian roulette is absurd.. His successful streak ending just the moment his buddy comes looking for him makes it even more silly. I guess many people see good symbolism for war in the Russian roulette theme and thats part of why this movie scores so high... but come on you cant reduce the Vietnam war to something that never happened in it..This movie insults my intelligence! Its a silly Hollywood action flick posing as a meaningful war drama.. and quite possibly the most overrated movie of all times!".

You don't have to be a statistician to understand that Walken having a successful career in Russian roulette is absurd.. His successful streak ending just the moment his buddy comes looking for him makes it even more silly. I guess many people see good symbolism for war in the Russian roulette theme and thats part of why this movie scores so high... but come on you cant reduce the Vietnam war to something that never happened in it..This movie insults my intelligence! Its a silly Hollywood action flick posing as a meaningful war drama.. and quite possibly the most overrated movie of all times!";

	schema:reviewBody "I hired The Deer Hunter after a number of people recommended it to me. I thought they were serious. I honestly cannot believe this film is so highly regarded when nothing actually happens. There is three whole hours of nothing. I haven't been so full of hatred for a film since I was forced to watch the Piano another very boring and overrated wasteofspace.Alright it started out looking good and interesting showing the very harsh conditions of a Pennsylvania steel mill. It captured my interest. That was in the first five minutes.Then we are treated to about 55 minutes of a mindnumbingly boring wedding scene. God knows what happened to the editor but he must have been drunk or on strike or something because what should have been a five or tenminute brief explanation became a drawnout and longwinded dance scene! Next there's maybe fifteen minutes of the main characters going out into the wilderness and murdering a few animals for their own entertainment.Now we finally get into the war scenes. When I hired this film I was led to believe that it was in fact a war movie. No it really isn't. Vietnam may be involved and feature partway through the story but this is definitely NOT a war movie. All we get is a few seconds of Viet Cong brutality then a flamethrower and some American choppers dropping off a squad or two of wellequipped soldiers.All of a sudden we are transported into some kind of Viet Cong mobile water torture station where unfortunate American and other Vietnamese probably South Vietnamese soldiers are forced to play Russian Roulette for entertainment and gambling purposes. They get slapped around thrown into ratinfested halfsubmerged pits and generally mistreated by the evil VC.Don't get me wrong the first Russian Roulette scene was very tense and I did hope that Robert DeNiro would blow a hole in the head of the VC leader.However this is all that happened in the film. After that nothing at all happened. I gave up just before the twohour mark. It was just too much tripe for me. I could not believe it was rated so highly. Nothing happened in two goddamn hours! A longwinded wedding a boring hunting scene and a very poor attempt at a war scene.I stopped watching after two hours. The garbage was finally beginning to get to me. So to all those who adore and blindly praise this film I have to ask you Did you actually watch it or were you just jumping on the EveryAcademyAwardWinnerMustBeGood train? It may well have been a great cinematic work in 1978 but today it certainly doesn't stand up against other older war movies.If you haven't watched The Deer Hunter yet...don't bother. Instead go watch a decent Vietnam film  such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. Otherwise you're just wasting three hours of your life.".

Actually from some other comments it looks like some other people have seen the elephant but think that it fits well into the room.My case rests on the fact that this is meant to be a serious movie but I have had less trouble suspending disbelief with the XMen than with this movie if the main characters had escaped from the Vietcongs using their superpowers that would have left me less uncomfortable than what I have seen in this movie.Some other IMDb reviewers have mentioned the extreme improbability of Nick making a living out of playing Russian roulette professionally. But the weirdness does not end there because his buddy Michael returns to Vietnam to rescue him from his insanity. How? why by playing Russian roulette with him of course! You might think that this is the action least likely to bring the two of them back together to the USA  and you would be right because Nick shoots himself during the game. The way it looks to me is that Michael unwittingly ends Nick's successful career.The earlier escape scene is also absurd. It makes sense that Michael and Nick plan to escape by using the gun they are supposed to play Russian roulette with. It makes sense that they figure they need three bullets to escape. It might even make sense that before starting to fire at the Vietcongs they want to be sure that the next chamber has a bullet in it although the way they make sure would mean a very likely failure for their plan in real life. But why did the Vietcongs let them keep a gun with three bullets ready to be fired? The escape plan boils down to hoping that the Vietcongs will let them keep a loaded gun if they survive Russian roulette. Nothing wrong with trying but the scriptwriters should not have allowed them to survive both the odds of Russian roulette and the odds that at least one of the Vietcongs would use his brain.The Russian roulette scenes are surreal. Watching them I could feel no suspense whatsoever in spite of the characters screaming themselves hoarse I simply could not suspend my disbelief. I had the uncomfortable feeling of missing something perhaps they were playing some other game that looks a lot like Russian roulette except that the person with the gun knows whether the next chamber has a cartridge in it. That might help to explain both the escape from the Vietcongs and Nick's survival as a professional player but it would introduce other difficulties such as Nick shooting himself.Now all of the above comments are about the Russian roulette scenes and it might be said that i am overlooking the rest of the movie that this is not a war movie but a movie about the trauma of war. Maybe so but suppose that you had seen the movie without the Russian roulette scenes would you think that the movie could be improved by adding a few silly scenes?For me the addition of silly scenes means that i must take away one or two points from my rating. My rating is already pretty low because I don't get the rest of the movie and in addition because I had high expectations for this movie and was disappointed so i am giving the minimum rating to the movie as a whole.".

We have also Platoon that represented somewhat of the same thing that The Deer Hunter did as well but this one came first and was a great version. It showed the intense horror and ultimate change effect on the men that fought in Vietnam. At first I admit I was a little bored because the beginning is a little long and felt unnecessary but then I realized later in the film how much that developed the characters and understood their friendships and how they relate.Robert De Niro seems to be the strongest one of the group his name is Mike. He has a lot of guts but he also seems to care mostly about himself he later on proves that after finally just letting go with his kept up emotions he must take care of his friends as well. Christopher Walken he's a baby in here! He's such a terrific actor and he did so well by portraying innocence in his role and the ultimate insanity of his character. He and Robert were amazing they were just so believable and worked so well together.This was the best picture of 1978 so far I cannot really judge one wither or not it deserved the reward. But it is an awesome movie and I would highly recommend it for anyone. The lines are just F A! D I mean memorable! This does deserve to be on the top 250 good job to other IMDb users! 1010".

He leaves the closet and New York opens a camera shop that becomes the salon for San Francisco's growing gay community and organizes gays' purchasing power to build political alliances. He runs for office with lover Scott Smith as his campaign manager. Victory finally comes on the same day Dan White wins in the city's conservative district. The rest of the film sketches Milk's relationship with White and the 1978 fight against a statewide initiative to bar gays and their supporters from public school jobs.";

His awareness is filled with truth and innocence he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't accomplished anything.

Josh Brolin as the disturbed Dan White is another standout in a complex and remarkable performance. No cheap shots here. Diego Luna Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also terrific as the boys around Harvey but it is James Franco who truly gets under your skin.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Milk a while back I was really looking forward to it because I had written a paper in my history class on Harvey Milk. We were learning about movements in the 60's and 70's as a straight female I saw one of my friends struggling with his sexuality and how hard it was for society his friends his own family excepting him for who he was. I wanted to find out more on the history of how we had either moved forward or backwards when it came to rights for homosexuals. Reading Harvey Milk's story was sad but extremely inspirational and looking at what people said about him he seemed like the most lovable guy in the world. He was funny charming and just a wonderful person to be around it was extremely sad to find out how his life ended and over something so stupid. Milk is one of the best films of 2008 it was made with great taste and Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime playing the infamous Harvey Milk.Unsatisfied with his life and in need of a change Harvey Milk decides to move to San Francisco with his boyfriend in hoping of a better acceptance. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley a working class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once IrishCatholic neighborhood Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones. After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in the United States. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White who is politically and socially conservative has a difficult relationship with Milk. He has a growing resentment for Milk largely due to the attention paid to Milk by the press and his colleagues. After working tirelessly against Proposition 6 Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. The increasingly unstable White is in favor of a supervisor pay raise but does not get much support and shortly after supporting the proposition resigns from the board. He later changes his mind and asks the city to rescind his decision. Mayor Moscone denies his request after having been lobbied by Milk to not reinstate White leading to some disturbing acts of violence.I HIGHLY recommend that you watch Milk this film was extremely moving and really makes you think before you say something stupid because someone else is different from you not just sexually but in general. It really breaks your heart to see how hard it must be for people who are different to express themselves and to be rejected by society. Sean plays Harvey with the love and compassion that the real Harvey would respect. We also have some terrific supporting actors James Franco Josh Brolin Emile Hirsch Diego Luna and Victor Garber. Milk was one of the best films of 2008 watch it learn from it and remember do onto others as you would do onto yourself.1010".

Van Sant uses live footage between scenes which reminds one of how much harsher the world once was to people who were 'different'. The writing is stupendous and the dialogues are especially effective. The portrayal of the characters are very human. There is no hero or villain. There are just humans with flaws humans fighting for what they believe in. Van Sant sets a tense and chaotic tone right from the beginning. The 70s atmosphere is well created through makeup and costumes. The use of brownish tinted light may arise nostalgia. It is two remarkable performances that make 'Milk' stand out Sean Penn's very accurate and nuanced portrayal of Harvey Milk and Josh Brolin's layered portrayal of a complex Dan White. I doubt 'Milk' would have been effective enough if it weren't for such strong acting. The director deserves mention for his brilliant work.

I was very gratified that no attempt is made to be delicate about Harvey Milk's personality either his sex life or his outsized ego which perhaps ironically for some makes him all the more heroic. The finest political film I think I've ever seen. It does more than dramatize a strong true story it captures convincingly the truth about a whole political movement. One that's as freshly active as today's headlines Prop 6 or Prop 8  does it ever end? There is an ease and familiarity to the scene  to the historical period and place  with very few small anachronisms as far as I could tell. This is also the most assured work of Gus Van Sant a genuine film artist who here delivers a complete drama with real visual style and brazen wit. The blending of documentary footage is the most seamless I can remember seeing anywhere. The crowd scenes are remarkable and all of the location shooting miraculously right. For a couple of fast fast hours I felt as though I had spent a couple of days  hilarious intense inspiring days  immersed in 1970s San Francisco. This movie does what all movies should do. See it.".

The  stunning beautiful Gerry is still his greatest film in my  estimation but Van Sant's return to nearunanimous mainstream acclaim  and some level of boxoffice success in Milk actually isn't too far  off as far as Van Sant's filmography goes. Some may express  disappointment that Milk is a 'conventional' biopic but it really  isn't conventional at all.  True this could have been the sort of melancholy meditation Van Sant  has been going for in recent years but the best argument against that  is that Harvey Milk is not that figure. He's not going to sit quietly  and contemplate life. Perhaps he might have before we meet him on the  eve of his fortieth birthday but from that point onwards Harvey Milk  was a man of action of words a man with the powerful ability to rally  people for a cause and not only gay people. He had a rare sort of  energy and an energetic film was needed to tell his story. Most  impressive perhaps about Van Sant's direction and Dustin Lance Black's  screenplay is that there are just as many of those melancholic  meditative moments as needed just enough to make this a compelling  character study and not a truly conventional biopic with a hero rather  than a main character. The photography here is also simply gorgeous  and the camera work is outstanding particularly the handheld work  during the rally scenes. It really succeeds in transporting you to  1970's San Francisco.  Sean Penn has frequently annoyed me. I respect his abilities but  reserve the right to express my subjective annoyance at what I perceive  as sometimes hilarious overacting. When I found out that he was going  to play Harvey Milk I was nervous since I have admired Harvey Milk  ever since I was first exposed to him through the Rob Epstein  documentary The Times of Harvey Milk which is still the best movie  made about Harvey Milk with Milk running a close second and I doubt  Bryan Singer's Mayor of Castro Street will be a serious contender. I  had no reason to be nervous. Penn's performance is one of the most  vibrant fascinating brilliant performances in years and one of the  most convincing and human. It's not a Harvey Milk impression it's more  than just that but he truly does capture the 'essence' of Milk if you  will.  It is pointless to make a political statement in the body of this  review so take this as one only if you have to it is disgusting that  in 2008 gay rights still a matter of political debate. This film is a  powerful beautiful tribute to the rights movement. It's not a  Democrats vs. Republicans film. In fact it makes it clear that Harvey  Milk was once a Republican and sneaks in footage of Reagan in strong  opposition of Proposition 6. Those short scenes should provoke some  thought and discussion. They certainly did for me and the people I saw  the film with. Ultimately however the film is not about an 'issue'.  Harvey Milk says to Dan White that it's not about jobs or rights that  it's their lives that they were and still are fighting for. Ultimately  this film is about people not about issues not about policy. It's  about people who were told they were sick who were told they were  wrong who were told they would corrupt society who were accused of  being pedophiles and attempting to 'recruit' children to homosexuality.  The film is about Harvey Milk a mere human being who did more for  freedom and tolerance than he probably ever understood.  I am not a candidate I am part of a movement. The movement is the  candidate.   Unfortunately the fight against the rampant discrimination against and  hatred of homosexuals is still not over. Milk's movement lives on and  grows stronger every day. He would be proud of that and devastated  that our society has not truly progressed but only learned to mask its  intolerance and hatred.".

After a while...it's just Harvey. I could go on about the supporting cast...all very solid in their own way. James Franco Scotty stands out as well....showing his range and willingness to expand as an actor.Kudos all the way around...I see this film getting several nods at Oscar time.Additionally...Rob Epstein's Oscarwinning 1984 documentary The Times of Harvey Milk is a definite must for anyone who enjoyed this film. I watched it right after Milk  and am still impressed with how affecting it is.".

There were no longshots or minutes at a time without dialog etc.I've really never thought much of Sean Penn before but with this role I expect him to sweep up the awards. Everyone was great in their parts but he did such an excellent job in portraying the Harvey Milk that I have seen before in clips and documentaries. They did not make out Milk to be a choirboy which was one thing I was afraid was going to happen. This story seems long overdue in it's telling but so completely relevant to today's news.I expect as the movie hits theaters this will cause quite a stir with both sides using it as fodder in their fight. I expect the ratings will reflect this as there are already people giving it 0's who obviously did not attend the premiere. I don't think it deserves a 10 either but is much much closer to that end. Looked at objectively it is a sometimes tearful sometimes funny movie that was put together masterfully".

	schema:reviewBody "'Milk' is another powerful mainstream American movie about gay experience. It seems destined to have the same kind of influence on the public mind as Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' and Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' both of which were prominent at Oscar time. Like them this isn't a great film but it's an important one.In 'Milk' the topic widens to gay politics and gay rights. These are not 'issues' Harvey Milk tells a major opponent these are our lives we're fighting for.  His own life peaked at a transformative place and time for homosexuals San Francisco in the 1970's. A San Francisco Supervisor assassinated by the disgruntled conservative Supervisor Dan White in 1978 Milk was the first openly gay man to elected to public office in California. He was a gay activist who gained fame and political clout. A homosexual with powerthat's scary Milk tells Mayor Mosconean ally with whom he sparred and who was assassinated with him.If he hadn't been killed early in his political career Milk might have traded his jocular title of Mayor of Castro Street the city's predominantly gay district for the formal one of Mayor of San Francisco. Dan White himself predicted this.While Milk sought the whole city's attention with a seemingly trivial causea pooper scooper law forcing citizens to clean up after their dogs he has come to represent a profile in couragea man willing to face up to Orange County bigots on their own turf who insisted all gays must come out of the closet to unite in strength. The film doesn't idealize the man his private life is obviously messy and despite his preaching he was in the closet to his own parents. His lover leaves him and a new Latino boyfriend Diego Luna is totally unstable.Every gay advance seems to bring on a backlash. After the 1969 Stonewall Riots alluded to in news footage as Milk opens more gay men and lesbians were out and proud but Anita Bryant the Florida orange juice advertiser and rightwing Christian gay basher was on the rampage campaigning for measures all over the country to remove gay rights. In California in 1978 one of her many causes was the Briggs Initiative Proposition 6 which would have mandated firing all the state's gay teachers.Today while the election of an AfricanAmerican as President makes the US look more friendly toward minorities antigay measures are still on ballots in many states at election times. On the same day that Obama was elected Californian gay people saw the passage of Proposition 8 put over by Mormon money to outlaw gay marriage in the state.Leaving behind the hermetic personal wavelength of his best film 'My Own Private Idaho' and the stylized elegance of his recent quartet of films Van Sant returns to a conventional mode closer to his 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Finding Forrester'but this time with more scope and more commitment to taking a stand as a gay man with a wide audience. The writer for the film was the former Mormon Justin Lance Black writer for several gayrelated films and the TV series about a polygamist Mormon Big Love. Harvey Milk a nicely modulated Sean Penn first appears recording a tape testament in his final year of life a scene that bookends the film. Penn's noted for emotionally overwrought roles but his Harvey Milk is someone who rarely loses his cool or his sense of humor even when he meets the hostile Briggs or regularly has to deal with his clueless inept opponent Dan White a fine Josh Brolin. Milk mocked the rightwingers' fiction that homosexuals are pedophiles who want to proselytize youththat gays are made not bornby opening public addresses with My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you. It's a line often repeated in the film.The movie as is the way with conventional biopics paints its subject's life in broad strokes. He meets his young lover Scott Smith an appealing James Franco while a corporate drone in New York. They decide to start a new life in San Francisco and open a camera shop together on Castro Street. Before long Milk is in the thick of political activity talking to Teamsters and cutting off his beard and pony tail and donning suit and tie to meet the general public.Milk emerges as a true politician. Moscone compares him to Boss Tweed. Through leading a successful boycott of Coors beer for the Teamsters he forges strong links with labor. Scenes are crowded with political coworkers and resident cute boys.Most of all the movie is a picture of community organizing and campaign management. This is told in broad stroke too but there are many historically specific personalities. Milk ran for office many times before redistricting made a clear win possible. Scotty is his manager till he can't bear another losing campaign and moves out. Next Milk recruits a cocky young runaway and street hustler Cleve Jones Emile Hirsch who claims he can get a thousand gay men on the street on demand and also boasts I don't do losing. With his new wellconnected lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg Alison Pill he secures endorsements from the Bay Guardian and the Chronicle and he wins handily.It's unusual for a mainstream film to get so much into the practical details of local politics.

	onyx:emotionText "'Milk' is another powerful mainstream American movie about gay experience. It seems destined to have the same kind of influence on the public mind as Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' and Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' both of which were prominent at Oscar time. Like them this isn't a great film but it's an important one.In 'Milk' the topic widens to gay politics and gay rights. These are not 'issues' Harvey Milk tells a major opponent these are our lives we're fighting for.  His own life peaked at a transformative place and time for homosexuals San Francisco in the 1970's. A San Francisco Supervisor assassinated by the disgruntled conservative Supervisor Dan White in 1978 Milk was the first openly gay man to elected to public office in California. He was a gay activist who gained fame and political clout. A homosexual with powerthat's scary Milk tells Mayor Mosconean ally with whom he sparred and who was assassinated with him.If he hadn't been killed early in his political career Milk might have traded his jocular title of Mayor of Castro Street the city's predominantly gay district for the formal one of Mayor of San Francisco. Dan White himself predicted this.While Milk sought the whole city's attention with a seemingly trivial causea pooper scooper law forcing citizens to clean up after their dogs he has come to represent a profile in couragea man willing to face up to Orange County bigots on their own turf who insisted all gays must come out of the closet to unite in strength. The film doesn't idealize the man his private life is obviously messy and despite his preaching he was in the closet to his own parents. His lover leaves him and a new Latino boyfriend Diego Luna is totally unstable.Every gay advance seems to bring on a backlash. After the 1969 Stonewall Riots alluded to in news footage as Milk opens more gay men and lesbians were out and proud but Anita Bryant the Florida orange juice advertiser and rightwing Christian gay basher was on the rampage campaigning for measures all over the country to remove gay rights. In California in 1978 one of her many causes was the Briggs Initiative Proposition 6 which would have mandated firing all the state's gay teachers.Today while the election of an AfricanAmerican as President makes the US look more friendly toward minorities antigay measures are still on ballots in many states at election times. On the same day that Obama was elected Californian gay people saw the passage of Proposition 8 put over by Mormon money to outlaw gay marriage in the state.Leaving behind the hermetic personal wavelength of his best film 'My Own Private Idaho' and the stylized elegance of his recent quartet of films Van Sant returns to a conventional mode closer to his 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Finding Forrester'but this time with more scope and more commitment to taking a stand as a gay man with a wide audience. The writer for the film was the former Mormon Justin Lance Black writer for several gayrelated films and the TV series about a polygamist Mormon Big Love. Harvey Milk a nicely modulated Sean Penn first appears recording a tape testament in his final year of life a scene that bookends the film. Penn's noted for emotionally overwrought roles but his Harvey Milk is someone who rarely loses his cool or his sense of humor even when he meets the hostile Briggs or regularly has to deal with his clueless inept opponent Dan White a fine Josh Brolin. Milk mocked the rightwingers' fiction that homosexuals are pedophiles who want to proselytize youththat gays are made not bornby opening public addresses with My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you. It's a line often repeated in the film.The movie as is the way with conventional biopics paints its subject's life in broad strokes. He meets his young lover Scott Smith an appealing James Franco while a corporate drone in New York. They decide to start a new life in San Francisco and open a camera shop together on Castro Street. Before long Milk is in the thick of political activity talking to Teamsters and cutting off his beard and pony tail and donning suit and tie to meet the general public.Milk emerges as a true politician. Moscone compares him to Boss Tweed. Through leading a successful boycott of Coors beer for the Teamsters he forges strong links with labor. Scenes are crowded with political coworkers and resident cute boys.Most of all the movie is a picture of community organizing and campaign management. This is told in broad stroke too but there are many historically specific personalities. Milk ran for office many times before redistricting made a clear win possible. Scotty is his manager till he can't bear another losing campaign and moves out. Next Milk recruits a cocky young runaway and street hustler Cleve Jones Emile Hirsch who claims he can get a thousand gay men on the street on demand and also boasts I don't do losing. With his new wellconnected lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg Alison Pill he secures endorsements from the Bay Guardian and the Chronicle and he wins handily.It's unusual for a mainstream film to get so much into the practical details of local politics. At the same time Jack is jealous of Scott and Cleve and moving toward a meltdown and Dan White having his own more dangerous meltdown is waiting in the wings.As a San Franciscan I wish the atmosphere of the tragic finale had been properly amplified by a horrified awareness of the Jim Jones massacre the news of which had emerged barely a week before White shot Moscone and Milk. But otherwise this stands as an essential piece of gay and California history and Van Sant's fluent lively film couldn't come at a better time.";

	schema:headline " Its not about winning its about making a statement.";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I'm not sure if this movie will win anything but it certainly made a statement. Milk is about the first openly gay person Harvey Milk to be elected to office in America. Milk does a great job in putting face to the gay rights movement which is sorely needed.The acting was superb by the cast all around starting at the top with Sean Penn. As the film wore on Sean Penn became Harvey Milk. It was not just a portrayal he gave it was a complete absorption of the man himself. Penn gave a very smart witty and inspiring performance which carried the film throughout. Josh Brolin gave a very convincing supporting performance as Dan White who is one of Harvey Milk's colleagues. The depth that Brolin gave to his portrayal raised some questions about who Dan White really is. If in fact he is a good man or a bad man if he is corrupt or honorable or even if he is straight or homosexual. Brolin once again proves to be one of the most overlooked actors in these past few years. Emile Hirsch always lights up the screen and continues to do so in here. James Franco though was quite a surprise to watch. I usually can't stand to watch Franco in any type of role but he proved that he can take on serious roles. This movie might be the statement Franco needed to make.The writing and directing was very solid overall allowing a greatly assembled cast to shine in so many aspects and ways. What was done in such a great way was the editing. Specifically the editing of archival footage into the movie. Most of the time I find it a bit distracting or annoying when archival footage is used but in here it was a strength. It was perfectly implemented into the movie giving the feeling that you could take the movie more seriously as a telling of a true story rather than just a movie.Milk was certainly one of the best of 2008 but we will have to see if it can stand the test of time. It made a pretty nice statement but can it win enough hearts and minds to support the gay rights movement like Harvey Milk would have wanted?".

You read the article and it said that a San Francisco City Supervisor named Harvey Milk was also killed by another supervisor Dan White.What I didn't know was how much Harvey Milk reflected my own life. A former Goldwater Republican and closeted gay man he moved to San Francisco and affected a revolution. That was me and three years later I came out and started doing my own thing for the same righteous cause Milk gave his life for.Milk was not the first openly gay person elected to public office. Elaine Noble and Allan Spears were serving in state legislatures when Milk finally was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Milk was not a single elected official in a large body of legislators. He became the focus of stopping a rollback of our rights that the newly empowered religious right was seeking to do and God help us still seeks to do. San Francisco no longer is THE gay city as it was in Harvey Milk's last eight years of his life. So many places now have GLBT rights laws so many have created their own gay culture and network. Still all of us owe so much to Harvey Milk and his circle who would not back down.A few days ago I saw Sean Penn in Bad Boys and to see him 25 years later as Harvey Milk it's hard to believe the breadth of work that he's done as a player. There's a nomination in this for Best Actor and maybe a second one to go with the one Penn won for Dead Man Walking. You are so taken with his performance that you forget and think you're watching a hidden newsreel of the life of Harvey Milk.Josh Brolin might very well bring home an Oscar for the uptight Dan White the assassin. What's extraordinary about Brolin's performance is that White is such an ordinary man trapped with a set of values that taught him to despise anything different than him. There's some suggestion that White was a latent case and that might have been the ultimate reason for his terrible acts. I've seen that happen often enough in my life.In my working days before retirement in 2002 I was the only openly gay person at the New York State Crime Victims Board working there and still am sad to say. Harvey Milk was brought to political activism by someone he knew being targeted for hate crime homicide which was never solved. In the more enlightened times of the Eighties and Nineties these things still go too often unpunished. Like Harvey these incidents were my reason for involvement.Watching Milk and inner circle many of whom went on to do great things in the Gay Rights movement I envied them. I certainly put my years in still do. But I would have given anything to have been involved from the beginning. They have tragic memories but also wonderful stories to tell about a cause bigger than themselves.And for that reason this review of this wonderful film is dedicated to a gay rights pioneer whom I knew and who recently passed away. Eleanor Cooper did her activism as an emigrant from Tennessee. She dedicated her life to making the world better for her GLBT brothers and sisters for more than 30 years in New York City. She was a prime leader in the passage of New York City's gay rights law. She was unflagging optimist and never lost faith that with education and reason people would get it about us. Her optimism was infectious buoyed many a spirit in bad times political and personal.Harvey Milk said that he had not really done anything he was truly proud of at the age of 40 just before moving from New York to San Francisco. If he did nothing else he gave hope and encouragement to untold numbers of young gay people that you're not worthless that you had a mission on this earth to make the best life you can for yourself and for your brothers and sisters. The best scene in the film is Milk talking to a young kid from Minnesota who was contemplating suicide and who might very well have done it as too many have.The young man's name was Paul. And this review and this film is and should also be dedicated to all the Pauls and Paulas out there who are not going to accept a second class life from ignorant people. Not any place on this globe.".

	schema:headline " Yet another bland biopic";
	schema:reviewBody "Milk isn't a terrible movieit's not even a bad moviebut it's nowhere near the level of gay masterpiece I hoped it would be. It's a conventional unambiguous rallying cry with no real impact.Gus Van Sant has done some very original highly stylized downright weird films in the past decade. My Own Private Idaho was Shakespeare's world populated by gay prostitutes with still life sex scenes and split screens and overthetop dialogue Psycho was a more surreal and more scandalous shotforshot replay of the Hitchcock original Elephant was a hyperrealistic photograph of teenage violence starring noname high school actors and so on. His most conventional film was Good Will Hunting but that at least was moving and had momentum as well as a terrific soundtrack. Milk is just plain standard. Each characterthough based on real peoplecan be summed up in a simple sentence such as Emile Hirsch's Cleve Jones the tenacious queer who... well I don't even need a full sentence. That's about it.Sean Penn is convincing and sweet as the 40yearold New York insurance man who realizes how boring his life is and decides to head west and make an impact. He seems to settle on a life of gay political activism simply because it's the most convenient the attention the theatrics and the social bonding seem almost as importantif not more sothan the actual revolution.Which is an interesting idea but not one that the movie really allows you to dwell on. Milk with its fastpaced biopic structure here's one important event... then here's another one a year later... then a close friend dies... and then there's a small triumph... and then... and its attention to political activism wants to be a cry for equality not a complex ambiguous character study. Harvey is reduced to the role of hero champion martyr. You're not allowed to be skeptical of his background his relationships his motivation his manipulative methods. You know he's the good guy because he's on the side of equalitythe ends justify the means and all thatand so you have to root for him and that's that.But I don't enjoy that. I like rooting for villains. I like feeling sorry for the assholes. I like believing even for just one turbulent moment that what the psycho killer is saying makes perfect sense. And I can't stand a flawless hero. I can't stand being forced to side with someone.And as for Harvey Milk as portrayed in this filmwell he just wasn't that inspirational. Look I'm queer and I'm liberal and all of that. It's a subject that's very close to me. Plus I'm a sucker for inspiration and I cry several times a year in movie theaters. But his speeches and his rallies never made me feel anything other than mildly interested on an intellectual level. The bad direction is part of thatthe cinematography choices were dreadful with very little camerawork standing out as exceptional. With each march and protest a still camera looks headon at the faces of the few stars as they march forward. Why? If we're supposed to be immersed in the riot to feel like we're a part of it why would be facing the rioters? Why would we be so still? Why not throw the camera into the action shakily following behind the other marchers? But there's none of that.Maybe Van Sant was trying to prove that gay people are just as normal and boring as straight people that their inspirational biopics can be just as colorbynumbers and boring as straight biopics. But who wants to see that? Harvey was loudMy name is Harvey Milk and I'm here to recruit you!Harvey was theatrical. The gay movement at that time loved to shout out loud. So why such a stifling story?There's only one aspect of the film that's interesting and that's the relationship between Harvey Milk and Dan White Josh Brolin in a fine performance the straightlaced police officer and political rival. Their awkward dance is compellingDan the man tries to please and work with however distantly his minority colleague while Harvey desires only to destroy the competitor who represents everything he detests and opposes.

	onyx:emotionText "Milk isn't a terrible movieit's not even a bad moviebut it's nowhere near the level of gay masterpiece I hoped it would be. It's a conventional unambiguous rallying cry with no real impact.Gus Van Sant has done some very original highly stylized downright weird films in the past decade. My Own Private Idaho was Shakespeare's world populated by gay prostitutes with still life sex scenes and split screens and overthetop dialogue Psycho was a more surreal and more scandalous shotforshot replay of the Hitchcock original Elephant was a hyperrealistic photograph of teenage violence starring noname high school actors and so on. His most conventional film was Good Will Hunting but that at least was moving and had momentum as well as a terrific soundtrack. Milk is just plain standard. Each characterthough based on real peoplecan be summed up in a simple sentence such as Emile Hirsch's Cleve Jones the tenacious queer who... well I don't even need a full sentence. That's about it.Sean Penn is convincing and sweet as the 40yearold New York insurance man who realizes how boring his life is and decides to head west and make an impact. He seems to settle on a life of gay political activism simply because it's the most convenient the attention the theatrics and the social bonding seem almost as importantif not more sothan the actual revolution.Which is an interesting idea but not one that the movie really allows you to dwell on. Milk with its fastpaced biopic structure here's one important event... then here's another one a year later... then a close friend dies... and then there's a small triumph... and then... and its attention to political activism wants to be a cry for equality not a complex ambiguous character study. Harvey is reduced to the role of hero champion martyr. You're not allowed to be skeptical of his background his relationships his motivation his manipulative methods. You know he's the good guy because he's on the side of equalitythe ends justify the means and all thatand so you have to root for him and that's that.But I don't enjoy that. I like rooting for villains. I like feeling sorry for the assholes. I like believing even for just one turbulent moment that what the psycho killer is saying makes perfect sense. And I can't stand a flawless hero. I can't stand being forced to side with someone.And as for Harvey Milk as portrayed in this filmwell he just wasn't that inspirational. Look I'm queer and I'm liberal and all of that. It's a subject that's very close to me. Plus I'm a sucker for inspiration and I cry several times a year in movie theaters. But his speeches and his rallies never made me feel anything other than mildly interested on an intellectual level. The bad direction is part of thatthe cinematography choices were dreadful with very little camerawork standing out as exceptional. With each march and protest a still camera looks headon at the faces of the few stars as they march forward. Why? If we're supposed to be immersed in the riot to feel like we're a part of it why would be facing the rioters? Why would we be so still? Why not throw the camera into the action shakily following behind the other marchers? But there's none of that.Maybe Van Sant was trying to prove that gay people are just as normal and boring as straight people that their inspirational biopics can be just as colorbynumbers and boring as straight biopics. But who wants to see that? Harvey was loudMy name is Harvey Milk and I'm here to recruit you!Harvey was theatrical. The gay movement at that time loved to shout out loud. So why such a stifling story?There's only one aspect of the film that's interesting and that's the relationship between Harvey Milk and Dan White Josh Brolin in a fine performance the straightlaced police officer and political rival. Their awkward dance is compellingDan the man tries to please and work with however distantly his minority colleague while Harvey desires only to destroy the competitor who represents everything he detests and opposes. Dan keeps promises that Harvey breaks. Dan drunkenly stumbles in the shadows of his fading conservative beliefsbeliefs he doesn't even necessarily understand or trust anymorewhile Harvey milks up the limelight. It's a sad and scary battle of wits and one that paints a dark political tinge on the otherwise spotless Harvey but the theme is confined to a few short scenes and left largely unexplored.As a movie focusing strictly on Dan vs. Harvey this could have been a good film but by expanding this into an eightyearlong historical examination of how great San Francisco is and how wonderful and downtrodden gay people always are the movie strays into the realm of simple sweeping statements. I'm disappointed by how much critical acclaim this film is getting aside from Penn and Brolin it's rather lackluster.Milk d Gus Van Sant w Dustin Lance Black Sean Penn Josh Brolin 610";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film last night and it had me in tears. If you don't know the story of Harvey Milk then you really should. I had never heard of him until this film and I don't know why I hadn't. I'm not gay and feel quite uncomfortable watching other guys kissing but have nothing against homosexuality. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all throughout this film and it really left me feeling very sympathetic for the gay community and anyone who is persecuted for being different. Sean Penn delivers the most outstanding performance i have seen him deliver in ages it should definitely warrant an Oscar! James Franco Josh Brolin Emile Hirch and Diego Luna also showing their brilliance. All the actors were incredible and to think that none of them that i know of are actually gay. It must take some serious ability to pull that one off so believably. Maybe I just don't have a gaydar and can't see it so could someone who is gay let me know what he thought of their performance. Anyway there is a lot to learn from this film it shocks me to think this happened only a generation ago and we were all such an unaccepting bunch of idiots back then. However it tells the entire story from an unbiased view. All the homophobes and 'bad guys' aren't just displayed as bad people but always come across as being human albeit ignorant you can't blame someone for their ignorance. Gus Van Sant's direction as usual was fantastic some very innovative and clever shots and by using an old school camera through many parts of the film could blend real historical footage and modern film seamlessly. One of the best films I have seen all year! I hope it does well and wins multiple awards it definitely deserves it! Enjoy this film it has really touched me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I very nearly gave this movie a miss. I'm pleased I didn't.As with the gaythemed Brokeback Mountain many might have stayed away till they realised it was more of a movie than that. Milk is a biopic of the murdered gay rights activist Harvey Milk. But it connects to the audience by being symbolically about everyone every minority anybody who has ever been bullied or ashamed to admit their beliefs. It's about the human spirit. The rights of man enshrined in the American Constitution. And it's about the compassion that lets us see our enemies as human beings.Part of this is down to an outstanding script. But much is down to Sean Penn at times almost unrecognisable in a beard who handles the role with a winning combination of grit and sensitivity. He becomes the master orator standing for political office. There are characters in his life that have committed suicide because of the shame of being gay. He is the first openly gay man to hold public office and he gives people hope in much the same way it may be said that the similarly charismatic Barak Obama is doing for black people. We see poignant comparisons with Nazi pogroms against anyone who was 'different'. We see the fervent religious right claiming God on their side as they preach a message of hate.Righteous hatred is not dead in America. A few hours before seeing Milk I had watched a horrific documentary about a family of preachers who picket not only 'faggots' but anyone they believe tacitly supports homosexuality the footage included picketing a dead serviceman's funeral. We have laws against inciting racial hatred. How can they get away with inciting such homophobia? Milk goes back to the 70's. Politicians opposing him label homosexuals with prostitutes and thieves. Deny them any rights. An argument worth pursuing philosophically perhaps especially as Gordon Brown's UK government is currently trying to demonise prostitution. A thief breaks the laws of property. But homosexuals  and prostitutes for that matter  offend only those whose totalitarian view of the world wish to discriminate against those who privately and without hurting others have the audacity to live differently. Common tactics include linking crime by association. And with prostitution there is some evidence of links to crime although it may be linked more to marginalisation  and prostitutes could always at least theoretically become nonprostitutes. Homosexuality like being black or Jewish cannot be 'treated.' Gays can rarely if ever 'become straight.' And neither is sexual preference an indicator of criminal tendency.Milk takes his arguments to the most hostile of audiences. He debates with remarkable skill. But although people warm to him for his courage and kindness his personal life frequently sinks into tatters. Being second fiddle to a political crusader is no joyride. Even if you were straight. Campaigntrail Harvey might be fighting for your life in broad terms but it won't help you through that long night of dinners for one.Milk admirably avoids the mistake of glossing over common faults of the gay community  notably male aversion at the time to lesbians. In a hilarious scene where Harvey hires a lesbian campaign manager the allmale entourage dissolves into ridiculous girly twittering against her  until with a few wellchosen words she proves she's got 'bigger balls than anyone in the room'. Harvey slowly expands his cause. He realises it can't be just about gay rights. It has to be about everyone's rights. If elected he has to show genuine concern for everyone's troubles  not just gays. And after a few political nearslips where he is tempted to cut a deal he welds himself to a virtuousness in public office that his opponents can only hypocritically claim but not deliver.We know in the first few moments that he is going to die. The rest of the film is told in flashback. Penn an actor that is occasionally too intense for my liking has found a film where he can throw every muscle twitch every watery eye every shade of emotion into a character and cause where intensity is called for. In one of the finest performances of his career he is understated to convey finer feeling yet passionate on the soap box to an inspirational degree.I was also very pleased to see this praiseworthy development from director Gus Van Sant. Many 'indie' directors start off with great 'artistic' work only to be eaten up by Hollywood glitz. Van Sant's career is almost the opposite. Having proved his metal with crowdpleasers like To Die For and Good Will Hunting he seems gradually to have abandoned all pretensions to mainstream. His Paranoid Park was a masterstroke of subtle evocation in the thriller genre. With Milk he has applied his skills like a great craftsman reclaiming selfrespect for the serious yet accessible artist.The one nagging criticism of course is where are all the gay actors? I cannot fault Sean Penn's acting. He is undoubtedly the best actor for the part. But the very message of equality proclaimed so loudly by Hollywood's darling liberal left is still unheeded within their own industry. How many openly gay actors can you name? I thought so . . . And how far have we really got really or has apathy set in? As California bans gay marriage one commentator noted Where were today's Harvey Milks when Proposition 8 was on the ballot?".

He will certainly get an Oscar nomination possibly even a win. Now to the strong supporting performances. Many of the attention has been given to Brolin and Franco but I thought that Diego Luna gave a very disturbing and real portrayal as Milk's lover Jack at one point in his life. Yes it was hard to watch but I feel that Luna really stoodout and it is a shame that people have not really recognized him as well. James Franco also gave a very strong performance as did Emile Hirsch. But here is a surprise I did not think Josh Brolin was anything special. He has been the supporting actor who has been getting most Oscar attention and most nominations and even awards. He was good no doubt but he lacked a lot in scenes I thought. I was expecting him to do more and I am sorry but I do not think he deserves an Oscar nomination let alone some awards he has taken homethey should all go to Ledger for his amazing performance as The Joker. But it is not a big deal like I said he was good but just not nearly as good as he is being praised. The screenplay is fabulous. It slides and it does not linger and never plays out very easily. The direction is superb as is the rest of the film.Here is one amazing film by any means. It grabs you whether you like biographical films or not.

	schema:headline " First rate story of a very important man";
	schema:reviewBody "My wife and I saw Milk yesterday at the Castro Theater in SF  right around the corner from Harvey's camera shop where I met Harvey in 19734. For those of us who learned from Harvey about what it meant to be gay in America at that time and who learned genuine acceptance and love this movie is wonderfully evocative.Harvey Milk was truly extraordinary as were the times. This film portrays it all for the most part accurately. Even the dog poop scene no real spoiler here which I had forgotten but remembered as soon as the scene began was dead on. Van Sant is also very faithful to location which for me someone who lived in the neighborhood for 30 years was really wonderful. Events were recreated where they actually happened. Sean Penn wears the same outfits Harvey wore for the Gay Rights Parade and other moments. It's great to see Cleve Jones still a gayrights leader in a starring role.Why no 10 out of 10? Well I thought Sean Penn was great spot on but it wasn't the earthshattering performance I expected. Penn absorbed and became Milk which is what he does so well. No disappointment here since the role is not earthshattering. Harvey grew on you he wasn't Dr. King or Bobby Kennedy.Second and more significant the parts that weren't so accurate. Most important here another extraordinary man George Moscone relegated to being a reflection of Harvey told what to do and how to act. Mayor Moscone was not the leader of a revolution like Harvey but he was an extraordinarily skilled and enlightened man a full ally of Harvey's not the implicitly reluctant guy who needed Harvey's push. Nor was Dan White's resignation aftermath completely accurate  'nuff said. Moscone too was a hero and even though the movie was about Harvey Van Sant would have done better by giving full albeit brief honor to George Moscone too.".

	onyx:emotionText "My wife and I saw Milk yesterday at the Castro Theater in SF  right around the corner from Harvey's camera shop where I met Harvey in 19734. For those of us who learned from Harvey about what it meant to be gay in America at that time and who learned genuine acceptance and love this movie is wonderfully evocative.Harvey Milk was truly extraordinary as were the times. This film portrays it all for the most part accurately. Even the dog poop scene no real spoiler here which I had forgotten but remembered as soon as the scene began was dead on. Van Sant is also very faithful to location which for me someone who lived in the neighborhood for 30 years was really wonderful. Events were recreated where they actually happened. Sean Penn wears the same outfits Harvey wore for the Gay Rights Parade and other moments. It's great to see Cleve Jones still a gayrights leader in a starring role.Why no 10 out of 10? Well I thought Sean Penn was great spot on but it wasn't the earthshattering performance I expected. Penn absorbed and became Milk which is what he does so well. No disappointment here since the role is not earthshattering. Harvey grew on you he wasn't Dr. King or Bobby Kennedy.Second and more significant the parts that weren't so accurate. Most important here another extraordinary man George Moscone relegated to being a reflection of Harvey told what to do and how to act. Mayor Moscone was not the leader of a revolution like Harvey but he was an extraordinarily skilled and enlightened man a full ally of Harvey's not the implicitly reluctant guy who needed Harvey's push. Nor was Dan White's resignation aftermath completely accurate  'nuff said. Moscone too was a hero and even though the movie was about Harvey Van Sant would have done better by giving full albeit brief honor to George Moscone too.";

I have never seen the original film version with Norma Shearer but it appears not to be bowdlerized like this one. But bowdlerized or not this is a very good film.It has a first rate cast led by Crawford who was capable of comedy but opted for dramatic intense roles like Mildred Pierce. As the role calls for her to be compromised by her actions she has masqueraded as a socialite to be accepted by the jaded aristocrats in order to pull off a jewel robbery the role is not a slap happy funny part like say Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson but a tonier style of sophisticated comedy. As such it is perfectly fitted to Crawford's screen persona.As for the jaded aristocrats Frank Morgan may not do a British accent at all but his fumbling is pretty good here  he is the richest man in England and could give an intelligent talk on industrial output or tariffs but cannot open up his heart to Crawford Nigel Bruce is another nobleman who has a randy set of eyes for pretty ladies and cannot see his wife Benita Hume is far too close to her cousin Ralph Forbes. The splendid Jessie Ralph is an aging dowager who befriends Crawford it is her pearl necklace that Crawford is seeking to steal. She is a lively and likable old lady and one with a scandalous past as we eventually learn. But if none of the aristocrats are spotless in character except possibly the boring Morgan the other members of the gang are not wonderful. Melville Cooper pretending to be Crawford's chauffeur is constantly ready to whip out his handy knife and cut the throat of anyone he thinks is double crossing them.But the most interesting thing about the casting were the two leading men Robert Montgomery and William Powell. The two most sophisticated and suave leading men of the golden age of movies only appeared in this one film together. They share only four scenes but it is remarkable about how smooth the scenes are  like a perfect set of volleyball games with no shots and counter shots missed by either party and when Crawford joins them she is equally smooth in responding to both her leading men. She had made other films with Montgomery but there were no others after this one. As for Powell this was there only film together. As such it should be seen for the bright chemistry between the three leads alone but it is a good comedy on its own.".

It is not her best performance for her best acting see her small but scenestealing role in The Women and for a Crawford feast see her Oscarwinning turn in Mildred Pierce but it is far from her worst. The blame cannot be entirely placed on Crawford either. Nor can it be placed on the director. It must be placed on the production code administrators who sheared Hollywood scripts after 1934 cutting out anything considered risqu. The original play by Fredric Lonsdale is a surprisingly hilarious and fresh sendup of the class sytem in England. Butler and footmen who are actually thieves in disguise get to act veddy propper and then when the guests leave get to drop their phony apparel. Its really quite funny. In the play when Crawford's wouldbe suitor catches her at robbery he forces her to spend a night in the closet with him. This was wonderfully handled in the 1929 Norma Shearer original of this picture. But the production code said that thieves had to always be punished and sexual actions could not be forced or blackmailed. Thus this is an extremely bowdlerized version of the play. It is interesting to watch the stars interplay and I'm a bit surprised that it flopped so largely in 1937. Seeing some of the junk that goes over big nowadays one would think that with a cast like this and high production values it would have at least made its mark. See the Norma Shearer version if you can find it. Unfortunately its very rare there is a laser disc version of it on The Dawn of Sound Volume III but totally worth it. It is risqu and hilarious. Or see Trouble In Paradise another early preCode comedy about jewel thieves who in that film don't have to face punishment for their actions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joan Crawford in doing The Last of Mrs. Cheyney had to stand comparison with not one but two previous actresses who essayed the part of a crooked adventuress who discovers she has a chance at love.The Last of Mrs. Cheyney was first presented on Broadway as a play by Frederick Lonsdale in the 19251926 season and it ran 385 performances with Ina Claire in the lead. Then it was done as an early sound feature film for Norma Shearer who got rave reviews.Not having seen Claire or Shearer in the part I only have Crawford to judge and she doesn't do badly at all in the part. Of course she and the film are helped greatly by the fact William Powell and Robert Montgomery are in the film and both can and have played this kind of light comedy in their sleep.Crawford is the shill the comeon for a gang of thieves of which William Powell is one of the members. She's taken on the identity of wealthy sophisticated American widow Faye Cheyney who ingratiates herself with the rich and famous and gets in their homes to rob them. We find her first working her wiles on shipboard with Frank Morgan playing the usual befuddled Frank Morgan part. Powell serves as her 'butler'. But she also meets wealthy young Lord Robert Montgomery and through him gets invited to old dowager Duchess Jessie Ralph's for the weekend.Jessie's got a big rock there that the gang would like to get a hold of. But Montgomery is offering Crawford a chance to break away from that life and it puts her in a dilemma. Since Powell's kind of stuck on her too she's got another problem.I think Crawford carried off the part quite well. But the best one in the film is Jessie Ralph. Seems as though the old duchess married into the aristocracy and she spots that Crawford is not all she claims she is. But she likes her nonetheless. Very similar to the part Florence Bates played in Saratoga Trunk with Ingrid Bergman. Ralph steals every scene she's in.One of these days I met get to see the Shearer version. Till then I'll recommend this version of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney without hesitation.".

	schema:headline " The first half was finethe last half was wretched!";
	schema:reviewBody "THE LAST OF MRS. CHEYNEY was not a very good film though you probably wouldn't suspect that until the film was about half complete. That's because the basic premise and acting were very good. In fact the film had a superstrong castwith Joan Crawford Robert Montgomery Frank Morgan and William Powell. It's obvious that this was a bigbudget MGM film. However towards the middle the whole thing became a very stagy and dreadful filmwith way too little action and way too much horrid dialog. By the end of the film instead of improving the film takes a nosedive into wretchedness! If you don't believe me then read on to find out about the terrible plot.Joan plays the title character. She is supposed to be a rich American but is actually a thief working with William Powell's gang. Her goal is to insinuate herself into rich society so she can steal some fancy jewels. However along the way she finds that not only are these people very welcoming but nice folksso nice that it's obvious that she's having a hard time sticking with the plan. However the gang members won't allow thiseven if it's obvious that Powell cares about Joan and wouldn't hurt her himself. So far this is great stuff and seeing love blossom between Joan and two nice guys Montgomery and Morgan made it all the better.Unfortunately I assume the original writers must have died or suffered massive head injuries because the witty dialog and fascinating story completely lost its way midway through the film. It was as if they'd set up a good story and had no idea where to go. That or the writers went on strike and were replaced by lemurs! At this point the film didn't seem to know whether to have Joan prove herself to be decent or a crookso they made her BOTH!! This made no sense but what was worse was the reaction her new society friends had when her plan came to light. Now you'd THINK having a jewel thief lie and steal would cause a problem but in a case of insane script writing they had the rich folks not only agree to forgive and forget but try to pay her and Powell 10000 pounds!!! What the heck was this?! No anger no recriminations but everyone instead being happy and even talking about setting Joan up in business! This was just stupid and .000000003 believable. Talk about contrived and dopey. To make it worse all they seemed to do for the last 30 minutes or so was talk talk talk and talk. It all seemed like mindless prattle after a while.I guess the worst part about all this for me was how utterly wasted William Powell was in the film. He is one of my very favorite actors of his age yet here his performance is very muted and he's given a very bland part. It was as if he was sleepwalking through the film. As for Robert Montgomery he was pretty typical of his usual devilish playboy character up until the endwhere he was transformed by Joan's allure into a simpering wuss. Ugghh! While she was given crappy material to work with Joan probably came off the best of the leads in the filmand this isn't saying much.Please understand that of all eras 1930s films are my very favorite and I adore Hollywood's Golden Age. So my dislike for this film is not because I hate older films. It's just that with so many wonderful films out there often starring these same actors this is among the worst of the larger budget MGM films. This film is ONLY for devoted fans of the actorsand even then you might want to think twice about seeing this one.".

And when she is weeping and involved in something sorrowful or tragic then she is at her best.  She is just so good at getting a raw deal and then coming back to triumph. This movie was not bad at least I got a chance to see Joan in a movie I never knew existed.  And she never looked better.  It was nice to see how handsome Robert Montgomery used to be.  All in all it was entertaining especially if you like attractive homes and scenery.  It did highlight that the very rich are silly and really don't have much of interest to do other than entertain each other all the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stagy tedious wooden boring endless. And yet... Here's a cast of wonderful MGM actors in their prime. Joan Crawford is not that far removed from the musicals of her youth. Her beauty hasn't hardened into the horrible Kabuki mask of later years. She's one of the worst things about this movie. She's utterly unfunny and totally charmless. She sinks every scene to the bottom of the sea and thence downward to the center of the earth. Still it's always interesting to watch her to notice the lighting and other tricks that give her the star treatment in every shot. The male leads are the incomparable William Powell one year after My Man Godfrey and Robert Montgomery one year before Night Must Fall. The rest of the cast is filled out with wonderful character actors including Frank Morgan Nigel Bruce and Melville Cooper. Not to mention Jessie Ralph a cinema immortal for her role as Mrs. Hermosillo Brunch in The Bank Dick.In 1937 American actors were severely afflicted with the phony English accent syndrome cahnt for can't. Here the cast is supposed to be mostly English with only Crawford and Powell as visiting Americans. But Crawford and Powell both speak in that midAtlantic half English accent. Meanwhile half the English characters are played by Americans who barely attempt to sound English Robert Montgomery Frank Morgan Jessie Ralph. In these bewildering accents much dialog is babbled little of it worth hearing. But under the wreckage you can discern the movie somebody was hoping to make something like the infinitely better Trouble In Paradise Ernst Lubitsch's masterpiece about two jewel thieves their victim and the resulting love triangle. Samson Raphaelson the brilliant writer of Trouble In Paradise is one of the many listed writers on this movie. There are a few flashes of brilliant dialog here that sound like him. Meanwhile Frank Morgan later the Wizard of Oz plays a character that's a prototype for Mr. Matuschek in the wonderful LubitschRaphaelson Shop Around The Corner. But in this movie 90 of the dialog is heavy as lead. There are many frenzied comings and goings none of them funny. In no way is this movie a comedy  if by comedy we mean what makes you laugh. Number of intentional laughs detected in this film 0. Unintentional laughs few. This isn't even one of those so bad it's good movies. It's just a stinker.And yet... all those actors near the tops of their careers... a firstclass MGM production from the golden age... and Mrs. Hermosillo Brunch! My advice Tivo it and watch it at triple speed if you like but do take a gander.".

It's a remake of a 1929 film which starred Norma Shearer. Crawford is a sophisticated and glamorous woman we first meet on board ship as she's maneuvering and flirting her way into the company of a society crowd. While doing so she meets Lord Arthur Dilling Robert Montgomery. He and Lord Kelton Morgan pursue her. Once in London she wangles the one thing that she and her gang of thieves led by William Powell as her butler have been waiting for  an invitation to Lady Ebley's country home and a crack at Lady Ebley's fabulous pearl necklace. All doesn't go as planned.Given the star power the film has some interesting moments but for the most part it's played too straight. A lighter touch was needed. This is perhaps a directorial problem there were several or the fact that Joan Crawford was better at drama than at comedy and William Powell better at comedy than at drama. Powell does a great job but it isn't much of a role. Audiences probably left the theater disappointed  perhaps part of the reason the film flopped at the box office. He doesn't have a lot to play off of and no chemistry with Crawford. Robert Montgomery is his usual self in one of those roles that fit him like a glove but the star trio is too somber.Joan Crawford looks fabulous and with a strong director who had a concept of the script she would have been fine. She didn't have a grasp of playing comedy but she was a hard worker who seemingly took direction well. It's a shame MGM spent all that money on what was a firstclass production only to have it just lay an egg. Apparently some of the racier parts of the play version had to be left out due to the code. At times the film drags.Several of the comments blamed Crawford some the script but I do believe with the right director The Last of Mrs. Cheney could have been a lot better.".

William Powell Robert Montgomery Joan Crawford Nigel Bruce Frank Morgan Jessie Ralph Melville Cooper to name the main ones. Then what went wrong? The answer is in the weak script and hohum direction. Based on a play the movie is stagy much too talky. There is little wit nor many clever lines in the wordy script. So all the viewer has left is a bunch of good actors talking themselves to death and putting the audience to sleep in the process. The script is also predictable. The plot is actually a good one. The charming and mysterious Mrs. Cheyney woos rich eligible bachelors and one not so eligible to gain their confidence so she and her accomplices can fleece them. Unfortunately Mrs. Cheyney falls for one of the eligible bachelors. Will she go through with the fleece? The answer lies in the last half of the film. Since Hollywood today is remaking so many movie classics that don't really need remaking why not remake some of the movies such as this one that could use a good make over? As noted by critics there is a degree of miscasting involved as well. Joan Crawford just does not fit as an adventurer passing herself off as a social bigwig in England. William Power would have played Robert Montgomery's role better than the role assigned him. Robert Montgomery on the other hand is well suited for his role as is Nigel Bruce and the rest of the cast.Even if you are a fan of the stars of this fluff and an admirer of 1930's Hollywood cinema you may still find this movie slow moving and hoping that this is truly the last of Mrs. Cheyney.".

	schema:reviewBody "Drama queen singlehandedly destroys the fun in a manor house jewelry heist.The single biggest problem with this film is Crawford. I don't think she had comedy in her. She plays the tragic heroine in every movie and this one is no exception. She warps the movie from a very funny comedy into just another Joan Crawford tragedy of sorts. And she assumes an air of breezy selfassurance that is so strong and so undiluted with any sense of selfdeprecation or humor that it makes her annoying.Of course there are other problems. It's hard to tell that the movie is supposed to be funny really until the butler takes a cigarette for himself and flops heavily onto the settee. Ah of course! NOW I get it! It's all a scam! Until then we've had small humorous asides from a few characters but outside of that we're not sure where the movie is going. Only with that heavy flop a good half hour or more into the movie do we understand that this is a comedy.By then it's too late even if the movie had begun behaving the way it's supposed to. But the maudlin melodrama continues with Crawford empathizing with the scarylooking Duchess and this once again drains all semblance of comedy out of the movie. The later scenes with the robbery gang which should be the sparkling highlight of the movie come off instead as irritating and quarrelsome. And the snooty upperclass guests do no better. The parlor game is abrupt unfinished talky and doesn't deliver any comic payoff. All of the characters but one are dispatched OFFSCREEN to pay their penaltiesas if the filmmakers WANTED to avoid any potential for genuine good fun! And the one character who pays hers on screen is annoying deliberately so. Was this to avoid lightening Crawford's gloomanddoom character? Nigel Bruce and Frank Morgan are of course both priceless in this movie because you could ask either of them to read the list of ingredients on a cereal box and they would still exude their own striking personalities and Powell has a few moments but his character comes off as stock and flat just like Crawford's.One imagines that this could have been a terrifically entertaining and funny movie...one imagines that some of the people involved Powell Morgan and Bruce must have realized this...and one imagines that they must have been terribly disappointed to see the way the movie was handled.".

SYNOPSIS Although she poses as a prominent socialite the charming and fashionable Mrs Cheyney Joan Crawford is actually a jewel thief who takes advantage of invitations to aristocratic homes such as that of Lord Kelton Frank Morgan to spy out the lay of the land. Her partner Charles William Powell believes he has complete control over Mrs Cheyney but his dominance is threatened by a young manabouttown Robert Montgomery who falls in love with her. NOTES The last film directed by Richard Boleslawski who died before the picture was completed. A remake of the 1929 film directed by Sidney Franklin starring Norma Shearer George Barraud and Basil Rathbone. The costumes were designed by Adrian.  The stage play opened in London at the St James on 22 September 1925 running a hugely successful 514 performances. Gladys Cooper played Mrs Cheyney Ronald Squire was Charles and Gerald du Maurier Arthur. On Broadway at the Fulton from 9 November 1925 the play chalked up a very successful 283 performances. Ina Claire played Mrs Cheyney A.E. Matthews was Charles and Roland Young Arthur. MGM remade the film in 1951 as The Law and the Lady with Greer Garson as a revamped Mrs Cheyney Michael Wilding as his lordship and Fernando Lamas the equivalent of Charles.  COMMENT Joan Crawford gives such a luminous performance in the title role as to put all the other players except Frank Morgan and Bob Montgomery firmly in the shade. Mind you Jessie Ralph can stand up to Joan but her role of course is a subsidiary one and she has her best scene at the climax when Crawford is mostly offcamera. Morgan has a grand time in a typical role whilst Montgomery is a revelation in what is basically an unsympathetic part. He even manages to steal scenes from Bill Powell whose role here is often to act as an astute stooge  which he does with great finesse and charm. We also liked Benita Hume's adulterous wife while Nigel Bruce grandly enacts his usual character of a blithely aristocratic ass. The picture is entrancingly photographed stylishly directed and most attractively set.".

After viewing District 9 it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protg.Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood scifi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their scifi it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.There is thankfully not an overused overexposed celebrity in sight and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something only rivaled by Gollum from Lord of the Rings.District 9 has so much to like. It's spectacular darkly funny entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time and it's all done on a meager 30m budget. There is true talent on show here.

That marks many people's first exposure to Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and the trailer  which had a decently executed mockumentary feel to it which only served to make its scifi content seem even more surprising. This same element of surprise is still present throughout the film proper and it is quite a cinematic treat.District 9 takes place in an alternate timeline where twenty years ago an alien spaceship came to a halt above the city of Johannesburg. The inhabitants of the ship are unable to operate the ship anymore so they end up being segregrated to their own slum within the city below. Eventually the government calls for the eviction of the aliens nicknamed prawns due to their appearance from the slum. The film's ostensible protagonist is Wikus Sharlto Copley who through a series of events too complicated to recount in a synopsis ends up undergoing some rather dramatic changes and before long he's thrust into the middle of something far too big for him to handle...The best thing about District 9 is that it always manages to stay fresh and surprising throughout. As the trailers indicate it starts off as a mockumentary in order to expose the gist of the story. The film gradually crosses over to being a more conventional film although still filmed with a very documentarian look and interspersed with occasional news footage or interviews. Despite the unexpected change in presentation you don't really notice because you're so wrapped up in the ingenious premise. Then you're presented with the plight of Wikus whose story is one I don't really want to expose too much because watching it all unfold was just amazing to watch. He's a perfect example of the Everyman trying to survive as best he can in the face of everything that the world throws at him over the course of the film. His development along with that Chris the prawn he befriends who is surprisingly wellrounded for a CGI character raises this above your average sciencefiction film. Even when the film's final third act becomes incredibly actionpacked it still doesn't jar with the mood of the film and doesn't forsake its characters and intelligence for the sake of cheap action sequences.On that subject the action sequences are far from cheap. Given that Blomkamp and collaborator Peter Jackson were originally aiming to make a film adaptation of Halo before changing to this there's still plenty of moments that feel quite reminiscent of Bungie's game from the alien technology to the frantic battles. The effects work looks great in even the simplest of situations to say nothing of the bombastic finale. There's just something about the way it all comes together especially when it is combined with one very uncompromising storyline and subject.District 9 is a rare find nowadays. It doesn't sacrifice the intelligence or raw power that its story affords it for the sake of appeasing your typical blockbuster crowd with a lighter rating and less focus on the story. It's a damned fine thriller that is not without its flaws but is still several cuts above your average summer film and is well worth watching  but only if you can handle the heat. And it does get quite hot.".

	schema:reviewBody "District 9 is a story about aliens who make contact with Earth and the relationships with humans and society. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to MultiNational United MNU a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare. Their sole interest alien technology and weapons. Weapon research would mean huge profits for the company. Wikus van der Merwe Sharlto Copley is placed in charge of the filed operation to evict remove and place the aliens in a new holding facility. Conflict and tension threaten the operation as agents move in. Don't be fooled. This isn't your typical alien scifi action movie. What got me was the believability. If there were aliens out there that were able to make contact with Earth it seems it could have gone something like this. The way the perspective switches from mock documentary style to standard third person certainly contributes to it. Real news footage and interviewers tell the story in retrospect as the events of the movie have already occurred when they are being interviewed. I think it all added to the realism of the experience. Usually in these type of films it's mostly mindless action and the story is lost. Not the case here. There's so much more to it. It's also about betrayal loyalty trust relationships and sacrifice. It can actually be pretty deep and thought provoking with many themes floating around. The film's really about the story which is really a fresh gritty original concept which is good to see nowadays. While the creatures can be most readily described as monsters though they are like us. Family and friendship are still important ideals in their world. The film explores a fine line between human emotions and monsters. With all the selfishness hatred and greed within us maybe we are the real monsters or at least that's how it can be perceived. Neill Blomkamp does a tremendous job with the direction and realism of the film. Sharlto Copley blew me away. I was shocked to see this was his first acting role. The action sequences were well done as well. District 9 is a very unique scifi film one that shouldn't be missed. Mind you this isn't a film for everyone. It's violent and many parts can be cringe worthy. Be warned but be ready for one of the best films of the year thus far.".

District 9 is a beautifully crafted film which shows signs of great promise for being around for a while a subject talked about by many people. Can't wait to watch this again with my friends  ".

	schema:reviewBody "Just got home from a preview of District 9. We had seen the previews and were intrigued to see just what the film would be like. The film style was very much documentary like with lots of sound byte style comments settings the scenes and giving commentary all through the film. These in my opinion took it from being what could have been just another aliens vs humans film and elevated into the realms of social commentary. The aliens are presented almost as animals yet you rapidly start to sympathize with them and tune into their desperation.If it wasn't for the alien space ship in the background and the poor being alien in every sense you would think this was a movie about any slum and the people who prey on the inhabitants.Like other films which cover the worst that humans can do there is a brutal violence present and the directory has not shied away from depicting it. This is not a film you want to watch after a big meal. Just ask my girlfriend. She thought she would have to leave half way through. In all this is a film we worth every cent to see. Right up until the end you are never sure what's going to happen next. The characters are believable and the style of the film just adds to it. This could have happened and in fact may happen. For a first effort Neill Blomkamp has created one of the best SciFi for a while his future work will be well worth paying attention to.".

My expectations were not high enough however because this film exceeded my them in every way possible.I will not go far into detail because I would prefer to not spoil anything. This is unlike any scifi we have seen in years. Forget Terminator 3 and 4 forget the AVP movies forget all those laughable scifi movies this film is what we have been waiting for. An original idea an original concept brilliantly executed great CGI good acting it just has it all. We have seen many aliens come to earth movies but this is different I will not say why though. That is for you to find out when you see it which I HIGHLY recommend you do.This movie qualitywise matches up with the popular SciFi films we love. The original Alien the original Predator The Matrix Star Wars etc. While I enjoyed those ones more because they are classics this one clearly meets the standards we expect today when it comes to quality. A big driving force behind this in my opinion is the fact that high esteemed Peter Jackson is behind this project as the producer. After seeing his masterful Lord of the Rings saga anyone can see that he knows what he is doing.As far as movies for this year this is definitely top 5 so far on my list Up Star Trek 500 Days of Summer HP6 and District 9. Thank you Jackson and Hollywood for finally producing the best SciFi in years. If this movie does not make its way to IMDb top 250 then I will be in awe.See this movie!".

	schema:headline " Excellent nononsense scifi actioner...";
	schema:reviewBody "Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful yet interesting posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.District 9 is a wallop of a film that is also one of the year's very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable and the characters are so realistically presented even the protagonist is deeply flawed and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.The story is well told a refreshing unique and somewhat original scenario one that we've never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak dark and realistic actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.The special effects are excellently rendered and actually give more than their money's worth Only US 30 million! And the effects were amazing as great as anything WETA has done before!. The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too as per the engaging and thrilling and also nonstop action sequences in the film's second half. And boy those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example first half of the film works like a docudrama and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down and we don't notice the change of pace. It's that brilliant.Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamp's hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director and one to look out for in the future. P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job In short it's an excellent science fiction action film but not without it's intelligence. It may have a few flaws and very few clichs these happen near the end of the film but it is still very solid nonetheless. If there is a sequel I'll be first in line to see it.Overall value 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I attended a preview screening of District 9 last night and I am in absolute awe of this film and its director Neill Blomkamp.Thanksfully I knew relatively little about the story going into the film. I had a rough idea of the concept and had seen a few TV spots but thankfully the film delivered so much more than I was led to expect.What I like most about the film is that it increasingly gains momentum throughout its runtime starting out as a mockumentary and thinly veiled social commentary but then delves into more mainstream thriller territory before culminating in some thoroughly entertaining action set pieces. If action is your thing be sure to stick it out through to the latter half of the film. As I was leaving the cinema I overheard many other patrons saying exactly that... I wasn't too sure for the first hour but I'm glad I stayed personally I have never walked out of a film at the cinema.That is not to say that the first half is any less impressive. I am a big fan of realism in films such as this and as such I really enjoyed the documentary feel. I think the intention was for the entire film to be in the mockumentary style but for me the style changes and takes on a more mainstream look albeit handheld... which I think is important to know going in. There are also a few areas where it couldn't be believed that a documentary crew could still be filming or even alive. But I think the film is much better for this and definitely more memorable.If there is one thing that irks me about this film its that the story moves at an incredible pace... particularly in the earlier scenes in the film which feel rather rushed and seemingly at odds with the realistic documentary feel it was going for. Things just seem to happen so quickly leaving little time to digest the premise and characters. I would love to see a version of the movie that extends the first half to allow a greater look into the reality presented to us.SFXwise there are no complaints. There is the odd bit of artificial blurring on some alien movement but overall we are presented with a very lowkey realistic CGI presentation that could teach Hollywood a thing or two.One other aspect that I must mention is the performance of the lead character. Seeing a film of this caliber that has no recognisable actors with foreign to an Aussie! accents just adds to the authenticity... but Sharlto Copley in his debut performance is a revelation and one of the most memorable aspects of the movie.I cannot recommend this movie enough and the wait until the weekend so I can see this film again is just too long!".

The shaky parts are supposedly documentary clips telling the story of Wikus the protagonist. But rather than add to the feel of it the shakiness is just nauseating. They just over did it. But after a while into the movie they got out of the documentary mode and things couldn't be any better. And the special effects in his movie will have you believing that these aliens are real.It's better that you go into this movie not knowing the deeper plot as a big part of the movie's entertainment value for me is the parts when things look hopeless and you really feel the despair and hopelessness of the characters. The only thing you need to know going in is that there are aliens stranded on earth and they are put in slums. This is one of those movies that teases you that it's nearing its end but inside you go No I want more. It can't end like this and the movie hears you and gives you more. And it's primed for a great sequel. The potential that this franchise has is just enormous. The way they can expand the story is just limitless and all of them can add to it's lore.

While I watching the film I immediately wanted to view it again. It is intriguing and highly entertaining with a dynamic characters and rich in both humor and action. Once it ended my friends and I chattered excitedly about the numerous aspects we liked. As clich as it may be there are parts of this film that will stay with you. When it is released I will be waiting with everyone else to see it again!!!".

I would like to give my opinion of the film but not any of the plot or details.I went into the theater basically only knowing the genre of the film being exposed just to the minimal humans only ads. While I watching the film I immediately wanted to view it again. It is intriguing and highly entertaining with a dynamic characters and rich in both humor and action. Once it ended my friends and I chattered excitedly about the numerous aspects we liked. As clich as it may be there are parts of this film that will stay with you. When it is released I will be waiting with everyone else to see it again!!!";

	schema:headline " Gritty real and very entertaining.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never been a huge supporter of South African based movies this one written  directed by Neill Blomkamp as I tend to find them a bit cheesy but this movie was definitely the exception to the rule. Initially the first 5 to 10 minutes were a bit difficult as my Hollywood brainwashed brain battled to get past the thick Souf Afrikan accents and the really gritty  realistic local setting. But my efforts were well rewarded with a fine performance from a truly brilliant cast and a direction equivalent to even better than what Hollywood can churn out. Neill Blomkamp can a be very very proud man.At it's core I would classify District 9 as a Science Fiction ActionDrama. And without spoiling to much the movie takes place in a slum in Johannesburg where a group of aliens often referred to as prawns! have been segregated from the rest of the populous after their mother ship breaks down and leaves them stranded on earth. 20 years later the story picks up where Wikus vd Merwe a field agent for the MSU is tasked with relocating the aliens to a better place  200km's away from Joburg  where they can live in peace and without fear of conflict confrontation and intimidation by the rather hostile locals. Thats the basic premise however there is far more to the story than that and I definitely am not going to spoil it.Wikus vd Merwe the main protagonist was brilliantly played by Sharlto Copely. Really I was most impressed. His character was rich and complex and was played out with sincerity and passion. However just when you think you have him all figured out he goes and says or does something that changes your perception of him altogether as he alters his behaviored pattern based on the current situation. This depth in character is not often seen in movies and came as a welcome surprise. Hats off to Mr. Blomkamp for focusing on this through his filming and writing.Visually the movie is a real treat as well. The setting is gritty grimy  dirty and really showcased slum life realistically. The special effects present was also exceptional but never over used. The first part or half? of the movie was done in the style of a documentary with interviews and news pieces glued together to enable the viewer to catch up on what has transpired and with some liberal use of the shaky cam style. This really adds to the realism but is only prevalent in the first half as the second half tends to settle down on a more stable style of filming.The movie has a 16 age restriction and justly so. There is plenty of swearing and enough gory splats that i found myself going yuck on one or two occasions. So you have been warned. But if you can handle this kind of thing you are in for a treat as it's never really gratuitous but justified most of the time because of the reality that the movie portrays.After leaving the movie I was still chewing over the whole concept which clearly indicates this is not the kind of inoneearouttheother kind of movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say its a thinking man's science fiction but it definitely does leave some food for thought. Another great thing is that you don't have to be a Science Fiction fan to enjoy it as my wife who is more into drama's thoroughly enjoyed as well she gave it a 10!.So does it deserve your money for a ticket? Most definitely yes. Niell Blomkamp hit a home run with this movie and we need to show our support. Go out and see it as soon as you can. I give it a strong 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "District 9 is a movie to think about. The first and second time I watched District 9 I wasn't quite sure what to think. I came at it from the p.o.v. of a science fiction fan and I thought some of the SF elements were not entirely thought through. But I thought some more about it and things started to gel.Movies have been made before that people thought were about racism. I'm thinking of a brilliant film like Pleasantville which on the face of it seems to be about race but was much more complex underneath that surface. And I'm thinking of another brilliant 1998 film like Bulworth where race was used to symbolize rich and poor. District 9 at first seems not simply to be about race but about xenophobia generally and the plight of refugees especially. Penetrating deeper this appearance however while effective and admirable is also deceptive. District 9 is one film that actually IS about racism. This is a South African film. The aliens in it arrived 28 years ago when the inhuman Apartheid system was still in effect.So what is this film saying? Get this It is using aliens to explain to us that there is still effective Apartheid in South Africa today. The aliens symbolize the black South Africans and how they are still ostracized from much of commonwhite society and kept in crimeinfested and corruptionridden areas. Having no future and no hope and no voice. That's also why in the film the Nigerians are Nigerians  they couldn't be South Africans because the aliens are the South Africans.The biofluid used to power the spaceship represents the lifeforce and will to live that the black South Africans have lost. In the film it must be the catastrophic loss of almost all their biofluid that led to the big ship's crash in the first place and to the poor condition of the aliens inside it. The alien technology represents cultural substance it is a beautiful symbol of all that we have to learn from socalled primitive cultures. If we'll open up to their problems and cultural content we will all be the richer for it.Even the documentary form of the first part of the film also makes proper sense in light of this interpretation. The documentary part is supposed to make the audience identify with the whites whereas when the documentary style of storytelling disappears the audience is left free to choose a different allegiance. In other words we start by being shown that we are the ones at fault and then we are given the opportunity to change.This is a brilliant film. I rate it 10 stars out of 10.".

It was the rave reviews and the high ratings that influenced my decision to watch this film but now that I have seen it I honestly do not see what all the buzz is about. This movie failed to deliver on almost every end. The characters were flat the filming style was annoying and the plot was unbelievable with too many holes. SpoilersWhile the action isn't great either the main problem with the film is that it makes an obvious attempt to appeal to the empathy of the audience and horrible fails at it because of absurdity. The success of this movie relies on whether or not the audience actually cares about the main character Wikus but there is no character development. The so called bond between the alien wearing the red clothes and Wikus is laughable. The movie barely shows them together throughout the film but for some unapparent reason we're expected to accept that by the end of the movie they've developed a close bond out of thin air. A bond that they are willing to risk their lives for. I won't leave you says the aliens I'll come back...I promise. Huh?... What a load of ridiculous crap. Was I supposed to shed a tear at that moment. For those of you who actually felt emotional at that moment I worry for you. I mean Wikus was not even a likable guy. The whole time he acted like an asshole and he had an utterly annoying accent. Did the director of this movie expect us to actually care about the guy. I sure as hell didn't. He was a selfish bastard throughout the whole movie who only cared about himself. The only reason I could come up with for why he protected the alien at the end was that it was his only chance of becoming human again. I can honestly say that I think that he got what he deserved. The story also contains too many flaws. Gaping flaws that make this movie nearly unwatchable. For this part I'll just ask all the questions that I have. I mean how is it possible that the aliens got stranded on Earth in the first place and then after 20 some years the mothership seems to magically work again? Why does alien fuel turn a guy into an alien? Why would the aliens have an antidote for a guy turning into an alien? Why would Wikus only cut off a finger? Why didn't the aliens retaliate with their superior technology? Why would the government allow the aliens to be so loosely controlled? Why do the aliens act like savages even though they are supposed to be an advanced race? Why can't the aliens contact their planet wouldn't they have the technology? Why are humans allowed to stay in District 9? Why would Wikus's wife actual believe that he performed some sort of sexual activity with an alien? Why is a spaceship buried under ground? Am I missing something? Yes I am being a bit too critical but it's just because people keep saying that this movie is so so great and it bothers me. I have much more to say but I'll just leave it at this. I give this movie a 4 out of 10.".

Half of the 300 people attending were still buzzing about this filmgoers' delight when the lights came up after closing credits. Some said its setting in South Africa's Soweto slums reminded them of CITY OF GOD. Others said its mockumentary style was reminiscent of CLOVERFIELD. Someone said it ranks up there with THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL 1951 of course and ALIEN for scifi originality. Another fan said it reminded her of IMPOSTOR on steroids I looked this up and it's an obscure 2001 flick starring Gary Sinise in a moral dilemma similar to Wikus' in DISTRICT 9. At any rate normally I don't award lowbudget 5 million remakes of shorts with a 10 out of 10 rating but I found DISTRICT 9 to be enough of an eyeopener to deserve a 10 despite being more flawed than any other topranking movie I can think of at the moment. The key to enjoying DISTRICT 9 is to sit back and not to nitpick. It may lack the stars and special effects bazillions of TRANSFORMERS REVENGE OF THE FALLEN or STAR TREK THE FUTURE BEGINS but DISTRICT 9 will give most people more food for thought than either of those two earlier releases of this summer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard enough about this South African film to know that it was an allegory about the Apartheid period. And I'm a huge fan of intelligent scifi. What could go wrong? Everything. Can I have those two hours back? The first 20 minutes was interesting. The lead character is portrayed as a passiveaggressive racist who is a part of the problem smooths over police violence in front of the press and fails utterly to comprehend the situation around him. In short he's marked for death. He's the redshirted security guy beaming down with Kirk and you just know his minutes are numbered. But when something bad does happen to him the movie's logic goes off the rails and melts into a steaming pile of a cheap Chuck Norris action flick where rifles blaze grenades explode and there's no motive to any of it other than just to blow sht up for the twelve year old kids in the audience.Question. If you were making an allegory about Apartheid why would your clueless selfish white guy racist jailer be the hero and liberator of the oppressed black people? I should think that in the 21st century old ideas about the White Man's Burden is more than just offensive it's also a tired clich. The jailer bureaucrat's only motive seems selfish he just wants to go back to his old self.The sadistic villain is like a bad penny. He just keeps showing up in every other scene fires off about a million rounds without hitting the hapless hero and doesn't have the horse sense to call in enough backup to handle the escalating violence.I'm supposed to believe that the Most Wanted Man in the Universe with his picture all over television can use his old access codes to break into a maximum security biology weapon lab and run off with alien rocket fuel? The plot holes get bigger and bigger which is forgivable if the story is reasonable. Yet the problem here is that there are no likable characters at all in the entire film. Also the violence is way too gratuitous and serves no purpose.I can't think of anything good to say other than to save your money and don't waste your time on this one.".

	schema:headline " NOT one of the greatest Sci Fi films ever!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a negative review of the film. Instead it is a clarification of why I think those fanboys who rank this movie up there with Blade Runner and Children of Men must have very short memories.The first half of the movie is basically throwaway. Its this mockumentary that supposedly frames the plight of the prawns into some kind of relevance. But its really just a lot of back story. The movie does nothing more for the morays of apartheid refugee status or whatever social commentary its trying to make beyond the assortment of interviews meant to set up the second half of the story. It's just a cute premise that serves as backstory for the real movie.The real movie starts the moment Wikus finds the tube of liquid and gets infected. The camera calms down and the documentary camera gets replaced by a neutral camera and cinematic action style we're all familiar with. The shift in perspective is disconcerting. What POV are we really seeing? It's like a movie within the movie.The movie is oddly dispassionate and unemotional. While the CG character animation is top notch I never cared for the prawns for the most part they seemed like a bunch of random bugs running away and on a rampage and only the father and son prawns were midly sympathetic. There was no villain I really hated  the MNU mercenaries were just nameless thugs and the head of MNU  the father was never much of a character. I loved no characters either. I liked the choice for Wikus  Sharlto Copley  hes an atypical hero uncaring selfish nerdy bureaucratic type. He's different enough to be interesting but I can't say I rooted much for him or loved the guy  except at the very end of the movie when he has a change of heart and has his orgasmic heroic battle like every good action hero must do. His wife seemed hardly a character at all so his empathy with and from her had little weight.Lots of stuff made no sense. Why did the prawns give up all their weapons? For cat food? Why didn't they just take what they wanted? Why did the command center drop down from the ship when it was such a pain to get it back up again? It was never clear at what point they were at with somemostall prawns getting moved to the new concentration camp.Overall it lacked the thematic unity of great science fiction like Children of Men or 2001 movies where I felt deeply involved with the characters. I can't believe some fans and reviews put it in that league.The mockumentary reminded me of independent and student films like American Zombies and others of that genre. But the devolution of the movie into a well done but typical action sci fi flick seems to give the movie a schizo personality with competing tonalities.Camera work while not Cloverfield shaky was kind of wonkishly bad video shaky and can make you sick as it did my date.I was mildy entertained by the film but my review is in response to the surprising laudations given to it by the reviewers and fans. I wonder who wrote those and why?? Possibly one of the most audacious SciFi films of the summer but it lacks the thought and conviction for it to be anything more.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is not a negative review of the film. Instead it is a clarification of why I think those fanboys who rank this movie up there with Blade Runner and Children of Men must have very short memories.The first half of the movie is basically throwaway. Its this mockumentary that supposedly frames the plight of the prawns into some kind of relevance. But its really just a lot of back story. The movie does nothing more for the morays of apartheid refugee status or whatever social commentary its trying to make beyond the assortment of interviews meant to set up the second half of the story. It's just a cute premise that serves as backstory for the real movie.The real movie starts the moment Wikus finds the tube of liquid and gets infected. The camera calms down and the documentary camera gets replaced by a neutral camera and cinematic action style we're all familiar with. The shift in perspective is disconcerting. What POV are we really seeing? It's like a movie within the movie.The movie is oddly dispassionate and unemotional. While the CG character animation is top notch I never cared for the prawns for the most part they seemed like a bunch of random bugs running away and on a rampage and only the father and son prawns were midly sympathetic. There was no villain I really hated  the MNU mercenaries were just nameless thugs and the head of MNU  the father was never much of a character. I loved no characters either.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say in advance that I didn't hear anything about this movie there was no hype for me I'm simply interested in good SciFi. D9 is in a way a SciFi Slumdog Millionaire if you allow yourself being caught you are totally in. Some months ago I hated Cloverfield for making my head aching and boring me. I hated Star Trek for disappointing me with being more childish and thereby being so seriously than Star Wars. Now I love District 9 for surprising me with a good idea and a subversive view. SciFi is rare because it's expensive. Good SciFi is one of the rarest things because the massive amounts of money spent must flow back to the investors with profit and they think that only mainstream and infantile movies work in that way. D9 was cheap compared to other top movies of the genre and so the producer had not many risks to bear.So the author had the opportunity to use his plot to show us some of the uglier sides of us by unmasking common accepted behavior preoccupation condemnation and greed as essential and damnable parts of our daily life.There is one key scene for me where Witus the main character describes how Alien fetuses are destroyed resp. burned with flamethrowers and make noises like popcorn during this process. It is obvious that those people don't think that the Shrimps are worthy beings despite  or because  they live with them since more than two decades. In this moment you see how easy it is to treat somebody as subhuman. Another key scene is at the beginning when they learn that the Aliens are poor and weak and dumb beings. After the first amazement there is no benefit from the encounter no wonders are coming from them they simply have to be fed. They are a burden and primarily useless. So there is no need to try to understand and treat them in an appropriate way ?But i don't want to overinterpret this movie. It's definitively not only for intelligent people but for people who are bored from predictable US mainstream SciFi. And yes D9 is political incorrect. The Nigerians are shown like real Idiots who actually think eating Aliens could make them mighty and powerful even after this didn't work during the past 20 years. They are villains cat food dealers like drug dealers there is no positive aspect in their appearance. It's a clich and maybe the author worked up some personal reluctance. But the story needed a color equation for the badness of all those white guys.I admit that the part which is critical of society is not the real main part of the movie. The movie wants to suggest that but the main part is the action shootout in the MNU center and the slums. Although this is a bit too long and too tension  box office oriented it intensifies the impression of the rest of the movie.I for myself rated back from 10 to 9 because of the 90 happy end according to my mom who always said good movie bad ending ".

It's great to see aliens choosing somewhere else in the world other than New York or LA as well and this really still felt like a South African film as opposed to a Hollywood film on location in South Africa.if budgets are to be believed they have put 30m to extremely good use. Perhaps saving money by not hiring famous actors. no matter. all the cast were exceptional anyway.The interaction between live action and CGI was seamless. Fantastically done.The whole sociology behind the film was very intelligent the way that humans would perhaps treat this situation and a clear critique on apartheid itself. It wasn't rammed down your throat though and it didn't take away from the actual story.However it seems to have split a lot of people down the middle. I don't know what some of my friends were expecting but some of them absolutely HATED it.perhaps this is because of the following reasons1. Some people are annoyed by the main actor in the film especially his voice and specifically the way he says the F word. 2. I've heard some complain about the stupidity of aliens becoming addicted to cat food. 3. The ending which i won't sayI actually thought the main guy was totally believable. You went from liking him to hating him to liking him constantly through the film and this was down to his acting. He was able to provoke very emotive thoughts out of situations which is a great skill. I understand he's not an actor by trade as well. The cat food thing  why not? alien bodies who's to say the way it would make them react. it's usually full of rubbish anyway so it very well might. they might feed their pets crack cocaine on their planet. have some suspension of disbelief for crying out loud. it's an alien film. And I loved the ending. I won't spoil it though.District 10 anyone?????".

If you've seen the trailers or viral marketing pieces you know that it's about a bunch of aliens refugees stuck in a ghetto called District 9. Basically it's a thinlyveiled apartheid movie with aliens. Expect to be beaten over the head by this through the entire length of the film. You see it's about how evil people are and how much they hate people errr... things remember... thinly veiled that are different from them. People are especially evil if the get together and form large paramilitary corporations that are inexplicably allowed to flaunt every known or imagined law ethic and moral code with complete impunity. People are so evil and stupid that they'll concentrate all of their efforts into beating down the others and completely give up on deciphering the massive amounts of technology the others happen to have. There's no point in trying to integrate them into society no National Geographic teams in there studying them. Nope nope nope we're just too busy as a species being evil. Even though the aliens are very easily bribed into doing whatever we don't even try to persuade them to use their technology for us. We don't even want to use them as slaves. Target practice maybe. We're just too darned committed to being evil. The politicians are in on it. The media's in on it. The fatherinlaw's in on it. It's serious work being this evil.Does this sound like a ridiculous and overthetop description? It's not. There's no human in this movie who's not a complete jerk. The hero? He's really a jerk. Everyone around him is an even bigger jerk. There's no human character in this movie that doesn't deserve to be fed through a wood chipper the alien characters that get any development are of course noble peaceful and loving. Let's just be honest. There's a certain mindset that just gets off on this mentality  these people will see this movie and say Oh yes! yes! yes! We're all jerks! Show us how bad we are! It's specieslevel selfflagellation at its finest if you're into that sort of thing. Otherwise you'll spend quite a bit of time rolling your eyes.One final word  shakeycam.

	schema:reviewBody "Simply breathtaking. For a band as atmospheric and deep as Sigur Rs one could not think of any natural visions worthy to accompany the music. It ends up though that you don't have to look too far after all. Just take some time to see the beauty and infinite space right in their own home of Iceland. This documentary Heima shows the world one of the last untouched visages in existence. The island country is exotic and devoid of pollution of nature and man. Sigur Rs decided to come back home to do a sixteencity tour for free in order to give back to the community that gave them life. Without the hectic bustle of traveling the entire earth from venue to venue the band is able to bask in the glory that is home calm themselves down for a short respite play the music to their own people and get nothing out of it except the joy from bringing together an entire country through the sounds they have created. It is a touching story of art and life that simply needs to be seen to be understood.Sigur Rs' music has always been such a visceral and aural experience for me. It is the kind of work that cleanses my mind from all thought to fully envelope my body and soul as one. If you are ever feeling stressed or unable to cope with something in your life just put on any of their albums all are masterpieces. The layers meld together for a wall of sound that takes you over washing away all your fears filling you with hope and joy for a future coming towards you a future that can be battled with the knowledge that you can overcome anything.I am just overjoyed to finally see a little insight into the artists behind the music. The members of this quartetalong with the foursome of women as their string sectionare all softspoken down to earth people. They tell of their inhibitions and inability to do many interviews or press junkets to support them. Not because they are standoffish or uncaring for those who enjoy their sound the band just wants to lead normal lives out of the spotlight that would overtake them if they bought into the machine. With abrupt cuts to the group having fun with each other we see the goodnatured humor they all have. As one member says he was 21 when they first started and became a sensation. These men didn't quite know what was in store and rather than become destructive to themselves and the music they decided to go in the other direction. More a family than a business Sigur Rs takes great pride in their work and say that they may even take too much time honing everything to the point of perfection. I myself don't care because the time spent seems to have worked each and every time.The visuals that director Dean DeBlois has added to enhance the music are magical. For one the cities chosen for each concert are amazing and diverse. From concert halls to giant festival stages to an abandoned fishing complex to setting up between a couple country houses to even in front of a newly created dam in the highlands for a protest show Heima shows Iceland with an eye of wonderment and unfiltered beauty. To see how the band uses layers of projections and cloth curtains hearkening to the elaborate cd artwork they hold each album in helps to explain the detail and perfection really at work. Seeing them play an acoustic show outside a dam they feel ruins the natural landscape of the city in order to create the electricity they refuse to use is fantastic. Also the cut scenes to static shots of the world surrounding them show the country in all its glory. The kites in the air the juxtaposition of the rundown fishing wharf with black and white footage of the time it once bustled the mountains shrouded in fog the ice melting and the water flowing forwards and backwards leave you without words as it all encompasses you into the world of their sound.All the band members share anecdotes and insight into their motivations and creative process as well as why they still come home and stay in Iceland despite the notoriety and money they have earned since their first album. Through it all though it is the music that shines. True artists their renditions of songs like Starlfur and Hopppolla can bring a tear to your eye for their sheer emotion. I loved how they sprinkled in motifs of the band throughout from the Takk man to the gtis byrjun alien to the birds flying silhouetted from the sky. Heima gets to the core of what Sigur Rs and their music is while also showcasing a country that many people may never think twice about. I for one now see that I must visit Iceland at least once before I die to experience its beauty for myself.".

	schema:reviewBody "After completing a 13month world tour in which they promoted their fourth album the rockoriented Takk the band Sigur Ros came home to Iceland in the summer of 2006 to give free concerts as a sign of their gratitude to Iceland. Director Dean DeBlois Lilo and Stich was there to film them as they toured the stark almost alienlooking landscape performing a series of mostly unannounced concerts in a variety of locales throughout the country. There was an abandoned fishing town a mountain foothill a camp where locals are protesting the building of a dam a wilderness outpost a national park a community coffee shop and a large convert venue in Reykjavik which if course had been announced.The result is a 97minute documentary called Heima which means at home or homeland. The film features gorgeous photography of the country's mountains rivers valleys and waterfalls as background for live performances of songs from all four Sigur Ros albums as well as two two new songs Guitardjamm and A ferd til Breidarfjardar 1922 performed with poet Steindor Anderson. Though there are interviews in the film with the unassuming band members whose recordings sell in the millions they are not very revealing. What does come across however is their humility love of nature and opposition to the exploitation of their land by global corporations. While I would have liked to have learned more about each member this is not a film about the psychology of the band members or why they have been successful but a celebration of the group's elegant and hypnotic music and their love letter to the people of Iceland.Formed in the late 1990's the band consists of singerguitarist Jon Thor Jonsi Birgisson bassist Georg Goggi Holm keyboard player Kjartan Kjarri Sveinsson and percussionist Orri Pall together with backup musicians. They are distinguished by experimental cutting edge songs lasting between six and thirteen minutes enhanced by the otherworldly sound of Jonsi's falsetto voice. Their music has been called glacial postrock and transcendent. Whatever the label their sounds have a way of penetrating your outer shell and reaching deeply into your soul.Those that came to see the concerts were not the usual excited young people that you might expect at rock concerts but folks of all ages including families with their children. The band's connection with their audience is very real and the concerts have a feeling of warmth and intimacy. Simply listening to the ethereal music of Sigur Ros is a revelation but seeing them on the big screen performing their music in their native country is a spiritual experience. If you are a lover of Sigur Ros this is a must see. If you are not Heima may make you one.".

I didn't know what to expect of it except that it would be moving passionate and that I would love it. It certainly turned out that way. They've succeeded in creating an honest and simple documentary that gave me more respect for them if that is possible.This film rotates around a love of music and of Home Iceland a simpler place than a lot of us are used to. Sigur Rs tour their home giving free concerts as a way of giving back to the land and people for what they gave them a place of inspiration and love. They visit the most remote villages all the way to the largest city in Iceland Reykjavk where it looks as if the whole country shows up for the concert.In between songs concerts and interviews The quartet Amiina also participates in the interviews there are clips of the country and towns of Iceland. You'll see its mountains its towns its fish factories and its beautiful landscape which in my opinion appropriately fits the music of Sigur Rs.There isn't too much wasted interview time rather much of the film is spent on the crowds their faces and their reaction to the music. My only complaint is that some of my favorite songs weren't played. Still they couldn't have fit everything into it. There isn't a song by them I don't like and that's a rare thing from one band. Thank you Sigur Rs for allowing the world to have a glimpse of yours.".

If you have ever heard a Sigur Ros album you will know it's a beautiful sweeping moving and often a sparse affair much like the land it came from. It is at times harsh cold and jarring like the countryside and its elements but at other times it is warm different and special like the country and its people. With varying crew sizes they play a series of gigs from an abandoned hillside cottage to a dam protest site a volcanic ash plain and haunting disused fishing factory to name but a few and ending in the most attended show in the country's capital Reykjavik. Peppered with interviews from the bands main and secondary members the film isn't just a live showcase and at times has some startling natural and artistic visuals to accompany the incredible music. Whether you are a fan of the band or just looking to see a great music film you can't go far wrong with this movie it is an audiovisual experience unrivalled in its approach to the band and their roots.

I always said that Sigur Ros' music should soundtrack a film and now it does their own.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Icelandic band Sigur Ros craft otherworldly songs with lyrics drifting between their native tongue and an invented language called 'Hopelandic.' I have long found their music to be both distinctive and enjoyable but continue to harbour some unresolved feelings about the band. I find their music to be rather less subtle than postrock contemporaries such as Mogwai and Labradford and cannot help but regard their invented lyrical language with a degree of cynicism. Being an admirer of the band but not exactly their greatest fan I approached Heima their featurelength film with a little trepidation. However I regard the film as a triumph.'Heima' is an Icelandic word for 'home' and this film is accordingly as much about Iceland as the Sigur Rose who must surely have surpassed Bjork as their country's most famous musical export. I have myself visited Iceland to view its stunning scenery but was nevertheless left breathless by some of the cinematography in this film. The beautiful landscapes of Iceland serve as the backdrop for many of the band's songs whilst further footage of desolate lava fields picturesque villages and mammoth glaciers is interspersed between the performances recorded in live venues and the interviews conducted with individual bandmembers.Sigur Ros choose some remarkable locations in which to play their music. The band illuminate obscure corners of Iceland most remarkably when they stage a live performance in a disused factory in an abandoned fishing town. The interviews with the band feature some frank and sometimeshumorous recollections and I found it fascinating to watch the way that Icelandic people reacted to the music being performed.The songs of Sigur Ros and the footage of Iceland combine to make this a film that is much more than a straightforward performance video. This is instead a powerful evocation of Iceland through the eyes and ears of the band. For anyone with a passing interest in Sigur Ros or in Iceland this film will be compelling viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the director of Lilo and Stitch comes one of the most beautiful music documentaries? I Watched it completely on accident and was totally entranced. Each of the dozen or so performances are done in rural areas caves rundown barns abandoned buildings coffee shops a protest at the building of a damn and only at the end on an actual stage.Sigur Ros had just released their fourth album and finished a world tour when they decided to play a series of free shows across Iceland largely unannounced until the day of the show.In the performance at the damn the band decided to play acoustic since using a generator would be kinda hypocritical while protesting an electric damn and the wind picks up at the beginning hissing against the cameras without PA to drown out the white noise. But as the song progresses the wind stops and the sounds soar. Spontaneous moments like this or when a dog wanders up walking between the performers give each song and venue an unpredictable truly live feeling. A performance in an abandoned building with only the lead singer on guitar and four of the band's string players seem to echo in the dilapidated building.The name of the film translates to At Home and this is very much a poem to the bands native country and the beauty of it's landscapes both natural and urban. The settings are often of faded places being consumed by nature and time in a minimalist nature porn that would Andy Goldsworthy proud. Although in the case of the damn the area of the performance is latter submerged under water as the urban blight consumes the landscape. This visual motif runs through the film but the performances are far from somber as the audiences attracted to the shows are a both young and old music fan and curious onlooker and whole families. The distance created by the obscure imagery is closed in the same moments by the warm focus placed on the regular people attending the shows. The band also performs with a Icelandic poet and again with a man who creates a kind of marimba music out of different kind of stones using volcanic rocks flaky stones form cliff slides and river rocks to produce different tones.An Icelandic choir chants beneath a green hill and we can hear the connection between these chants and the bands general sound similarities even the band didn't seem to be aware of until filming. Though they have a lead vocalist and voice is very important to their music...how do I say this without it sounding like a gimmick oh well...the band have no lyrics as such and sing in a made up glossia language making melodic sounds that suit the music. As wiki explains it Vonlenska is a nonliteral language without fixed syntax and differs from constructed languages that can be used for communication. It focuses entirely on the sounds of language lacking grammar meaning and even distinct words. Instead it consists of emotive syllables and phonemes in effect Vonlenska uses the melodic and rhythmic elements of singing without the conceptual content of language. In this way it is similar to the use of scat singing in vocal jazz.The band's website describes it as a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music. Most of the syllable strings sung by Jnr Birgisson are repeated many times throughout each song and in the case of   throughout the whole album. You can pretend it's just a foreign language if that makes you feel better though. Because there are no words their music has a blankness and openness to it that gives the listener the ability to project their own thoughts and emotions without disconnecting from the most immediate instrument that so much instrumental post rock can miss the human voice. Their music is melancholy grand triumphant and intimate at different times but I wont waste too many words trying to describe it. Words like ambient glacial falsetto are used allot in such descriptions and would be appropriate.The band is interviewed in between songs and they are humble and unpretentious. Certain sounds are beautiful and just feel right no more no less. They like playing for people who wouldn't normally see them and are genuinely pleased that each town greets the shows so warmly. The phrase this is nice is used several times by several different members but you know what? It is nice. The combinations of sounds places and people create a rhythm that just feels right. Home is where the...etc. I just watched this and while it was still fresh I wanted to recommend it to just about everyone. I'm not a big fan of documentaries about bands in general so this was a very pleasant surprise. Like listening to the band's recorded music which I am biased about since I am a fan of the band who are largely responsible for my love of The Life Aquatic and apologist view of Vanilla Sky this left me with warm fuzzy feelings.The 90's modern attempts at Woodstock ended in orgies of overpriced water and sexual assaults so it's nice to see a band somewhere in the world could create free music in intimate venues that people could appreciate and get behind. Almost everyone appreciated it anyway.One of the bands grandmothers attended a show but said it was too loud and when she found out it was on TV decided to go home and watch it there.When the concert strobey light and video effects came on in the final climatic moments she thought her TV was messed up and turned it off. You can't please everyone.".

Each of the dozen or so performances are done in rural areas caves rundown barns abandoned buildings coffee shops a protest at the building of a damn and only at the end on an actual stage.Sigur Ros had just released their fourth album and finished a world tour when they decided to play a series of free shows across Iceland largely unannounced until the day of the show.In the performance at the damn the band decided to play acoustic since using a generator would be kinda hypocritical while protesting an electric damn and the wind picks up at the beginning hissing against the cameras without PA to drown out the white noise. But as the song progresses the wind stops and the sounds soar. Spontaneous moments like this or when a dog wanders up walking between the performers give each song and venue an unpredictable truly live feeling. A performance in an abandoned building with only the lead singer on guitar and four of the band's string players seem to echo in the dilapidated building.The name of the film translates to At Home and this is very much a poem to the bands native country and the beauty of it's landscapes both natural and urban. The settings are often of faded places being consumed by nature and time in a minimalist nature porn that would Andy Goldsworthy proud. Although in the case of the damn the area of the performance is latter submerged under water as the urban blight consumes the landscape. This visual motif runs through the film but the performances are far from somber as the audiences attracted to the shows are a both young and old music fan and curious onlooker and whole families. The distance created by the obscure imagery is closed in the same moments by the warm focus placed on the regular people attending the shows. The band also performs with a Icelandic poet and again with a man who creates a kind of marimba music out of different kind of stones using volcanic rocks flaky stones form cliff slides and river rocks to produce different tones.An Icelandic choir chants beneath a green hill and we can hear the connection between these chants and the bands general sound similarities even the band didn't seem to be aware of until filming. Though they have a lead vocalist and voice is very important to their music...how do I say this without it sounding like a gimmick oh well...the band have no lyrics as such and sing in a made up glossia language making melodic sounds that suit the music. As wiki explains it Vonlenska is a nonliteral language without fixed syntax and differs from constructed languages that can be used for communication. It focuses entirely on the sounds of language lacking grammar meaning and even distinct words. Instead it consists of emotive syllables and phonemes in effect Vonlenska uses the melodic and rhythmic elements of singing without the conceptual content of language. In this way it is similar to the use of scat singing in vocal jazz.The band's website describes it as a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music. Most of the syllable strings sung by Jnr Birgisson are repeated many times throughout each song and in the case of   throughout the whole album. You can pretend it's just a foreign language if that makes you feel better though. Because there are no words their music has a blankness and openness to it that gives the listener the ability to project their own thoughts and emotions without disconnecting from the most immediate instrument that so much instrumental post rock can miss the human voice. Their music is melancholy grand triumphant and intimate at different times but I wont waste too many words trying to describe it. Words like ambient glacial falsetto are used allot in such descriptions and would be appropriate.The band is interviewed in between songs and they are humble and unpretentious. Certain sounds are beautiful and just feel right no more no less. They like playing for people who wouldn't normally see them and are genuinely pleased that each town greets the shows so warmly. The phrase this is nice is used several times by several different members but you know what? It is nice. The combinations of sounds places and people create a rhythm that just feels right. Home is where the...etc. I just watched this and while it was still fresh I wanted to recommend it to just about everyone. I'm not a big fan of documentaries about bands in general so this was a very pleasant surprise. Like listening to the band's recorded music which I am biased about since I am a fan of the band who are largely responsible for my love of The Life Aquatic and apologist view of Vanilla Sky this left me with warm fuzzy feelings.The 90's modern attempts at Woodstock ended in orgies of overpriced water and sexual assaults so it's nice to see a band somewhere in the world could create free music in intimate venues that people could appreciate and get behind. Almost everyone appreciated it anyway.One of the bands grandmothers attended a show but said it was too loud and when she found out it was on TV decided to go home and watch it there.When the concert strobey light and video effects came on in the final climatic moments she thought her TV was messed up and turned it off. You can't please everyone.";

	schema:reviewBody "With subject matter that many might consider offensive fifteen yearold boy in love with his stepmother and seduced by older woman TADPOLE manages to be a charming witty light comedy with a sensitive look at a controversial themea comingofage story with heart.And its hero a sophisticated fifteen yearold played by a twentyfive yearold actor AARON STANFORD is a natural in the title role completely convincing as the impressionable youth living with his stepmother SIGOURNEY WEAVER and father JOHN RITTER in a fancy New York City apartment. Ritter plays the busy working father in one of his rare serious roles and is excellent as is Weaver as the woman who discovers that her son has been having an affair with her best friend BEBE NEUWIRTH. Neuwirth makes the most of her sly comic scenes as a temptress who awakens hormones in the teenager. A restaurant scene with the boy and his parents is a highlight of the story where her deceptive conduct is exposed by Ritter's observation of an indiscretion in a mirrored image.Witty and humorous never taking itself seriously it's an amiable tale told with deft touches and it moves briskly under Gary Winick's nimble direction with some nice glimpses of Manhattan's upper east side.".

	onyx:emotionText "With subject matter that many might consider offensive fifteen yearold boy in love with his stepmother and seduced by older woman TADPOLE manages to be a charming witty light comedy with a sensitive look at a controversial themea comingofage story with heart.And its hero a sophisticated fifteen yearold played by a twentyfive yearold actor AARON STANFORD is a natural in the title role completely convincing as the impressionable youth living with his stepmother SIGOURNEY WEAVER and father JOHN RITTER in a fancy New York City apartment. Ritter plays the busy working father in one of his rare serious roles and is excellent as is Weaver as the woman who discovers that her son has been having an affair with her best friend BEBE NEUWIRTH. Neuwirth makes the most of her sly comic scenes as a temptress who awakens hormones in the teenager. A restaurant scene with the boy and his parents is a highlight of the story where her deceptive conduct is exposed by Ritter's observation of an indiscretion in a mirrored image.Witty and humorous never taking itself seriously it's an amiable tale told with deft touches and it moves briskly under Gary Winick's nimble direction with some nice glimpses of Manhattan's upper east side.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oscar Grubman is a 40 yearold trapped in a 15 yearold's body' a bright prep school sophomore who prefers Voltaire and Henry Miller to icons of pop culture and more seasoned' women to girls his own age.  The problem is that the woman he fancies himself in love with now is his very own stepmother a heart specialist appropriately enough named Eve. Despite the admittedly touchy subject matter Tadpole' exudes a great deal of undeniable charm thanks primarily to superb performances by a firstrate cast and to the wry humor of much of the Heather McGowanNiels Muller screenplay.  Aaron Stanford and Sigourney Weaver are wonderful as Oscar and Eve two extremely intelligent people who know that in other circumstances they might have been able to act on their feelings but who have the wisdom and maturity to see things for what they truly are.  The possibility of giving into a forbidden love' can exert a powerful force on an individual and Tadpole' does a nice job capturing that theme in a lighthearted nonthreatening way.Of course Tadpole' taps into that ageold fantasy of a young boy's obsession with an older woman and one wonders how the audience would feel if the situation were reversed and he were the 40 yearold and she the 15 yearold in the relationship.  I suspect somehow that a film on that subject would carry with it a darker more sinister tone than the one we find in Tadpole.'   Actually there are a number of very funny scenes in this film with much of the humor deriving from the secrecy misunderstandings and double entendres that would naturally arise from such a situation.  Indeed some of the movie plays like classic Restoration farce with an ersatzincestuous twist.  A good deal of the humor arises from the fact that the older women in the film see in this precocious teenager the kind of passion intelligence and sensitivity that they don't find in men their own age.  Director Gary Winick shot the film in a digital format giving the movie a slightly shaggy independent' feel.   This heightens the sense of intimacy and immediacy needed to confront this particular topic without seeming to exploit it at the same time.  A slicker more commercial' look and approach would most likely have made the film appear too sleazy distasteful and arch.As it is we are amused at the same time we are appalled. Tadpole' by lowering the protagonist's age and keeping the matter all in the family' so to speak has brought The Graduate' into the 21st Century.".

A teenage boy Peter Appel falls in love with his stepmother Sigourney Weaver. It seems almost refreshing since most movies about stepmothers have her as the hated one. But I found this movie disturbing and not in a way that sometimes makes a movie worth watching. SPOILERS AHEADMuch of the movie revolves around the sexual encounter between Jimmy Appel and Dianne Bebe Neuwirth which becomes the source of what comedy there is in this movie. Excuse me? Reverse the roles for a moment. If a fortysomething man had had a sexual encounter with a 15year old girl people would be up in arms about this movie. There would have been calls to ban it. But when it's a fortysomething woman fooling around with a 15year old boy suddenly it becomes a cute funny coming of age story? And it's loaded with cliche lines like he's old enough to take care of himself you're old enough to make your own decisions. No he's not  he's 15! This is the classic double standard. It's good for a teenage boy to have experiences with an older woman it's scandalous if a teenage girl has the same experiences with an older man. I find it scandalous either way and I'm embarrassed to admit that at one point I fell into the double standard too and found myself wondering why the kid would even be interested in Sigourney Weaver when he could have the incredibly sensual Bebe Neuwirth! It just shows how deeply ingrained this double standard is in us.There was some potential here had the story revolved around the truly rather innocent love Jimmy felt for stepmom Eve but I just couldn't get around the double standard. For what it's worth the performances were generally all right except for John Ritter as Jimmy's dad who came across as rather uninterested through most of the picture.210".

	schema:reviewBody "TADPOLE 2002Written by Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller. Directed by Gary Winick. Starring Aaron Stanford John Ritter Sigourney Weaver Bebe Neuwirth Robert Iler Peter Appel and Kate Mara.This movie is like Sara Palin's ultimate fantasy about how the residents of New York City are intellectually pretentious and morally degenerate.Oscar Grubman Aaron Stanford is a 15 year old kid who's come home from boarding school to spend Thanksgiving with his dad and stepmom. Aaron Stanford looks like he's closer to 30 than 15 but that turns out to be a good thing as the film goes along. Oscar is the sort of budding college literary dick that thinks reading Voltaire and speaking French at his age is some sort of accomplishment. He also thinks teenage girls are beneath him. That's because Oscar is in love with his stepmom Eve Sigourney Weaver. Standing in the way of his semiOedipel ambitions are Oscar's clueless doorstop of a father John Ritter and Eve's best friend Bebe Neuwirth who Oscar ends up sleeping with in a moment of weakness. After a comedy of manners dinner and a laughably heartfelt scene between Oscar and Eve Tadpole concludes by actually asking the audience to seriously consider that maybe Eve should have an affair with her 30 years younger stepson.If an actor who genuinely looked 15 had been cast as Oscar watching this film would have been a thoroughly skeevy experience. Since Stanford looks old enough to have played a teenager on the original Beverly Hills 90210 that's not an issue. Robbed of its pedophilic overtones however Tadpole stands revealed as an aimless piece of crap. This is a 45 year olds half formed fantasy of what he wishes had happened to him when he was 15 after he's forgotten was it was really like to be that age. The only good thing about this story is that at only 78 minutes long it never has time to wallow in its own crapulence.This is a comedy where no one tells a joke and then it gets all serious at the end as though there's some profound meaning to be discovered in a teenager wanting to screw his stepmom. It's the sort of movie that repeatedly flashes Voltaire quotes up on the screen. It's a film that confuses sophistication with Three's Companystyle misunderstandings. I'm sure there are some folks who think the pretentiousness of Tadpole is intentional. That it's a satire of that sort of urban intellectual preoccupation. The flaw in that theory is that Oscar's pretensions are validated at every step along the way. Instead of portraying him as a deluded kid who only thinks 40 year old women would be attracted to him the movie actually has a gaggle of 40 year old women find Oscar attractive. The only person in the entire story who finds Oscar's affection for Eve even slightly objectionable is his fellow classmate and comedy relief sidekick Charlie Robert Iler. Oscar's father isn't bothered when he finds out his son slept with his wife's best friend. Heck Eve isn't even that bothered when she finds out her best friend slept with her stepson. And when she finally figures out that Oscar is in love with her instead of finding it silly or shocking or cute Eve is deeply moved by it. She doesn't laugh in his face. She gets all quiet and pensive. But the more seriously you take the situation the more seriously you have to take the ethical psychological and ethical implications of it. Tadpole never does any of that yet it does take things too seriously to generate any humor out of the absurdity of the situation. You will find some laughs here but you'll always been laughing at the movie and not with it.There is one good thing about this film and that's the work of the slinky Bebe Neuwirth. Her character may be morally repugnant but she's also funny sexy and enticing. She's like that naughty relative you love seeing at family reunions but would become a chore if you saw them all the time. There might have been a pretty good story to tell about this woman playing emotional and mental games with Oscar but these filmmakers never noticed it.Tadpole is a movie that started out as a bad idea and never got any better as things went along. Unless you're a George W. Bush voter who'd like to have your prejudices about Barack Obama voters confirmed you can give this film a pass.".

His mother is French and lives in France. Oscar is very precocious cultured polyglot and loves poetry and he finds the girls of his age very silly feeling a great attraction for older women. Oscar has a crush on his stepmother. However her forty and something years best friend Diane Lodder Bebe Neuwirth has an affair with Oscar and he becomes quite confused with this new situation. Tadpole is a reasonable comedy only having some funny situations but never reaching a target having a terrible conclusion. When the viewer finishes watching the film he will certainly ask What is the point? Further in accordance with the information in IMDb Aaron Stanford was born in 1977. Therefore he was completely miscast being twentyfive years old and pretending he is fifteen. Further he is not charismatic as his character would require. John Ritter is a reasonable actor but looks very snob in the role of a history professor of Columbia. Sigourney Weaver is lost in a character who is neither Mrs. Robinson nor an example of a faithful wife. The best parts of the story belong to Bebe Neuwirth who is amazingly funny and makes the film worth together with its soundtrack. In summary Tadpole is a forgettable entertainment recommended for killing time. My vote is six.Title Brazil Um Jovem Sedutor A Young Seducer".

This idiot is so arrogant conceited cold condescending and rude it defies description.  There is not one redeeming quality about this character whatsoever.  In real life with his attitude towards women this guy couldn't get laid in a whorehouse.  He's the type of arrogant dickhead that women laugh at and turn away from in disbelief.       Yet in this...whatever...piece women are flocking towards him in unbelievable numbers.  Sure I could understand if these were women that have no selfesteem or confidence and actually wanted a man to abuse them so they could feel some sense of importance.  After all even abuse is a form of attention that they otherwise wouldn't be getting.  But no these are attractive confident successful professional women and that's what I don't get and that's where the whole premise of this film falls apart. There is not one speck of reality or believability in either the characters or the situations.  No confident successful woman would ever and I mean EVER put up with the endless torrent of condescension this dickhead unapologetically throws their way.  If these were destitute suicidal women or women who had been left alone and neglected their whole lives then I could see an element of believability.  But not the beautiful classmates and established women that line up to get near this guy. True all the girls I know would also be lined up to get to this guy but they would be lined up for blocks to bitchslap him up and down the street and tell him to get over himself.       When I said whatever I meant regarding genre.  What is this?  It certainly isn't a comedy there's nothing funny about either the dialogue or the situations.  It's not a drama dramas are more character pieces and certainly nobody watching this film could possibly care about the lead character.  You instantly hate him your hate grows as you realize exactly how much he hates women and to a lesser degree everyone else in the world. Actually in the one dose of reality you do get out of this dreck you don't even care about the women he treats like dirt because they all obviously could do so much better than him but they keep coming back for more!     I'd love to live in this guy's world  because if this dickhead has this many beautiful women clamouring for him I'd have a harem from here to Australia!       Just don't see this movie O.K.?

It turns out this film is NOT just about that but ultimately leading to how he has such high expectations.  He doesn't really come across as a snob but rather as an adult trapped in a kid's body. What Tadpole really is about is Oscar trying to adjust to life at his age and girls who are as old as he is.  Oscar Aaron Stanford  I don't know.  I just don't think they've lived long enough.Eve  Why don't you give them a chance?I knew that from hearing these two lines of dialog Tadpole would not be a raunchy or sick kind of film.  The ending concludes that Oscar Grubman just needs to relax and open himself up and learn to accept Eve as his stepmother instead of falling in love with her.  In terms of the love parts of this film I really like how there's more talk and conversation.  It makes you think that these characters are really getting to know one and another.  The scene where Oscar meets Eve at her laboratory in Columbia University is just showing how much Oscar wants a mature and articulate woman.  He's not a perverted or stupid guy who thinks of getting in a girl's pants.  All in all this is one of those rare mature and honest films that deals with a issue like this in an intelligent not mundane way.  I wish more films made today were like this.Only problem with this film is that the digital look makes this film look funny.  Director Garry Winick needs to realize that making a motion picture on film guarantees a much better resolution and texture than digital video does.  Lower cost filmmaking isn't necessarily the better solution unless you're a first time filmmaker.By the way Roger Ebert gives this film thumbs down.  I swear Ebert is loosing his reputation as a Pulitzer Prize winning film critic.  He gives great indie films such as Tadpole and Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys bad vibe yet gives positive criticism for Like Mike and Crocodile Hunter Collision Course.  Man I'm beginning to think Ebert should have reviewed by himself instead of getting that idiot Richard Roeper on board".

The scene where Oscar meets Eve at her laboratory in Columbia University is just showing how much Oscar wants a mature and articulate woman.  He's not a perverted or stupid guy who thinks of getting in a girl's pants.  All in all this is one of those rare mature and honest films that deals with a issue like this in an intelligent not mundane way.  I wish more films made today were like this.Only problem with this film is that the digital look makes this film look funny.  Director Garry Winick needs to realize that making a motion picture on film guarantees a much better resolution and texture than digital video does.  Lower cost filmmaking isn't necessarily the better solution unless you're a first time filmmaker.By the way Roger Ebert gives this film thumbs down.  I swear Ebert is loosing his reputation as a Pulitzer Prize winning film critic.  He gives great indie films such as Tadpole and Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys bad vibe yet gives positive criticism for Like Mike and Crocodile Hunter Collision Course.  Man I'm beginning to think Ebert should have reviewed by himself instead of getting that idiot Richard Roeper on board";

I thought the plot was intriguing because i figured there would be a lot of interesting developments and i just wanted to see how the film would come out to be. well sadly  i didn't see the film in theaters but i did catch it on IFC for the first time. and i was impressed.i thought the story didn't really have much depth to it but the movie was really funny in some parts. i enjoyed watching John Ritter. for a movie the story felt really thin  but it made up for it in the end i believe. And it did interest me to keep watching it rather than just stop. overall i thought it was really funny and there were some interesting parts of the movie that i thought could of been executed better. i heard about the complaints about the quality of the film and how it was filmed in digital and that didn't phase me at all. i think it's stupid to think less of a film just because the shots in it weren't perfect. i loved the ending and it really fulfilled the time i spent watching it. like the summary it's a very well done enjoyable simple film. i'd watch it again definitely.".

Not to mention how unconvincing a 25 year old played a 15 year old but I just want to say that's the movie industry!! I liked this movie a lot. It was enjoyable it had it's humorous moments but was serious underneath it all. And what is so wrong with that? I know that some people have also commented on child rape or how if the genders were reversed then this movie would be pulled from the theaters and I won't disagree with that. But I read that whole situation as the point of the movie. A 15 year old has sex with a 40 year old and although they comment on it some no legal action is taken. But this is the way society is now a days. This kind of stuff happens and all though it isn't rightit's just the truth. And I can see how that would disturb some people. But really I just say enjoy the movie for what it is. Enjoy it for it's humor at society. Enjoy it for it's acting which I believe was a great job done by the whole castand enjoy it because it is different.  ".
