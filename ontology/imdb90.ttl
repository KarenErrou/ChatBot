The plot is beyond simple a biological agent gets into the water supply of a small town in Iowa called Ogden Marsh and turns the inhabitants into homicidal maniacs. Things get even worse when a US Army unit initiates a brutal containment operation where shooting first and not bothering to ask questions is the order of the day.The film wastes little time building up to the first outbreak of insanity and then chillingly portrays how the town's social fabric is obliterated at breakneck speed. There is an abundance of scary moments inventive gore and even some very black humor. Some moments are so intensely suspenseful that time seems to practically stand still. All the cast play their parts well including Timothy Olyphant as the town sheriff Joe Anderson as his deputy and Radha Mitchell as the town doctor. The minimalist soundtrack is also strikingly effective. All in all this film is a treat for horror fans and for anyone looking for an intense night out at the movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This remake of the 1973 George Romero film sees the rural Iowa town of Ogden Marsh become unhinged when it's residents begin exhibiting odd behavior usually culminating in acts of violence. Sheriff David Dutton Timothy Olyphant is at a loss to explain what's happening to the people he's known all his life but the discovery of a dead pilot in a marsh leads him to the answer a downed plane infecting the town's water supply. It isn't long before the military has blocked all methods of communication and descended upon the town. Determined to render a final solution they don't intend to let anyone out alive.Following the basic setup of the original this update expands upon the story and throws in a few new directions and surprises. If you ask me there was plenty of room for improvement. Romero's film is decent but highly flawed. You could blame the budget but Romero's done some fantastic work with low budgets. It definitely had bigger problems than that. This is the type of remake I wish there were more of the type that can improve on a weak original. We spend the majority of the film with the four main characters as they attempt to escape the madness David his wife Radha Mitchell his deputy Joe Anderson and his wife's secretary Danielle Pannabaker. I was already a fan of both Olyphant and the lovely Mitchell before viewing this and they're once again in solid form here. This is basically Olyphant's show and he owns the screen when he's on. I'd love to see him get more leading roles after this. Anderson and Pannabaker are also impressive getting me to care about the fates of their characters something that many horror films have a hard time doing. One of the major differences between this and the Romero original is the lack of focus on the military's point of view this time around. We spend the duration seeing the events from the perspective of the leads and various other townsfolk. While the POV shown in the '73 film did offer some levels of interest I think it works better as far as menace goes to not do that here.The crazies themselves are well rendered each person reacting differently to the virus. Some are completely gone while others still retain some semblance of a thought process the hunters for instance. After seeing the trailer I was worried that they'd turn this into another zombie movie but I was happy to see that wasn't the case. Speaking of the crazies Lynn Lowry of the original Shivers I Drink Your Blood etc. pops up very briefly as one of them. A nice little nod there and I noticed another potential nod to a similar film 1984's Impulse in which contaminated milk leads people to act on their base impulses. A scene of Olyphant running after a mysterious vehicle that has been documenting the carnage mirrors a sequence from that picture. Also of note is Maxime Alexandre's gorgeous cinematography. Eisner was smart in getting him as he's done equally stellar work for Alexandre Aja in the past. Thankfully the use of CGI is minimal. In fact I don't believe any pops up until the end and when we get to that it actually works just fine.The film is peppered with a number of suitably tense setpieces particularly one involving a pitchfork a scene in a car wash and the aforementioned ending. On the downside there are a few cheap jump scares thrown in. The music also struck me as being rather pedestrian at times. Overall though I can safely say I'll be returning to this one more often than the 1973 effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Crazies a remake of a seldomseen 1972 George Romeo film is about a small town whose inhabitants drink tainted water and become deranged. The movie is slick but still terrifying relying not only on wackedout effects but also on unadulterated suspense to really rattle your nerves. At a Little League game in Ogden Marsh Iowa a man wanders into the outfield carrying a shotgun. When the man raises the weapon Sheriff David Dutton Timothy Olyphant shoots him dead. But the man wasn't drunk he'd just gone crazy. Dutton investigates further with the help of his deputy Russell Joe Anderson and discovers that a plane carrying a deadly cargo has crashed into a nearby creek thus poisoning the town's drinking water.From there events quickly get out of hand as anyone who'd drunk water from their taps becomes first listless and unresponsive then mumbly then completely unhinged. But that's only the beginning of the nightmare for the town which is then surrounded by a military force bent on containing the virus by any means necessary.This is only kind of a zombie film. I mean no one's dining on the flesh of their living compatriots there's no shambling and mindless killing. There's plenty of killing but the afflicted people still have the capacity for reason. One thing I liked about this was that precious time isn't spend trying to discover the reason for everyone's behavior attention is focused on the survivors and how they react to what's going on. I also appreciated that at no time does anyone even the sheriff have this superhuman ability to know what must be done and how to do it. Dutton isn't a superhero he's a sheriff.Another thing that helps a lot is the pacing. Too often things either move so quickly that you can't figure out what's being done to whom or too slowly so that the suspense angle becomes the boredom angle. This is crucial for a horror film which basically trafficks in suspense. Director Breck Eisner keeps the action coming without holding up the story e.g. no drawnout standoffs when it would look implausible and there are plenty of creepinguponyou moments to choke twelve cows. Olyphant looks a lot like a younger Bill Paxton here and he's a good fit  Sheriff Dutton is a solid leader but he's not an improbable one. He's the kind of guy who rises to the occasion not surpasses it completely. If you're looking for a movie where the hero is always armed to the teeth and subsequently never gets much more than a scratch on him this isn't for you. Dutton has to constantly fight with his own instincts and change his attitude during the course of the movie save everyone save his wife save a few people save himself. People who make horror movies know they're making them for a pretty select audience. Lots of people don't like horror movies at all and those who do are somewhat picky about them particularly with so many bigbudget ones from which to choose so standards are high. It's important to grab that core audience show them something they haven't seen or haven't seen done particularly well then smack them upside the head. Classic horror films used the horror of the unseen to great effect and morerecent genre films try the same thing. One reason for this is that we've become inured to inyourface slasher films because the anticipation of the slasher doing his slashing has largely been eroded. But that's a digression right there.Basically if zombie movies in general are your bag you should love The Crazies. If you don't like any horror films regardless there's no way you should see this. The Crazies is effectively scary mixing human emotions with raw blood and gore and endless edgeofyour seat thrills.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Romero's 1973 cult classic was a fun film. It focused a lot on the government and the scientists trying to figure out the cure. It also had some solid chaos in it. It was a very memorable lowbudget film and when a remake was announced I was not pleased.Boy do I love it when I am wrong sometimes! The Crazies remake was a fun film. It had the tension the violence subtle social commentary regarding how the politics in America work and it was a fun thrill ride. What I loved most was the violence. The story was pretty faithful to the original and all it needed to do was up the violence. Great fun and it kept you guessing when things were going to turn bad. The tension was perfect. Easily one of the better horror remakes I have seen in the last few years. My only minor gripe with this film was the ending. I won't spoil it but it felt a little lame to me. However I liked the movie so much I want a sequel! How crazy is that?!".

	schema:headline " You'll be crazy about 'The Crazies'";
	schema:reviewBody "A remake of the original movie made by George Romero in the 1970s The Crazies tells the story of what happens after a highly infectious contagion finds its way into a rural water supply after a classified plane crashes and turns the previously down to earth townsfolk into violent rampaging killers  the 'Crazies' of the title. First off it's fair to say that the new version of The Crazies is a vastly superior film to the original. The story is very well set up and generally builds momentum at a nice pace. You don't feel like you're being plunged blindly into the action. Of course the story isn't exactly new. While it still remains a brilliant premise and was no doubt unique in the 70s when the original was made nowadays we've seen this type of thing many times before. Movies such as Rec its remake Quarantine 28 Days Later its sequel 28 Weeks Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake have saturated an already overcrowded market  with probably yet more to come. But while it's easy to say that the remake is just another in the aforementioned cycle of movies it must also be pointed that when Romero did the original he arguably invented a new genre just like he did when he made Night of the Living Dead as well as 'the dead coming back to life' genre Romero gave us 'the killer virus that turns normal people into insane killers' genre. The reality of the matter is by making those movies all those years ago he was virtually inventing two types of story that would be mined again and again in later decades in everything from films and books to video games. If the aforementioned 28 Days Later is credited with the resurgence of the zombie flick then it must also be acknowledged the debit it too owes Romero's original 'Crazies' film this is no zombie flick. In both movies the victims are not the walking dead but alive and kicking albeit completely insane.While the production value is much bigger than the 70s release the acting in the remake beats the original hands down. This is a movie with something for everyone for the gals there's Timothy Olyphant while Radha Mitchell supplies the goods for the guys. Playing the town Sheriff Olyphant makes for a solid likable and charismatic lead. Based on what he does here surely Alist status and multi million dollar action roles are within his grasp. Similarly playing his wife Radha Mitchell brings a lot of gravitas and humility to her role and creates a very likable character. It's one of those rare moments of credibility  and good casting  where the chemistry between two principals is so strong you actually believe they could be married in real life and because of this you're rooting for them every step of the way while everything around them is going to hell.There are two definite standout scenes in the movie one set in a quarantine area with a group of people strapped to gurneys while a previously carefree towns person lumbers around wielding a pitch fork is chilling while another set in a car wash where every slap on the windscreen is to be feared is relentlessly claustrophobic. These aren't just great scenes its great filmmaking. The Crazies is a very well made film. Even the ageold and rather hackneyed 'no signal for the cell phone' problem typical in movies such as this is solved very neatly here. Rather than having it as a throwaway line of dialog it's worked effectively into the plot. Plus in another key moment that can only be described as jaw dropping we get an overhead shot of a crashed aircraft in a deep swamp. For a remake it's fair to say this movie has its share of surprises.Another major plus is rather than telling the story from the usual teen perspective the movie defies protocol and focuses on the adults. A refreshing change from the usual teen canon fodder this is a smart move and makes it more than just another 'teens on the run' flick. Also while we know the U.S. government is responsible for the crash and the subsequent outbreak motives are still kept effectively obscure. No explanation is ever offered and the film is all the better for it. By keeping everything so murky adds an air of mystery and menace to the proceedings. One small criticism though the film opens with an unnecessary 'flash forward' to a blazing inferno of a town where we see flaming cars. Clearly this is the aftermath of whatever disaster is about to take place because then we see a 'Two Days Earlier' caption and the movie begins. This opening  brief as it is  does absolutely nothing to help the film. If anything it slightly lessens away the impact of what happens later because we've already had that small foretaste. However that's just a small complaint. Overall The Crazies is a well acted entertaining and thrilling roller coaster ride of a movie. Everything moves along at a nice speed and the running time is not so long as to outstay its welcome. It delivers a good deal of jumps and scares and is entertaining from start to the finish.".

This reimagining joins the exclusive club of a remake that trumps the original. And thoroughly at that No offence to the great George A. Romero who created the minor 'classic' back in 1973 but that movie was a poor effort in almost every capacity.Director Breck Eisner's Crazies is moody and smart with a great sense of humour about it. It never delves into selfseriousness not tries to be overtly political. It evokes a sort of mashup of Dawn of the Dead and Outbreak. There are some unapologetically relentless sequences propped by unbearable tension and horror and others of pure adrenaline fuelled mayhem and action. The marriage of horror and action that worked so well in films like 28 DaysWeeks Later succeeds here as well and has enough of a personal moral stance to not seem like a cookiecutter studio product.In the quintessential hick town of Ogden Marsh the small populous go about their normal hick activities prepare for the spring plant attend the popular town baseball games and for one young couple prepare for the birth of their first child. David and Judy Dutton played superbly by Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell are the town sheriff and doctor respectively both of whom are well liked in the closeknit township. Suddenly strange things begin to happen. Townsfolk begin acting odd prone to violence and murder and bodies begin to pile up. Soon the town is in disarray and thing go from bad to worse fast with the arrival of government forces who quickly cordon off the town and become more terrifying then the crazies themselves. With his deputy the sheriff does everything in his power to get his budding family out of hell in time.One of many things I admire about The Crazies is it doesn't pussyfoot around. There is no dull buildup in which all key characters are given an introduction. We are thrust into the action right off the start and get to know the characters as the panic ensues. Joe Anderson as the deputy gets the most interesting character arc again I will make a comparison to 2004's Dawn of the Dead this time regarding the character of CJ which one could attribute a number of similarities including a killer moustache. Radha Mitchell who is no stranger to horror films having starred in flicks such as Rogue Silent Hill and Pitch Black among others is perfectly suited for the role of strong female protagonist. Olyphant who has ample charisma is also pitch perfect as the compassionate but driven Sheriff and I hope roles like this will get him the leading jobs he deserves.The Crazies also benefits from having to real villain it is more a movie of circumstances than black and white good vs. evil. The shortcomings of this film are those found in many horror movies. We get jolts of sound that accompany boo! moments but thankfully this is secondary to the impending sense of dread that makes up the movies core. The very final scene is one we have witnessed so many times before and the only thing that's comes to mind as I continue to see it is that the director does not have enough confidence in the films effectiveness. Small quibbles aside this is one of the best horror films of the last ten years and stands as proof that if care is taken all horror remakes don't have to make us crazy.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Even outside the fact that The Crazies is actually a remake of a 1973 George A. Romero film I have a feeling most audiences still have the infection flicks of the past decade still fresh on their minds. Over the past ten years we've endured quite a few and several have even packed quite a bit of wallop 28 Days Later Planet Terror etc.. While I feel Breck Eisner's 2010 redux of The Crazies isn't anything new in this regard I still found myself entertained over the course of the 100 minute runtime.This may have something to do with the fact that I grew up in a small town in southern America not too unlike the isolated Iowa setting of the film and I can recognize the small town obsession and paranoia of larger politicalgovernmental interests heaving themselves on the livelihood of small town folk and invading their way of living. That idea has been exaggerated in a worstpossiblescenario with The Crazies. The remoteness of the society works to the advantage of the film quite well. Perhaps even too well as some audience members may wonder where the rest of the world is when all of this is happening. The American media of all shapes and forms would have had a field day reporting over anything vaguely resembling this mess.The direction is impressive with much attention to detail taken from behind the camera. It's especially comforting that the director didn't depend solely on violence. Eisner even cuts away from some of the more graphic impact moments coincidentally making more of a psychological impact on the audience.The film moves with brisk pace as our heroes struggle to survive the unthinkable. Eisner like Romero is astute at making Hazmat suits and the traditional gas mask into terrifying images. The very presence of such an image confronting you effectively sends a feeling of utter helplessness into the audienceas if you are caught in the middle of something far beyond your control. Our central characters seem vulnerable and exposed at every turn as a result while scary military men in full biogarb follow close at their heels.There are some issues that prevented me from loving the film though. The script could have used a little work as plot holes were easily noticeable and characters were either very thinly developed or at times made ridiculous decisions. Like another recent zombie film Zombieland occasional overthetop actions of some of the characters seemed out of place. There is very little to no character development in the film and most of the roles are simply caricatures we've seen in countless other movies. Thankfully Timothy Olyphant whom has been on my radar since Deadwood Radha Mitchell who's becoming somewhat of a scream queen isn't she? and a surprising performance from Joe Anderson add credibility to such events.Many twists and turns the film takes aren't very surprising but The Crazies manages to keeps atmosphere flowing throughout most of the films scenes. While protagonists investigating barns and being captured by increasingly menacing foes becomes rather monotonous towards the films conclusion the film just manages to get away while not overstaying it's welcome.Eisner is apparently in the mood for more of this horror remake mayhem since he's already in discussions to potentially direct remakes of The Brood and Creature from the Black Lagoon. As for The Crazies this venture does its original quite a bit more justice than many of the others we've received as of late. For a visually pleasing and entertaining horror movie The Crazies neither drives audiences ballistic nor restores their sanity.Related Recommendations 28 DaysWeeks Later Children of the Corn rec Quarantine Planet Terror Dawn of the Dead Carriers The Stand The Crazies 1973".

	schema:headline " A Clever Horror Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Although recently I have seen quite a few horror films I am not very familiar with the original horror classics made by George Romero. Most of them are supposed to be thrilling and much better than the modern day remakes yet I did enjoy Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead 2004. Originality is hard to develop in horror films because most audiences have seen everything before in previous motion pictures. You can make a bloodsplattering zombie vampire or serial killer movie but chances are another filmmaker has already created a film with a similar story bigger stars and more gore. Yet every once in a while a director will come up with a clever story in order to make up for the lack of innovation in modern horror films. Last year's Paranormal Activity 2009 is one of those exceptions and so is Breck Eisner's The Crazies 2010.If our own government accidentally dropped a biological weapon on a small country town would it take precautions to cover it up or would it admit the mistake and take necessary measures to help those infected? This is the situation in The Crazies in which each family of a small town in Iowa begin developing violent symptoms and start losing their minds. One day at a high school baseball game a local farmer comes onto a baseball field with a double barrel shotgun. After failing to talk the crazed man out of dropping the gun the local sheriff named David Dutton Timothy Olyphant is forced to shoot him. At first it is believed that the incident was a consequence of the farmer drinking too much but soon other citizens of the town begins acting in a familiar way. One man burns his house down while his wife and child are locked within. Another man appears to have lost the ability to speak. Confused about what is happening David and his deputy go searching for possible leads to what could be causing the disturbing behavior of the locals. In their search they discover a crashed plane underneath the town's river and they soon see that it is no coincidence that those who live closest to the water supply are slowly developing symptoms of the strange disease. A few days after the first signs of the virus military personnel suddenly appear and take everyone in town into custody. At the military base David and his wife are separated because it is believed that she has been infected. The rest of the film follows David's journey to try and save his wife. Can he trust the government to do the right thing and take care of his wife or is he the only one who can save her? Although the Crazies themselves are entertaining it is nothing viewers probably haven't seen before. They basically act exactly like zombies minus the biting. What separates this film from other horror films are the emotions shared by the main characters and the political questions brought up about how our government might handle the accidental insurgence of biological weapons on U.S. soil. Naturally every character begins to become paranoid over the fact that his or her friends and family may have become infected yet how to you deal with knowing that your loved ones will soon become uncontrollably disturbed and may try to kill you. It is amazing yet understandable how people's personalities can suddenly change at the first sign of any danger.Overall The Crazies has enough action and gore to satisfy horror movie fans but is also clever enough to separate it from most other modern horror remakes. So far this has been the biggest surprise for me in 2010.".

It is not so much that it is a regeneration movie but that now we have become too staid within the confines of this genre within the last three decades or so.Then the new age of horror movie makers such as Romero David Cronenberg Shivers1975 Rabid1977 Wes Craven The Last House on the Left1972 to Abel Ferrara The Driller Killer1979 was literally scaring the hell out of their newfound audiences with breaking down the barriers of conformity. Today with the remake horror genre that has spread so quickly like a virus across our cinema screens the horror genre has now turned into pastiche and repetitive formalistic clich. Breck Eisner's work here is no different.It's a fair attempt and does occasionally exactly what it sets out to do to scare the viewer but in the same breath it also has no deep seated anxiety attached to it no deep rooted connection for any of its players' in so much that we are not given the opportunity to bond and ultimately mourn their passing. The prime example here is the family brunt to death in their home and particularly the man with the garden fork and his killing of those strapped to the bed there is just no tension to highlight the severity of the situation no personal anguish for those in need. The whole setup from its first frame is all so predictable as to the mans own fate that the whole sequence becomes just a passing moment that only succeeds to pass one sequence to another with obvious conclusion. With experience and hindsight we know better than to judge this as nothing more than middleoftheroad horror that shares the same ethos as its contemporises and this too lets itself down. Apart from everything else in contention there was just no gain in its ploy not to evolve it players in a deeper and richer relationship with its audience. If there had been more time available would we be feeling pity for those strapped to their hospital beds burnt in their homes or exterminated and thus highlighting the need to feel less distant and indifferent and too feeling more in shock and disgust in their demise? Is this the premise of what horror is to lets its audience feel shocked? To enter into their subconscious? Instead of relying at times only on the sensationalistic visuals of shallow character development and jumpscares to maximise an all too a shallow experience that fills the air with empty chances and unimaginative prose?".

The original was made in 1973 and true to the era casts the government as the bad guys  having created this infection as a biological weapon. The original movie split the pointofview between the townspeople and the government agents so the plot was more apparent from both sides. The remake keeps the same antagonist but does not try to reveal the government's plans or voice the government's justification for the actions undertaken. The result is that the heroes and the audience are kept in the dark for a longer period and the tensions are increased accordingly.One point of differentiation between this movie and other zombie movies is that the creatures do not seek to eat the flesh of the humans thereby reducing the gore factor but there is still plenty of scene that are unsettling and retain a sense of their actions allowing them to seek revenge and work in teams. Yes teams of zombies working together. Scary.While I generally do not like horror movies I would almost classify this more as a thriller with some sicfi and horror elements. And the elements work quite well together.For my other movie reviews please visithttpsnomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com".

The horror film should unnerve disorient and startlequalities that evaporate when imitated. The formulaic scare tactics of The Crazies and its contemporaries are so well established that their effect on audiences now is negligible. It's compounded by the remake phenomenon and though you can put a fresh coat of paint on a fortyyearold film can you really expect it to frighten anybody?I suspect fans of the genre aren't even showing up to be scared anymore. How can they be? They know the rules. What passes for great horror today is really 'horrortainment' competent atmosphere and innovative gore slapped on an obvious template. And such has been the reaction to The Crazies which has a relatively high 72 Rotten Tomatoes metascore based on 130 reviews. The consensus is that the film is uncommonly intelligent without reference to the embarrassingly low mean intellect of 21st century horror.And The Crazies does have competent atmosphere though it's merely that. Following a promising start the film still suffers from the stilted predictability that plagues the genre at its worst and it shouldn't be praised for performing above a very low average especially when nothing interesting happens after the first twenty minutes.There's a gravity to act one before the meddlesome government steps in and fs up the film with attention paid to the fact that the Crazies are our suddenly creatively homicidal friends and neighbors. There's your movie what does it mean to be brutally attacked by the people you love? Why don't we leave it at that and do away with this trite big brotherquarantine shtick? All it nets us is regurgitated social commentary a halfhearted compound escape sequence and a film that's approximately 30 walking.And the walking dissolves into more walking which is intermittently punctuated with exactly the sort of scenes you would expect in a postapocalyptic zombie flick. Where do we go? Is one of our party members infected? Why don't you wait in this dimlylit diner alone while I go do something important?An occasional effective jump scare menacing visual and suspenseful moment aren't enough to make up for a wholly secondrate script. It all goes back to that first sentence. The Crazies is not scary. And it's not scary just because it doesn't surprise us but also because it exists in a world without consequence. Early in the film a son and his mother stow away in a coat closet to hide from her infected husband. When dad finds them he doesn't yank them outHe locks them in and sets the house on fire.Okay you got meNow what? We cut out of the scene and never see any of the characters again. What? If you really want to horrify me stick me in that closet with the burning family. Let me feel the smoke inhalation and smell the singed flesh.Like comedy and laughter if a horror film finds a way to frighten this jaded moviegoer I'm more than willing to overlook its flaws elsewhere. But the last thing I should ever feel is comfortableNo scratch that. The last thing I should ever feel is bored and The Crazies is a boring film. It's objectively a step above Legion or The Wolfman but I suppose that's what passes for praise in the current horror climate.".

Not having watched the originalI wouldn't mind doing so I like Romero a lot I can't make any comparisons. I agree with those that put forth that this doesn't go anywhere the genre hasn't been before and that the presentation itself doesn't either however it is a largely solid entrythat certainly delivers and that deserves recognition. This is intense from start to finish. The reason it is and why it works is that character development and buildup of atmosphere are smooth and occur as a byproduct of what happens. Instead of slowing down in pace to flesh anyone out or very clearly set something up it manages to do both in a natural way. It feels realistic to an extent. This is terrifying eerie and creepy. There are a handful of cheap tricks used and there are many jump scares. Not everything leads anywhere though the payoffs tend to be marvelous. I applaud the psychology that does make it into this some paranoia and you do get glimpses of the impact it has on people to be in an unnerving situation for a long time. The dialog has great moments. Editing and cinematography are mostly good with a few exceptions where you can't quite tell what's going on. The FX are excellent in all respects. There is plenty of bloody violenceat times brutal and disturbing content a little gorenearly invariably impeccably effectively used and occasional strong language in this and none of it is gratuitous. I recommend this to every fan of horror. Not an action flick not a revolutionary piece but definitely an enjoyable trip to the cinema. 710".

I recommend this to every fan of horror. Not an action flick not a revolutionary piece but definitely an enjoyable trip to the cinema. 710";

I couldn't tell maybe that is what the director was going for? Either way berserk psychopaths should not be working together reasonably. The acting was atrocious and the entire movie is nothing compared to a George Romero film and I have seen them all. The movie was entirely predictable and unoriginal to say the least.

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this movie  somewhat to my own surprise to be honest because for whatever reason I wasn't expecting a lot out of it. It's quite exciting it doesn't really have a lot of gratuitous gore what violence and bloodshed there is fits into the story and there's a moderate amount of suspense involved in whether the leads Timothy Olyphant playing the sheriff and Radha Mitchell playing his wife and the town doctor are going to be able to find a way out of this mess.They find themselves in the middle of a nightmare when a government plane crashes and  unknown to the local population  spreads a biological weapon that was on its way to be destroyed and whose intent is to destabilize local populations. It does this by turning them extremely violent and basically turning them into homicidal maniacs so that they begin killing each other off. The government seals the town off in an attempt to contain the virus and David and Judy Olyphant and Mitchell along with a handful of other survivors are left trying to find a way to escape. This actually reminded me a little bit of the vampire thriller 30 Days Of Night with a handful of people trying to survive an insane situation except with no vampires.This is pretty good all the way through. It doesn't need any more setup than what I've already written the plot is pretty straightforward and simple. My only criticism might be that for me the most heartpumping climactic scene came way too early less than halfway through the movie. That was the scene in the funeral home where David finds the funeral director and minister attacked and is then confronted himself by one of the crazies  which is how the government refers to those infected. There are exciting scenes after that of course but somehow the movie settled into more of a routine after that funeral home scene and never quite regained the chill of that moment. It's a good movie though with an ending that leaves everything pretty much open and makes you wonder how this is going to be stopped. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "The original version of THE CRAZIES is one of the most disturbing films ever made . I've seen a lot of violent films in my time but George A Romero's film sticks in my memory due to its political context . It's a Vietnam war movie transferred to America where the government and military have to destroy America in order to save America . It's also a film that gives us no one to root for as both the towns folk and soldiers engage on an orgy of destruction . If there's any sympathetic character it's the army officer who finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place but as for the rest of the characters they're so unsympathetic an audience will find the original so alienating as to be unwatchable which led to THE CRAZIES meeting lukewarm box office in 1973 Thankfully this remake doesn't make any political statements which would have been very difficult due to the support of the American public of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . The heroes are the standard all clean cut pillars of middle American society a couple of law enforcement officers and a couple of doctors and soldiers aren't portrayed as trigger happy thugs. This is the big difference between the original and the remake  it's the uninfected humans who are the good guys while the infected zombies who are the villains of the piece which makes it a far more commercial and accessible movie to a mainstream audience. The battle lines are clear cut and this isn't necessarily a problem What is a problem is this version suffers from a seen it all before feel . It opens with an establishing shot of a burning town and cuts to a caption of The Crazies at the bottom right hand corner of the screen againsta black background very similar to the title caption of 28 DAYS LATER .

	onyx:emotionText "The original version of THE CRAZIES is one of the most disturbing films ever made . I've seen a lot of violent films in my time but George A Romero's film sticks in my memory due to its political context . It's a Vietnam war movie transferred to America where the government and military have to destroy America in order to save America . It's also a film that gives us no one to root for as both the towns folk and soldiers engage on an orgy of destruction . If there's any sympathetic character it's the army officer who finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place but as for the rest of the characters they're so unsympathetic an audience will find the original so alienating as to be unwatchable which led to THE CRAZIES meeting lukewarm box office in 1973 Thankfully this remake doesn't make any political statements which would have been very difficult due to the support of the American public of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . The heroes are the standard all clean cut pillars of middle American society a couple of law enforcement officers and a couple of doctors and soldiers aren't portrayed as trigger happy thugs. This is the big difference between the original and the remake  it's the uninfected humans who are the good guys while the infected zombies who are the villains of the piece which makes it a far more commercial and accessible movie to a mainstream audience. The battle lines are clear cut and this isn't necessarily a problem What is a problem is this version suffers from a seen it all before feel . It opens with an establishing shot of a burning town and cuts to a caption of The Crazies at the bottom right hand corner of the screen againsta black background very similar to the title caption of 28 DAYS LATER . In truth 28 WEEKS LATER is the natural successor of Romero's 1973 version THE CRAZIES featuring a plot with a heavy political subtext where characters having to protect themselves against the American military and infected hordes alongside strong imagery . The 2010 remake of THE CRAZIES is merely a run of the mill horror thriller deliberately lacking any subtext or historical context and while it won't alienate an audience becomes very forgettable";

Some of the stuff works from the buildup in the beginning with the family being stalked in the house before it being set on fire to the gory ambush in the morgue there's some nice action scenes early on that create a pretty creepy air especially when combined with the investigation angle.

The biggest flaw is that the middle segments after a strong opening just drain the energy from the film as it continually repeats the tender family relationship that never once feels threatened or in danger despite attempts to force the issue but it knowingly won't and just renders the whole thing pointless. Also by dropping the number of encounters down it leaves the relentless pacing of the first half incredibly slowed down and dull afterward drawing out the film a little too long in this section.

Shenandoah. The craft had a crack team running it and it had an excellent head Commander Zachary Landowne. It was in fair demand around the country for most people believed that the future of long distance air travel would be in airships not airplanes. So the Navy brass frequently sent the Shenandoah on public relations flights rather than using it for military purposes or long distance flights.It was sent to Ohio where local politicians wanted to use the zeppelin to impress voters. Unfortunately there was a storm front with heavy thundershowers in the path of the zeppelin and the zeppelin had recently had some damage to a fin on it's tale. There had been no time to repair the damage. So when the zeppelin crossed into the storm front the zeppelin was ripped apart by the winds and crashed killing Landsdowne and fourteen men. Landsdowne's close friend Brigadier General Billy Mitchell was exceptionally critical of the disaster. He blamed the politicians and military brass who ordered the flight. As Mitchell had been long a thorn in the side of these two groups as he tried to push his views on air power and the need for a unified strong air force he was charged with insubordination and ordered to be court martialed.Gary Cooper plays Mitchell well as an honest honorable man who realizes that the future will be only safe for those who have a strong air arm. He is fighting old fashion ideas mouthed by old fashioned army leaders like Fred Clark. He does have allies like his lawyer a Congressman played by Ralph Bellamy and like one of the judges General Douglas MacArthur  who was the only one to vote for acquittal. But the issue goes down to the Mitchell's insubordination. And this leads to the dramatic high point when Cooper is crossexamined by the malicious and clever Rod Steiger. Steiger is able to get Cooper to not only reveal his lack of respect for the brass but to reveal his mistrust of the Japanese. That he is correct in the long run does not save him  he is found guilty and suspended without pay from the army for five years.Mitchell died in 1936 not in time to see his vindication five years later. But he is remembered now as the real founder of the modern American Air Force. The film is a pretty good retelling of his story and reminds us how frequently a prophet is despised and rejected in his or her time.".

An early pilot in the U.S. Army's fledgling Air Corps he served in World War I when no Americanproduced plane saw action above the trenches of France.  Notwithstanding the Wright brother's initial breathtaking powered flight by 1914 England France and Germany were far ahead of us in not only aircraft design but also in fashioning tactics for a new kind of warfare.Mitchell returned from the war not only a convert to the future of airpower but as a zealot advocating his prophecy to all who would listen and to very many who didn't want to.  The postwar Army suffered massive cutbacks. Mitchell reverted from brigadier general to his permanent rank of colonel a more gentle demotion than many others experienced.The Army's first postwar chief of staff was the only man ever to hold the rank of General of the Armies John J. Black Jack Pershing.  Pershing actually appreciated aviation's potential to a real degree but he faced a budgetcutting congress while leading an army with too many senior officers who dimly recalled fighting Indians from the saddle.Mitchell was given the opportunity to sink the German war prize battleship Ostfriesland.  A rather foolish cabinet member offered to watch the aerial bombing from the warship's deck so certain was he that the vessel couldn't be destroyed from the air.  Fortunately for him his offer was not taken up.Gary Cooper turns in a quietly passionate role as the Air Corps leader who did sink the Ostfriesland.  In the film he's shown disobeying war game rules and using oneton bombs not approved for the exercise.  That never happened. He went by the rules that time.  His and his pilots' achievements were dismissed however by battleshiploving admirals who claimed that the test was meaningless since the ship wasn't defending itself.  Some Japanese observers were less sure that this was a valid analysis.Gary Cooper's Billy Mitchell despite deviations from the real story is a remarkably accurate picture of a dedicated officer with unrestrained hubris whose public and volatile denunciations of Army and Navy superiors for numerous fatal crashes led to his then highlypublicized courtmartial.Ralph Bellamy as Congressman Frank Reid is Mitchell's chief counsel.  A blistering but unreal crossexamination by the young Rod Steiger as MAJ Allan Gullion is the the dramatic high point of the film. It's something we expect from the courtroom genre.  Mitchell is convicted of in essence disobedience and is placed on a longterm suspended status in reality the effective and actual termination of his military career without the continuing public interest that incarceration would have brought.Cooper is strongly expressive while exuding a powerful sense of personal morality and duty as Mitchell defined that quality.  That largely matches the real Mitchell.As defense witnesses we see the young H.H. Arnold to achieve fivestar rank in World War II and Carl Spaatz a fourstar architect of strategic bombing in the next war.  These officers persevered in their dedication to birthing a powerful air force and they did it without losing their careers and thus their effectiveness in that regard they mirrored young field grade officers such as George Patton and Dwight Eisenhower in their crusade to take the Army from the horse to the tank.Cooper walks out of the film in civilian clothing a slightly confused expression on his face.  He should have been confused.  For the remainder of his life which ended before the war he predicted he was essentially marginalized as aviation expanded and America slowly recognized the need to build a world class air force.Overall for historical accuracy The CourtMartial of Billy Mitchell is solid on the central story and fictional on the margins.This DVD transfer however borders on dreadful.  Colors are washed out and voice levels shift slightly over and over.  But it's well worth watching.710.".

	schema:headline " Good Movie But Incorrect History";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie which is supposed to be about Billy Mitchell an early proponent of air power and of his subsequent court martial for insubordination was entertaining but as with most Hollywood productions which are made from true stories was filled with errors.During the first part of the movie Billy Mitchell allegedly violated orders by using oneton bombs that he was told not to use.  That is a falsehood. Mitchell had permission to use the heavier bombs.  In addition in the movie the general overseeing the bombing tests was a General Guthrie. There was no such person.The movie showed Mitchell being reduced in rank for violating orders which was another falsehood.  He was reduced in rank but not for this reason. As previously stated Mitchell had permission to use the heavier bombs.The movie also portrayed Mitchell as being a bachelor when in reality he was married.  In fact pictures of Mitchell at his court martial show his wife sitting next to him!The movie also showed Mitchell telling Congressman Reed that he wouldn't go along with Reed wanting to challenge Army members of the court for prejudice.  In reality Mitchell had one general removed for that reason. After his removal the general remarked that he and Mitchell were now enemies.Just once I wish that Hollywood when making a movie of a true event would make it like it really happened and stop changing things to suit what they want the public to see.I think the biggest miscasting was having Gary Cooper playing Billy Mitchell.  The real Billy Mitchell was a firebrand who wasn't afraid to speak his mind.  Cooper in the movie was more laid back and just didn't impress me as being the right actor to play Mitchell.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie which is supposed to be about Billy Mitchell an early proponent of air power and of his subsequent court martial for insubordination was entertaining but as with most Hollywood productions which are made from true stories was filled with errors.During the first part of the movie Billy Mitchell allegedly violated orders by using oneton bombs that he was told not to use.  That is a falsehood. Mitchell had permission to use the heavier bombs.  In addition in the movie the general overseeing the bombing tests was a General Guthrie. There was no such person.The movie showed Mitchell being reduced in rank for violating orders which was another falsehood.  He was reduced in rank but not for this reason. As previously stated Mitchell had permission to use the heavier bombs.The movie also portrayed Mitchell as being a bachelor when in reality he was married.

	schema:reviewBody "Otto Preminger was perhaps honing his skills as a director because this film seems to be a dress rehearsal for his greatest achievement Anatomy of a Murder which is a classic of the courtroom drama genre. The movie is interesting in that it presents a man of honor Billy Mitchell who not only was an aviation pioneer but a visionary that pointed out to the future in uncanny ways. He realized that wars were going to be fought in the air and that soon the world would shrink thanks to faster planes than the primitive two engine jobs he was flying during WWI.Billy Mitchell was an outcast rejected by the same people that were too obtuse to realize the upcoming revolution in aeronautics. In trying to prove a point Billy is found guilty and tried for disobeying orders. It's a sad story in which a highly developed mind like Billy's has to contend with the ignorance of his peers. Testimony from other leading figures of the time such as Eddie Rickenbacker and others speak volumes about Mitchell's incredible insight on the new technology and how vulnerable America was from air raids by enemies.Gary Cooper's approach to the role doesn't clarify much about the real life Mitchell. He is not quite as effective as in many of his most outstanding films. Somehow we don't get any passion out of his character where perhaps another actor would have run away with the role. Mr. Cooper's take on Mitchell or perhaps Otto Preminger's direction doesn't shed much insight in the character. The best thing in the movie is Rod Steiger as Allan Gullion who is brought to the trial to help the main prosecution officer. He steals the picture in his short time in front of the camera. Mr Steiger brings a different concept to this officer he stands out against all the other people around him. What a presence he had! In contrast with Mr. Cooper's stoic presence Mr. Steiger was ready to smolder the screen if given the chance. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Charles Bickford Ralph Bellamy Elizabeth Montgomery Jack Lord James Daly Fred Clark among others enhance this movie. The only problem with the copy I saw is the horrible coloring that tends to give a fading images. This is a film in need of restoration.".

	schema:headline " To Fill The Skies With American Eagles";
	schema:reviewBody "Otto Preminger put together a real good cast to tell the story of The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell considered by many to be the spiritual founder of the American Air Force. Gary Cooper was only a few years older than Billy Mitchell when he chose to publicly criticize the existing services and invite a court martial and fits the part as right as he did when playing Lou Gehrig.What to do and who would control the airplane as a strategic weapon was a running debate even before World War I. By the time that Mitchell court martial took place in the mid Twenties nearly every other country with the means had founded a separate Air Force. America would not have a separate Air Force until 1947 when the Army and Navy were put under one Department of Defense and an Air Force created from those members of the Army Air Corps who wished to join.No one ever doubted the airplane had some value in war time. Those like the general Charles Bickford played who is an amalgamation of many in the service that Gary Cooper unsuccessfully dealt with saw it as a thing for scouting maybe transportation. Billy Mitchell saw it as far more than that. Mitchell fought hard for money that to further develop airplanes that the Army and Navy wouldn't even ask Congress for if Congress were so disposed to give it back then. After several fliers were killed in some planes that were little more than kites with motors Mitchell lambasted both services and got his court martial.Military historians from then till now still debate the value of the airplane in war. The best that can be determined is that air superiority can give one an edge in a close contest. It can't win a war all by itself. If it could Great Britain would have surrendered after the blitz or Germany would have been pounded into submission by Army Air Force and RAF bombing of the place for three years starting even before one American soldier was in ground combat.My favorite analogy has always been the difference between the landings at Salerno in 1943 and in Normandy in 1944. In The Longest Day there's a famous scene where two airplanes take off and make a strafing run on one of the beaches and then fly away. That was the sole contribution of the Luftwaffe by then they had no more contribution to make.A year before at Salerno the battle took three weeks with planes from the Allies and the Axis engaged before Allies were established. It was a close run thing as the Duke of Wellington said about another battle a century earlier. Planes do make a difference but they're not the whole ballgame.Billy Mitchell chose a course that finished his career in the U.S. Army. He knew it would end this way and he did it anyway. The military as an institution is resistant to change as most everyone agrees. Mitchell fought for air power and airplane development as a civilian as long as his health permitted. Besides Cooper and Bickford the most noteworthy two performances in the film are Ralph Bellamy as Republican Congressman Frank R. Reid from Illinois who served as Mitchell's civilian defense counsel in the trial and Rod Steiger who played the hired gun from the Judge Advocate General's office who conducts a devastating cross examination of Cooper on the witness stand.The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell is a good dramatization of one of the great criminal trials of the last century. And it's a wonderful story about sacrificing one self for an idea you believe in.".

Much of what he said about air power came to pass and eventually the Air Force was formed of which he is considered the father. However at the time the services were faced with budget cuts and narrow thinking. They weren't convinced of Mitchell's arguments. Mitchell in the film disobeys orders about the size of the bomb he's carrying using oneton bombs to destroy the Ostfriesland which was an World War I prize from Germany. He is demoted in rank and sent to work in Texas. When a friend of his is killed in a death trap flier called The Shenendoah Billy sets himself up for a court martial so that he can bring his cause to the American public.This is a good movie which holds one's interest. I have a confession which is that I am not always impressed with the acting of Gary Cooper though I do love him and this was one of those times. One of the posters suggested that James Cagney would have been a better choice given the reallife character of Mitchell. Possibly. Cooper is passionate in a quiet way but a little too onedimensional in his performance. There are strong performances from everyone most especially Rod Steiger. He doesn't chew up the scenery instead he uses his voice like a knife. He's very effective.Definitely recommended though it's not Cooper's best work.".

What makes the difference? Two words Rod Steiger. The crossexamination scene where he goads and scorns Cooper mercilessly is one of those very rare moments in cinema when a performance holds the screen and burns itself into your memory. No matter how many times I have seen this film I always spend the first hour or so waiting to relish this particular scene.

What does matter is that in his time he was fighting for an Air Force that would be able to defend America. He was right that at the time the armed services use of air power and the safety of the pilots was criminal the number of Air Forces bases named for the people that died during this time can attest to that. He was also correct that the armed forces would depend on air power a fact the armed forces ignored until nearly 1939 when Hitler proved what a modern air force could do. If it were not for the fact that private companies like Boeing were developing planes before the military were asking for them would could have been fighting the first year of WWII in biplanes.While many of Billy Mitchell's claims may have seemed absurd at the time the showed quite an insight of how air power would develop over the next 50 years.That being said do catch this film. The cast is top notch and their performances leave you feeling sorry for Cooper and hating Rod Stieger! This is one of my top 20 films not only for the cast and crew but for the subject matter.".

In such a setup the semiotic philosophies of Derrida and Barthes seem to have no place words easily spoken are not yet emasculated and have the power to bully and distort as well as being a proven vehicle for decency.But words have to be linked to character.  Gullion may be brilliant but he emerges in narrative terms from nowhere we know nothing about him his narrative rootlessness robs his words of moral value.  CooperMitchell may not be the most graceful of rhetoricians but both Cooper's fourdecade proven persona and our access to Mitchell's backstory contrive to give weight to his words and a moral if not verbal eloquence.Yet the courtroom drama here shows the spirit of democracy  revealed not only in its legal system but in its military  to be Pharisaic.  The good man who wants to save lives the patriot who wants to defend America is dishonoured stripped of his livelihood and means of subsistence found guilty.  The film shakes with the wagging finger of hindsight where the mad predictions of an insubordinate visionary have proven to be accurate and the military establishment everything he accused them of complacent negligent dangerously narrow.This kind of 'debate' risks seeming sterile academic uninteresting  we know Mitchell's right and the army are blind where's the conflict?  But this is a Preminger film and therefore more than a courtroom drama.  The casting of Cooper is crucial.  Like 'The Right Stuff' this film about the military is in actual fact negatively imbued with the spirit of the Western. Cooper so often Man of the West ranging the open spaces embodying American values now faces the modern world and finds frontiers closed as he is hemmed in by bureaucracy.  The individualistic spirit of adventure risk progress is no more replaced by decision by committee surely Preminger's metaphor for Hollywood.Mitchell may be the film's moral centre but he is a sick man a weak passive transgressor who is made to look stupid and helpless by the new rules of Machiavellian systemplaying.  The film made in the mid1950s reveals how the founding spirit of America is being smothered by the new conformity  linking the military intransigence here to exGeneral Eisenhower's America.  The presence of Rod Steiger fresh from 'On The Waterfront' also reminds us of another recent prominent showtrial the McCarthy purges.  But although the film is impeccably antimilitary bureaucracy and conformist it questions that founding spirit suggesting that such individualism always had something a little mad and sick in it.That's about all I can say about the film because I saw it in a dreadful panandscan version.  Content is only ever a minor part of any film so I don't know how Preminger treated his theme visually only intellectually which means I didn't really see it at all although I liked the idea of the courtroominawarehouse wall being the same khaki colour as the soldiers' uniforms.  Great to see the godlike Elizabeth Montgomery in a rare Hollywood role very cute and young maybe she should have wrinkled her nose at the script.".

	schema:headline " What if Billy Mitchell's advice had been heeded?";
	schema:reviewBody "The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell is an interesting look at the American military in the years after the end of World War I Nov. 11 1918. Some of the names have been changed and some are fictional. Some details have been revised. But overall it's an accurate look at a time in American history and an event that was quite controversial.Billy Mitchell was the top American officer with flying experience at the end of WWI. He rose quickly through the ranks and very early on was convinced of the future of air power and need for an air force. He was well known and liked by the public and the press. But he soon got into hot water for his criticism of military leadership and his constant nagging of the top brass about the air service. America was reducing its military after the war and defense dollars were tight. Well before generals George Patton and Douglas MacArthur questioned American military strategies in WW II Billy Mitchell stuck his neck out to call military leadership incompetent. Yet the courtmartial of a general is rare in history. There might well have been some things other than insubordination that led to Mitchell's courtmartial. All of that is played out well in this film. The cast is very good overall. And while Gary Cooper does a fine job of acting his rendition of Mitchell doesn't fit the real character. Mitchell was flamboyant and outgoing where Cooper here is quiet and withdrawn. The real Mitchell had been more vocally critical for some time and not withdrawn. But he did respect the service as the movie implies.Mitchell's criticism came to a head in September 1925 when he issued a statement to the press. It was prompted by the crash of the Shenandoah zeppelin and death of many of its crew and then three seaplane crashes enroute from California to Hawaii. Mitchell said These incidents are the direct result of the incompetency criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense by the Navy and War Departments. In October the government brought the courtmartial charges. But it should be noted that after a 1924 inspection of Hawaii Mitchell had returned and written a 324 page report in which he predicted an attack on Pearl Harbor and war with Japan. Perhaps that public information was too much of a hot potato for the U.S. government to handle. In the movie Maj. Guillion played by Rod Steiger reads from Mitchell's report that says carrierbased planes will lay 150 miles off Hawaii and attack it. But according to numerous other sources Mitchell didn't think that carriers would be practical. Instead he saw the attack coming from Japanese bases on other islands. In the movie Billy doesn't want his counsel to challenge Gen. Jimmy Guthrie as president of the court because he is a friend. That character played by Charles Bickford is fictional. In real life Billy's attorney Congressman Reid played by Ralph Bellamy challenged three of the 13 judges for bias. All of them were removed to leave the court with 10 men as the films shows. Major General Charles Summerall the president of the court was one of them removed.A scene during the courtmartial is noteworthy. Gen. MacArthur is one of the members of the court then a major general. He says to the others behind doors that highranking officers should be able to voice their opinions as a matter of free speech under the constitution. He said that was something quite different than insubordination. The court in secret ballot with twothird concurring found Mitchell guilty of insubordination. Later research found that MacArthur had voted for acquittal. Mitchell's sentence was suspension from active duty for five years without pay. The movie ends with Mitchell watching as a squadron of planes flies overhead. In real life President Coolidge changed his sentence to half pay but Mitchell instead resigned on Feb. 1 1926. He spent the next decade writing about and campaigning for air power. He died in 1936 at age 56 from influenza and other complications including a bad heart.

	onyx:emotionText "The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell is an interesting look at the American military in the years after the end of World War I Nov. 11 1918. Some of the names have been changed and some are fictional. Some details have been revised. But overall it's an accurate look at a time in American history and an event that was quite controversial.Billy Mitchell was the top American officer with flying experience at the end of WWI. He rose quickly through the ranks and very early on was convinced of the future of air power and need for an air force. He was well known and liked by the public and the press. But he soon got into hot water for his criticism of military leadership and his constant nagging of the top brass about the air service. America was reducing its military after the war and defense dollars were tight. Well before generals George Patton and Douglas MacArthur questioned American military strategies in WW II Billy Mitchell stuck his neck out to call military leadership incompetent. Yet the courtmartial of a general is rare in history. There might well have been some things other than insubordination that led to Mitchell's courtmartial. All of that is played out well in this film. The cast is very good overall. And while Gary Cooper does a fine job of acting his rendition of Mitchell doesn't fit the real character. Mitchell was flamboyant and outgoing where Cooper here is quiet and withdrawn. The real Mitchell had been more vocally critical for some time and not withdrawn. But he did respect the service as the movie implies.Mitchell's criticism came to a head in September 1925 when he issued a statement to the press. It was prompted by the crash of the Shenandoah zeppelin and death of many of its crew and then three seaplane crashes enroute from California to Hawaii. Mitchell said These incidents are the direct result of the incompetency criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense by the Navy and War Departments. In October the government brought the courtmartial charges. But it should be noted that after a 1924 inspection of Hawaii Mitchell had returned and written a 324 page report in which he predicted an attack on Pearl Harbor and war with Japan. Perhaps that public information was too much of a hot potato for the U.S. government to handle. In the movie Maj. Guillion played by Rod Steiger reads from Mitchell's report that says carrierbased planes will lay 150 miles off Hawaii and attack it. But according to numerous other sources Mitchell didn't think that carriers would be practical. Instead he saw the attack coming from Japanese bases on other islands. In the movie Billy doesn't want his counsel to challenge Gen. Jimmy Guthrie as president of the court because he is a friend. That character played by Charles Bickford is fictional. In real life Billy's attorney Congressman Reid played by Ralph Bellamy challenged three of the 13 judges for bias. All of them were removed to leave the court with 10 men as the films shows. Major General Charles Summerall the president of the court was one of them removed.A scene during the courtmartial is noteworthy. Gen. MacArthur is one of the members of the court then a major general. He says to the others behind doors that highranking officers should be able to voice their opinions as a matter of free speech under the constitution. He said that was something quite different than insubordination. The court in secret ballot with twothird concurring found Mitchell guilty of insubordination. Later research found that MacArthur had voted for acquittal. Mitchell's sentence was suspension from active duty for five years without pay. The movie ends with Mitchell watching as a squadron of planes flies overhead. In real life President Coolidge changed his sentence to half pay but Mitchell instead resigned on Feb. 1 1926. He spent the next decade writing about and campaigning for air power. He died in 1936 at age 56 from influenza and other complications including a bad heart. Mitchell is considered the father of the U.S. Air Force. After his death he was given many honors. Franklin Roosevelt made him a two star general. But as assistant secretary of the Navy 191320 Roosevelt once had called Mitchell pernicious. Many places and things have been named after Mitchell. It's too bad he didn't live until 1942 so he could be officially and publicly exonerated after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.";

	schema:reviewBody "It was known as ONE MAN MUTINY in the U.K. since Billy Mitchell's was not a name to conjure with over here. Warners had a similar problem with the Alan Ladd vehicle THE McCONNELL STORY which wound up as TIGER IN THE SKY. I'd never heard of Mitchell either before this but had connection at the time with the world of military protocol and what happened when you broke the rules if only as a humble National Serviceman. A courtroom drama was always a draw here allied with a recreation of the Twenties in the new CinemaScope and a score by Dimitri Tiomkin which appropriately stiffened the sinews and summoned up the blood. Gary Cooper cut an impressive figure in his uniform and though I now learn that he wasn't everybody's choice for the part his HIGH NOON image  the lone man of integrity at odds with his own community  probably made him more sympathetic.Warhero Mitchell was tried for insubordination after speaking out of turn to the press about the Army's indifferent attitude to his beloved Air Service  underfunded and undervalued losing fliers in clappedout planes on peacetime exercises and duties and unconvinced by Mitchell's vision of the future role and importance of aerial combat. Found guilty which technically he was he was suspended for five years without pay but later chose to resign not shown in the film. History was to thoroughly vindicate his stance and the man himself posthumously recognised and honoured not shown either but it still seems pretty courageous in the politicallytouchy Fifties to mount a production in which the military establishment is the 'heavy'. All grist to the mill however for Otto Preminger who delighted in giving the censors sleepless nights though Mitchell's attack is somewhat softened. You want to give the Army a kick in the pants but you want to do it like a gentleman his counsel wryly observes. In reality the infighting was a good deal more abrasive but Coop true to his moviecode never sneaks a low blow.Charles Bickford in his third and final film for Preminger heads up the support as Mitchell's austere C.O. who becomes an implacable opponent. Twenty years earlier he was the villain Latigo to Coop's Bill Hickok in THE PLAINSMAN. Ralph Bellamy for so long the squarejohn who never got the girl in Thirties comedies bounced back on the screen after ten years away treading the boards with a zesty turn as Billy's attorney whose achieving of a deal with the court is scuppered when his client resolutely refuses to compromise. The young Rod Steiger back in the days when he was prone to show his teeth and sneer at the camera gives one of his more modulated performances as the prosecution's hired gun possibly overawed by Preminger an even bigger ham on set. I like the way he introduces himself by rapping on the table as if respectfully knocking at the door before moving in to nail his prey even sharing a joke with the defendant during their pertinent exchanges. In the film Mitchell is given a bout of malaria to also contend with during the trial. Whether this was authentic or a device to help bolster Coop against the new boy's darting swoops and tricks is interesting to consider. All this is taking place of course during Prohibition  which explains why Billy is only offered a glass of milk when he visits the Landsdownes' apartment. Preminger respects his audience sufficiently not to elaborate here though Billy tactfully doesn't drink it. We're left to wonder whether young cleancut Commander Zack might have a covert bottle or two stashed away. Maybe even Crazy Otto couldn't go that far...".

The deck is stacked in favor of Gary Cooper as the hero Billy Mitchell.I read a reasonably balanced biography of Mitchell some years ago and he didn't come across as the idealistic firebrand we see on screen. Rather as I remember it he had married well and was something of a social aristocrat which isn't bad in itself.The story's probably familiar. Mitchell is an advocate of air power and against orders blows a test battleship out of the water with outsized 2000 pound bombs. For this he's sent to Siberia in Texas. When his friend in killed in an airship accident and other friends expire in a crosscountry flight he makes a public announcement accusing the War Department of being criminally negligent and almost treasonable. For this he gets a court martial found guilty and is cashiered.He was evidently correct about a number of things. The day of the battleship was limited. The majority lost by all sides in World War II were sunk by airplanes. No air force ever used 2000 pound bombs though with one exception the Tirpitz to sink them. Nor did air supremacy ever win a war by itself. Not in World War II  and not since then.The best scene  both the most dramatic and the most unintentionally comic  is the court martial scene. Every participant in the trial has a single dimension. There are the good guys and the bad guys. The bad guys are winning at the start but the tide turns and they lose. The last witness is Mitchell himself. He not only has to undergo the agonizing ordeal of being crossexamined by a particularly slimy and sarcastic Rod Steiger but he must be suffering from an attack of malaria at the same time. Man does he suffer. He keeps a handkerchief to his face patting away the sweat.I don't recall from his biography whether Mitchell actually made the predictions attributed to him by the film. They include a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by planes from aircraft carriers 150 miles off the Hawaiian coast. The enemy will be the Japanese. He also calls for the Air Force as an independent branch of the armed forces. This is like 1927 mind you. Steiger keeps making snotty references to Mitchell's crystal ball. A friend and I made up outrageous Mitchell predictions that might have been cut from the script. The Finns will build an undersea tunnel and fly airplanes that will come out of a Washington sewer and bomb the White House and so forth. Well  who knows? Anyway I get a kick out of it. Worth catching if you don't care much about historical accuracy.Oh  and Kids in 1941 the Japanese actually DID do what Billy Mitchell said they would. It began what we call World War II. PS We won.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2003 Thailand produced one of the most jaw dropping action films in recent years in ONG BAK a throw back to the reckless stunt choreography of Hong Kong cinema. 2004 continues the tradition with BORN TO FIGHT a film that maintains the philosophy of doing stunts with no special effects no wires and no stunt doubles. Keanu Reeves need not apply.The plot of BORN TO FIGHT is very simple. A cop Choupong Changprung and his partner are working undercover to capture a drug kingpinmercenary. The cop succeeds in an over the top opening sequence that leaves both a town and his partner blown to pieces. To get over the loss of his partner the cop decides to accompany his sister with a group of gymnasts on a humanitarian mission to a small village. But as cinematic bad luck would have it the thugs of the aforementioned crime boss shows up take the village hostage and threaten to detonate a nuclear missile unless their leader is released. It is then up to the cop and the villagers to stop them.The basic premise of BORN TO FIGHT is so standard that it could easily be used for any American action film DIE HARD in a village! is what the execs would call it. What sets it apart from a majority of its action genre brethren are the astounding stunts and fight scenes. Both this film and ONG BAK for that matter take me back to the time when a stunt would make me audibly wince in pain for the guy on the receiving end. Knowing that person actually took the bump rather than standing in front of a green screen and being digitally made a bad ass is far more satisfying to me. The adrenalinepumping trailer which made the internet rounds during the summer of 2004 contains only a fraction of on screen mayhem contained in this film. The last half hour where the villagers fight back is a nonstop battle.Director Panna Rittikrai who was the fight choreographer on ONG BAK utilizes a number of Thai athletes as the heroes. By doing this Rittikrai is able to incorporate their various athletic abilities such as gymnastics soccer playing and the Thai sport of sepak takraw which utilizes a hard ball that becomes a formidable weapon. This helps substantially in the film's pursuit to one up each previous stunt. However that is not to say that regular action staples such as gun battles and car chases are left out of the mix. The film contains lots of bloody shootouts including one done in a long take a la Woo's HARD BOILED. And the vehicular mayhem is ever present with a number of motorcycle stunts that qualify as the most dangerous I have ever seen in a film. In a nod to their influences particularly Jackie Chan the filmmakers end the closing credits with footage of the stunts as they happen. Surprisingly the most dangerous looking ones result in the stuntmen jumping up and signaling they are okay.With ONG BAK getting a lot of deserved hype leading up to its North American theatrical release it is refreshing to see that the Thai film industry isn't resting on that film's rep. While this film may lack the plot dynamics and production value of ONG BAK it probably cost half of that it still manages to deliver on the promise of nonstop action. BORN TO FIGHT is a must see for anyone who was once thrilled to the sight of Yuen Biao kicking a coconut Sammo Hung getting into a stick fight or Jackie Chan destroying an entire shanty town.".

	schema:headline " Not ONGBAK... and not intended to be.";
	schema:reviewBody "Where ONGBAK is a traditional martial arts film that strings a series of muaythai fights and Jackie Chanstyle chase scenes together with a simple plot BORN TO FIGHT is an action film more akin to DIE HARD. That means plenty of John Wooesquire gun battles and an incredibly high body count with a sprinkling of brutal stunts. BORN TO FIGHT is not a sequel to ONGBAK its not the next ONGBAK its simply a highly entertaining actioner that will keep fans of this director satisfied until TUM YUM GOONG is released.The opening sequence featuring people leaping between 2 moving trucks is reminiscent of similar classic scenes from POLICE STORY. The story then switches gear seemingly heading towards simple martial arts film territory our hero is challenged by a local thug over the affections of a girl before a hail of gunfire signals a massive change in direction. The next portion of the film is a relentlessly brutal slaughterfest as the evil villains randomly gun down villagers without a second thought to levels you would never see in a Hollywood film. Hans Gruber has nothing on these guys! Finally after a few false starts and a rendition of the Thai national anthem our plucky villagers rise up although quite how they manage to slaughter so many villains in revenge despite being outnumbered unarmed and constantly being killed in the gunfire is never entirely clear. What is clear is that the ridiculously gimmicky gymnastics fights are fun to watch the ballkicking guys who fire kettles and things at the heads of their enemies deserve a SHAOLIN SOCCER type film of their own and there's nothing cuter than seeing a little kickboxing girl kick the hell out of a baddie.Our hero has a few moves of his own but the film's focus is wider than ONGBAK concentrating on the efforts of a team rather than a lone individual nevertheless he is the star of two wonderful gun battles shot in single takes without cuts forget DOOM's firstpersonshooter scene this is the true visual embodiment of the modern shooter game a breathtaking yet agonisingly short sequence inspired by similar sequences in John Woo's HARD BOILED and John Carpenter's THEY LIVE.What BORN TO FIGHT lacks in coherence it makes up for in energy. This is the modern equivalent of the kind of crazy rulebreaking action films Hong Kong could churn out so successfully in the 1980s. And its the perfect appetiser for TUM YUM GOONG to come.".

	schema:headline " A good martial arts film full of crowdpleasing stunts.";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all be wary of anyone who gives a score of 1. Only completely objectionable and morally bankrupt pursuits could warrant such a score.Kerd ma lui is an action film that follows the life of an undercover Thai cop who is ailing from the recent loss of a partner. To salve his pain and to fulfill his duty as his sister's guardian he decides to take some time to travel to an outlying village on a mission of good will. Whilst there the village is overrun by murderous terrorist with sinister motives not least of which being to indiscriminately slaughter innocent villagers for all the world to see.The story in Kerd ma lui is solid and well paced. The cast of characters are adequate and they all serve their immediate purpose. There's a good deal of nationalism in the film as it does deal with terrorism and nuclear holocaust but the Thai nationalism was refreshing to me as it offered a perspective that I had never before experienced. It was nowhere as political as the nationalism prevalent in many US films but it was inspiring never the less.The real meat of the film is its action. It's a reckless brand of stunt mastery that actually inspires fear and concern for the performers. Each stunt and flawless take seems to tempt fate. For example trucks perform jumps only to land a couple of feet away from an actor's head. And though some of the choreographed fights between the less skilled performers utilize camera tricks for impact effect there are some fights with hits that simply aren't pulledhigh flying moves full of so much momentum and speed that they need to be slowed down in order to be appreciated. Speaking of slow motion it's used quite liberally throughout the film. I've heard complaints against this but it's important to note that some of the choreography would simply not be seen at 24 fps.Kerd ma lui is a good film that has a lot more going for it than Ong bak. It has a deeper storyline and characters that are likable and interesting. The suspense is more genuine and the fights aren't as repetitive. Comparisons to Ong bak aside Kerd ma lui manages to be a decent film that is certainly worth a watch and as always it provides a glimpse into a foreign approach to the action genre. Without doubt the Thais have succeeded in creating an action fighter that outperforms many of its counterparts from the west.".

I wouldn't be surprised if there really were some casualties at the end of the filming. But anyway as a newcomer to Thai cinema I can say that the actual fight sequences are choreographed pretty well the elaborate death blows thrown in the world of Muay Thai are seen here along with a little different touch as well. As good as the choreography is the lack of coherency far out paces it though which leads me to believe that the story is just somehow weaved inbetween these high flying fight scenes. Which I think is further shown with the always surprising use of the slowmotion instant replay for all of us with broken rewind buttons? which they use for those really sweet stunts. But hey since when do judge an action movie by it's coherence that would take out all the fun out of it. While not a great movie it is still quite entertaining and if you don't actually speak Thai well you can probably skip the subtitles seeing as the dialogue adds little too the movie just watch these little thai guys running around jumping off stuff and you'll be alright.cheers".

It was this that prompted me to watch it without subtitles not speaking a word of Thai. Bear that in mind when I attempt to explain the plot. Not that the film requires any for if you've seen 'Air Force One' or 'The Rock' you'll have seen this movie before.Following the daring kidnap of a rebel leader in which his partner heroically dies our hero seeks solace in a small village. There will be no peace for him for the rebels storm the village gun down countless children and brutally execute the police officer there before demanding the government release their leader. And in the midst of this our hero finds himself out gunned and outnumbered and all that stands between the villagers and certain death.The hero now wanders the village alone despatching a few guerrillas before being captured strictly formula stuff. What makes 'Born to Fight' different from American movies is that when the inevitable fight is taken to the villains it's not just the hero who takes on the terrorists it's the entire village who take them on. And this is the film's real muscle athletes and martial artists all showcasing their arcane talents in a fightback that lasts almost half the length of the film.The low budget means that this isn't a CGI fest of Michael Bay proportions but more in the vein of the gutsy Golan  Globus thrillers of the 80's. Low on money but laden with good and often ingenious stunts 'Born to Fight' is the direct descendant of movies like 'The Delta Force'. It's got limited budget lots of guns knives and cheap wooden huts to be destroyed. In fact at times it's more like playing 'Far Cry' than watching a movie with pistols shotguns and machetes used in turn to despatch the redscarved rebels while the suitably repetitive soundtrack hammers away.'Born to Fight' is a film out of time some twenty years too late for the cinema but by no means a bad film and a welcome one on DVD if you need to kill an hour. You genuinely won't need subtitles for this movie just a remote control to fastforward the few dialogue scenes. If you're in the market for more eyewatering stunts I'd strongly go for Ong Bak instead.".

	schema:headline " A stunttastic actionfest!";
	schema:reviewBody "What Born to Fight lacks in plot development it sure makes up for with bonecrunching violence and explosive mayhem this has got to be one of the one of the most action packed movies I have ever seen with the entire second half consisting of walltowall fights and death defying stunts all accompanied by a pounding techno soundtrack.Thats not to say that the rest of the film is dull either. The opening sequence which introduces the main character Deaw Dan Chupong is an absolute stonker and sets the tone for the movie immediately. Deaw is a cop who with his partner is on the trail of an evil gunrunner General Yang and his gang. There is a breathtaking chase scene which sees Deaw fighting Yang's men atop a moving juggernaut. Yang is eventually arrested but not before Deaw's partner is killed by one of the film's many explosions.In order to help him get over this ordeal Deaw's sister invites him to accompany her on a trip to a small village where she and her athlete chums are going to hand out food and toys to the villagers. All is going well until the village is attacked by a small army and its inhabitants are held prisoner. It transpires by an amazing coincidence that these are Yang's men and they wish to make a deal with the government Yang's release for the release of the villagers.But when Daew discovers that they intend to kill the villagers and also plan to fire a nuclear missile at Bangkok he rallies the prisoners and together they kick major badguy butt!Wonderfully OTT Born To Fight is a great film for action fans who wish to switch off the brain for a while and revel in some of the barmiest and outrageous feats of derringdo to ever be committed to celluloid. Dan Chupong who had a small part in that other great Thai action flick Ong Bak is incredible and deserves to be huge and his costars some of which are actual athletes are also impressive. Even a little girl and a onelegged man get in on the action inflicting serious pain on the baddies.By the end credits which feature amazing behind the scenes footage Born to Fight had me grinning from ear to ear. I highly recommend it to all action film fans and give it a whopping 9 out of 10.".

The plot is standard and the acting is wooden but the primary village location allows for a plethora of stylized fight scenes vehicle stunts and pictorially pleasing acrobatics.The sequence in which a stuntman falls between two trucks and almost gets his head squashed recalls similar insanity from Hong Kong fare such as Fatal Termination The Big Heat and Tiger On Beat 2 who could forget Conan Lee's accident?. There are some great scenes in which various projectiles some flaming are kicked between opponents. The squibs are familysized and the nasty actions of the mercenary raiders don't exclude the killing and maiming of children.It all becomes a little repetitive after a while but the film has a purity and energy to it that is most admirable. The idea of casting proficient gymnasts works well in the sense that we get a rich variety of fight styles and visually impressive maneuvers.Born To Fight is not as dynamically directed as Ong Bak and Tony Jaa is missed but the work of that film's stunt coordinator in this zippy actioner is still adequate.".

Some of the moves he pulls off are ones that viewers would only imagine can happen in video games. The story is well done as Chupong his sister and some of her athlete friends go to a village only to become hostages then revolutionaries. The last half concentrates on the athletes' specialized skills soccer gymnastics taekwondo muay thai and sepak takrawa combo of soccer and volleyball. Definitely for the action fan out there!!!!

	schema:headline " Great action movie but with an average storyline...";
	schema:reviewBody "I will start out by saying that Born to Fight is an action movie in every sense of the word. It is full of adrenaline and martial arts. However the movie does suffer from a fairly mediocre storyline.The story in Born to Fight is about a drug bust going awry when Deaw's boss is killed in an explosion. Upset with the situation Deaw joins his sister and a group of Thailand's top professional athletes to go to a village to do charity work. However the village falls prey to terrorists demanding the drug lord released while they plan to blow up Bangkok with a nuclear missile. But Deaw and the athletes do not sit idly by and let this happen.There is a lot of action sequences in the movie and they are really nicely executed plus filmed in great angles as well. Plus there is a lot of martial arts as well. And they even implemented ways to bring in gymnastics rugby and soccer into the fights which for most parts worked out nicely enough. Personally I think the scenes with the soccer and ballkicking during gunfights was a little bit too much it just didn't seem all that plausible.Born to Fight had an impressive array of athletes on the cast list each displaying some impressive stuff from their given fields of expertise. Dan Chupong playing Deaw is a great newcomer to the Thai martial arts movies and I think we will see more great martial arts movies from him in the future. Actingwise well not the best of performances in this movie but it is not the acting you watch these movies for it is the sheer brutal action.However the storyline in Born to Fight was very predictable you knew immediately how the movie would end. Plus it was something that didn't bring anything particularly new to the genre. Sure there were new stunts and fights but the plot in general was generic and stereotypical which was a shame because it did bring down the movie a bit. And also for a Thai action movie then Born to Fight didn't fully bring what you'd expect from it. It had a lot of great action but in other Thai action movies you just get that one extra length which was missing from this movie.The fighting in Born to Fight was great. I personally really love watching Thai martial arts movies because they are so raw brutal and direct. You can see how feet and hands impact with whatever they are striking and you can see that it is forceful and hard hitting. Lots of contact with knees and elbows to various parts of the body. And in Born to Fight you also have a lot of scenes where people bang against various physical objects wooden fences poles etc. and you can see that it is real and there is a lot of speed and force behind those impacts which makes you either cringe and curl your toes in sympathy pain or makes you go 'wow that is just awesome'. And that is one of the great things about Thai martial arts movies no wires no silken gloves just sheer pure action.".

I imagine if I was 12 and had never done martial arts myself I would think this was just the best. But just as I thought Karate Kid was amazing when I was a kid I laugh at the lameness of the fight sequences now I imagine most adults will laugh at just about everything in this film. Oh if you do decide to jump into these murky movie waters whatever you do either mute the English dubbing it's some of the worst I have ever heard especially in this day and ageor listen to the Thai track and read the subtitles. Yes the dubbing is that bad and the generic Rock music is torture too.".

Initially cowed by the extreme violence visited on them by their captors the villagers are roused to patriotic action by their national anthem and the cop the athletes and the villagers strike back at their captors. This is not a clever movie. The plot and the characters are all about the level of sophistication you would expect from a cheap straighttovideo action flick. What this has going for it is some incredible stunt work and fight choreography. The opening action sequence has some great stunt work involving trucks but that's nothing compared to the last half hour of this film which is one continuous action sequence. The fight choreography is particularly engaging since the athletes ... gymnasts soccer players even a onelegged soccer player ... all use the tools of their sports to fight the bad guys. Not a great film but a joy if you can turn your brain off and marvel at the stunt work.".

Although it's a bit mindless just look at what these guys do best and thats inventive action scenes. which include awesome fights insane stunts. They deliver a fast paced adrenaline fuelled movie.

The action in this movie however could not compensate for the terrible story and terrible acting. Don't get me wrong the action by itself was good but definitely not enough to overwhelm the other deficiencies in this movie. I am just glad a friend of my loaned me his copy of this movie because if I had to pay money to see it I would be really incensed.The story is about a drug kingpin who is captured by the main character who is a police officer. Despondent over his partner's death during the capture he accompanies a group athletes who go to some shanty village to distribute goods for the needy. However as fate would have it the followers of the kingpin storm into the village and take them as hostage for their leader's release. The villagers take as much as they can before they rise up and fight their occupiers.".

After this amazing opening scene we're subjected to an endless array of setups that were unbearable. First the star is brooding then his sister's brooding and VERY hot then they're traveling to the country then they're meeting the villagers. All of these scenes had a modicum of charm but strung backtoback they just made for endless set up that rose the dramatic level about zero percent. I strongly recommend this film to karate movie fans but only if your remote is working properly. You NEED it for this flick.".

If you want to see one and a half hour of people getting killed then this is your movie. They didn't waste time for something called a storyline or dialogue. OK given the stunts are brilliant probably some of the best ever filmed. But if I only want to see stunts I watch a broadcast of a martial arts tournament. The ''actorsactresses'' have nothing more than a few lines before the killing starts. No character depth no development and no acting. There are probably 15 minutes without killing not even done ''nicely''. You can't even memorize the names before the ''action'' starts. Also I don't call it fighting but killing on purpose. The movie is like an egoshooter like a scene from Rambo. The basic story was actually OK and you could see that the actorsactresses would have been able to act if given the chance. The characters just didn't interact at all with each other. Everyone says hi and that's it. Bum bam shot people falling down an explosion here and there. The End. What a waste.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw a trailer for this on another DVD and I was immediately intrigued because it was from the same people who brought us Ong Bak and The Protector. Although the star wasn't Tony Jaa it featured the same lack of CGI or wires when it came to the stunts some of which looked downright deathdefying like the one in the opening sequence in which a stuntman nearly got run over by an 18wheeler.The plot in this one is nothing new grieving cop takes a break to visit a village with some national athletes only it gets attacked by criminals who take the villagers hostage and demand the return of their leader who just happened to be caught by the cop. The cop then inspires the athletes and the villagers to fight back and also prevent Bangkok from being nuked.This movie like most action movies relies on the wild fights and stunts to carry it and the action in this one is topnotch. The athletes in this movie are actual Thai athletes who perform their own moves but it's not just them who carry the fight to the villains the villagers join in aided by an old man and a little girl skilled in Muay Thai and also a onelegged man who doesn't let his infirmity stand in the way of kicking some butt.In addition to some mindboggling stunts and fights there were moments of genuine emotion in this. In one scene a villager is killed by the bad guys right in front of his daughter and just as it is about to happen the camera has a hand put over it so that we do not see it as if we were the little girl.Another scene which had some punch to it was the murder of the local Buddhist priest. Thais are a very spiritual people and so the death of this man was a powerful blow to not only them but myself.My only complaint and a minor one at that is that it takes a little while for the action to get started as the athletes pass out humanitarian supplies to the villagers though there is one sidesplitting scene in which one of the athletes tries to explain his sport rugby to the locals who mistake it for something else.This movie is a wellspent 100 or so minutes so check it out.".

The exposition doesn't to be need more than 10 minutes at the most. Even cheesy songs are allowed this is Asian cinema after all as long as they're during the love or the grieving segments. But what I do ask for is good ACTION.Quick plot rundown Main guy witnesses cop partner die in line of duty at the hands of evil general. Main guy sad so to forget his sorrow main guy goes to poor village with sister to hand out sports memorabilia. Coincidentally evil general's No.1 henchman  terrorist gang decide to hold poor village hostage so government will release evil general. Somehow a nuclear missile is also involved...Here I expected to see some kickass Thai boxing. I didn't. Maybe OngBak set the standard too high. But I should've known when I looked the lead dude up and saw that he was in OngBak's credit nether regions as 'bodyguard 4'. Sure he could do the flip kicks throw his opponents into pottery and every once in a while deliver the crushing elbowdrop but it all just falls flat. Part of the fun of watching the fighting in OngBak was the sense that Tony Jaa is a real badass. He didn't need to hit people more than the viewer's sense of belief found necessary. He was almost untouchable  seeing him dodge limbs and obstacles was just as fun as seeing the beatings. This dude on the other hand should've been dead after the first 3045 minutes which became the most infuriating plot hole. Pretty much every time someone tried to hit him they did. His kicks were weak and flabbylooking. His skill truly was at the level of an extra. If they had made the balancebeam chick the star the whole thing would've been 3 times as entertaining. She had the most gracefully choreographed scenes in the entire movie. For those who absolutely need to see this fear not there were plenty of explosions gun violence and moving vehicle stunts. But just like the fighting all of it felt forced and had no heart. Worst part is they absolutely tried which brought the whole movie to a comedic pitch not too long after the mayhem started. I wish I could rip on individual scenes but that would be considered spoiling...In conclusion Tony Jaa is back to kick some ass in Tom Yum Goong so we can all forget about this ripoff and send it to the DVD bins in supermarkets and Walmarts where it belongs.".

	schema:headline " My favourite nonSergio Leone spaghetti western.";
	schema:reviewBody "'A Bullet For The General' is my favourite nonSergio Leone spaghetti western. It actually has some connection with Leone as it was directed by Damiano Damiani who Leone later codirected 'A Genius Two Friends and an Idiot' with and stars Gian Maria Volonte who fans will recognize from 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More'. On top of that the legendary Klaus Kinski who was also in 'For A Few Dollars more' as well as many other spaghetti westerns plays Volonte's brother. One thing I should point out is that despite Kinski getting second billing and having his photo alone splashed all over the cover of the video I watched he's not in the movie all that much so be warned. Volonte's REAL costar is Lou Castel best known to me from his work in 'Orgasmo' and 'Killer Nun'. Castel plays Gringo a mysterious American who ingratiates himself into a gang of bandits led by El Chuncho Volonte after a train robbery. El Chuncho takes an immediate liking to Gringo and they joins forces selling weapons to Mexican revolutionaries. Volonte and Castel make a terrific duo as good as Eastwood and Wallach in 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly'. Klaus Kinski as I say has little screen time but is always a pleasure to watch and plays an unusual role for him the saintly El Santo. Added to that is the presence of the stunning Martine Beswicke 'One Million Years BC' 'Dr Jekyll And Sister Hyde' one of the most beautiful actresses of all time. Boy do I never get tired of looking at her! 'A Bullet For The General' works as exciting entertainment but the relationship between the two main characters is interesting and the atmospheric background of the Mexican Revolution this is two years before 'The Wild Bunch' remember makes this recommended viewing. Finally the ending is a killer and El Chuncho's parting lines are unforgettable. If you've seen Leone's best westerns and 'The Wild Bunch' put 'A Bullet For The General' right at the top of your to see list. You won't regret it.".

The gang allows him to join them to sell weapons to Mexican revolutionaries ignoring he is doublecrossing  as he is a traitor working for dark forces .It's a magnificent western film with dazzling shootouts between the protagonists and the contenders . The spotlights of the movie result to be the confrontation in the train and the final duel . There is a special remembrance to Sergio Leone's western  because appearing  Volonte  Kinski and Aldo Sambrell who are usually in the master's Spaghetti films . This picture belongs to numerous group in which is set during Mexican revolution  called Zapata Western  such as the Italian films  Compaeros  The mercenary  Tetepa and the American movies  The wild bunch and The professionals . The picture blends violence  blood  action western and it's fast movement and that's why it is entertaining  besides  there is a thoughtful dialog with a clever writing in leftist trending by Franco Solinas  screenwriter of a notorious film  The battle of Algiers . Colorful cinematography by Antonio Secchi  shot on location in Almeria Spain  as usual  and Cortijo De Frailes Cabo De Gata  San Jose  and Guadix  Granada . Enjoyable musical score by Luis Enrique Bacalov  author of The Postino and Pablo Neruda which won an Oscar for the soundtrack and he composed lots of Spaghetti Western scores .The motion picture was rightly directed by Damiano Damiani . Damiani's nice direction is well crafted  here he's mostly cynical and inclined towards violence and too much action especially on its ending part . Damiano is an expert on all kinds of genres as Drama such as Arthur's island  The Most Beautiful Wife  The witch  Empty canvas based on the Alberto Moravia novel  Terror as Amytiville 2  the possession and Historical as The Inquiry . Damiani was specialized on crimethrillerSubgenre or Italian cop thriller as Confessions of a Police captain  How to kill a judge and The case is closed  forget it and Spaghetti Western as Trinity is back again with Terence Hill and this prestigious A bullet for the General .

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit I'm not the biggest fan of the political spaghettis revolving around the Mexican revolution that came out during the late 60's. It was a trend that coincided with the general leftist sentiment that prevailed in Italy at that time and gave directors like Sollima and Damiani in this case a perfect opportunity to speak their views. However I'm a sucker for a good spaghetti western.A Bullet for the General starts out fantastic with a train hold up by the Mexican bandit El Chucho Gian Maria Volonte. The whole setting and the moral dilemma the captain of the train faces is just right on the money. For the next hour though the movie takes a sudden downturn in quality. There's plenty of shooting action but it's uninteresting for the most part. We watch El Chucho's gang as they attack different posts to steal arms for a revolutionary general called Elias. There's a running sociopolitical commentary throughout the movie but what really takes it down a notch is the heavy handed dialogue. The English dubbing is absolutely awful and the translations probably don't do justice to the original material. Some of them are so cringeworthy that the ideas they're supposed to convey become caricatures.The good thing is that the second hour is better as it focuses more on character drama and conflict. The last 20 minutes in particular elevate the movie from just OK and are worth the price of admission. The cinematography by Damiani is excellent the desolate terrain becoming another character in the movie. The performances are solid for the most part with Volonte stealing every scene he's in as the greasy Mexican bandito with a heart of gold. His change of heart during the end is a joy to behold.Overall if it weren't for the atrocious dubbing and occasionally silly dialogue this would be a classic. As far as political spaghettis go Sollima's Faccia a Faccia is still the undisputed king. In the Mexican revolutionera adventure department it doesn't top Corbucci's Companeros. However it's still very good as it is combining bits and pieces from both worlds into an entertaining story. Recommended viewing for fans of the genre.".

	schema:headline " Solid not great";
	schema:reviewBody "Pretty amusing spag western actually... Gian Maria Volont is at his absolute best and Klaus Kinski also does some great character work as a revolutionary religious man who does the Lord's killing for Him. Lou Castel's performance as Nino was relatively underwhelming  it's one of those cases where the director apparently thought less is more. I just find the character somewhat onedimensional and Castel didn't do anything to make it hold up. Martine Beswick gave some good performances in other films I've seen particularly Dr. Jeckyll and Sister Hyde but was nothing special here just eye candy with a lot of rogue.The story is an interesting one although even without the revealing American title its path might have been fairly predictable. I did think it was interesting that the film gradually shifted our sympathies from the Yankee Nino  who obviously has ulterior motives that we more and more suspect are not motivated by morality  to the initially stereotyped bandito El Chucho played by Volonte. Basically this shift in our sympathies if it works represents the film's main political statement. The film plays with our expectations that the white man with a hidden agenda will turn out to be the good guy. I think after he accomplishes his task we're supposed to begin hating him but I for one found the portrayal of the General to be overly static as if the director wanted to present him as a kind of godlike figure. So in the end I wouldn't have had a problem with El Chucho going to America with El Nino which means in some respects the film just did not work for me. I thought Kinski's priest character was twisted and I couldn't get upset about what happened to him either. So while my sympathies definitely shifted towards El Chucho I didn't buy into the revolution he was supposed to be rejoining and I wish he had simply decided to go off on his own path with or without El Chucho instead of returning to that tarnished idealism.The directing is solid but unexceptional reaching its peak during the action sequences early in the film. I've heard the film compared to Leone's films or the best of Corbucci's Westerns. Although it bears some comparison to Leone's Duck You Sucker and Corbucci's The Mercenary I personally didn't feel the action was quite as intense nor the characters as interesting as in those films. For one thing this film really only has one convincing or intriguing character El Chucho. Kinski's priest El Santo is fun to watch but utterly without dimension and Castel's Nino was neither fun to watch nor interesting. In contrast The Mercenary and Duck You Sucker each have at least 2 compelling characters and the relationship between the American and the Mexican isn't nearly as interesting as what Leone did with the Irishman and the Mexican in his film about the Mexican Revolution.Still if you forget about perhaps superior Westerns or superior Spagwesterns that you've seen and just take the movie on its own merits it's at least a reasonably entertaining picture and has some interesting surprises if you don't sit and think about it too much while you're watching it.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Political Spaghetti Western By Damiano Damiani!";
	schema:reviewBody "Damiano Damiani's masterpiece El Chuncho Quin Sabe? aka. A Bullet For The General of 1967 is a very political Spaghetti Western set in the Mexican Revolution. A quite brutal tale about ideals greed friendship and selfishness is not only a very entertaining Spaghetti Western but also a unique study of an idealistic man's struggle between his greed and desire for wealth on the one hand and his beliefs and ideals on the other hand.El Chuncho Gian Maria Volont is a bandit and revolutionary with a strong fondness for women alcohol and cigars. Along with his slightly insane but religious and very idealistic brother El Santo Klaus Kinski he leads a gang of bandits with beliefs who help the poor and rob the government's army to sell the weapons to the revolutionary army. When the gang is joined by Bill Tate an American who due to his youth is just referred to as El Nino by El Chuncho and his fellow Mexican bandidos the gang leader starts to befriend with the gringo. El Nino however is basically almost the opposite of El Chuncho he doesn't drink he doesn't smoke and he doesn't waste his time with women and neither does he believe in any causes or ideals the only thing he is interested in is quick and good money. His friendship to the babyfaced but selfish and coldblooded Nino becomes a breaking test for Chuncho who is torn between his greed and his ideals.Although Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci are two of my favorite directors of alltime and their movies Gi La Testa Duck You Sucker Leone and Il Mercenario The Mercenary Corbucci are two awesome movies and furthermore there are quite a few more excellent Mexican Revolution Spaghetti Westerns  I would name A Bullet for the General as my favorite of the MexicanRevolutionthemed Spaghetti Westerns. The acting in this movie is superb. Gian Maria Volont played in four Spaghetti Westerns and each one of them is a masterpiece. After his excellent performances in A Fistful Of Dollars For A Few Dollars More and Sergio Sollima's Faccia A FacciaFace To Face Volont is superb as El Chuncho the most lovable Spaghetti Western character he played. Klaus Kinski is great as always the character of the rather crazy but idealistic El Santo is quite unusual since Kinski's roles in Italian Westerns were with a few exceptions normally those of extremely cold blooded and selfish killers who didn't think of anybody but themselves. Lou Castel perfectly fits into the role of babyfaced El Nino and he manages to point out his character's cleverness and selfishness in a very good way. The directing by Damiano Damiani is brilliant and so is the cinematography. I would have rated this 1010 if it wasn't for he one minor flaw The score by Ennio Morricone and Louis Bavalov is good but it is no quite as great as it could have been as it can't compete with the brilliance of other Morricone scores. Nevertheless an excellent film! A brutal witty and very political Spaghetti Western A Bullet For The General is an excellent film that genrefans and film buffs in general should not miss!".

	onyx:emotionText "Damiano Damiani's masterpiece El Chuncho Quin Sabe? aka. A Bullet For The General of 1967 is a very political Spaghetti Western set in the Mexican Revolution. A quite brutal tale about ideals greed friendship and selfishness is not only a very entertaining Spaghetti Western but also a unique study of an idealistic man's struggle between his greed and desire for wealth on the one hand and his beliefs and ideals on the other hand.El Chuncho Gian Maria Volont is a bandit and revolutionary with a strong fondness for women alcohol and cigars. Along with his slightly insane but religious and very idealistic brother El Santo Klaus Kinski he leads a gang of bandits with beliefs who help the poor and rob the government's army to sell the weapons to the revolutionary army. When the gang is joined by Bill Tate an American who due to his youth is just referred to as El Nino by El Chuncho and his fellow Mexican bandidos the gang leader starts to befriend with the gringo.

	schema:reviewBody "Damiano Damiani's 1966 film 'A Bullet for the General' is one of the first examples of the Zapata Western a subgenre of the Spaghetti Western that mostly dealt with political themes during the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th century. Gian Maria Volont plays El Chucho the leader of a Mexican bandit gang who earn their pay selling arms to revolutionaries  he meets with a suave gringo named Bill Tate played by Lou Castel who claims to be on the run from the law and soon finds himself inducted into the group and deep in the heart of the Mexican revolution.Despite the simple sounding premise 'A Bullet for the General' displays a great depth of character as the protagonists relationships shift with the plot before inevitably exchanging roles. The first hour or so seems like a standard western affair with lots of the usual train hijacks and bandit raids but as the characters develop and their relationships become more strained we see some marvellous performances from the suspicious El Chucho his brother El Santo a fanatical Christian revolutionary played by Klaus Kinski and the cool and unflustered Bill 'Nio' Tate.The doubt displayed by El Chucho towards Tate really sets up the finale and as the film nears the heart of the revolution Tate's motives become clear  but that doesn't stop Damiani pulling a nice twist at the end endearing Volont's character and providing a juxtaposition to the characters he made famous in some of Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti Westerns. In a film dealing largely with rolereversal this is particularly apt.I didn't quite know what to expect from 'A Bullet for the General' I hadn't previously heard of the director and apparently this was his first foray into the Western genre  but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Providing a good mix of action and politics with commendable performances from Volont Kinski and Castel 'A Bullet for the General' is an intriguing and unique example of the Spaghetti Western and well worth your time whether you're a fan of the genre or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Damiano Damiani's first stab at the spaghetti westernGian Maria Volonte veteran of Sergio Leone films plays Chuncho leader of a Mexican Bandit gang who sell arms to the revolutionaries. Lou Castel is a calm smooth American who tags along with the bandits eventually exerting an influence on them. There is also a strong performance by another spaghetti western regular Klaus Kinski as a slightly crazed Christian revolutionary. As time goes by the relationships between them change and become more complex revealing the characters' true colours. Along the way there is plenty of Mexican Bandit action  train holdups raids on forts peasant liberation  to keep up the pace of the film.To be fair the first hour or so was pretty average  there were a few good moments such as an attack on a landowner's mansion but nothing really exceptional. However as the plot begins to come to a head things really start to pick up with issues of betrayal trust and ideology coming to the fore. The final scene really makes an impact as Chuncho is forced to choose between a wealthy and comfortable future in the states and his loyalty to the revolutionary cause. Needless to say he makes the right choice and he makes it in style resulting an ending which manages to be at the same time funny exciting and emotional.One of the cleverest things about this film is that in many ways it is a role reversal of the typical spaghetti western. We see the cool collected Yankee stranger as the villain and the scruffy Mexican bandit as the hero as far as those concepts exist in the genre. The casting of Volonte here is particularly apt since in Leone's films he WAS that Mexican bandit villain.Overall Quien Sabe? is well above average combining action politics and a good storyline into one excellent movie.".

Tate called Nino by his new friends tags along as they get guns free the poor and attempt to get paid for their efforts.Thats wildly simplified and doesn't do the complexity of this film justice. What is going on in the film is often not apparent until you get to the very end of the movie. No one is who they seem to be and everyone has some sort of other motive for what they are doing. Its a complex film that you have to stay with since you can never be certain what is going on.For a long stretch of the film I wasn't certain what I thought of it. As I said this is a story that is ever changing and evolving as it goes and which you can't say whether you like or not until you get to the very end. It seems like an enjoyable mean but slightly confused western for most of its running time. Our nominal hero Nino rapidly evolves into something else. He is always up to something and rarely is it any good. He's hard to root for or even to like. You instead you have to root for Chuncho which is a bit odd at first since he's a bandit and the bad guy. By the end you're rooting for Chuncho while you're still not sure about Nino. In the end though it all comes together and it reveals itself to be a quite special movie.This is a movie to see if you like westerns or even good movies for that matter. Its a film that engages you and moves you and your emotions. Its nice that an entertaining film such as this can also have other things on its mind yet not get lost on those other things or lose the enjoyment factor there's a good deal of political satire woven into the story.Definitely recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "aka A BULLET FOR THE GENERALAfter hearing the Ennio Morricone soundtrack I knew I wanted to see the film that went with it and I'm glad I did. And if your into spaghetti western soundtracks then this one is essential to add to your collection. Beautiful Spanish themes and orchestration by Luis Bacalov. This also goes along the same lines of Leone's DUCK YOU SUCKER 1971 and Sergio Corbucci's COMPANEROS 1970 in that it involves a foreign mercenary who gets involved in the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th century. I like it almost as much as those two films although babyfaced Lou Castel as El Nino the gringo doesn't make much of an impression as an assassinforhire used by the Mexican government to take out Elias Jamie Fernandez and collect 10000 pesos in gold. He uses a gold bullet and a sniper rifle in order to commit his deed.In order for El Nino to carry out his mission he has to hook up with El Cuncho Gian Maria Volonte who sells guns to Elias. At least Volonte is fairly animated compared to the wooden Castel. Cuncho's brother the priest El Santo Klaus Kinski and Adelita Martine Beswick of Hammer horror and 007 fame are along for the ride.The action is fairly decent and the film has a great feel for Mexico even though it was filmed in the usual Almeria Spain locations. It moves along at a leisurely pace and even though it has a 2hr. playing time I didn't feel bored by any of it at all. The only flaw is the ending where El Cuncho kills El Nino as Nino pulls out on a train. He really doesn't give any reason at all for doing this other than he is 'slightly' mad. The anamorphic widescreen Anchor Bay DVD uses as good a print as expected with light grain showing through from a wellsourced print. No extras beyond an American and European trailer. A welcome addition to any spaghetti western collection. Recommended.7 out of 10".

The script is exellent and although most is dubbed as always with these moviesthe storyline is as engrossing as the action. Klaus Kinski has fun as the mad priestbandit and the whole thing looks terrific in a 235 print really utilising the huge landscapes.There is a terrific moment at the end where one character does a simple thing and the other character suddenly realises what has been going on all along.A truly terrific picture and in feel not that far away from Leones'later Fistful of Dynamite.".

They allow a taciturn American gringo into their band Lou Castel oblivious to his objectives. Klaus Kinski plays the semicrazy priest of the bandits I mean revolutionaries while Martine Beswick is on hand as the babe of the bunch.This is a decent Spaghetti Western focusing on Mexican bandits. The tone is serious and the cast costumes dirt and sweat lend to the gritty realism. The opening sequence where a munitions train is forced to stop due to a crucified army captain blocking the tracks is notable. The script respects the intelligence of the viewer and doesn't spell everything else even while everything is obvious if you read between the lines. Volont who plays the filthy but amicable Mexican protagonist is best known for his roles with Clint Eastwood in A Fistful of Dollars 1964 and For a Few Dollars More 1965.  The score by Luis Bacalov is quite good and was supervised by the inimitable Ennio Morricone. THE FILM RUNS 115 minutes and was shot in Almera  Guadix Spain with indoor sequences done in Rome.

Complex characterizations interesting narrative  an ending that will leave U a bit shocked perhaps.Other's have reviewed the plot. I will say Lou Costello as El Nino is a cypher in this film his character is rather blank  not easily read but that's the point. Other reviews I have read remark he has no charisma or his characterization is boring but they miss the point he is a professional assassin  he knows exactly what he wants  what he is doing  he is smarter than everyone around him. Chuncho's first realization there is something more to El Nino comes in a quiet scene where in he asks Costello as El Nino 'U don't like wine U don't like women what do U like' paraphrasing El Nino replies 'Gold'.Kinski is wonderful as always. Highly recommended spaghetti western! IMO this is Volante's best characterization although 'Face to Face' is very close in my ranking here his emotional arc is extreme  he is an excellent actor. I always enjoyed his performances but in this film he really does a wonderful wonderful job of acting. He makes most modern American actors look like rank beginners in comparison. He was truly gifted. RIP amigo.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the Mexican Revolution Chuncho is a bandit running guns for peasant leader Elias. Whilst robbing an army supply train Chuncho meets Nino an unusual American who wants to join his group and seems to have a great interest in meeting Elias ...This distinctive Italian western has several great things going for it  a fine cast a stylish score by Luis Bacalov lots of exciting action scenes  but its real asset is a terrific story by Salvatore Laurani and Franco Solinas. The scripts for many spaghetti westerns are just simple revenge dramas but this has real character depth and a powerful political context forcing the uneducated Chuncho to decide what he really believes in. Is he an outlaw or a champion of the poor or simply a mercenary like Nino. He may not be very smart  he's unable to read or even count and he doesn't realise Nino's real mission when other men would  but in the end he does the right thing for his country and for the revolution. The other characters are equally multifaceted El Santo views the fight as a crusade for God's justice Nino may be a cold killer but he's mostly honest upfront and doesn't doublecross Chuncho when it would be so easy to do so and Adelita is one of the few powerful and independent women in these movies who holds her own fights for herself and isn't interested in macho bravado. Volont Kinski and gorgeous darkhaired BritishJamaican Beswick check her out also in One Million Years B.C. and Dr Jekyll  Sister Hyde are all terrific but perhaps the real find is Colombian actor Castel as the enigmatic NinoTate. With his grey suit fastidious nature and let'sgetonwithit attitude he is unlike anybody else and a perfect oppositesattract match for the riproaring Chuncho and it's through him and his callous disregard for the Mexican people and their struggle for identity that the movie really scores. Damiano's direction is solid and he deserves plaudits for making a lefty arthouse picture disguised as a contemporary entertainment. Like so many Italian films of the period this movie has several titles the original is Quin Sabe ? translating in Spanish as Who knows ? but it is perhaps better known by the US title A Bullet For The General and is also sometimes subtitled El Chucho meaning muttdog in Spanish which is a perfect description of Volont's character despite the missing letter. A stylish thoughtprovoking and wellacted western for the discerning cult movie enthusiast.".

It is everything one would expect from a man who is known as one of the premiere stylists of the cinema and more. It is poetry it is art and it is almost ruthlessly compelling.Whereas most sports documentaries are relatively cut and dry in that they focus mainly on the winners Ichikawa has almost no regard for winning or losing at all. For him it is about the event the preparation and the movement embodied in Olympic competition  and the film follows both the winners and the losers. The film is incredibly textural. Sight sound and movement  even the most imperceptible  all weave together to form a remarkable tapestry that is as much about the director's own concerns as it is about the Games themselves. It is for this reason that the film initially had a rather stormy reception from those that had commissioned Ichikawa to make the film and given him an army of cameramen to do so though if my recollection is correct it went on to break boxoffice records in Japan. Tokyo Olympiad is not a film about the victory of winning it is about the victory of attending  of being amongst the awesome crowds the athletes the bodies in motion. Being there is it's own victory which is why Ichikawa focuses so much on the athletes from the newly formed African nation of Chad who although they do not come close to winning any medals are the first representatives of their country to appear in the Olympic Games. For Ichikawa their story is just as triumphant as that of the Ethiopian longdistance runner who unflinchingly leaves all his opponents in the dust and goes on to win his event by a mile. Tokyo Olympiad is not just about the realm of athletic or Olympic experience it is about the human experience and about creating cinema out of it. At nearly 3 hours in length it is neither a minute too short or too long and I personally feel privileged to have seen it.".

Ichikawa understands something that five years later Michael Wadleigh director of Woodstock would understand about filming an event though Woodstock will always be the better more incredibly watchable film for me. And it is simply put to make it an EVENT in bold letters for people who may not even really usually watch the Olympics. The way he uses his many many many cameras an exhaustively large crew is staggering and just in the first half hour or so when the countries all line up and the audience fills in as the games kick off it's done in a very dynamic style. He alternates interestingly between big wide shots of the crowds like Woodstock seeming larger than it really is with everyone packed in thousands of masses the stadium itself and then to closeups of individuals and bodies moving. It's this side of the film the technical one that is most worthwhile to see in the film.If it's less than perfect it's because frankly it almost does become 'too much' to see so many games that go on in the near threehour running time. And the narration voice that pops up now and again sounds way too much like a narrator from old newsreels trying to add emphasis where it's not really needed. It's too immense an event with too many goals vied for victory to add on extra words. But there are highlights though such as the 100 meter dash done in a slowmotion that might echo some of Ichikawa's other narrative films. And the Joe Frazier boxing match while brief is memorable. Sometimes Tokyo Olympiad comes off almost like an avantgarde film as much as it does just straighton documentary and it's here that I got drawn in. Of all major events involving sports and other games and activities and trials and such the Olympics brings together all cultures for the sake of competing for a country's honor and respect and Ichikawa has a very good balance between showing that and adding a distinct style to the numerous events. In fact Ichikawa has what might be the best avantgarde sports documentary ever made at least in the past forty or so years.".

	schema:reviewBody "It pales in comparison to Olympia that gorgeous Olympic documentary made during the 1936 Olympics by the Nazis' head filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl but Kon Ichiwa's Tokyo Olympiad is quite a good film itself. It documents the 1964 Olympics the first ever to be held in Asia. Like Riefenstahl Kon Ichiwa attempts to construct a document of abstract beauty out of these amazing athletes a testament to the human form. He succeeds at times but it's too much just a document of the events at times and too little abstraction. And I can only watch so much running before I get bored! The film has its high points and low points. The best moments are during the opening and closing ceremonies the bicycle race volleyball race walking the marathon finale and especially the gymnastics which end the first half of the film. The gymnastics competition is the only sequence in the film that hits the same level as Olympia. It's also nice to see the events in color there are a couple notably the amazing hammer throw in bw. The black and white cinematography is beautiful in Olympia but its even more wonderous to see the oranges of the sun and the Olympic flame and the colors of the flags and the athletes' multihued uniforms. And the widescreen cinematography is often gorgeous although I don't necessarily think that a wider screen just because it shows more action is better than the old Academy ratio of 1.331. Riefenstahl used that aspect ratio masterfully as Ichiwa does here. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film is that we only get to see about thirty seconds of a boxing match with Joe Frazier the only athlete whom I and probably everyone else as well recognized in the film and then Ichiwa follows him most of the way to the locker room until Frazier turns around and waves goodbye. There is however a high jumper from the U.S. near the beginning of the film named John Rambo. I don't think there's any relation between him and the psycho Vietnam soldier. Much of the second half is dull and there are several events almost cruelly ignored. Well maybe not ignored but for instance there is perhaps half a minute of basketball. Perhaps it was an unpopular sport in Japan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of course it's easy to compare this movie to Leni Riefenstahl's Olympiad movies about the Olympic summer games in Berlin of 1936 but there is also a very good reason to compare both ambitious projects besides the fact that they share the same subject. Both are also being shot and told in a very similar way with as of course big difference that this documentary is in color and filmed with more modern technologies.The documentary shows everything involving the Olympic games. From athletes preparing to the crowds cheering for their favorites. Winners and losers the ignition of the Olympic flame and the closing ceremony. But foremost it still focuses on the sports for obvious reasons. It shows beautifully how it's being experienced and executed by the athletes. This is more than just a camera registration of the Olympics. It takes us to places no other camera's are ever allowed and shows us shots from multiple different angles and of things that are never shown on TV.It extensively shows a lot of the sports some featured still more prominently than others. It's of course impossible to give all 163 events and 5151 athletes from 93 different countries an equal amount of attention. But the movie manages to find a nice balance between the most important and popular sports and the more surprising and shocking moments of the 1964 Olympics. Basically each sport gets filmed and edited in a different stylish way but at all times the movie feels like one whole that just flies by even though it's quite a long one.And stylish is certainly a good word to describe this documentary as. Some of the sports are filmed simply beautifully and are absolutely captivating to watch. They even manage to at times build up a good tension even though the outcomes of it are already known for almost 50 years by now. There are too many moments that stand out to name but I would nevertheless still like to mention the registration of the marathon which got featured at the end of the documentary. It's also the sport that gets featured the longest and it's absolutely beautiful and special to watch. It also really makes you respect the athletes all the more.Like basically every Olympics some memorable and legendary events occurred during the games. Don Schollander winning 4 golden medals Joe Frazier becoming the heavyweight boxing winner Abebe Bikila winning the Olympic marathon for the second time Anton Geesink become the very first Olympic open category judo champion which was entire an Asian dominated sport at the time and many more memorable moments which are all shown in an unique and beautiful way within this documentary.It's also fun to see how non of the sports have really changed over the years and how all of the athletes in this documentary show all of the same emotions and passion for their sport. Thing that changed the most are some of the country's flags it seems.The entire documentary still feels pretty dark but as it turns out the 1964 were also considered to be dark and cold at the time. In other words the documentary simply does a great job at capturing the mood and atmosphere of its time and place.If I have to say still one real negative thing about this documentary it would be the fact that basically all of the sounds were obviously later added to the documentary. Athletes breathing athletes running athletes hitting a ball. All of the sounds come straight out of a studio which just doesn't always sound natural enough. It's even somewhat comical and annoying at times especially when the images and sounds don't really go together. It's weird hearing a crowed go ballistic while in the background the mostly Japanese spectators are all calmly sitting and watching.A real more than great and uniquely beautiful registration of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic summer games. A mustsee for the lovers of sport and documentary filmmaking.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This film covers the 1964 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo Japan. Using 164 cameras including with slowmotion and nightvision it covers the opening and closing ceremonies the lighting of the Olympic torch and the highlights of the athletes competing. The sports seen with many closeups blurring ocassional blackandwhite colour and other clever filming techniques include sprinting and marathons track and field athletics long jump pole vaulting shotput hammer throw weightlifting hurdles gymnastics swimming fencing wrestling shooting cycling football hockey basketball sailing and many more. There are also the little sections that see the competitors training resting with food and drink. With English commentary by Jack Douglas. It does not focus on the specific results in each event it is much more about the performance the techniques the stamina and the reactions of the winners and losers. It may not have the statistics but it is an inspirational tribute to human athleticism and endurance a worthwhile documentary. Very good!".

	schema:headline " The Olympic Games of 40 Years Ago";
	schema:reviewBody "Having watched this film for the first time only recently it was striking to try to realize how much is forgotten about any given Olympic Games with the passage of time. Many of the names of athletes including those of the USA are simply forgotten. Bob Hayes Billy Mills Joe Frazier Don Schollander were about the only American athletes on the 1964 Olympic team that were recognizable in this film.My view of this film is that it did not particularly energize me or inform me about the Tokyo Olympics. Many of the editing choices were not good and it was not a film that would stand the test of time. Compared with the wonderful Olympic films by Bud Greenspan over the years 16 Days of Glory this is clearly the product of a relative amateur. But this predates Greenspan's Olympic work and for its time it was probably the most ambitious approach to filming such an enormous athletic event since Riefenstahl's work in Germany.Individual sequences that were particularly enjoyable were the close closeups of the shotputters and the hammerthrowers the sprinters spiking their starting blocks into the cinder track swimmers on the starting blocks just before the start the amazing finishing sprint by American Billy Mills to win the 10000 meter race to this day one of the great singular Olympic moments.This film did not personalize the athletesthere was virtually no background provided about them no personal story. The only portion that came close to that focused for a time on a young runner from Chad who as was pointed out in the film was at 22 much older than his country at the time. This was clearly the filmmaker's choiceto present an abstract vision of the Tokyo Gamesbut it somehow left me cold. To present the first Olympic Games held in Asia in such an impersonal abstract way seems like the incorrect choice of approach.Well I've now seen this film once probably will never watch it againit brought back some memories of those Olympic Games some nice photography. But in the end uninspiring  forgettable. Oh yes it rained a lot in Tokyo in October of 1964.".

	schema:headline " Completely failed to meet expectations";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2009 director John Hyams raised the bar for directtoDVD action films with UNIVERSAL SOLDIER REGENERATION. Expectations were low and so was the budget but Hyams overcame those limitations with some jaw dropping action scenes that included a pleasing rematch between Dolph Lundgren and JeanClaude Van Damme. The standard set so high that I felt disappointed when I saw the trailer for Hyams' followup DRAGON EYES 2011. As with the previous film Van Damme plays a key supporting role but the headlined star is a UFC fighter. While Van Damme was not on screen a great deal in REGENERATION he was still arguably the lead but that is definitely not the case here. Despite what the distributors might want you to think. His character Tiano plays a pivotal role but only appears in a string of flashbacks. He is mentor to a prisoner called Hong played by mixed martial artist Cung Le who drifts into the town of St. Jude state unspecified with a clear but unspoken agenda.DRAGON EYES is backtobasics action of the Cleaning up the town variety. The kind of thing we've seen in the likes of STREET CORNER JUSTICE Charles Bail 1996 Latin DRAGON Scott Thomas 2004 and ROAD HOUSE 2 Scott Ziehl 2006. It's a storyline that reaches all the way back through the 1980s to the glory days of the western influenced by Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo 1961. There's a heavily retro vibe to the whole film. This is established with a credits font that evokes the blaxploitation era. After REGENERATION I felt sure that Hyams would get a decent budget to show what he can do but it would seem the opposite was true. The trailer indicated that the locations would be simple back streets and abandoned buildings and there was a limited Van Damme presence but I felt sure any shortcomings would be overcome by great looking action. While it appeared low budget I was hopeful that DRAGON EYES would be something akin to the first couple of films starring Tony Jaa. Unfortunately while Le's character is as thinly written as any of Jaa's and both are skilled martial artists the comparisons between the two end there. Le lacks charisma and isn't given much to say or do apart from the action scenes. While there are inventive action moments there are simply not enough of them. Le shows no promise of being the next big thing. It's not really his fault Hyams just fails to deliver. There's a notable overuse of slow motion. Looking like it was shot on video although with a decent camera DRAGON EYES is a major disappointment. During approximately 80 minutes of screen time the plot meanders and seems total nonsense. Exposition is minimal which is unusual and the film coasts from one scene to another with no real sense of direction or momentum. There are lots of pointless scenes involving supporting characters including one funny one featuring a crackhead called Beech played by Eddie Rouse. Rouse and Le both previously appeared in PANDORUM Christian Alvart 2009 and of the two it's Rouse who delivers the most memorable performance in DRAGON EYES. That is apart from Peter Weller always a great screen presence clearly having a ball playing villain Mister V. He gets all the best lines.The simple plot is overly complicated and unconvincing. We are meant to believe that Hong has been able to locate and break into all the main bad guys safes to steal their contents. This is all going on while he runs around like a ninja to make them uneasy and things take a turn when after beating up the local gangstas they seem to respect him for it. I was confused when some guys he fought in one of the first scenes started to come to his aid when another group show up to fight him. It wasn't until this second group are shown listening attentively as he tells them to stop selling drugs to kids and put away their guns that I realised the absurdity of what was going on. They are listening to him like he's Jesus. This just allows for more bad guys to take their trade and they do nothing. They just get shot.As usual this all builds to a big climax it's no surprise that it's in an abandoned building in which Hong fights his way through some thugs to confront the villain and rescue a girl. The action's not engaging and I really didn't care. I just couldn't wait for it to be over so I could put this all behind me. It's not that it's a really bad film it's just that it's bland and poorly put together and I expected so much more. If you want to see a film like this with a comprehensible plot and good action just rent the Steven Seagal movie URBAN JUSTICE Don E. FauntLeRoy 2007 or give Van Damme's little seen Yojimboinfluenced DESERT HEAT John G. Avildsen 1999 a go.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was finally able to watch this and I have to say that I enjoyed it. I do agree with some others that the story did have some plot holes which was the main flaw of the movie. It felt like a lot of the scenes were missing about 5 min that would explain why the next scene plays out how it does. Still this didn't really affect most of the overall enjoyment factor for me. I thought Cung Le was a cool lead. He has minimal dialog which is probably a good thing so he comes off as the strong silent type. As we all know JC only has a small part...probably about 10 minutes spread throughout the whole movie. His scenes and his performance are both very cool. I didn't really care for how his back story was explained though. The fights do have a lot of slow motion thrown into them but it actually works for the most part. It allows you to feel the brutality of street fighting...plus you see everything clearly which is great. Hyams knows how to stay on a scene which I love. As far as the side characters go they are all clichd but the acting is actually pretty solid. The guy who plays Beech probably delivers one of the best crack head performances I've seen in a movie. The ending is very abrupt but I felt like it actually fit the tone of the movie. Like Regeneration I really enjoyed the subtle music score from Michael Krassner too. Overall the movie isn't great but I thought it was a well made little indie action flick. It totally felt like a late 80'searly 90's beat em up flick like Road House or Perfect Weapon. 3.255".

	schema:headline " Showcases Chung Le's talents well as an action force to be reckoned with!";
	schema:reviewBody "'DRAGON EYES' Three Stars Out of Five International Kickboxing champion and UFC star Chung Le stars in this crime drama action film. It costars JeanClaude Van Damme Peter Weller and Kristopher Van Varenberg Van Damme's son. The film was directed by John Hyams who also directed the last two 'UNIVERSAL SOLDIER' films also featuring Van Damme and written by Tim Tori who also wrote the low budget B horror films 'PROWL' 'HYSTERIA' and 'TRESSPASSERS'. It was produced by After Dark Films who had primarily been known for releasing horror films but has now turned to martial arts action films as well they also produced the recent Scott Adkins action film 'EL GRINGO'. The film is about what you'd expect from your average martial arts B movie but it does showcase Le's talents well as an action force to be reckoned with.Le plays Ryan Hong a mysterious loner who rolls in to a town rife with gang violence known as St. Jude. He turns the two ruling gangs there against each other before falling under the attention of corrupt police chief Mr. V Weller. Mr. V first sees Hong's skills as an asset and uses him to help control the gangs but then finds him to be more of a menace than an ally. Hong turns to the skills he was taught in prison by an old resident of St. Jude known as Tiano Van Damme and attempts to clean up the town once and for all.Le has had a lot of cool supporting turns in action films like 'TEKKEN' 'PANDORUM' 'FIGHTING' and most recently 'THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS' but this is his first chance to show off his leading man chops. His fighting skills are very impressive and he has an acting style similar to the likes of the greats like Jackie Chan and Jet Li in my opinion. It would be nice to see him get better movies with higher production values but this is a good start for him. Hyams is a good action film director and it doesn't get much better than having Van Damme and Peter Weller supporting you in your first starring role. Van Damme plays little more than an extended cameo in the film but was given top billing in all the marketing including posters and the DVD cover in order to sell it his name is pretty marketable these days despite being seen as washed up just a few years ago. He doesn't really have enough screen time in this film to make much of an impression but just his presence gives the film some extra cred. Weller is great as the movie's villain and it's nice to see him popping up in films still as well. The movie is really just an action vehicle for Chung Le though and at that it does it's job pretty well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vXh674mS5vTo".

I've now watched 40 minutes of the movie and he has hardly spoken more than 20 words. Only John Rambo is allowed to do that! And his facial expressions range from anger the fighting to total detachment all other scenes. Is that supposed to make him tough and cool? No. It. Does. Not! It makes him dull and boring.It's always a really bad sign when the main character could die in the movie and you wouldn't even blink and certainly not care. This is very much the case in Dragon Eyes. And what a shame it is because every other character does have a personality and is very much 'alive' while our hero just stares holes into the air and fights whenever he has to. Wow!What I mean is... does Cung Le have no charisma at all? That can't be true right? So why don't we see any of it on screen? Bad directing? No talent for acting? Peter Weller on the other hand seems to be enjoying his return to the screen very much. It's a pleasure seeing him work!The movie is now over. I give it six stars. That's too much.

	schema:headline " He'll Clean Up Your Lawless Inner City";
	schema:reviewBody "Dragon Eyes is ugly implausible and infuriatingly convoluted. Here is a film that's not only an eyesore  the colors muddy the lighting perpetually dim  but also so badly structured and so poorly developed that it's next to impossible to follow along with. In attempting to cross a contemporary crime drama with classic martial arts writer Tim Tori and director John Hyams have diluted the waters leaving neither genre with enough substance or style to please any potential audience. Characters are introduced and disposed of with such haphazard regard that one wonders why anyone bothered to give them dialogue or personalities they would have been much better off just standing there silently like pieces of scenery waiting for their cue to get knocked out shot at or both. This movie is a mess the likes of which a mop and bucket are required.We meet a mysterious man named Hong Cung Le whose one piece of back story is slowly revealed via intermittent flashback sequences ones that somehow manage to show so much and yet say so little. It seems he was arrested tried and convicted for a crime he didn't commit but in fact bore witness to and tried to stop. In prison he was taken under the wing of an equally mysterious man named Tiano JeanClaude Van Damme who teaches him in the ways of some martial arts discipline in their surprisingly spacious cell. Curious that they were never once seen by a security guard whose job it is to make rounds on a regular basis. Anyway when Hong is released he goes to the crimeinfested city of St. Jude presided over by a corrupt police chief who prefers to be called Mr. V Peter Weller. For reasons not adequately explained until the end of the film  and even then the details are sketchy at best  Hong interjects himself into the affairs of several rival gangs each of which he tries to pit against the other.At least I think that was what he was doing. He's soon taken in by Mr. V who's initially impressed by his fighting skills. If I've gotten your hopes up that the film is walltowall martial arts choreography I must apologize. Martial arts do sneak their way into several of the fight scenes but not in a way fans of that genre are likely to find entertaining. Most of the action is just plain brutal with a lot of body slamming and punching and lightningquick edits that confuse every shot into an indecipherable jumble. Strangely enough most of the fight scenes are punctuated by splitsecond slow motion shots which were included perhaps in an effort to make them seem like mindless video game stunts. But I stray after a time Mr. V soon loses his trust in Hong and vows to fight back. But as luck would have it Hong has made an alliance of sorts with the Hispanic gang and the black gang. The same cannot be said of the Russian gang the leader of which he fought with in yet another suspiciously large jail cell.When Hong first enters St. Jude he moves into an apartment building overseen by a distrusting man whose granddaughter Crystal Mantecon is largely responsible for entering a scene delivering one or two lines that are halfcryptic and softly sarcastic and then leaving. To say she contributes absolutely nothing to the plot would be a massive understatement. Perhaps I should be thankful that the filmmakers didn't go the expected route and make her Hong's love interest. I'll bet they came close though.

	onyx:emotionText "Dragon Eyes is ugly implausible and infuriatingly convoluted. Here is a film that's not only an eyesore  the colors muddy the lighting perpetually dim  but also so badly structured and so poorly developed that it's next to impossible to follow along with. In attempting to cross a contemporary crime drama with classic martial arts writer Tim Tori and director John Hyams have diluted the waters leaving neither genre with enough substance or style to please any potential audience. Characters are introduced and disposed of with such haphazard regard that one wonders why anyone bothered to give them dialogue or personalities they would have been much better off just standing there silently like pieces of scenery waiting for their cue to get knocked out shot at or both. This movie is a mess the likes of which a mop and bucket are required.We meet a mysterious man named Hong Cung Le whose one piece of back story is slowly revealed via intermittent flashback sequences ones that somehow manage to show so much and yet say so little. It seems he was arrested tried and convicted for a crime he didn't commit but in fact bore witness to and tried to stop. In prison he was taken under the wing of an equally mysterious man named Tiano JeanClaude Van Damme who teaches him in the ways of some martial arts discipline in their surprisingly spacious cell. Curious that they were never once seen by a security guard whose job it is to make rounds on a regular basis. Anyway when Hong is released he goes to the crimeinfested city of St. Jude presided over by a corrupt police chief who prefers to be called Mr. V Peter Weller. For reasons not adequately explained until the end of the film  and even then the details are sketchy at best  Hong interjects himself into the affairs of several rival gangs each of which he tries to pit against the other.At least I think that was what he was doing. He's soon taken in by Mr. V who's initially impressed by his fighting skills. If I've gotten your hopes up that the film is walltowall martial arts choreography I must apologize. Martial arts do sneak their way into several of the fight scenes but not in a way fans of that genre are likely to find entertaining. Most of the action is just plain brutal with a lot of body slamming and punching and lightningquick edits that confuse every shot into an indecipherable jumble. Strangely enough most of the fight scenes are punctuated by splitsecond slow motion shots which were included perhaps in an effort to make them seem like mindless video game stunts. But I stray after a time Mr. V soon loses his trust in Hong and vows to fight back. But as luck would have it Hong has made an alliance of sorts with the Hispanic gang and the black gang. The same cannot be said of the Russian gang the leader of which he fought with in yet another suspiciously large jail cell.When Hong first enters St. Jude he moves into an apartment building overseen by a distrusting man whose granddaughter Crystal Mantecon is largely responsible for entering a scene delivering one or two lines that are halfcryptic and softly sarcastic and then leaving. To say she contributes absolutely nothing to the plot would be a massive understatement. Perhaps I should be thankful that the filmmakers didn't go the expected route and make her Hong's love interest. I'll bet they came close though. Their precious few scenes together hinted at something flirtatious. In the granddaughter's case at least Hong is a man of so few words and facial expressions that it's rather difficult to tell how he's feeling at any given moment.

So why did I end up giving this a 7 and not a higher score? Well and this may be considered a  S P O I L E R  It's the ending of any movie the way things are concluded which can often leave the most lasting impression on you no matter how good the movie was before it reaches the final few scenes. And this is where the problem lies. The last 15 minutes of the movie just seem extremely rushed forced and clichd. Such a shame that not more time was taken with the ending and that the fights at the end could have been introduced in a superior more logical way. While the fights themselves were still entertaining it seems by the end of the film they just wanted to get it over with and bring it to a close.

	schema:reviewBody "How does Jean Claude Van Damme get back to stardom . After playing the title character very well and honestly in JCVD there's not much more scope after a former action movie star has played himself in a metafictional movie . So it looks like going back to obscure straight to DVD action thrillers for Jean Claude and as you'd expect he appears in the opening pretitles sequence which features a protagonist newly arrived in jail where he has to prove himself to the other inmates that he's no wimpy push over . As the titles are shown with some hard ass rap track we find the protagonist park his car in the mean streets of a Latino quarter . Mr Protagonist gets in to fisicuffs with some bad mofos who want to cap his ass . Oh I forgot to mention that the protagonist is played by Cung Le not Van Damme who's role is fairly minimal here so if you've bought this DVD expecting 90 minutes of Van Dumb action then you're going to be rather disappointed As for myself I wasn't disappointed by the lack of the muscles from Brussels . Cung Le makes for a very likable hero and his little boy lost looks suit the character very well . In fact much of the first half of the movie is likable even if is very routine . Le's character Hong finds himself up against The Street Kings and The Eastsiders and congratulations to director John Hyams for having a gang that is exclusively composed of Latinos and their rival gang being composed of black homies because normally these gangs are more cosmopolitan than the French Foreign Legion and he brings some flourishes to the proceedings borrowed from Guy RitchieUnfortunately Hyams has a rather serious problem with storytelling especially where the editing is concerned . The more the story continues the more it relies on flashback and this gets more confusing giving the impression Hong is busily working at his day job then the action cuts to his prison cell where he is being mentored by Van Damme . The more the story goes on the more ridiculous plot turns arrive . For example Hong is left for dead after being beaten to a pulp in front of a gang of corrupt cops  is placed in a coffin then miraculously gets resurrected without explanation . This ruins the film to a great degree because the first half had great potential".

	schema:reviewBody "Fan or not there is no denying JeanClaude Van Damme's action star status throughout the 90's. Over the years he has made a name for himself in the straight to video market but unlike some out there his movies have held a sense of quality on some level. His latest film Dragon Eyes brings along MMA fighter Cung Le but takes Van Damme in a different role than we are used to seeing him in.Dragon Eyes follows a man who moves into neighborhood living in fear thanks to the rival gangs at war. Slowly he begins playing them against each other using his martial arts skills he learned from his mentor while serving time in prison. Just as he starts gaining control in the neighborhood he is thrust into a war with a corrupt police chief as well as the gangs to try and defend the scared people of this desperate neighborhood. While the story here isn't anything all that original it still gives it that old school feel. It kind of goes all over the place at times and seems to suffer a bit due to editing but not enough to hurt the overall film. This film is very much like most martial arts films of the 80's and 90's. Cung Le takes the lead and does a decent job. His acting skills are slowly but surely getting better but this is his first time out carrying one on his own shoulders and he does a fine job. Van Damme takes a back seat approach playing more of a Mr. Miyagi to Cung Le with very little dialogue but still delivering an effective character through action. This film is clearly more about the martial arts and there is no shortage. Le does a great job with the fights delivering some wellchoreographed entertaining fights.This is an old school martial arts film that fans of the genre will have fun with. Cung Le has made numerous films but his turn as the lead here showcases a new generation of action star that he could easily fill. Van Damme serves his purpose here very effectively and gives you just enough of what he does best to tide you over until he steps it up as the villain in The Expendables 2.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

Van Damme serves his purpose here very effectively and gives you just enough of what he does best to tide you over until he steps it up as the villain in The Expendables 2.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey";

	schema:reviewBody "JCVD JeanClaude Van Damme is finally the master who does the teaching. What this is at the core is Yojimbo or Fistful of Dollars or even Last Man Standing. A very classic story in which a stranger comes to town and either plays both sides against each other or convinces the more logical folks to join him. Cung Le is really good in this as the quiet stranger and there is just enough of the prison flashbacks to fill in the whole backstory I found that I really did Enjoy this which at the start I would not have expected. Peter Weller is exactly the character that he has played in every other show for the past 3 years or so a dirty cop kingpin and compared to his lot in Burn Notice this is more fitting closer to the character he plays on Sons of Anarchy. So all told and tightly wrapped up I would recommend this After Dark movie they do make a few good ones now and again. However I would only recommend this to guys looking for a brainless action movie that will make you feel smart and able to keep up. There is not a lot here for anyone else though any of those other movies I mentioned would be a better choice though this is not completely without merit as I have said.".

Cung Lee certainly has some movies there is no doubt about that but he needs to start picking better scripts so he can utilize his talents for maximum effect.

He is not yet able to carry a movie on his own. Peter Weller makes for a solid villain. He's usually dependable and here was no different. We also get Kristopher Van Varenberg Van Damme's real life son and he is proving to be quite the solid actorFinal Thoughts It's too boring for its own good. It does have some good action sequences but the boredom that frequently comes in between all that kills any momentum. Cung Lee has potential.

Well they were wrong on both counts  this one didn't see the inside of many American theaters and it's definitely not a vehicle for Van Damme  but this isn't reason to be disappointed because despite being a DTV production it's very good action movie. Not mindblowingly good Van Damme's own Universal Soldier Regeneration was superior if you ask me but nevertheless one of the better examples out there of quality martial arts flicks being feasible on a relatively small budget.The story a softspoken martial artist Cung Le  fresh from prison and the tutelage of his wizened teacher Van Damme  seeks to redeem his past by cleaning up a neighborhood sick with drugs gang violence and police corruption.As far as Van Damme goes this movie does in fact mark a new stage in his career it's the first time he's playing the role of a mentor which is both satisfying at this point in his career and ironic since the first time both he and Cung Le were mentioned together he prophesized hostility between them. Nevertheless Van Damme's character plays almost entirely in the background and only has one flashback scene outside of prison. The movie is thoroughly a vehicle for Cung Le whose last several years of playing supporting roles effectively bolster him to the status of a respectable action hero. The character he plays isn't particularly intriguing but he's got a fair presence and forcefully pushes most of his opposition aside as a film fighter. Peter Weller drastically steps away from his ROBOCOP legacy to heighten the cast value as a memorable villain with one of the best interrogation scenes I've seen in a while to his credit.The few reviews I've read about this film take aim at the story I don't usually argue other peoples' opinions but seriously  what were you expecting guys? At any rate I found no qualm with it the plot itself is simplistic but there are a handful of neat twists and characterbased surprises to keep things interesting e.g. Le's character earns control of a Latino gang and makes them surrender their firearms because Only cowards use guns. With that said there's one resoundingly weird event that doesn't add up involving Cung Le's character escaping from a thoroughly impossible situation. Steven Seagal pulled a similar headscratcher in MERCENARY FOR JUSTICE but Le's unexplained disappearing act takes the cake. How the heck did he put that policeman in the casket? Also I was sort of disappointed by the ending but the fact that I had just witnessed some very fine fight scenes helped soften its abruptness. Cung Le isn't Scott Adkins but he offers an exciting alternative of MMA and karatebased action. In my experience mixed martial arts have fared better in Hollywood than lowbudget features but ol' Cung could be the one to even things out with the big leagues. I appreciate the variety of fights their almost complete lack of onesidedness and how well pro fighters like Scott Scheeley and Trevor Prangley made the transition to cinefighting by Le's example.The production isn't perfect but nevertheless it's very strong. DTVisms like computeredited montages and slow motion scenes exist but you can almost feel director John Hyams fighting to keep them to a minimum. As much as for Cung Le this film is a victory for him as well in managing to follow up his abovementioned UNIVERSAL SOLDIER movie with a worthy new entry. Plainly said I'm eager to see what all of these guys get up to in the future and action fans in general would be in the wrong by not giving this one a serious look.".

Of course JCVD has still got all the silky moves but with age creeping up on him he is obviously not gonna be as believable as in his hayday.Cung Le takes on the role as main hero for this 'Yojimbo' remake yep another one a loner comes to a small town and uses the two local gangs against each other to get to the big man and bring peace. So completely and utterly unoriginal and to be frank its been done much much better 'Last Man Standing' the warring street gang element doesn't really work for me here it just seems like any other warring street gang flick where as 'Last Man Standing' worked really well due to the time period setting it looked so darn cool.The cast is a mix of your typical unknowns who all seem to be pretty proficient in martial arts to major player Peter Weller as Mr V the main bad guy. Weller is clearly enjoying himself as he hams it up beautifully whilst for some reason he has been made to look like Frank Sinatra with his little hat old blue eyes kicking ass.As said JCVD takes more of a backseat role being the mentor in flashbacks and Le is the high flying number one. Personally I didn't take to Le as the main man he looks solid enough yes but he just doesn't have that leading man quality to pull off being the hero he's not exactly a great looking guy and I just didn't get the same adrenaline rush from seeing him fight. He can fight but its more of a scuffle plus his moves aren't as sharp or far reaching as others I've seen. Sure its more realistic but you kinda wanna see some fancy JCVD type air moves which make you shout HELL YEAH!! I wasn't really behind him feeling the rush. I love how everyone in these films is a martial arts expert every bad guy and every random person called on to fight is a martial artist I know it equals more kick ass but its kinda stupid isn't it.A kind of video game vibe to the style has been attempted in places eg. with the character intros which isn't really needed seeing as it isn't really kept up throughout but overall its a slick moody gangster action piece with a nice limited colour palette giving a touch of class. A bit lacking for Mr Silver really not quite up to his usual standards a mixed bag of good and bad but more average really. Certainly more stylish than recent JCVD films but he isn't involved so much with this one sooooo...good film title bares no real meaning to the film but its cool.510".

	schema:reviewBody "A man named Hong Le comes to a gang drug and crimeinfested 'hood called St. Jude and rents a small apartment. It seems a gang war is brewing between the Devil Dogs the 6th Street Kings and the Eastsiders. A corrupt cop named Mr. V Weller is orchestrating all the mayhem from behind the scenes. But the introduction of Hong into this milieu shakes things up for everyone. To innocent residents like Rosanna Mantecon he's a godsend because he helps clean up the neighborhood in a classic cleaning up the neighborhood montage that we always love to see  but to his enemies he's a thorn in their side. All Hong has to rely on is the Martial Arts training he received from his mentor a man named Tiano Van Damme. But what is Hong's true motivation? He will be put to the ultimate test  will he be the savior of the streets? Find out today...Dragon Eyes is more or less a Homie Movie but with a difference. The difference being that it is competently acted directed edited and has some tough brutal and engaging fight scenes. But we wouldn't expect anything less from our new favorite director Mr. Hyams who delivered the utterly brilliant Universal Soldier Regeneration 2009 immediately preceding Dragon Eyes. Throwbackstyle action but perhaps with some added brutality seems to be Hyams' trademark. After all this movie is about a loner who comes to a harsh new town pits two gangs against one another and contains the casual racism of the old days  as well as the Prerequisite Torture of the hero and the final fight in the...you guessed it the abandoned warehouse. So all the proper elements are present and accounted for. But this movie has the first instance we can recall of Rakefighting and Hong wields that rake like nobody's business. We applaud that.With the casting of Peter Weller and Van Damme we finally have Robocop vs. Timecop. Well not really as they don't share any scenes together. Van Damme's role is extremely limited he only appears in dark shadowy flashbacks as Hong's mentor. It's more about the mysterious Hong in a setup that's like Blood and Bone 2009 meets Urban Justice 2007. Peter Weller as Mr. V  not to be confused with Danny G from the previous year's Forced To Fight 2011  because in Dragon Eyes Mr. V wears a hat. Otherwise the roles are very very similar. But Weller has a ton of screen presence so you want to see him do roles like this. It seems just a few years ago you wouldn't see stars like Weller in downanddirty DTV product like this and Forced To Fight. But if Robert De Niro is going straight to video now that signals the way for the movie industry and all actors beneath his stature.Mr. Hyams is clearly a talented director and knows how to direct a quality fight scene. The movie overall has some good grit and basically delivers what you want. While we prefer Regeneration Dragon Eyes is certainly worth watching.".

Nevertheless Universal Soldier Regeneration director John Hyams doesn't let the low budget undercut his gripping but formulaic thriller. Basically Dragon Eyes is a modern day towntaming western. An enigmatic loner Mr. Hong is dispatched to the small town of St. Jude as a favor to a cell mate that served as his mentor. St. Jude is seething with anarchy. Pushers are selling drugs on the street and the authorities are crooky. Although the setting and the characters are different Hyams and scenarist Tim Tori have appropriated the Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest as the template for this brawny slugfest as our reticent protagonist former MMA champion Cung Le of Pandorum infiltrates the local gangs and manages to turn them against each other. The main villain cuts a flamboyant figure in a fedora named Mr. V Peter Weller of Robocop and he delivers a firstrate performance as a murderous crime lord who has no qualms about killing in cold blood. Martial arts legend Jean Claude Van Damme appears in our hero's flashbacks and serves as our hero's mentor. Hyams never lets the action slacken and he stagess several effective knucklesmashing fights. Of course the action supersedes plot and the characters are strictly onedimensional. Dragon Eyes contains some earthy dialogue consistently cynical attitudes and freeflowing violence that generates a body count. The amazing thing about Dragon Eyes is that Hyams keeps everything downtoearth and believable. The action occurs in rooms around apartments but never ventures out into sprawling cityscapes. This is a nononsense brawling that doesn't wear out its welcome at 92 crisp minutes.".

	schema:headline " A Wickedly Misbegotten Mess Manages a Few Bright Spots But Not Enough 30 Years Later";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a bit confounding as to why this legendary 1978 fiasco would warrant a 30th Anniversary Edition DVD even though in hindsight this elaborately conceived film is not quite as bad as I recall. That's not to say it's a neglected masterpiece. Not by a long shot. Directed by the estimable Sidney Lumet Long Day's Journey Into Night Network last year's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead the epiclength film is a regrettable misfire on several counts with its chief liability being a rickety story structure due to an earlycareer foible of a screenplay by current schlockmaster Joel Schumacher Batman Forever The Phantom of the Opera. The 1975 Broadway musical version was a zesty allblack update of Frank Baum's original story that became a longrunning hit. Schumacher eschewed the book of the stage version in order to customize the role of Dorothy written as a prepubescent Kansas farm girl for a then 34year old Diana Ross still riding high off Lady Sings the Blues and Mahogany. Consequently in the film version Dorothy has inexplicably become a 24year old Harlem schoolteacher with a severe case of social anxiety disorder.Because the original 1939 film version of The Wizard of Oz is so familiar there is virtually no sense of surprise in the way of plot. The challenge becomes watching a dowdy skeletallooking Ross react to her surreal surroundings in such an excessively nave manner as to make Dorothy appear in need of a special education program. That leaves her three road companions to pick up the slack and for the most part they do. One can now feel melancholic over Michael Jackson's youthfully energetic turn as the Scarecrow since it is the only time his abundant talents have been captured on the big screen. He does his trademark spins and jumps in an exuberant duet with Ross on the show's most famous number Ease on Down the Road probably the film's best moment. Comedian Nipsey Russell makes a likeably philosophical Tin Man but it's Ted Ross who truly shines as Fleetwood the Lion in a performance that compares favorably to Bert Lahr's cowardly original. A rather hyper Richard Pryor makes a barelythere appearance in the title role. The women fare even less well. Theresa Merritt has just a few scenes upfront as kindly Aunt Emma Mabel King does her blustery best to make an impression as Evillene the Wicked Witch in just a couple of scenes and the legendary Lena Horne is simply wasted as Glinda the Good in static repose as she belts out her one number If You Believe in Yourself.The film picks up considerable energy during the production number set to Luther Vandross' Everybody RejoiceBrand New Day but Lumet just doesn't know when to stop it. Like Martin Scorsese 1977's New York New York and John Huston 1982's Annie Lumet is a director out of his depth within the necessary fleetness of the musical genre and the film's pacing lags over its excessive running time of 133 minutes. The one element that remains impressive over the years is Tony Walton's creative costumes and elaborate production design turning New York City into a surreal series of carnival rides. Most ironically the World Trade Center is made over into Emerald City and the Twin Towers plaza becomes the setting for an Earth Wind  Firestyle disco ensemble. For what is marketed as a special edition package the 2008 DVD is surprisingly bereft of meaningful extras  a brief makingof featurette made at the time of production the original theatrical trailer and a CD with eight of the movie's songs. The movie is a misbegotten mess with just a few forgotten jewels.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE WIZ is a bad movie. It is a very bad movie. It is an extremely very bad movie. To watch it is to be infuriated by just how much potential it has and how far it falls from even vaguely achieving success. A black urban version of The Wizard of Oz is an intriguing idea. The musical score is okay and at least three of the songs are better than average. The budget was obviously substantial and a lot of effort was put into transforming New York City into Munchkinland the Emerald City and points in between. But rather than being in awe of the spectacle one is more likely to stare in disbelief and ask What were they thinking? Sidney Lumet a fine director noted for making small dark and often depressing dramas 12 ANGRY MEN FAILSAFE THE PAWNBROKER etc. seems illprepared to make a big budget musical based on a series of children's books  and unfortunately he proves it. I don't think he makes a single intelligent directorial decision in this entire film the lighting is gloomy camera placement consistently ineffective and the editing clumsy. His choice of soft grainy imagery over crisp clear pictures makes the atmosphere oppressive. The set design art direction and costuming while impressive still look numbingly cheap and tawdry. Scenes filmed on location at New York landmarks look like they take place on cramped soundstages. The film is just plain ugly to watch. Worse Lumet seems to have directed the actors to perform in a soap opera style that is embarrassingly overwrought the prevailing mood is of whining selfpity. Michael Jackson Nipsey Russell and Ted Ross get in a few good moments as The Scarecrow The Tin Woodsman and The Cowardly Lion but there is not a single honest moment to be found in the performance by Diana Ross. To accommodate Ross sixyearold Dorothy from the book played as 13 by 16yearold Judy Garland in THE WIZARD OF OZ now is a 24yearold Harlem kindergarten teacher. At 34yearsold Ross looks more like she is pushing 50 yet displays the emotional maturity of a threeyearold.Ross' miscasting is legendary but her inappropriateness for the role pales in comparison to her actual performance. In rewriting the story for Ross Joel Schumacher's screenplay changes Dorothy from being a winsome wideeyed child to an emotionally unstable adult. In Ross' dubious hands the character seems both mentally and emotionally retarded yet she somehow manages to avoid making the character in any way sympathetic. Strident always on the verge of hysterics it is simply put one of the all time worst screen performances. Richard Pryor fares little better. Instead of the lovable charlatan played by Frank Morgan in the 1939 version of the story the Wizard is now a cowering little fraud devoid of wit or charm. Why hire Pryor known for his bravado and cocky attitude then make him play against type? The filmmakers decided that this Wizard did not just have to be exposed as an illusion but had to be humiliated and degraded as well. The scenes where Dorothy confronts and belittles The Wiz illustrate the meanspirited cruelty that permeates the entire film. The most curious aspect of THE WIZ is trying to decipher just who it was intended for. Obviously the material was meant to appeal to children thus it's strangely inappropriate G rating yet the mystical magical land of good and evil from earlier versions is transformed into a foreboding world of terror and despair. Oz seems to be an extended slum populated by the homeless vandals hookers bookies druggies various street people and gangs while the Emerald City is a superficial place for shallow pretentious phonies. While the tone of the film is juvenile  almost infantile  it all takes place in a seedy adult world that is almost prurient.THE WIZ doesn't just avoid childlike innocence it seems to hold it in contempt. Garland's Oz was basically a beautiful place where evil could be conquered with intellect compassion courage and the security of family and friends. The Oz that Ross treks through is basically an evil place the message she learns is that the world stinks so stop your whining and get used to it. The there's no place like home moral remains intact but that has little meaning if the alternative  Oz  is seen as corrupt and evil.In THE WIZARD OF OZ Dorothy's Oz is a dream world version of her own life the Witch the Wizard and her traveling companions all have human counterparts. This makes the 1939 film a personal story. In THE WIZ there is no apparent correlation between Oz and Dorothy's seemingly isolated home life the people of Oz and Dorothy's family have no counterparts. Garland's Dorothy escapes to Oz but realizes the best part of Oz is already part of her. Ross' Dorothy fears Oz and ultimately escapes from it. The inner dream world of Oz becomes an alien world of mediagenerated stereotypes. THE WIZARD OF OZ is a fantasy THE WIZ is a horror story. Obviously reworking the basic story to accommodate an allblack cast wasn't done just to utilize a different style of music. As such the film becomes a showcase for a panorama of AfricanAmerican stereotypes many of them negative. But rather than debunking racist clichs the film embraces them. Sleep inducing poppy fields are replaced with opium dens witches become sweatshop slave drivers flying monkeys are gang members Munchkins are graffiti vandals and so on and so forth. As adult satire such imagery is understandable if lame but the film forgets this is still a story specifically aimed at children. Just as the film was rewritten from the play to accommodate the adult Ross the material is altered from L. Frank Baum's books to make it adult but not mature. It seems to be the film's conviction that to tell the story from a black perspective it must embrace a grim urban reality basically saying that childlike innocence cannot exist because urban living especially for a black audience has destroyed such a concept. A sad commentary for a children's fantasy and an even sadder assumption about AfricanAmerican life.The irony of THE WIZ is that it is illconceived cheaply melodramatic and relies on trite stereotypes in other words it has no brain no heart and no courage. And ultimately it found no home being a box office flop. And what could have been a breakthrough landmark in cinema ends up being a sad relic of political incorrectness.".

There are things wrong with it some more egregious than other movies some less. But here's the thing The Wiz has taken an old beloved classic of literature and rewritten it just enough to make it completely new. I was as absorbed...if not moreso...with these new characters reborn into another world so familiar and yet so unknown as I was taken in by the original Judy Garland film.Suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient for all storytelling and the more fantastic the more imagination one requires to enjoy it. Diana Ross too old? So what? I thought she was marvelous and I thought she perfectly portrayed Dorothy in this alternate universe. In fact I thought all the actors were terrific.The story of the Wizard Of Oz has been in my top five favourite stories of all time for as long as I have been alive. I include Diana Ross' The Wiz right up there in an unbreakable tie with Judy Garland's Wizard Of Oz. They are both charming and well told versions of a brilliant literary classic and they both deserve their due at the top of the food chain as far as fantastic storytelling goes. And I haven't even touched the stunning aspect that an all Black cast chose not only to make this film but actually rewrite it enough to show the point of view of the lives of the folks who lived in the ghettos and inner cities.Even today Black actors must struggle to receive equal treatment in film. Back when this movie was released accomplishing this film was nothing short of a mindboggling achievement and one to be lauded. I suspect a lot of the bad reputation this film has gotten over the years especially at the beginning was because the inherent racism and sexism in the industry was offended that the folks who made this film had the temerity to do so with an allBlack cast. It's happened before and I'm afraid it will continue to happen until we grow enough intelligence to finally put discrimination behind us at last and move beyond into a brighter future.This movie will remain one of my favourite films. I couldn't recommend it any more highly. If you are a child at heart if you love good stories made new if you live in the imagination this film is for you.Just beware of that subway scene. If your kids are young andor easily frightened preview the movie before you watch it with them. It still creeps me out when I see it and I know a lot of people who still get nightmares from it. But it's one of the best scenes in the film and a testament to how creative the folks who put the film together were.".

	schema:reviewBody "Normally I feel that it is a travesty to remake an older classic film  sequels excepted. Profits aside what is the motive? What is there to  add? The Wiz however is one of the few exceptions to my belief.  Whereas The Wizard of Oz is more of a child's film the intended  audience for The Wiz is a few steps above that. Like its predecessor  The Wiz is both visually stunning and musically engaging. It  compliments the seriousness of its themes and situationsboth of which  it has in more abundance than its predecessorwith a copious amount of  humor.  Seldom have I witnessed a more creative work of adaptation than that  which is presented by The Wiz which is of course adapted from L.  Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. A few others that spring to  mind are Logan's Run and The War of the Worlds. I mention these not  because they were simply a good translation of book to film but  because they maintained the book's overall story plot theme  characters etc. while retailoring the environment andor situation.  The Wiz focuses on the black situation. It redresses all of the  elements from its source material to meet the needs of its revamped  modern social subject matter. From the Scarecrow who represents a  pitiable underachieving product of his environment to the poppies  which represent drug addiction to the denizens of Oz who are ready to  follow the latest trend just to be in the story presents its  audience with a generalized glimpse at the breakdown of black culture  and society.  Though The Wiz does not convey the same childlike wonder magic and  fantasy that both the original film and the novel do it translates  those elements into more of an industrialized mechanical inner city  playground. Unfortunately albeit appropriately the Oz we witness is  through an older Dorothy's eyes. Interestingly due to her advanced  age the circumstances that befall her must be harsher in order to  invoke the necessary change of heart.  Unlike the setting in The Wizard of Oz which exists in our dreams  somewhere over the rainbow the setting in The Wiz occupies our  nightmares. The contrast between Judy Garland's Oz and her native  Kansas is many times greater than that between Diana Ross' Oz and her  native New York. The incentive to return home is greater for  Dianaeven though the colorful lure of a fantasy land is not  presentsince her Oz may be merely a preview of things to come back  home if she does not start to make a difference.  One of the few things for which I did not care was  alltoorecognizable yet modified New York as Oz. Though the entire  film's art direction was brilliant I found New York to be too  distracting and too contemporary to be an adequate Oz. Another subject  of distaste for me was the end of slavery segment after Evillene's  liquidation. The song and dance were nice and full of energy but the  symbolism was too literal and seemed out of place with regards to the  rest of the film. I could have also enjoyed a bit more denouement and  perhaps even an epilogue about Dorothy's reunion with her family.  Three interesting notes 1 The landscape of Oz in The Wiz actually  does change after Dorothy intervenes to make a difference this does  not happen in The Wizard of Oz. 2 While Judy's visit to Oz seems to  be concussioninduced Diana actually appears to visit that fabled  land which is closer to the book. 3 The Wiz contains all four  witches presented in the book The Wizard of Oz only contains three.  Though it seems rather dated today The Wiz is still a fun movie to  view and it contains a number of known Motown celebrities.".

Three interesting notes 1 The landscape of Oz in The Wiz actually  does change after Dorothy intervenes to make a difference this does  not happen in The Wizard of Oz. 2 While Judy's visit to Oz seems to  be concussioninduced Diana actually appears to visit that fabled  land which is closer to the book. 3 The Wiz contains all four  witches presented in the book The Wizard of Oz only contains three.  Though it seems rather dated today The Wiz is still a fun movie to  view and it contains a number of known Motown celebrities.";

What really makes me sad is that the young children that see this think it is wonderful. I remember falling out laughing when they did a close up of Dorothy's feet in the magic slippers. Veins and tendons galore. They looked like turkey feet. Well like a trip to Mecca I plan to take my daughter to see the Broadway summer revival so she will not grow up in the ignorance that Diana Ross is Dorothy. This film was wrong on so many levels I would really be suspicious of a 40 year old woman living like a 12 year old. Ewwwwwwww just creepy all the way around. It made me think that instead of a tornado Dorothy had been to the local crack house and when she finally came down she ran home. I cringe every time she squealed Toto and at the same time looking like she was weaned on a pickle. Just sad.....".

A great artist knows more than one genre crosses their boundaries and unites things that aren't supposed to belong together creating a new genre of his own. In this film director Sidney Lumet  who has proved himself as a good director with his mastery of gritty realism  tries to cross those boundaries and unite his gritty style with the film musical. He pours his ingredients into the wicked witch's cauldron mixes them together... and sadly creates a hotpot of sloppy seconds.The first point of contention has to be the grossly miscast Diana Ross as Dorothy. I have read in various places that she gained the part from playing personal politics and schmoozing with the honchos at Universal. As this game has no honour whatsoever I see no reason to be diplomatic when talking about how damn awful she was at this part. Not only was she too old to be a convincing Dorothy but she just could not act to save herself. Her squealing ham of a performance does nothing for movie and when the movie cuts to one of her emotional closeups you can just picture the few seconds beforehand when Lumet must have said OK Diana it's time to do your scaredsadexcitedconfused face... ACTION! and the camera proceeds to film a few seconds of overacting that could fit into a song about feelings by Barney the dinosaur. Granted her singing in the movie is mature and soulful but this only makes the acting seem even more awkward and outofplace in comparison.Combine this with Lumet's tendency to stage scenes with a master shot with so few cutaways closeups or focus on the finer details of choreography or design. Then notice a lack of flow from once scene to another and everything seems so out of place that by the time the characters arrive at the Emerald City it's VERY hard to be interested in the movie. The later highlights such as Mabel King's performance as Evillene and Lena Horne's performance as Glinda fade into the obscurity that the film has inflicted upon itself.Michael Jackson and Nipsey Russell give credible performances as the Scarecrow and Tin Man. It's equally heartening to see Jackson in the days before he became a living tabloid headlinepunchline and disturbing to think that while he shines in this role his performance as a stumbling confused character on a quest to find himself became a selffulfilling prophecy. Like or hate the music but the material and the performances could have been much better served by a script that didn't scream out its point at every opportunity and direction that occasionally intercut some of the finer details with the 'big picture'".

At the time a tiny little teen with a LARGE voice named Stephanie Mills took this play by the hand and made it spectacular. You had to have seen it in New York back then  and I did  when I was a kid.Then came this movie. A stage to screen adaptation of the play that has a few good moments all by supporting cast but was brought down by the casting of Diana Ross as Dorothy. While this may make all Diana Ross fans angry  understand one key thing Miss Ross was too old to play this Dorothy. There were plenty of those at the time who felt that way  and when I finally saw this movie I have to 100 agree. I do remember the 'gossip mill' of this this like it was yesterdayStephanie Mills the original Dorothy from the stage was considered to do the screen version and Miss Ross was tapped to play the Good Witch at the end the part Lena Horne finally did. If this casting took off the film would have been a nice bow to the stage version and the Dorothy 'part' would have been the young teen she was meant to be. Even if Miss Mills was found not to be box office enough shrugg!!! there were plenty of teens at that time to handle the part  and me it IS important to have Dorothy in The Wiz portrayed as such a young inexperienced wide eyed teen in the ghetto learning these things.But..and this is according to the gossip mills of that time...Miss Ross wanted the part of DOROTHY so bad and she pulled her weight and clout...said she could get Michael Jackson whom at that time was a hot teen singer himself! to whom they were VERY interested in casting. The rumor was Miss Ross said in essence no Dorothy for her no Michael for you. And that would leave the executives who thought Michael would be a box office draw in a quandary. So here we have what we have.Whether this is true or not is for you to decide. But as I watch this there has to be a bit of truth for it does pain me to see Miss Ross as the young ghetto Dorothy. Every time there's a close up interaction of the part to the adults or dance number you can tell. Be honest. We're not talking about a Shirley Temple vs. a Judy Garland age thing that actually worked it was a baby New Year vs. Methuselah on screen thing. Fan of Miss Ross or not  and I am a fan  just not for this. This wasshould have been Stephanie's debut movie role and it would have been nice.And not just to zero in on Miss Ross' casting there could have been a few other changes as well that would have made this kinda fun as well...such as Nipsy Russell's Tim Man was good but putting Richard Pryor there would have been a riot  and letting Nipsy be...The Wiz instead. As I've said there are other roles that were wonderful here  Oh Evilene!!! and Lena Horne as the Good Witch are a delight to see nevertheless.".

She looks like a refugee! Also she just has the wrong voice for this part. Stephanie Mills had a strange nasal voice but she was a BELTER and you need a belter for these songs. Poor Diana and her thin voice just couldn't cut it and she had no physical charm to fall back on. Oh dear.I was really surprised how lame the musical renditions and sound quality were. I have surround sound and I just couldn't believe how muffled and distant the sound was. And in my opinion ALL of the musical performances were misfires. You could see how many of the songs could have been good in a good performance but those just weren't to be found here.Many people single out Lena Horne's performance as fantastic but to me like the rest of the movie she was BADLY misused. Lena Horne is a nuanced jazz singer so to hear her try to go all lowdown gospel was rather painful especially with her impeccablyenunciated Woo! Yeah!'s. She also looks utterly ridiculous. I didn't get much of a sense of the old Michael Jackson we all used to love between the layers of makeup and the lack of focus of the movie and scenes.I love how Dorothy alternates between being worried that Toto is out of her sight for even a moment because he is so precious to her and completely forgetting about his existence for long periods of time.Also apparently the scarecrow's owner shredded the works of the great philosophers or at least his copy of Bartlett's Famous Quotations to stuff his scarecrow with?And WHAT is happening in the sequence where the subway comes to life and attacks our heroes? WHAT is that? Also the cowardly lion doesn't get much of a character arc does he? One scene he's going on about how he doesn't have any courage the next he's ferociously defending Michael against the sabertoothed garbage cans.Now think about that sabertoothed garbage cans. Hmmm.I understand that during this movie our quartet go through tableaux of the issues affecting blacks in the 70's fine... so then what's with the emerald city scene where the Wiz dictates fashion to the people below? Am I to understand that one of the major cultural issues AfricanAmericans faced in the 70's was the tyranny of imperious fashion designers?I was surprised that of all the things they kept from the original Wizard of Oz film they jettisoned the device that Dorothy is just dreaming about all the people she knows and at the end there's no And you were there and you were there and you were there scene. I was kind of stupefied by how HUGE some of the sets were. Many looked like actual NYC locations that they has just laid a yellowbrick floor on. I would love to know if they actually did that or just built these enormous sets.Well that's it! This film is not a total waste of 2 hours but it is... quite an oddity.

I took part in a school production of this and really enjoyed it so I was looking forward to this. While the Wiz had its good moments it was so disappointing. I found it too static too misconceived and too mediocre for my tastes.Starting with the good things first and foremost Michael Jackson. He is surprisingly good as the Scarecrow with just about the right amount of energy and innocence for the role. His vocal rendition of You Can Win was thoroughly enjoyable especially. Nipsy Russell and Ted Ross also do nice work as The Tin Man and Lion and Lena HorneR.I.P is a lovely Glinda. Mabel King does well with what she has as Evillene which admittedly isn't much though I felt she died too easily. I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the songs Ease On Down the Road is by far the catchiest and the most memorable.However I hated Diana Ross's Dorothy. I love Diana Ross but she was not right for Dorothy at all she is too old in my personal opinion that is she has been in much better voice before as well and she fails to capture the cherubic innocence of Judy Garland coming off as haggard and whiny. Even worse was Richard Pryor's Wiz I found him far too loud and cocky it was as if Pryor hadn't realised he was playing the wonderful yet mysterious Wizard of Oz because if anything it felt like another one of his comedy skits. The story is good on the whole if somewhat rickety and flowless in places but then there are some pointless scenes I am especially talking about the subway scenes those scenes were completely unnecessary.I had mixed feelings on the sets. Some are beautiful and expensivelooking but others especially the one in You Can Win looked like sets from Monty Python. Some costumes are nice such as Lion's and Glinda's but the Winkies's are less successful. The dialogue is occasionally amusing but it is also very inane as well Sidney Lumet's direction is very heavyhanded here and the choreography is messy particularly in the Emerald City Ballet sequence and a Brand New Day. The camera work and lighting ranges from adequate to appalling with the lighting in The Munckin Scene too dim and the camera work very static in more than one place throughout the course of the movie. The movie is filmed sometimes at such a distance you have difficulty empathising with any of the characters and their situations. The pacing is often off as well as the film progresses the pacing becomes increasingly elephantine and pedestrian. And talk about an abrupt ending completely unsatisfying and rushed. When it ended I was like that's it? Overall had its good points but The Wiz could have been much better with more focused direction choreography camera work etc. 410 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This film remake of the outstanding 1970s Broadway musical of the same name both shines and clunks on the big screen.  Coming off somewhere between Thank God It's Friday and Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory and in Diana Ross' case Sybil the film version of The Wiz is not good not bad  just plain weird.One of the main problems of the film everyone's said it before and I'll say it again is the casting of Ross as Dorothy.  While I found her singing numbers to be wonderful and full of emotion Diana just plays the role too dark and brooding.  She cries so much that she winds up looking like a neurotic mental case on the verge of suicide.  Reviewer Leonard Maltin said she weeps and whines her way through this.  And no makeup job in the world could make the mature Ross look like a young innoncent girl even though in the film she's supposed to be a 24yr old teacher.  Diana is just a depressing unbelievable Dorothy despite what a wonderful singer she is.  Another problem is the look and feel of the film.  For a movie that was rated G and based on the family fare of The Wizard of Oz it sure wasn't that childlike.  An overall depressing tone low lighting and freaky costumes and set design drag this film down.  It freaked me out when I saw it as a kid and now seeing it again as an adult I now understand why. Don't get me wrong I think the sets are outstanding but kids movies should not look like a horror flick.  And speaking of horror flicks one scene even looks like one as attacking trash cans with teeth recall Jaws.There are many positives of this film however.  The excellent score that was perfected in the Broadway run is enhanced by soaring arrangements by Quincy Jones.  A guilty pleasure is the funky disco Emerald City numbers. Also every member of the supporting cast is outstanding and wellcast.But overall the screenplay is just too weird for any adult much less kid to enjoy.  At 133 minutes it seems to drag on forever and ever. The Wiz is not a total failure and everyone involved should have felt proud to be a part.  But without the entertaining musicaldance numbers and a few comicrelief moments delivered by the Scarecrow Tin Man  Lion The Wiz would just be a bad memory of Diana Ross' career.  Anyone's who's really interested in the magic and promise of The Wiz should hope that the Broadway play is revived in its original glory as it was sometime in the 1990s.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Brazil this movie was released under the title of The Unforgettable Wiz and this is what this movie is not. The black version of one of the greatest book and movie of all time The Wizard of Oz The Wiz Sidney Lumet's film is a very disappointing and depressing musical who again comes to tell Dorothy's journey in a different and magical world helping her three new friends. Instead of a young girl Dorothy Diana Ross is a 24 year old woman shy frightened with the world and during a storm she ends up in the City of Oz along with her dog Toto. The rest if you know the story is the same she mets a Scarecrow Michael Jackson without a brain a tin man Nipsey Russell without a heart and the Coward Lion Ted Ross who wants courage. All Dorothy wants is to return home and to do that she must find the Wizard of Oz Richard Pryor the only one who could possibly makes her wish come true. But there are dangerous in the yellow brick road too! Moving objects the Old Witch of the West who wants to revenge the death of her sister killed accidentally by Dorothy.Now what makes this film good to see? The Wiz is a musical that presents to the audience new songs to an classic story typical sounds of the 1970's a few good musical numbers and two great and unforgettable moments the two first songs sang ed by Michael Jackson. And Michael's performance is fantastic. Not only singing but here you can see he's a method actor playing the down and out Scarecrow. The Art direction and the costumes are incredibly great nominated for Oscar but Oz instead of being Oz is appears to be like a bizarre and altered New York City where there are five Chrysler's building and the World Trade Center is where the Wizard of Oz lives. My concerns about this movie It's very boring and depressing. 90 of the songs presented here moves in some darker issues such as fear absence of things I want to return home that kind of thing. Okay kids might not noticed that when I watched this film as a kid it was one of my favorites but the more experienced viewer gets bored easily by watching Diana Ross crying in almost every song she sangs. She was totally miscast and this movie end up her movie career she only made two TV movies after that. Also the fact that for a musical it runs too long tried to be funny and end up being over dramatic. Bottom of line it didn't needed to be made and even Ray Bolger the original Scarecrow said this The Wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal the original movie obtained. Right! Lesson that Dorothy of the 1939 movie learned There's no place like home. Meaning  things might be bad in home but it's better to be there than be in another place else. Lesson learned by Dorothy in this movie Be brave don't be too shy and go teach in a school for teen students where you're gonna get a better paycheck. If you pay attention in the beginning when Dorothy's mom says something like that and when Dorothy returns home you're gonna have that idea as the story's moral. Sorry Mr. Lumet but you'll be better remembered by masterpieces like Network 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon. But it wasn't your fault. Perhaps the one who needs to be blamed of its failure is the writer Joel Schumacher. What he was thinking in writing a low and sad movie for kids? We're never wanna know! 310".

Who watched such gritty classics as Serpico Dog Day Afternoon and Network and said Hey that's the guy we should get to make a campy pastelcolored blackthemed songanddance extravaganza! I know I know...the producers wanted to change the film from the original Broadway show do something different make it more gritty more urban and Lumet knew his way around that sort of thing. But making a musical was not his forte. For anyone questioning this check out The Wiz.Forget the fact that the source material just isn't very good. There's a reason Ease on Down the Road is played over and over again...it's the only decent song in the whole thing. Forget the fact that Joel Schumacher who years later decided the Batsuit needed nipples wrote or rather scrawled an awful script. Forget the fact that the costumes look like they were found in a Dumpster outside Party Fair. All of these things could easily have been overlooked if only the direction hadn't been so hamhanded. Watching the musical numbers you just want to reach into the screen grab Lumet and force him to move his camera a bit. Each number is shot in the most static fashion with barely a zoom a pan or a dolly. It's like watching a filmed stage production with real NYC locations brought into the theater. I understand this was before the era of MTV and I'm not asking for Michael Baytype direction but where Lumet's static direction worked with such dialogueheavy dramas as Network and Dog Day and later Prince of the City the exact opposite approach was needed here.I don't want to sound like I'm knocking Lumet for being a bad director. Nothing could be further from the truth. But some directors even great ones are not meant to make certain movies. I believe he took the job for the paycheck and while there's nothing inherently wrong with that you can't feel any passion for the project coming through. I just wonder what would have happened if a filmmaker with a real passion for the job had taken on The Wiz.".

Perhaps that's partly a personal reaction to the rather inflated claims made for Reeves' last film by certain critics who seek to present it as the work of a suicidal soulintorment auteur. C'mon fellas. 'The Sorcerers' is quirky and takes itself slightly too seriously resulting in a strange enjoyably naive atmosphere. I particularly enjoy the unique screen presence of Victor Henry who plays Ian Ogilvy's ginger haired friend Alan. I was saddened to learn via the evereducational IMDb that he was involved in a road traffic accident not too long after making this film and spent the last 17 years of his short life in a vegetative state. Another potential talent lost.Ignore the wits who claim that this is a work which dissects and critiques the function and form of cinema itself etc etc. These people create subtexts for Pete Walker films in their spare time. Enjoy it simply as a movie where Ian Ogilvy listens to Cliff Richard's 'Out in the country' on his dansette and then slashes up Susan George with a pair of scissors.Hey. 'Wired for sound' gets me the same way.".

Horror legend Karloff plays an elderly scientist who has invented a technique which enables his wife Catherine Lacey and himself to experience the thoughts and emotions of a young man Reeves regular Ian Ogilvy. Ogilivy doesn't know they are doing this and eventually loses control of his mind and body after there is a battle of wills between the old couple who are vicariously living through him.

It has the budget and look of a madefortelevision movie Euston Films maybe? and falls somewhere between Peeping Tom and Performance in its conflation of traditional horrorfantasy and Swinging London elements. The first scene of Karloff sparring with a newsagent recalls Miles Malleson poring over dirty postcards in Michael Powell's masterwork. Ian Ogilvy's eternal triangle in and around a nightclub interrupted by the increasingly criminal forays on which he is sent by the mindcontrolling Montserrats has a touch of James Fox's peregrinations as the hoodlum whose brain is warped by contact with Mick Jagger and Anita Pallenberg.Like Fox Ogilvy was a public schoolboy Eton here convincingly playing rough trade. His junk shop cheekily named The Glory Hole is in Lisson Grove not far from the infamous Bayswater pad of Performance. A comparison of Reeves and Donald Cammell as sceptical observers of the Flower Power era might keep a film studies thesiswriter busy.However the film belongs to Karloff and Catherine Lacey the puppetmasters of mesmerism. Boris aged 80 is doing his last work in his native land. He is clearly tired and spends most of the runtime sitting or sprawling. He is in his mellow Targets phase bearded gaunt holloweyed and lined that beautifully sepulchral voice still able to veer from sinister implication to moral authority within a few syllables.

	schema:reviewBody "The once great hypnotist Prof Marcus Montserrat has fallen on hard times since being ridiculed by the press. He now lives in a tiny flat with his loyal wife selling his services in the window of newsagents. His master project of mind control sits without a subject until wife Estelle hits on the idea of offering the mindcontrol device as some sort of wild new trip to a generally disaffected youth looking for the next thrill. With this they manage to recruit one Mike Roscoe and find that they can influence his actions and also experience the sensations that he is feeling whether it is washing his hands or the flutter of desire for a young woman. The power of the device demonstrated Marcus has plans for the direction it will go but Estelle finds the ability to experience youthful sensations again in your young body to be a great gift that she is unwilling to part with so easily.Everything about this film screams that it will be poor. From the very start we learn that it is dated by throwing in so many hip aspects in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience while also being a film late in the life of Boris Karloff where it appears he has selected it because it means most of his scenes are done indoors. The gaudy colourcinematography doesn't help either and within about ten minutes I could feel my brain writing this review already  dismissing it as a trashy piece of 60's trash trading on hip clichs of youth and music while also alluding to better by having Karloff at the head of the cast. To some extent this first impression is correct because it is very much all of these things but yet it manages to have enough about the central plot to prevent it being a cheap and easy horror film but is something better.It does this by making the scenes with the Monsterrats the most important and engaging scenes in the film and all the 1960's trimmings and young people remain just that  trimmings. The real battle is occurring within this tiny front room and somehow the two cast members manage to make this work despite spending most of their time pretending to feel stuff or concentrating really hard with their eyes closed. Sure Karloff is the star here and does do good work but the film is stolen by a great turn from Catherine Lacey as his wife Estelle. Her fall into madness is well delivered and she becomes the dark heart to the story even overpowering Karloff himself. Outside of these two the film is generic young people. Ogilvy does reasonably well to convince at being controlled Ercy and Henry run around and Sheridan looks dropdead gorgeous. As director Reeves is guilty of some obvious shots and places but when he is in the flat with just Lacey and Karloff he does manage to produce a genuinely tense atmosphere that is maintained in that room all the way to the memorable final shot.The Sorcerers is not a perfect film by any means but it is much better than I thought it would be and much better than all the trimmings suggest it deserves to be. It has dated and is deliberately hip but it works thanks to Karloff Lacey and some genuine tension in the confines of a grotty little flat.".

	schema:headline " Atmospheric and effective little British low budget horror production starring Boris Karloff.";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie had a notable low budget but in this case that really works in its advantage. It helps to keep the movie focused on what matters the most and there are no distracting chases monsters makeup or other horror elements present. It gives the movie plenty of room to let its atmosphere become the most haunting and effective aspect of the movie. The low budget gives the movie a certain sense of realism which helps to make this movie feel as an uneasy one. So its really not a scary movie but more of an uneasy one to watch mainly due to the atmosphere and simplistic story of the movie.The movie relies on just one simple concept and uses this throughout the entire movie. 'The great hypnotist Professor Montserrat has developed a technique for controlling the minds and sharing the sensations of his subjects. He and his wife Estelle test the technique on Mike Roscoe and enjoy 'being' the younger man. But Estelle soon grows to love the power of controlling Roscoe and the vicarious pleasures that provides. How far will she go and can the Professor restrain her in time?'. This rather simplistic sort of story and concept works out well in the movie and makes this one of the better 'typicaly' low budget British horror movies from the '60's. It's basically a big plus that Boris Karloff is in this movie. It doesn't make it any better more professional or uplifts it but its just a welcome addition to the movie that also helps to of course make this movie a bit more special. Also remember that he already was 80 years old at the time of this movie. You have got to respect that. The large majority of people of course only know him for his Frankenstein role but those who've seen him in other horror movies also know that Boris Karloff actually was a pretty good actor for his time. He could very well play demanding roles with obviously also more lines to it. He once more shows in this movie he was a capable actor though the script is a bit too dodgy in parts to really allow him to shine to his best capabilities. He played in a lot of movies like this in the '60's at the end of his career before his death in 1969 2 years after this movie.Catherine Lacey doesn't really begin good in the movie but as the movie starts to progress and her character develops she gets really good in her role that also becomes a big part in the movie its uneasy and realistic atmosphere. I've also liked Ian Ogilvy. He has got the right 'arrogant' kind of look and also knew how to act. Too bad he never really broke through in Hollywood and he now mostly just makes small appearances in well known TVseries. Oh well at least there is still this and other movies to enjoy him in.It's the sort of late '60's movie made in pre'70's style. So some of the camerawork and compositions is quite experimental at times. Unfortunately the editing is not much good and it forms one of the weaker aspects of the movie. It feels sloppy at times and even kills the movie its flow at certain points.A movie well worth searching out.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It stars Boris Karloff Ian Ogilvy Catherine Lacey Victor Henry and Elizabeth Ercy. Music is by Paul Ferris and cinematography by Stanley A. Long.When aged scientist Marcus Monserrat Karloff tries a new hypnosis machine on bored young man Mike Roscoe Ogilvy he and his wife find they can control his actions and experience what he is experiencing. Initially this breakthrough is a rewarding one but Marcus' wife Estelle Lacey wants more and soon things start to get decidedly amoral.Michael Reeves sadly died of an accidental drug overdose aged just 25 this having crafted the Cruel Britania brilliance that was Witchfinder General. Prior to that he helmed The Sorcerers an equally great production a scifi horror fusion that pulses with a pessimistic tone. There's no great budget for the talented young director to work with but it barely matters in fact it benefits the film greatly as the two elders Karloff wonderful Lacey magnificent live vicariously through Roscoe's Ogilvy fresh faced and perfectly exuding a bored man after further thrills misadventures. But the kicker here is that it is Karloff's scientist who recognises things are going out of control and it is he who strives to stop his obsessed wife from committing heinous acts.Set to the backdrop of swinging sixties London with mini skirts Brit pop music and Norton motorbikes firm period reminders The Sorcerers captures the zeitgeist of the time. Blending psychedelia with scifi and amoral horror with wistful yearnings film comes out as an original piece of work. Thematically as has been noted by the critics who have afforded this under seen classic some time it says youth is wasted on the young while also planting us the film viewer in the metaphor chair. If Reeves was being caustic we will never know sadly but it does bear thinking about in light of how horror films and their blood thirsty fans would evolve come the millennium. Michael Reeves a visionary?From Lacey bringing one of horror's forgotten monsters to life to a no cop out ending of pure bleakness The Sorcerers never lets up on gnawing away at the senses.

	schema:headline " Horror in Swinging London";
	schema:reviewBody "The director Michael Reeves who died from a drug overdose in 1969 at the age of 25 is today probably best known for his last film WitchfinderGeneral made in 1968. The Sorcerers dates from the previous year and is an attempt to combine a horror theme with the sort of swinging London milieu familiar from other films of this period such as John Schlesinger's Darling or Antonioni's BlowUp. Professor Marcus Montserrat was at one time a distinguished medical hypnotist but was disgraced in some scandal the exact nature of which we never discover some thirty years earlier and is now a lonely embittered and impoverished old man. He has however continued with his scientific work and has perfected a hypnotic technique which will enable him not only to control the subject by as it were remote control but also to experience vicariously all the sensations that the subject is experiencing. Montserrat and his wife Estelle persuade a young man named Mike Roscoe to volunteer to act as their guineapig for their experiments with this technique.It is significant that this film was made by a director in his early twenties during a period when the generation gap was a phrase on everyone's lips because this is very much a film about crabbed age and youth. The contrasts between the old and the young are emphasised. Montserrat seems more like Mike's grandfather than his father Boris Karloff was fiftysix years older than Ian Ogilvy. Ogilvy was a close friend of the director and was also to star in WitchfinderGeneral. Mike lives in an airy spacious apartment decorated in a thenfashionable style and spends his leisure time in discos nightclubs and coffee bars. Some of the pop music of the era such as Cliff Richard's Out in the Country is incorporated into the soundtrack. Montserrat and Estelle by contrast live in a dingy flat of the sort familiar from the kitchensink realist films of the fifties. Their floral wallpaper is faded and their furniture shabby and outdated. They appear to have no leisure pursuits except perhaps those of regretting their lost youth and envying the young.The film is not however preaching some simplistic message along the lines of Don't trust anyone over thirty a popular phrase at the time. Mike is not portrayed simply as an innocent victim he is a bored selfish and amoral young man who neglects his pretty French girlfriend Nicole. He volunteers for Montserrat's experiments because he is bored with his seemingly comfortable life and hungry for new experiences there is a suggestion that at least at some subconscious level he is happy to go along with whatever Montserrat and Estelle order him to do.Montserrat's motives for developing this new mindcontrol technique appear to have been partly idealistic he was hoping to use it to enable old people like himself to recapture some of the joys of their youth. About halfway through the film however a new conflict arises that between Montserrat and Estelle. She discovers that she has a greater power to control Mike than does her husband and drunk with power forces him to commit ever more immoral acts starting with stealing a fur coat and progressing to two murders. To his horror Montserrat finds that he has lost control over Mike who under Estelle's influence has become a monster. There is a contrast between Karloff who plays Montserrat with a certain restraint and dignity and Catherine Lacey who gives a splendidly overthetop performance as Estelle is transformed from a little old lady into a raving maniac.Although it is not an overtly political movie the control which Montserrat and Estelle exercise over Mike may reflect the feeling of many young people that they were subject to the unwanted controlling influence of the older generation. This was after all the period when young men were being sent by elderly or middleaged politicians to fight in Vietnam. There is a similarity with WitchfinderGeneral which also features a villain who exercises a controlling influence over the minds of others although Hopkins does so by playing on superstitious beliefs rather than by hypnosis. One difference between the two films is that WitchfinderGeneral is like The Wicker Man a rationalist horror film in which it is superstition not the supernatural which should frighten us. In The Sorcerers however Estelle seems truly demonic despite the bits of scientificlooking equipment we see her level of control over Mike seems as the title may indicate like something supernatural rather than the result of any scientifically explicable phenomena.Unlike some critics I would not regard either of these two films as great masterpieces. Reeves however was clearly a highly promising director before his career was tragically cut short and both WitchfinderGeneral and The Sorcerers are films which retain plenty of interest even today. 710".

The story can have some dull spots but has a good sense of terror suspense and thrills. Michael Reeves who died tragically far too early directs assuredly while the acting is good by all. Ian Ogilvy Victor Henry and Susan George hardly disgrace themselves in support but they are outshone by both Boris Karloff and especially Catherine Lacey. Karloff is very dignified menacing and adroit even when not as active and towards the end of his career he still has what made him a good actor in the first place. Lacey overdoes it a tad at times but that doesn't matter at all when she is such fun to watch and is as scary as she is.

He plays Professor Marcus Monserrata disgraced hypnotist who lives with his wife Estelle Catherine Lacey in a drab apartment. They've created a new machine that allows them to experience and control the minds of anyone they manage to get tested on it. That someone would be Mike Roscoe Ian Ogilvy a young man who seems bored with the swinging '60s London lifestyle as evidenced by his nonchalant treatment of his girlfriend Nicole Elizabeth Ercy and their friend Alan Victor Henry. Unfortunately while Marcus wants to use it to help certain kinds of people Estelle just wants some thrills...The plot seemed to be similar to Brainstorm only more disturbing especially concerning the Estelle character. The mix of atmospheres is quite exciting and the shocks are genuinely frightening. Karloff is at his most sympathetic here as he feels truly overwhelmed by Ms. Lacey's aggressive power. And seeing Ogilvy truly trying to be a mix of emotions without overdoing it was compellingly played here. Also good was Sally Dani Sheridan Nicollette's mother as singer Laura Ladd and young Susan George as Audrey Woods Mike's previous girlfriend. In summation The Sorcerers comes highly recommend due to Karloff and the rest of the cast.".

Unfortunately while Marcus wants to use it to help certain kinds of people Estelle just wants some thrills...The plot seemed to be similar to Brainstorm only more disturbing especially concerning the Estelle character. The mix of atmospheres is quite exciting and the shocks are genuinely frightening. Karloff is at his most sympathetic here as he feels truly overwhelmed by Ms. Lacey's aggressive power. And seeing Ogilvy truly trying to be a mix of emotions without overdoing it was compellingly played here. Also good was Sally Dani Sheridan Nicollette's mother as singer Laura Ladd and young Susan George as Audrey Woods Mike's previous girlfriend. In summation The Sorcerers comes highly recommend due to Karloff and the rest of the cast.";

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched a Boris Karloff film that I'd not seen before The Sorcerers 1967. In this one Karloff plays a scientist and hypnotist who has come up with a gizmo that will enable him to control others telepathically long distance while at the same time feeling that person's emotions. He and his wife use the gizmo to take control over a mod swinging Londoner Ian Ogilvy. The two coerce the lad to swim in a pool and speed on a motorcycle and experience all those feelings in their apartment. But soon the wife Catherine Lacey gets a little too intoxicated with the experiences and forces Ian into even further deeds for her own pleasure stealing a fur coat from a store and even serial killing! This film is surprisingly well done and features some interesting directorial touches from Michael The Conqueror Worm Reeve. It's a bit disconcerting to see Karloff in a film along with psychedelic images and groovy rock music but he is excellent as always even at this late stage in his career. The film builds to a logical and downbeat conclusion typical for Reeve and is really a most satisfying experience. I was very pleased at how fine a film this one turned out to be....".

At this point there's a nice bit of social commentary going on too especially concerning the disenchantment of 'the youth' of the sixties and how long such a golden age could possibly continue but the second half becomes a disturbing horror flick as the wife suddenly becomes excited and obsessed by the ability to force Ogilvy to commit acts of violence.

The interplay between Karloff and his wife is great and the ending's fittingly neat too. Perhaps it's not quite the insight in to voyeurism  obsession that Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is but it's certainly got a lot going for it with a sharp script great acting especially from Karloff and some interesting imagery and choices of camera angles too.So The Sorcerer's perhaps by no means a classic but it's definitely an intriguing film and it gets 710 from me.".

This British prodigy passed away far too early at age 23 but not before delivering a couple of very entertaining film and one authentic masterpiece that being The Witchfinder General starring Vincent Price. The Sorcerers is filmed with a remarkably smaller budget than Witchfinder but it contains equally large doses of ingeniousness style and a very solid concept. Reeves himself adapted a novel by John Burke that tells the tale of an elderly scientist  Boris Karloff as Professor Marcus Monserrat  who invented a technique to control the mind of persons and experience life through their emotions. He and his wife magnificent role by Catherine Lacey test it on the rebellious Mike Ian Ogilvy who appeared in 3 Michael Reeves movies. At first it's all very innocent with the kick of crushing eggs but soon Mike is committing horrible murders forced by the will of the old couple. And it's proved once again that the women have a far more violent mind! The tone of this motion picture is very dark and Reeves brings it with a rarely seen before virtuosity. You really don't mind the obvious cheapness as true creativity doesn't require a large budget. The screenplay features action a very exciting car chase near the end for example quite shocking images of violent massacre and even a thoughtprovoking moral as you witness what helpless elderly are capable of if they're only given the power! On top of all this The Sorcerers has a swinging 60's soundtrack and it can count on terrific acting performances. Boris Karloff's role perhaps isn't the most suitable he ever played but any performance by this icon is always worth admiring. Keep an eye open for a small appearance by the young and stunningly beautiful Susan George".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sorcerers offers horror icon Boris Karloff one of the last truly worthwhile roles of his career. It is one of only three films to be directed by young filmmaker Michael Reeves. Film buffs are forever declaring what great things Reeves would have gone on to achieve had he lived longer. Whether these claims of unfulfilled greatness are accurate or not noone will ever truly know. It is fair to say that his last film the sublime Witchfinder General is unquestionably a genre classic indicating that this young director certainly possessed the potential to become a major force. His second film The Sorcerers is another rather interesting and wellmade chiller which shows plenty of early promise. Combining elements of scifi and the serialkiller genre The Sorcerers is an unusual and effective entry from Tigon. Although it has not dated as well as some films from its era it remains fascinating for a number of reasons  its strong performances disorientating camera angles and scoring infrequent but savage violence and its apparent suggestion that society's drink 'n' drugfuelled hedonists are potential serial killersinwaiting. In spite of occasional flaws The Sorcerers is a film well worth checking out.A former practitioner of medical hypnosis Professor Marcus Monserrat Karloff now lives in disgrace in a grotty corner of London sharing a shabby apartment with his wife Estelle Catherine Lacey. They have built a machine which can induce powerful telepathic hypnosis upon anyone who uses it giving the Monserrats the ability to control the hypnotised person's mind and more remarkably experience whatever sensations they are feeling as if they were their own. All they need now is a young guinea pig willing to submit himself to their mind control experiment. Enter Mike Roscoe Ian Ogilvy a handsome but bored youth who has grown dissatisfied with a life of disco drink and dating hot chicks. He wants something new to inject excitement back into his life and Professor Monserrat's hypnosis machine looks just the ticket. Unfortunately after Mike has been successfully brought under the control of the good professor and his wife things begin to take a sinister turn. Drunk on power and unable to resist the intoxicating thrill of controlling someone else's actions Estelle starts telepathically manoeuvring Mike into darkly dangerous situations encouraging him to commit escalating crimes ranging from burglary and assault to murder.The film cleverly deromanticises the usual perception of London in the Swinging Sixties showing a darker place where frustration and cruelty bubble beneath the surface. Karloff gives a solid performance as the frail wellmeaning professor who cannot see the potential for evil in his invention Lacey is great too as his dangerously unhinged wife. It's often been said that Estelle's descent into psychotic madness is too sudden and complete to be a wholly convincing plot development  a criticism that carries much truth in all fairness  but nevertheless the actress gives a splendidly fullbodied performance as the film's main villain. The way Karloff's character is the more sympathetic and agreeable of the two acts as a nice little twist on expectations too. Overall The Sorcerers is a solid cult chiller  skilfullymade thoughtprovoking and entertaining fare from a young filmmaker whose light went out too soon.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Sorcerers offers horror icon Boris Karloff one of the last truly worthwhile roles of his career. It is one of only three films to be directed by young filmmaker Michael Reeves. Film buffs are forever declaring what great things Reeves would have gone on to achieve had he lived longer. Whether these claims of unfulfilled greatness are accurate or not noone will ever truly know. It is fair to say that his last film the sublime Witchfinder General is unquestionably a genre classic indicating that this young director certainly possessed the potential to become a major force. His second film The Sorcerers is another rather interesting and wellmade chiller which shows plenty of early promise. Combining elements of scifi and the serialkiller genre The Sorcerers is an unusual and effective entry from Tigon.

	schema:reviewBody "An interesting addition to the swinging '60s subgenre of urban horror movies this rarelyseen film is the work of brainchild Michael Reeves the guy who made WITCHFINDER GENERAL and then died in mysterious circumstances shortly afterwards. The storyline focuses on an oldfashioned science fiction standby  that of the telepathic link between two characters  and breathes new life into the tale by developing some highly interesting personalities. The main characters are an elderly couple desperate to reexperience some of the excitement of modern youth the hypnosis machine is merely a method of making this dream come true. Like all of the best scientific inventions it is created for the good of mankind the Monserrats plan to use it to help other elderly people have the same experiences but eventually ends up being used for the worst evil.The film is as stylish as any set in swinging London cf. BLOW UP and Reeves adds enough intrigue and artistic touches into the brew to make it consistently interesting from a technical viewpoint. Although slowlypaced there is a focus on gritty realism which reminds me of another similar  and no less disturbing  film from the same year CORRUPTION with Peter Cushing. The budget limits the use of expensive special effects but the story is good enough so you won't care. Another strong element is the acting with three outstanding performances from the leads and some surprisingly good turns from the supports. Watch out for a young Susan George once again on the receiving end of some unpleasant male violence.Acting towards the end of his lengthy career Boris Karloff plays not the mad scientist  as you might expect having watched the earlier body of his work  but instead a genuinely misguided and flawed creator who is too physically weak to be able to defend his young protg when the time calls for it. Thus he is not really the villain of the piece but instead a helpless victim and Karloff's strong acting evokes sympathy for his plight. It's nice to see the ageing actor get a meaty role for a change and I would rank this as possibly his best performance of the 1960s.Catherine Lacey is simply astonishing as Karloff's wife whose transformation from a kindly OAP to the very embodiment of vengeful and sadistic evil is frighteningly good. Unsurprisingly considering his close friendship with director Reeves the young male lead is played by Ian Ogilvy who is as good as ever in a rather subdued and fairly deep part. Although some may complain that the ending is a little predictable and oldfashioned I for one thought it finished off the tragic tale nicely. Fans of the genre should keep their eyes peeled for this imaginative and underrated talentfilled offering.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cacoyannis based this film in a Greek classic novel by Kosmas Politis named 'Eroica'. It was filmed five years after his first masterpiece 'Stella' 1955 starring the mercurial Melina Mercouri. Eroica means heroic and generally means a hero or heroine who fulfills the definitions of what is considered good and noble in the originating culture typically the willingness to sacrifice the self for the greater good. So this is a story of two boys and their actions and flaws which lead them to their downfall.At first we have Alekos. A handsome boy of fifteen that realizes that he is in love with Monica the daughter of the British Ambassador. He is also a member of the teenage boys gang. The leader in the gang is Loizos. The film begins with the accidental death of Andreas Loizo's best friend by Nestoras and the reactions of the boys to this tragic event. Loizos trying to cope with the event realizes that he is the illegitimate son of his mother's adulterous affair. He abandons the gang and leaves with a theatrical group to find himself. Alekos trying to establish himself as the new leader of the gang burns down the house of Nestor. He wins the love of Monica but he loses his selfrespect. The end is tragic. Cacoyannis succeeds in creating beautiful images and a romantic vision. The viewer feels sympathy for the arrogant cocky and heroic Loizos and sympathy for the imprudent and romantic Alekos. Monica seems beautiful vain and empty of feelings the creature that symbolizes the end of the boy's childhood. The only disadvantage of the film is that Kosmas Politi's poetic words and theories seem 'heavy' to be heard from teenagers. Jenny Russell is good but sometimes you feel that the burden of the role is too big for her. Both Alekos and Loizos are very good actors for their ages. I like the film. It is rather slow but that helps the final climax and tragedy.".

	schema:headline " Sergio Corbucci's Western parody is packed with noisy action and silly humor";
	schema:reviewBody "A very funny Western about some roguish adventurers who attempt to rob a fortune of a rescue . ItalianSpanish coproduction full of action  exaggerated characters shootouts and lots of humor . This Spaghetti Western concerns about robbing a valuable Japanese pony from a train crossing American West and the Japan Ambassador had for gift to US . The thieves result to be some rebel Indians . Then a Japanese named Sakura Tomas Milian the Yellow along with a rogue thief SwissGiuliano Gemma the White  and a sheriff Eli Wallach the Black team up as three unlikely heroes . This is a surprisingly lowkey Spaghetti Western in which three diverse characters joining forces to find the sacred horse and rob a rescue .This amusing picture contains an entertaining plot  action Western  shootouts and bits of campy and refreshing humor . It's an improbable blending of standard Western tongueincheek and ChopSocky . A bemusing premise  gunslingers against samurais  and interesting casting full of usual Spaghetti make this oater well worth the watching . Delightful Western satire in which the grifter Giuliano Gemma using his wits  breaking all the rules and kicking virtually every clich in the pants  as he relentlessly deceives plunders and robs . Amiable but sometimes lumbering Western satire goes on and on about the same premise  as a lot of minutes are superfluous it has half hour of excess  as it packs overblown jokes and antics and some moments turns out to be dull and tiring . Tomas Milian steals the show as Sakura he is very fine he ravages the screen he jumps bounds and leaps hit and run  besides receives violent punches kicks and is ultimately buried . Furthermore appears ordinary secondaries of SpaghettiPaella Western as Chris Huerta  Tito Garcia Victor Israel Dan Van Husen Rafael Albaicin Lorenzo Robledo and many others . The film mingles slapdash pursuits high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shootouts fights or stunts every few minutes . The musicians Guido and Mauricio De Angelis compose a jolly soundtrack with catching leitmotif and well conducted  it's full of guttural sounds and commercial songs. Striking cinematography by Luis Cuadrado in Eastmancolor with negative well processed . Interior filmed at Paolis Studios  Rome and Ballesteros studios Madrid and outdoor sequences filmed  of course  at Almeria Spain. The film follows in the wake of  Hallelujah trail 65  by John Sturges  Support your local sheriff  and  Support your local gunfighter  by Burt Kennedy and of course  Blazing saddles 74  by Mel Brooks  all of them are engaging Western satire and very fun . The picture takes part of a subgenre in which during the period of the 70s combined Spaghetti Western and art martial with original influence of David Carradine's Kung Fu  series  for example  Karate law in the west Tonino Ricci  My name is Shangai JoeMario Caiano and  Return of Shangai Joe  Bitto Albertini in addition  Red sun Terence Young  that bears remarkable resemblance to this one .Sergio Corbucci's direction is well crafted here he's more cynical and humorous and less inclined toward violence and packs too much action  but especially this slapstick Western contains broad comedy . The other Sergio made several Spaghetti classics as  Django The great silence Hellbenders The specialist  and Zapata Western as The Mercenary The Compaeros and What am I doing in middle of the revolution . In addition Sergio directed other inferior S.W. as Far West story Johnny Oro The white the yellow an the black and Minnesota Clay. It's an offbeat  muddle and uneven Western but will appeal to Corbucci aficionados . Rating  55  riotous Western spoof in which there's too much silly comedy and enough excitement".

Then a Japanese named Sakura Tomas Milian the Yellow along with a rogue thief SwissGiuliano Gemma the White  and a sheriff Eli Wallach the Black team up as three unlikely heroes . This is a surprisingly lowkey Spaghetti Western in which three diverse characters joining forces to find the sacred horse and rob a rescue .This amusing picture contains an entertaining plot  action Western  shootouts and bits of campy and refreshing humor . It's an improbable blending of standard Western tongueincheek and ChopSocky . A bemusing premise  gunslingers against samurais  and interesting casting full of usual Spaghetti make this oater well worth the watching . Delightful Western satire in which the grifter Giuliano Gemma using his wits  breaking all the rules and kicking virtually every clich in the pants  as he relentlessly deceives plunders and robs . Amiable but sometimes lumbering Western satire goes on and on about the same premise  as a lot of minutes are superfluous it has half hour of excess  as it packs overblown jokes and antics and some moments turns out to be dull and tiring . Tomas Milian steals the show as Sakura he is very fine he ravages the screen he jumps bounds and leaps hit and run  besides receives violent punches kicks and is ultimately buried . Furthermore appears ordinary secondaries of SpaghettiPaella Western as Chris Huerta  Tito Garcia Victor Israel Dan Van Husen Rafael Albaicin Lorenzo Robledo and many others . The film mingles slapdash pursuits high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shootouts fights or stunts every few minutes . The musicians Guido and Mauricio De Angelis compose a jolly soundtrack with catching leitmotif and well conducted  it's full of guttural sounds and commercial songs. Striking cinematography by Luis Cuadrado in Eastmancolor with negative well processed . Interior filmed at Paolis Studios  Rome and Ballesteros studios Madrid and outdoor sequences filmed  of course  at Almeria Spain. The film follows in the wake of  Hallelujah trail 65  by John Sturges  Support your local sheriff  and  Support your local gunfighter  by Burt Kennedy and of course  Blazing saddles 74  by Mel Brooks  all of them are engaging Western satire and very fun . The picture takes part of a subgenre in which during the period of the 70s combined Spaghetti Western and art martial with original influence of David Carradine's Kung Fu  series  for example  Karate law in the west Tonino Ricci  My name is Shangai JoeMario Caiano and  Return of Shangai Joe  Bitto Albertini in addition  Red sun Terence Young  that bears remarkable resemblance to this one .Sergio Corbucci's direction is well crafted here he's more cynical and humorous and less inclined toward violence and packs too much action  but especially this slapstick Western contains broad comedy . The other Sergio made several Spaghetti classics as  Django The great silence Hellbenders The specialist  and Zapata Western as The Mercenary The Compaeros and What am I doing in middle of the revolution . In addition Sergio directed other inferior S.W. as Far West story Johnny Oro The white the yellow an the black and Minnesota Clay. It's an offbeat  muddle and uneven Western but will appeal to Corbucci aficionados . Rating  55  riotous Western spoof in which there's too much silly comedy and enough excitement";

If you thought Mickey Rooney's turn in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S was racially offensive you haven't seen anything yet.The rest of the film is a tired mix of genre tropes and repetitive slapstick comedy.

Some might just have been Japanese but the main one was played by the CubanAmerican Toma Milian and it's undoubtedly one of the most embarrassing roles he ever took. Seeing the guy in a goofy wig mustache and kimono looked utterly stupid. Unfortunately the film itself never rose much above this.

Katie ends up getting a job via two conniving coworkers Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick who are just using Katie to get the president of the firm Larry Miller ousted. This is strictly a b movie its not meant to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying. The film is watchable in that its not an abomination but its throwaway fluff. In a cameo Penny Marshall is funny a subtle injoke about Milwaukee made me chuckle and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests don't read too much into this. So not horrible but easy to skip. Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does. Again not good but not a profound disaster.".

Katie is forlorn about his departure and soon makes plans to travel to Manhattan herself for a surprise visit. However Billy the Cad has a woman in his bedroom when Katie comes knocking. Tearfully Katie gives him back the ring and heads to the apartment of another Oklahoma transplant Haley Rachael Leigh Cook. Haley is an aspiring actress and offers welcome and comfort to Katie. But when she has an audition she asks Katie to fill in for her at her day job as a bicycle courier. In short order Katie not only meets a nice mail clerk Ben Luke Wilson but also a nefarious company vice president Debra Penelope Ann Miller and her loathsome assistant Freddy Andy Dick. Perceiving Katie as a dim bulb they soon have her placed as the secretary for the company president Larry Miller where they hope to manipulate her into embarrassing the prez in front of the board of directors resulting in his ouster and Debra's elevation. Can such a scheme work and is Katie really just another dumb bunny? This is a very predictable offering to fans of light romance but it has its moments and most of the cast is really terrific. Simpson herself is rather nondescript but pleasant but not so for the other thespians. Wilson is engaging as ever Penelope Ann Miller makes a fine screen witch and Dick has some really funny scenes. Larry Miller Nelson and Cook also add much to the film's enjoyment. As for Fuller all one can say is wow! He is very handsome and should have a bright future ahead of him as an actor or a model. While there is nothing spectacular about the costumes sets or photography they are definitely up to par but the formulaic script and direction alternates between humor and tediousness. In short if you are not an admirer of the romcom genre you would probably be well advised to skip this one altogether.

Someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say.And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My the nut has fallen far from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can in fact shoot a scene in a cab in New York and it will look real and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson but hopefully he's learned that lesson now.And Jessica Simpson... naturally she can't act. Hell she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn and yet she's starring in this movie. OH wait it was produced by her father. Okay that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think of.So should I be surprised it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad but this... it's not just bad it's the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie this film is as bad as that film is good. It's the AntiAnnie Hall.I am so glad I didn't pay to see it I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn't go on. No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then around when the first act is ending you realize it'll only get worse and that's when you either need to leave or kill yourself.In conclusion this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding.".

That's really the only reason I can think of.So should I be surprised it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad but this... it's not just bad it's the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie this film is as bad as that film is good. It's the AntiAnnie Hall.I am so glad I didn't pay to see it I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn't go on. No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then around when the first act is ending you realize it'll only get worse and that's when you either need to leave or kill yourself.In conclusion this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding.";

When will we stop seeing singers that obviously can't act keep trying to I hope ends soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors Penelope Ann Miller Rachel Leigh Cook  Luke Wilson who are part of this dump. As far as the plot well it is almost nonexistent and so poorly done and written yes I know it's another rehash I very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this. Please whatever you do don't waste your time but if you do feel sorry for the ACTUAL actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb. Jessica Simpson you're pretty but stick to singing although I'm not much a fan of that either. And whoever did this film I wouldn't put this on your resume. 110 because you can't give a zero.".

And how many of these morons will have bothered to watch the movie before posting those comments? I'm guessing none but they see Jessica Simpson and they can't resist. It's quite pathetic really.So onto a review of the actual film from somebody who HAS bothered to watch it then? It's pretty much what you go in looking for  a cute fluffy  fun movie which showcases Jessica Simpson as a lovable goof ball and breaks no new ground but happens to have just enough funny moments  cute performances to save its self. It's the sort of movie to rent on a Friday night in the sort of thing that you don't have to think too hard about but don't find yourself falling asleep during  will leave you with a little smirk thanks to it's star and it's sappy ending.This movie is and always has been a Jessica Simpson vehicle which is made pretty damn clear from the outset. From it's title to it's setting to it's cameos from her dog her father  her hairstylist to it's unoffensive and quirky heroine. Her first movie role takes her public persona and throws in just enough acting material for her to practise with until she gets cast as lead in a big movie it's the people who haven't figured that out that are having the problem here. Given that she's the lead makes it obvious to everyone that she's gonna have to showcase a little more than in her prior roles. Does she have the acting talent that she's constantly belittled for? Well yes. If you actually watch the movie you'll see that Simpson does have the making of a comedic actress  which is handy because she doesn't seem to be trying anything else. She has the right amount of on screen charm  charisma to draw you in and enough quirks to keep you giggling up until the ending which you WILL see coming  but why is that always a bad thing?. Her deliverance is just fine and she brings the character to life  anybody who has a hard time believing her here i can't quite understand as she doesn't do anything wrong. Quite the opposite  it's her quirky little faces the winks the smiles  the giggles that make Katie Gregorstich a person  and which Amy Renfo in EOTM lacked.As for her costars  Luke Wilson Rachael Leigh Cook Drew Fuller Penelope Ann Miller Andy Dick Larry Miller  Willy Nelson are there for Jessica's character to bounce off of and they're charming and funny but to be fair to them aren't really given much to play with as it's made clear from the outset that they are all just supporting character. Penelope Miller is the most impressive of the costars as she shapes  molds the hapless  unwitting Katie Drew Fuller is all too convincingly shallow  Luke Wilson does well as the love interest with a secret.The script is a little weak and it's not exactly ground breaking but it's actors keep it alive and it offers enough material to keep them happy. The direction is fine  not great but good enough to keep you interested.The movie does have a sort of cheap feel to it but i imagine the salary bill took up over half of the budget  it only really shows in the taxi scene  the horrid shots of Katie on the street in New York which are badly lit badly wigged  totally unnecessary.So to sum up what is this movie? Plainly put it's a Jessica Simpson comedy veichle. That said  Is it groundbreakingly earth shatteringly hart wrenchingly amazing? No is it cute funny  good enough to rent? Definitely. Should i believe all the aholes who are on one constant bash? No. Should i watch it? YES!!".

Should i believe all the aholes who are on one constant bash? No. Should i watch it? YES!!";

The best friend played by Rachel Leigh Cook. The leading man played by Luke Wilson looking a little old for the part. Jessica Simpson looks a little old too.

	schema:headline " A delightful romantic comedy!";
	schema:reviewBody "The story goes something like this A smalltown girl Katie Jessica Simpson decides to visit her boyfriend in the big city. When she arrives she discovers he isn't quite as faithful as he should be. Katie then ends up venturing into the adventure that is New York. Filling in as bike messenger comedic and charming mishaps ensues. She falls into a hole in the ground and thus meets charismatic goodguy Ben Luke Wilson. It's not love at first sight at least for her but destiny and Ben won't give up quite that easy. Being just a smalltown girl AND blonde a couple of evil executives at a building firm decides she's the perfect scapegoat for their cunning plan. Misunderstandings with hilarious and sad consequences follow. However this is one blonde who won't take it lying down!People being judgmental of this film will soon enough be proved wrong. The jokes are confident and fitting and the story well developed. The relationship between Katie and Ben feels so natural that it puts anything Godard has created to shame. The multitalented Jessica Simpson once again surprises with a strong role only she could pull off. Simpson really is the Marilyn Monroe of our day there's even one scene honoring her!. She balances perfectly between vulnerable and whimsy. Katie really does show us that you can't judge a book by its cover! Luke Wilson is as charming as ever. Even if he was covered in manure that man would be as appealing as anyone. His light touch puppy dog eyes and laid back manner makes it difficult to resist. Andy Dick plays the role he was born to play one of the two diabolical executives. He really cannot be underestimated. The strength of the performance lies in his restraint. It's remarkable because most actors would just run away with it and play it for cheap laughs. Not this guy! In conclusion director Scott Marshall has crafted an intelligent and frequently hilarious comedy that is destined to become a classic alongside masterpieces of cinema like Epic Movie and Norbit. Kudos to everyone involved in this especially Jessica Simpson. Her sincere smile and wholehearted laughter would make even the toughest man break out in a big grin. You may be tough but you're not THAT tough! Warmly recommended to everyone who wants to be swept off their feet and see a romantic comedy that for once feels honest. Thank you for this film! Oh and the soundtrack rocks! Now if you still haven't gotten it. I'm being sarcastic. 110".

She catches him in flagrato with a stripper and the engagement is off.

These two frame something up to get Miller's assistant fired and then fake a resume for Simpson so that Miller hires her. With her as an unknowing fifth column in Miller's office Penelope and Andy start doing their thing.

And I can see the discussion around the Simpson kitchen table after they must have seen Reese Witherspoon's films. That kind of Elle Woods character was perfect for Jessica let's get something going like it.Director Scott Marshall cast his aunt Penny Marshall in a really good small part as the head of a development company who Simpson and her boyfriend mail room clerk Luke Wilson are pitching to. Wilson is the only good guy she met during her employment at this company but even he hasn't been totally honest.In the old days of the Hollywood studio system people like Janet Gaynor or Loretta Young or going back to silent days Mary Pickford would have been cast in Simpson's kind of part.

Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing.Many things in this movie were paintbynumbers the various uberclich montages the last minute misunderstanding even the kids' party chaos.

	schema:reviewBody "Calling Blonde Ambition an awful movie is beyond the actual content of the film. The movie was quite enjoyable and good. Mrs. Simpson's performance was not perfect but neither is most of Hollywood's Alist Actresses. She did a good job considering it was her first time as the lead. I also note that her chemistry with costar Luke Wilson was very high. But as good as the movie was on my views don't expect Oscar winning material from this.The movie had an exceptional plot without any plot holes. DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO...SPOILERS The story started with Simpson saying goodbye to her high school sweet heartDrew Fuller at a bus stop. Fuller is going to New York City to pursue his dream of being a model. Simpson is struck with sadness. It is later revealed that Simpson is engaged to Fuller. Realising the sadness of her granddaughter Simpson's grandfather Leslie Nelson gives her a plane ticket to see her lover on Valentine's Day. As soon as she get's there she finds out he's cheating on her. She cries to her cousin Rachel Leigh Cook who encourages her to stay in New York and find a job. Simpson then goes through small adventures as she lands a job at a big company. There she meets a handsome man Luke Wilson who seems to fall in love with her. The story then goes on to Simpson trying to keep her job as the Vice President Penelope Ann Miller of the company and her assistant Andy Dick try to confuse and use Simpson to get the President Larry Miller of the company fired.All in all the film was very good and enjoyable. Since the movie will not come out in theaters the film would be a very good rental and an excellent buy.8 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "REVIEW OF THE VERSION SHOWN ON TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES IN NORTH AmericaThis is one of many Italian WWII adventure films to be released in the late 1960s  early 1970s. It's a familiar story presented in a unique way with some American aspects thrown in.Leading man Rock Hudson stars as an American commando. His team is parachuted into Italy to blow a colossal strategic dam. Hudson's unit is ambushed and he is the only survivor. He is rescued by a band of Italian youngsters who con him into helping them wreak havoc on the Nazis who took over their town and killed their families. Meanwhile Capt. von Hecht Sergio Fantoni leads a hunt for Hudson and must cope with the S.S. to do so.This movie has a lot of fine aspects. First of all it's got a very good international cast. American star Rock Hudson has had his share of fame in plenty of classic movies he's had experience in the war movie genre too in TOBRUK and the marvelous ICE STATION ZEBRA. You'll see more of the incredibly beautiful Sylva Koscina than you've ever seen before she's a nurse who's captured to aid Hudson but is nonessential to the story. Just there to look at ... and there's plenty to see. Sergio Fantoni VON RYAN'S EXPRESS is very good as the oneeyed German Captain von Hecht who will stop at nothing to stop Hudson from destroying the dam. Giacomo RossiStuart BATTLE FORCE THE LAST 4 DAYS has a very minor part as Fantoni's aide. Mark Colleano is incredibly good as the selfish leader of the youngster gang. His performance is brilliant and he deserves more credit than he gets. Plenty of familiar German characteractors ... Tom Felleghy THE BATTLE OF EL ALAMEIN appears as a German colonel. Max Tarilli THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE as a German Colonel. Gerard Herter LAST DAY OF THE WAR as the commander of the dam. Watch for Andrea Bosic from DIABOLIK as a German General.The action scenes are sparse and involve few extras. The last big scene on the dam is welldone for the most part but there are still a few corny moments. Several times the camera focuses on a sole machinegunner and you can hear men screaming but you never get to see the victims. The cinematography is marvelous and breathtaking as this was filmed on location in Italy. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is pretty good but surprisingly not anywhere near as good as his Leone scores. The script is intelligent is tells a familiar story from a unique viewpoint showing young preteens battling the Nazis with machine guns and grenades is something that's rarely done. No striking dialog or directorial tricks from Karlson who did the great HELL TO ETERNITY ten years earlier but it's still a good adventure  suspense flick. The only negative thing I can think of is the HORRIBLY OUT OF PLACE antiwar statement near the end. It stresses that people get so caught up in war that they make horrible mistakes and come to mourn over them later on. Come on guys  the first 105 minutes showed war as a big adventure and the last 5 makes it look like a colossal tragedy. Sure I think war IS bad and should be avoided if possible but if you're gonna make an action movie don't try to make a big statement at the end. It ruins what's been accomplished during the rest of the movie.I saw this on video from MGM. It's an incredibly rare VHS tape released for a short time in 1993. I found a brand new one on half.com for a great price and snatched it immediately. The print is pan  scan except for the credits which are widescreen I'd say about 1.781. The colors are accurate and striking. There are hardly an flaws like scratches etc. This is worth seeking out and buying for a decent price.Overall for the cast Morricone music and unique approach to the subject matter I'll give it a 610. With a better ending it could have been a 710.".

Their families where slaughtered by the Germans and they want to use the soldier to help them get revenge whereas he wants to train the kids so they can help him blow the dam.This is more of an Italian film than an American one and it shows in the Italian style of direction  editing which sometimes comes off awkward.Everyone speaks English but the Germans and Italians are heavily accented so I suggest using the subtitles.The biggest highlight is the moving score by Ennio Morricone. The second is the beautiful Sylva Koscina who plays the doctor that nurses the soldier Rock Hudson to health and hangs around the outcasts the entire film. Sylva is just breathtaking throughout and fullyclothed the entire time I might add.Hudson is rocksolid as the taciturn soldier sorry and Mark Colleano is excellent as Aldo the fanatical leader of the ragtag group of kids. He wants revenge at all costs and the young actor gets this across with passion. Sergio Fantoni is also notable as Captain Von Hecht he's not a onedimensional German officer and is actually a solid man who just got trapped on the wrong side of the war.There are a couple of action sequences one being pretty farfetched when the soldier  the kids mowdown an entire village of Germans while riding in an Army truck but the action is usually swift and quiet in the order of guerilla tactics.I like how the members of the outcast group including the soldier and nurse are always sweaty and dirty with messy hair and crumpled clothing. It smacks of how war really is  dirty sweaty and messy.The presence of the stunning Sylva Koscina blows any theory of gay or pedophile subtext. If any other actor than Hudson played the role of the soldier like Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson there would be no such inane theory. It doesn't exist.In any event Hornets' Nest was likely the blueprint for John Milius' Red Dawn 1984. The difference being that Hornets' Nest takes place in Italy during WWII and involves a younger group of kids. The Italian locations are a huge plus the film runs 110 minutes.GRADE B".

	schema:headline " Much more than your typical war movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Hornets' Nest has been one of my favorite films ever since its release. A few years ago I tracked it down on VHS and I'm very glad I did because the versions I'd caught on television had all been edited.Rock Hudson is definitely the star convincingly cast as an American army captain who finds himself expected to singlehandedly destroy a strategic dam in occupied Italy. Yet the story focuses just as much on Aldo the teenaged leader of the gang of boys who help him. Acted with remarkable intensity by Mark Colleano Aldo drives the action from beginning to end and in fact dominates the final scene. Without Colleano's passion and energy to offset Hudson's more subdued performance the movie would have been a forgettable war story. Because of it Hornets' Nest becomes an unusual antiwar tale of loyalty and jealousy desperation and guilt. Of course the film does have its flaws. Silva Koscino plays a German doctor who accompanies the group against her will. Her character is out of place frequently annoying and seems to bring out the worst in those around her a brief nonexplicit rape scene is the only reason I cannot unreservedly recommend this movie. The story honestly would have been better without any female presence at all. Sergio Fantoni on the other hand is quite strong as a German captain who attempts to foil Hudson's mission. Despite being a Nazi he is depicted as a gentleman as well as a military man and his contribution adds another layer to the complex relationships being played out on screen. The scenery is beautiful evoking the warm sunny lazy Italian countryside during a period when it was anything but and is brilliantly complemented by Ennio Morricone's score. All in all this is a movie I love to share with my friends.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hornets' Nest has been one of my favorite films ever since its release. A few years ago I tracked it down on VHS and I'm very glad I did because the versions I'd caught on television had all been edited.Rock Hudson is definitely the star convincingly cast as an American army captain who finds himself expected to singlehandedly destroy a strategic dam in occupied Italy. Yet the story focuses just as much on Aldo the teenaged leader of the gang of boys who help him.

	schema:headline " This film deserved more respect than it got.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film many years ago when it was panned because children were being used in a war movie. That attitude reflected the times in which it was produced.  People wanted Anti War movies like The Deer Hunter or heroic battle epics like Tora Tora Tora.  Movies that brought the stark reality of war too near were not well received.  Hornet's Nest was made in Italy and like the movie Two Women made ten years before it was not widely popular in the United States. Although Two Women gave Sophia Loren new respect as an actress and received an Oscar for Best Foreign Film it did not receive favor from the public. The patriotism of World War II had faded by the 1970's and the public demonstrations against Viet Nam were gaining force when Hornets Nest was released. It was seen as a glorification of war and a fading star like Rock Hudson could not save it. Ironically one of the actors playing an SS officer in the movie was a French Partisan who spent a year in Buchenwald after the Nazi's captured him. The one female star Sylvia Koscina was a child in Yugoslavia during the war and had memories of the Nazi occupation.  Sophia Loren began filming this movie and withdrew because it recalled too much of the trauma of her childhood in war time Italy. The children who made this movie did a good job of showing the effect of war on young minds. In spite of being little more than amateurs the acting was capable. The one young actor who was professional Mark Colleano was particularly talented. He played Aldo  the leader of the partisan children. His last scene brought tears to my eyes.  It was not intended to be an easy picture to watch. Those reviewers who made snide remarks about Rock Hudson's sexual preferences and the nudity of the teen and child actors in the movie were simply revealing their own salacious nature. They deliberately missed the point. In retrospect this film was made before it's time. Based on actual events where Nazi troops committed atrocities against entire villages it was meant to remind the world of the savagery of a totalitarian military that had absolute control over the lives of helpless populations. It foreshadowed the massacres committed by the Soviet troops who took over Eastern Europe and much of the territory bordering the USSR. Massacres in Hungary and in Poland and the building of the Berlin Wall Since then we have seen movies like Schindler's List Hotel Rwanda The Killing Fields and Empire of the Sun win awards. They all show the atrocity and dehumanizing effects of war in a much more graphic manner than does Hornets Nest as do many many other well respected films. Though Hornet's Nest can't compare in quality to them it did not have the budget nor the huge cast they had either. In the years since  Hornets Nest the world has been treated to Bosnia Rwanda Somalia and Serbia where women and children are victims and participants in total warfare. It prefaced the time of child soldiers who watch their families slaughtered and go on to commit unspeakable acts themselves. All of these years later this picture is still relevant. Children become partisan fighters much like the boys in this film. Children turn themselves into human bombs or carry guns for ISIS. Boy soldiers live and die in the jungles of the Philippines or as pirates off the coast of Somalia.  Savage child soldiers in Africa showed the whole world how easy it is to create babykillers and how hard it is to return them to what they once were Children.  In Afghanistan Syria Yemen Libya children are carrying weapons and fighting as adults. Boys and girls are being robbed of both their childhood and their future.  I watched Hornets Nest again tonight and it brought tears to my eyes. These children dirty ragged hungry orphans had managed to survive and had taken vengeance on their tormentors but in doing so they had lost something irreplaceable. They had lost their innocence and a part of their humanity. Although they survived they were truly victims of a terrible war. Maybe watching this movie in todays context makes the point it did not when it was first released. War is bad for children and other living things.  Being safe and smug in a country free from these things we can put our children to bed with out fear of bombs or machine guns waking them. But in many parts of the world that is not the case. So is this movie so ridiculous? Is it so unrealistic? Is it a joke because Rock Hudson turned out to be a Gay man?  I don't think so. I think the movie deserves a respectful viewing and some recognition at long last.".

	schema:headline " Terrific World War II Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Big Hollywood studio movies about World War II grew increasingly cynical during the 197os. Walking Tall director Phil Karlson made Hornet's Nest in Italy with Rock Hudson Sylva Koscina and Sergio Fantoni showed what could happen when orphaned juvenile delinquents entered the fray with machine guns and an attitude. Hudson starred as an Army Captain sent to destroy a dam but the Germans ambush his men after they parachute into enemy territory and wipe them out so only the Hudson character survives. Meanwhile the Germans wipe out an entire village of men and women more specifically fathers and mothers as the partisans and the sons and daughters watch the massacre from afar. The children swear vengeance and rescue an unconscious Army officer before the Germans can take him prisoner. They abducted a female German surgeon to supervise his recovery because they want him to teach them how to use a cache of weapons and pay the Germans back with interest for slaughtering their sires. Initially reluctant the Army officer realizes that he must accommodate these revengebent juveniles if he is going to use them to complete his mission. Hornet's Nest beat the John Wayne western The Cowboys to the punch. Since Wayne cannot find any adult cowpunchers to herd his cattle to market he has to settle for schoolage youngsters literally cowboys to drive his steers to market. Along the trail these youngsters grow up and get handy with sixguns eventually tangling with a gang of rustlers that kill Wayne. Clearly cynicism is at work in both films as children are indoctrinated into a culture of violence and bloodshed. The amoral quality of the storyline can be measured in the reluctance of the protagonist to train children in the ways of violence so much so that by the end he smashes all the weapons that they used against the enemy. The Ennio Morricone theme music with its whistling motif is brilliant. Fantoni is the German officer who knows what the kids are going to destroy and he has to shoot one of his own officers to try to stop the pintsized raiders.".

These guerrilla groups have become so annoying to the Germans the local military Italian governor is replaced by a brutal SS Officer. Upon reaching the town he rounds up the villagers and order them to reveal the Partisans upon pain of death. Bad mistake but one which the Germans inflict with Nazi efficiency. Their children learn the US military is sending a team of Commandos to destroy the dam near the town. The SS discover the drop zone and massacre all the airborne troops except one. The single survivor called Turner Rock Hudson awakens from his wounds and discovers he owes his life to a group of Teenage boys. Informed the SS is searching for him Turner also learns an experience German Officer name Von Hecht Sergio Fantoni is also closing in on his whereabouts. Realizing he has little choice Turner decides to use his hatefilled and revenge seeking youths to continue his mission to destroy the dam. Accompanying him is a kidnapped female doctor Sylva Koscina who reluctantly joins the group. The movie itself is interesting in that instead of battle hard soldiers Hudson has to first teach the kids to kill and then later must reverse his lessons. To the credit of the young cast the teens lead by vengeance seeking Aldo Mark Colleano do a remarkable job of acting. From deep sorrow to hate spewing machinegun scenes they add to the over the top drama. In all this action film does an honest job of creating a military Classic. However much as I enjoy Hudson the actor I can't help feel Charles Bronson or Burt Lancaster would have been a better choice as Husdon is not convincing as a rapist of women or abuser of children.

	schema:reviewBody "This highly unusual war drama stars Hudson as a U.S. Commando dropped behind enemy lines in Italy. When every other member of his team is killed he must rely on the aid of a ragtag bunch of orphan boys to complete his mission. Hudson in an anachronistic moustache and making a rather unlikely skydiving commandoat least in this stage of his career does an okay job. He looks a bit tired but his character is supposed to be wounded and a bit overwhelmed. Colleano gives a very overheated and loud portrayal as the ringleader of the orphan brigade. He has a few quiet moments but mostly comes off like a deranged Italian Davy Jones. A little subtlety would have gone a long way. Koscina plays a surgeon with the least WWIIlike and least doctorlike hair in film history! who gets coerced into trying to save Hudson from his initial injuries during the drop. She does an adequate job but is hardly compensation for the film's original intended star Sophia Loren. The role is unnecessary except to add female interest and visual and the story would have been stronger with just Rock and his boys doing their thing. Who knows if producers were wary of a film like this with Hudson lacking a love interest and surrounded by scantily clad boys!....... The plan involves carrying out the demolition of a massive dam and doing away with as many Nazis as they can in the process. The reality of the film is hampered somewhat by having a Nazi general played by an obviously Italian actor Fantoni whose hair has been bleached and fried to a white crisp and by it's odd changes in tone. An unbelievable amount of people are killed within the first opening moments of the film including women in the process of nursing their babies! In fact virtually every character besides Hudson and the boys is offed by the ten minute mark and this is not the end of the killing. This much carnage doesn't leave any room for shock if a more prominent character dies...it's just part of the action. Still the film does leave an impression. It overstates some of it's points through bombast and overemphatic acting but also has some gentle thoughtful moments which salvage it. The actions scenes are pretty capable even somewhat memorable and location filing helps a lot. In the end it's kind of a Lord of the Flies meets The Dirty Dozen filmed by an Italian crew.".

This much carnage doesn't leave any room for shock if a more prominent character dies...it's just part of the action. Still the film does leave an impression. It overstates some of it's points through bombast and overemphatic acting but also has some gentle thoughtful moments which salvage it. The actions scenes are pretty capable even somewhat memorable and location filing helps a lot. In the end it's kind of a Lord of the Flies meets The Dirty Dozen filmed by an Italian crew.";

Prior to seeing Hornet's Nest I had believed that Rock Hudson's career bottomed out in 1971 with Pretty Maids in a Row and then was somewhat revived when he switched to television acting the next year. But now I can see that Pretty Maids was actually the beginning of a climb up from an even lower point represented by Hornet's Nest.As someone has already mentioned Hornet's Nest has become a gay cult classic. Presumably this was unintentional in 1970 but you really have to wonder. Here is WWII army paratrooper Rock dressed in a uniform more cigar republic than U.S. Army see Seinfeld's Cuban cigar makers episode a bandito mustache and hair over his ears 1970's style. He hangs out with and disciplines a bunch of Italian boys in various states of undress. There are lingering and unnecessarily extreme closeups of a German officer's boots being shined by one of the Italian boys. And the German soldiers show an extraordinary amount of interest in the other Italian boys especially when the boys take off their clothes. If not the worst WWII movie it certainly is in the running for that designation. Some war movies tease you at the beginning into believing they might be decent but Hornet crashes and burns with its very first scene as the evil Germans are shown massacring an entire Italian village with special emphasis on the Priest. Things don't go downhill but stay pretty much at that propaganda film level it is no surprise that the writer was later responsible for the lame WWII episodes of the Wonder Woman TV show. The premise of the film which seems to be more afterthought than character motivation is blowing up an Italian dam. Since the Germans are withdrawing from Italy it would seem more logical for the Allies to want to protect the dam from German demolition but logic is in very short supply in this story. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Both boys' lives are already ruined by the time the Hudson character appears on the screen. Aldo is all for unquestioning action and immediate revenge against the perpetrators at any cost a very human reaction. His power to reason has completely disappeared. Dino is more sanguine protective of the other boys and willing to accept Hudson as the natural leader. According to modern Italian writers every time the Italians decide to adopt the sensible Dino approach they fall foul of the Aldos agitating to rectify their ills by short term methods. The contrast between the two characters may not have been intentional but it adds flavour and a realistic ending to an otherwise routine film. Coleano son of a famous actor and Forsythe's physical difference also adds emphasis to their different approaches.".

	schema:reviewBody "A dark and gritty World War II adventure movie filmed on location in Italy and coproduced by the Italians this film is quite grimdark and violent and also possibly one of the filthiest movies I've ever seen. Everyone is always sweating and in bad need of a good bath with messy hair that needs combing and clothes that need a trip through the washing machine. It all adds to the realism of course war is dirty and messy.Hornets' Nest stars macho man Rock Hudson fresh off his successful starring role in the big screen adaptation of Alistair MacLean's novel Ice Station Zebra as the determined Captain Turner. He does a pretty good job in what is essentially a onenote tough guy role although he does later one get to emote a bit during scenes where Turner wonders he's doing the right thing by arming a bunch of preteen and younger kids.Other standout performances include the achingly beautiful Sylva Koscina as Bianca whose compassionate kindhearted nature make it truly saddening all that she endures throughout the film. She begins by denying the crimes of the Nazis but eventually takes up arms against them herself. Still there is the uncomfortable scene where she's almost raped by the kids and roughed up by Turner later and I really have to wonder what in the world directors Phil Karlson and Franco Cirino were thinking.There's also Mark Colleano as Aldo and wow can that kid act! Colleano really plays the whole psycho teen angle to the hilt and makes Aldo a believably dangerous and reprehensible but still somehow pitiable character. Indeed almost all the actors playing the boys do a good job particularly Mauro Gravina as the adorable illfated Carlo and John Fordyce as Dino. These two are really the human face of the group of children nevermind Dino is probably close to eighteen. If Aldo represents all that is wrong with youth then the warm and compassionate Dino and the eager curious and hopeful despite the tragedy that has befallen them Carlo represent all that is good and pure in it.This finally brings us to the German characters who save for Lithuanian actor Jacques Sernas as Taussig are played almost entirely by Italians doing bad Teutonic accents. The highranking colonels and generals are stilted and laughable but Sernas is pretty good. His Taussig oozes despicable arrogance and casual cruelty.The best German character though and indeed probably the best character in the movie is the very very blonde Sergio Fantoni as Captain Friedrich von Hecht. He's a perfect example of an antagonist who isn't a villain. He's a decent enough guy who's just on the wrong side of an unjust war and knowingly serving an evil regime acidly making his distaste for you SS people known at every turn even at the risk of his own career and maybe even his life. Most interestingly of all is how he treats his mission to find and eliminate or capture Turner. Von Hecht is a hunter you see and he sees the American officer on the loose as a challenge that he must accept and try to overcome. For him it's less about advancing the Nazi cause he could care less about that and more about the thrill of the hunt. And mild spoiler here he isn't one of this egomaniacal hunters drunk on his own superiority over his enemy when his own prey bests him in the end he accepts his defeat with dignity.If the movie has a fault the rape scenes aside it is that it is a little on the unrealistic side when it comes to the battle scenes and also can't quite seem to settle on a tone or moral. We have essentially untrained kids mowing down countless Nazis left and right and it can't quite seem to decide if it wants to show war as a fun adventure or as a grim reality with tragic psychological tolls that come with children becoming killers and its efforts to have it both ways leave it feeling a bit disjointed.".

I don't care whether its John Carradine being assassinated in Hitler's Madman or Ralph Fiennes being hung in Schindler's List I just can't help screaming Die Nazi die! every time I see blood trickling out of their mouth or that last moment before their execution as their soul prepares to catch the elevator down to hell. Hornet's Nest starts me off with absolute hatred towards the most evil political party in European history tied with the vicious thugs who terrorize world peace today.An entire village of aging townspeople and young mothers are viciously wiped out in the opening scene by the Nazi's. Watching from afar atop a huge hill are the teenaged sons who are wanted by the Nazi's for being rebels against their regime. The arrival of American parachuters leaves only Rock Hudson alive brought into their cave. They deceive Nazi doctor Sylvia Koscina into coming back to treat him and making her their prisoner begin to turn her political beliefs around.A touching reminder how war touches so many lives and turns young boys into men over night this isn't flawless by any means. Like the kids of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang these kids seem to ho everywhere without being caught even stealing a full arsenal of weapons. All it seems to change Koscina is seeing the children in danger but fortunately the beautiful blonde doesn't break into song. The actors playing the Italian teenagers do a perfect job for amateurs with Mark Colleano passionate as the very determined leader.One scene that is very disturbing has Colleano preparing to rape Koscina simply out of revenge for what the Nazi's did to the women in his village. He's the only professional actor among them and at times seems to be over emoting but somehow it comes off as believable. Sergio Fantoni as the Nazi leader gives a very subtle performance reminding us that real villains could be cultured and wellmannered in the pursuit of their goals but sometimes evil is brought on in a calm convincing voice. Great photography is a plus and the tension never lapses as Hudson and the boys with fights from Koscina build up to the plans to blow up the local dam.For me the whole point of this movie putting guns and explosives into the hands of children is to show how that in times of war when survival of decent communities is key all must fight in one way or another. Sure killing the Germans won't bring the dead back but it will prevent other innocent people from being slaughtered at the hands of terrorists. The fact that this flopped because of youngsters being given weapons is nullified by the need to neutralize evil under any circumstance.".

However it feels so heavy you'd think you're watching War  Peace.  This effect isn't helped by the total lack of laughs in this comedy'.  Few if any of the lines are funny mainly because they totally lack any sort of charm or wit but what makes it worse is that the actors are playing to the laughs!  There are plenty of scenes where gaps seem to have been left in dialogue or in routines to allow the audience to finish rolling in the aisles.  These may only be a split second long but in the absence of laughter they feel longer.I watched this with another Caine comedy  Without a Clue'.  That was average as well but his performance really lifted it.  Here he can't do the same  his character is charmless and occasionally resorts to mugging to get by witness his dancing after returning from Rio.  Similarly Maggie Smith has nothing to do and feels too snobbish to be likeable.  The relationship between the two is also dry and it's unfortunate that their eternal' relationship is supposed to be the model for true love.  Spader who can do good given the chance seems totally out of his depth with his two classy costars.  He resorts to doing some sort of subpar Hugh Grant impersonation  full of stuttering and blinking when under pressure except he can't make it seem charming in the same way that Grant can when he's on form and his character quickly becomes shallow and uninteresting.The film collapses to a happy ending at a new years party  but by then any interest I had in the characters had evaporated.  The film is only about 90 minutes long  but it felt like 3 hours every scene felt dull and dragged out.Overall even with Caine Smith and Sam Shepherd filling out an impressive cast list  this totally fails to impress.  It's not that it's the worst film ever made  but it's an average story with average characters average performances and comedy that totally misses the mark.  The end result? A dull unfunny film that is impossible to care about or enjoy.".

Your family can watch and enjoy this movie with few regrets and have a good time. There is no nudity and my only caution with be some cursing in one scene.

While it is a feel good movie it is an intelligent reflective one.  Neither of the parallel lives led by the main character is shown to be flawless.  Both have their attractions.  Jack the lead character is forced from his comfort zone by a glimpse of a life connected by commitment and love to friends and family.  This movie does something for me few feel good movies ever come close to causing.  This movie makes me think about what I really value in life.  Both procapitalist and profamily The Family Man either leaves you pondering whether your life is consistent with your values or goes over your head and leaves you with the impression that your emotions have been manipulated by another crass commercial Christmas movie.  It depends on what the viewer brings to the table.P.S.  Tea Leoni's shower scene has got to be the sexiest portrayal of a movie mom I ever saw.".

Whatever limitations the film's storyline or premise has the individual performances rise above it.In the DVD extras there is an interesting comment by the producer where he says he challenges any man to watch the film and not want to live with Tea Leoni and I must say I wholeheartedly agree with him. To be fair her character is completely idealised naturally beautiful but unaffected by it intelligent insightful sexy gracious humble caring unstoppably positive and nondemanding. Have you ever met anyone like this in real life?I enjoyed this film so much that it just about creeps into my all time top ten.

Young dreamers in love with their successful careers instead of each other find out that maybe their love really was meant to be. This is what Nicholas Cage finds out and when he wakes up from the dream of what 'could have been' he rushes to stop 'loosing her' again and hopefully still live the happily ever after dream.

But he also did a wonderful job of transitioning from resentful to begrudgingly intrigued to acceptance. I think Tea Leoni and Jeremy Piven were superb in this as well. It was sweet romantic and funny. All very important in a romantic comedy. Setting it at Christmas time added to the feel. Anyone who has kids can identify with the moral of the story.".

As Campbell and his college girlfriend Kate Tea Leoni say farewell Kate begs him to stay but Jack gets on his plane anyway. Their relationship ends while he is in London and Jack goes on to become the President of a large Wall Street company. While walking home from work on Christmas Eve thirteen years later Campbell has an encounter with an angel who gives him a glimpse. This glimpse shows Jack what his life would be like if he and Kate were still together and in the end Jack must choose between his life of riches and loneliness or a life filled with family and love.The central idea of the film is to show that a person who is rich in material objects often lacks more important things. It says that these things include being surrounded by people who care about you and having someone to love. Before Campbell's glimpse his only motivation is money and most of the movie is filmed at his office showing he does not have much of a life outside of it. Without a second thought he calls an emergency meeting with his staff at noon on Christmas causing them to leave their families and come in to the office. The movie successfully shows the struggle between money and family because this is a theme to which the audience can relate.The director is able to keep the audience's attention throughout the movie through the use of humor. Lassiter Josef Sommer the owner of the company when asked why he is still at the office on Christmas Eve replies because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money. In doing this the director while still concentrating on the theme of the movie keeps the viewer watching. In doing these things and more the director creates a film that is not only entertaining to watch but also one that carries a message about life and happiness.".

In this movie Nicholas Cage says goodbye to his girlfriend Kate at the airport. He is going to London for a job. We next see him years later as a successful head of a large corporation unmarried and basically involved in onenight stands. We are later to find out that when Cage went to London he forgot about Kate and she went her own way never to be heard from again.Cage is on the way home from the office during a snowstorm and thwarts a robbery. The audience expects the robber to shoot cage but instead Cage seems to convince the robber that he would be a better man if he didn't shoot Cage. It turns out that the robber is not really a robber but a type of Angel similar to Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life who will give Cage a glimpse of what life would be like if he hadn't stayed in London but instead came back and married Kate.Cage goes to sleep in his luxury apartment and wakes up the next morning in a bed with an older Kate. Cage slowly learns that he is really a married man with a family and instead of a big time corporate president he is a tire salesman in his fatherinlaw's store. There are several hilarious scenes and some very touching ones. His new life looks like a nightmare at first turns out to be the life he will eventually prefer Some of this is reminiscent of Goldie Hawn in Overboard. Only until he realizes this he will not be returned to his prior life by the Angel.The director does a great job in giving us an ending that is different than what you seem to expect. I won't say what but I think it was well done.One thing that is not explored is that when Cage's glimpsed life finishes he will lose his two children from that glimpsed life. The director never touches on Cage's feelings about that unlike the novel Replay where the main character is torn apart because a child he had in an alternate life no longer exists when he is in a different reality.The movie is well cast and Don Cheadle is excellent as the angel.".

Nicholas Cage stars as a rich business exec and womanizing bachelor who is forced to relive a decision he made to leave his college girlfriend Tea Leoni for a banking internship in London. In the alternate reality Cage is transported to he finds himself significantly less wealthy in terms of money but the upside he discovers over time is a loving family to come home too. Watching Cage's character evolve into the role is one of the most heartfelt parts of the movie. Tea Leoni underrated and underused is always a pleasure to watch as well. The movie overall is pretty familiar but will still make you laugh and smile.".

I really believe this movie can improve your relationship with a romantic partner.I don't think anyone could've played Jack Campbell better than Nicolas Cage.

Jeremy Piven has done a great job playing Arnie  the buddy guy! The Family man is one of the rare movies which highlight the notsonice side of success and being on top in contrast to happiness and fulfillment family brings.Writers David Weissman and David Diamond didn't leave anything out when it comes to portraying the world in which parents live. How do you raise your kids do a full time job maintain relationship with friends do household business every night take your dog for walk and most importantly build a great relationship with your spouse? Wouldn't all that business take away the time necessary to build THE career and life's comfort? We might think we don't need all of the above.And that's exactly what Jack Campbell had thought as well.".

When one wants a powerful and true performance of a character who can do better than Morgan Freeman Don Cheadle and Denzil Washington. I guess we live in a time when such a statement is thought to come from some personal agenda. It doesn't this just seemed like a obvious thought last night as I watched Don Cheadle. Anyway...Annie the daughter is crucial to the accepting of the basic replacement daddy plot.

So you think it is cruel to be sent to the suburbs after ruling Wall Street but try to imagine what it is to be sent back to an empty apartment with a view after sharing one last night with the woman you love in the quiet peace of your home with two kids and a dog.

Getting straight to the point he time travels back to a what if scenario where he is married to Kate and they have kids. We see that his life in New York is completely different he has a posh penthouse apartment a flashy car and enjoys his life of flings with women and having lots of money when he's sucked into the other life of being a husband and father living in a boring house driving a minivan and being a car tire salesman we see that he tries to go back to his real life as a Wall Street guy but no one recognises him  forcing him to go back to the alternate universe of being a family man he tries to play the role of a husband but is finding it difficult.The performances are wellacted Director Brett Ratner did a good job however the film is slowpaced at times.As the motion picture goes on you can't help but want Jack to go back to his real life in NYC.This cine is clearly trying to shove down our throats the depiction that Jack is better off being married with kids and having a dead end job. The end of the movie is the most interesting as we see that Jack eventually gets to go back to his real life as a wall street executive but he has a change of heart and wants that what if life as a family man he tracks down Kate and we find out that she also doesn't have kids and is basically the female version of him she lives in a nice apartment has a slick job as a wealthy corporate lawyer and has no interest in having a family we see that she has an assistant who is helping her move to Paris Jack and Kate have a conversation while she her assistant and the removal men are literally packing up her possessions she says they should keep in touch but it's obvious that she couldn't care less if she ever sees him again he ends up following her to the airport and tells her about the alternate universe life that they would have had she has coffee with him and that's the end of the film implying that they will have that alternate universe life.The majority of the film is fine but the ending is a cop out it would have been better if Kate just went on the plane to Paris and Jack accept that their alternate life was only a what if.There are many unrealistic things about this plot it is highly unlikely that they would still end up having that alternate life implied at the end of the film at the beginning if he'd have not gone to NYC then it's possible that they would have had that life with the kids but people change and as we see he originally is a successful nonmarried person and so is she Jack changes his outlook and entire mindset by the end of the film but Kate does not have that mindset so realistically them living that alternate universe life would not work it doesn't seem that Kate had the same experience so how on earth can she relate to him and his brand new mindset? he just looks like a crazy person shouting that they have a family and live in New Jersey best thing she could do is run onto that plane ASAP!When you see the real Kate the wealthy corporate lawyer you can't help but be glad that this is who she really is the movie tries to go back to a childish dream of the alternate universe as though being single wealthy and careerminded is a wrong thing the message that this movie is sending is that one can only be happy being married with kids and that is just wrong because there are many happy single people who don't want kids if this movie was unbiased then they would just let Jack and Kate go their own separate ways the what if scenario is fine but that's all it should be but it's more of a what could have been and what could have been is not always a good thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hunker down kiddies it's time for a twohour schmaltzathon. This movie not only tugs at your heartstrings it rips the strings out and whips you with them. Subtlety ain't this film's strong suit.Nicolas Cage plays a slick Wall Street powerbroker the only kind in Hollywood and probably real life as well who has it all money money money and power. Jack Campbell's lacking a family but he doesn't see that as a bad thing. He's also driven obsessed with improving the company he works for  he even schedules a crisis meeting on Christmas Day. This guy's got balls all right. He's making loot hand over fist and he's probably on his way to an ulcer or a heart attack before he hits fifty.On Christmas Eve he gets a phone message from an exgirlfriend Tea Leoni. Years earlier the two of them had made a decision crucial to their lives  he went to England to intern with a prestigious bank and she went to one of the finest law schools in the country. This facilitated their breakup but since Jack's made out rather well in the interim he pays the call little mind. Then that night he stops by a convenience store to pick up some egg nog. An irate lottery player the always reliable and watchable Don Cheadle pulls a gun on the clerk behind the counter. Jack offers to buy the man's lottery ticket in an effort to calm the situation and even attempts to rehabilitate the hoodlum. Cmon Jack tells him everyone needs something. What do you need? Cash asks him. Jack considers the point then replies there's nothing he needs. Ok says Cash but just remember you got yourself into this. Hmm.The next morning Jack wakes up in bed with the lovely the delicious the marriedinreallifetoDavid Duchovny Tea Leoni. And he has two kids. And a dog. And whoa! This isn't Jack's life is it? He doesn't like kids! And here they come bouncing on the bed he shares with Kate. It's Christmas Day after all. But Jack's in shock. He panics grabs the keys to their minivan Hey! Where's his Porsche? and dashes off to the city. What's going on?Seems Cash is some kinda sorta angel or something it's never really explained and he's offering Jack a glimpse of what his life would havebeen like if he had stuck with Kate back in the day. Now those of us who are of a certain age do wonder from time to time what life would have been like if different decisions had been made. Jack's problem is that his wonderment is now his reality. And it's most certainly not the reality he's looking for! The Single Jack is a hedonist who recognizes only responsibilities to his job. The Married Jack pays more attention to his familial responsibilities.So we have a general fishoutofwater scenario. Jack knows he's Single Jack and naturally he has neither knowledge nor memory of life as Married Jack. He doesn't know his friends his inlaws his coworkers he works as a tire salesman! nothing. He doesn't even know where he lives! Ah yes mad hijinks ensue. It's like in that Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show  the audience is in on the joke but the lead character has no idea. See Jack stumble over gettin' jiggy with his wife! See him mumble greetings to friends he doesn't know! See him stand with his mouth agape most of the time trying in vain to absorb everything.And of course see Jack wrap things up neatly. Too bad it's a twohour sojourn into schmaltz though. The problem with the movie isn't that it's sentimental it's that it's a preachy film desperate to teach us that Marriage Is Good. And think about it  how many guys do you know are married to someone who looks like Tea Leoni and is a nice person too who goes to work at a tire place with a song in their hearts who has a loving family with two perfect kids? This life doesn't exist and damn this movie for making the married versus single issue seem so black and white. Single bad marriage  good.The best sentimental films teach lessons with such subtlety that you don't realize you've learned anything until well after the closing credits have rolled. The worst of these films takes a lesson that most people know anyway and proceeds to whack the living crap out of you with it. Ok ok! I get it! Married life  good things. Got it ok. And thankfully Jack got it too or we'd still be watching this drivel.".

Nils Poppe known best as Jof from The Seventh Seal and Bibi Andersson also contribute with an additional display of their usually skillful performances. The plot is light but brilliant and will probably shock regular Bergman fans. For some reason Smiles of a Summer Night is talked about as Bergman's best or even only comedy but although I really like that film too and have watched over forty of his movies and must say that this is the funniest by a long shot. A highly enjoyable but sadly underrated possibly misunderstood movie. At the time of my writing this Djvulens ga is not yet a DVD item in the US or the UK.".

	schema:headline " The mirrors which reflect God";
	schema:reviewBody "Full disclosure  I tend to like movies with the devil in them. I also love brooding characters and weighty questions about life and love and this film has all of the above.The premise is that in keeping with an Irish proverb the Devil has a stye on his eye because a woman is about to be married but is still a virgin. In this case she's the daughter of a vicar. He sends Don Juan and his sidekick back to earth along with a demon to oversee them with the mission of deflowering her before the wedding. Things get complicated when Don Juan quickly develops real feelings for her and his sidekick falls for and begins seducing her mother.Don Juan is brooding hating both God and the Devil equally for the morality game they play. On the one hand he boldly says the lack of principles is my principle vice my virtue debauchery my asceticism godlessness my religion. On the other hand he betrays real sadness when he says Those capable of love are very few. Their suffering has no limit. I am told they are mirrors which reflect God and make life easier for us wretches in the dark. Such brilliant dialog is Bergman at his best.The vicar's wife is a complicated character as well  wondering about her husband's love whether he would be sorry if she died and telling him that life is like a comedy  you see me in one part others see me in another. No one sees my real self as she seriously ponders whether to sleep with the sidekick. Such a poignant scene especially as the vicar is a paragon of virtue desperately wanting to understand her saying he'll still love her if she sleeps with another and later overcoming the demon's temptation to try to catch her in the act.So both women mother and daughter are faced with the temptation of adultery  one just before her marriage and the other in middleage. Both are swayed by pentup passion sweet words and pity  but their feelings and actions are far from simple. Will love be enough to shield them from temptation even when it truly touches their hearts? I won't spoil it.In addition to all of that I loved the little touches in the movie including the ministers in hell advising Don Juan on the art of seduction the demon morphing into a black cat and the punishment of Don Juan in hell which consisted of nightly dreams of rendezvous with sensuous women only to be woken up before he could get his satisfaction the performance is over Don Juan. One of his later punishments is somewhat shocking given the movie was made in 1960  he's forced to listen to a demon gives a play by play description of the sounds the one woman he cares about is making while having sex starting with her panting and ending in an orgasm so violent she's weeping tears of joy. My goodness.Playful weighty sacrilegious creative well cast and well filmed  'The Devil's Eye' may not be Bergman's best movie but it's quite good. I think it's unfair to knock it down based on his other classics  imagine if it was made by someone else! But no with all of the elements we see here this is distinctive Bergman.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's funny so to speak that Bergman's most touted dark drama has its wealth of light and even comedic moments and viceversa in the case of Devil's Eye. For the muchtouted movie I mean The Seventh Seal where we get much ado about the existence of God or lack thereof and Death looming large but it's also got its share of laughs and unintentional witty dialog. It's a major work and without much argument the quintessential work of the filmmaker.On the other hand we get The Devil's Eye which is more of a minor work done by Bergman admittedly as a workforhire project in order to direct the Virgin Spring that same year. It's a comedy as we're told right from the getgo by the 'narrator' of the story Gunnar Bjornstrand about the old 'sty in the eye' proverb where Satan will deflower a virgin to get rid of it in this case he sends Don Juan whose been spending 300 years in a loop of the same failed courtship in hell with his compadre Pablo to do it for him on a Nordic girl about to get married. And yet this comedy of sorts which is filled with sly moments and turns of performances that are uncharacteristically campy for a Bergman film also has some dark connotations about infidelity and desire and love in the face of evil. It might be a minor work but it's probably one of the director's strongest and most underrated.In fact I'd wager that Bergman put more work into this than he'd even care to cop to the design of hell itself is ingenious akin to the No Exit set with Satan in a suit and cool but firm demeanor played by Stig Jarrel and a constant flame burning behind his quaint bookroom setting and his servants being prissylooking chaps out of some French royal palace. Bergman also casts this really wonderfully with Don Juan played by Daniel Craiglookalike Jarl Kulle with his suave demeanor but sad interior coming out some of the time and Nils Poppe who also played the cheery VirginMary hallucinator Jof in Seventh Seal as the aloof Parson whose daughter is to marrypossibly be seduced.Bergman also gets some laughs and some surprisingly tender scenes between the Parson's wife Renata and Pablo and the Demon put on assignment by Satan to keep watch on Pablo only to end up in 'Satan's Closet' that the Parson has set up for just such an occasion. It's clever on top of this that the intended goals are reversed in the scope of BrittMarie Bibi Andersson and his mother Renata in terms of their seductions and falling from graces. There's a lot of devilish some pun intended fun to be had I wouldn't want to reveal but suffice to say that Bergman has his cake and eats it too he crafts a pleasurably stylish picture loaded with his intriguing and occasionally deep conversations about love and the nature of Heaven and Hell and Satan and God. It may be 'light' material but in its own limitations it's a more satisfying effort than the good but overrated Wild Strawberries.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a long time unavailable on DVD this 2007 Tartan release finally addresses that but is it worth it?Like most I love classic Bergman and find anything else by him interesting at the very least. Coming just after the heavy and emotionally draining making of his The Virgin Spring in 1960 the DVD blurb tells us that the director needed to 'tell a joke'  this resulting oddity revealing a waspish comedic streak from someone known as a deep complex and often depressive writer and director.It launched Bibbi Anderson who would become Bergman's famous face in his massive hits Persona and Wild Strawberries. In The Devil's Eye she plays the virgin BrittMarie daughter of a cleric. At age 20 the Devil has decided she's ripe for deflowering but she's promised to a boring but reliable older man. Taking the form of Don Juan the infamous Lothario of legend the devil attempts to seduce her. Who will win? Heaven or Hell or indeed both?From the very outset with its odd introduction and even odder harpsichord note this one is set to be a comedy. It's very theatrical caricatures and grotesques mix with the ordinary mirrors and imaginative sets convey hell. Period detail rubs shoulders with 20th century Scandinavian domesticity. One can see many possible influences all moulded in a vast cooking pot and quite a strange mixture is the result.I'm sure one could look into it all a lot deeper than I did  one of the greatest things about Bergman is that most of his films can be watched at a differing angle and a whole new aspect is highlighted helped enormously by his intelligent and often poetic dialogue. Watching late at night when concentration levels were ebbing I took it as it was presented  amusing satirical with sexual references a wit and with a big sparkle in this Devil's Eye.To answer my question  yes it is good but oddly so unBergman like though some scenes in Fanny  Alexander for example share this mischief I wouldn't say that this film is essential Bergman. For those who want all he did then yes obviously and maybe those who want to know more about his inner psyche. Those expecting a more formal classic might be well putoff it's the sort of 'what the hell is this?' that may well result in the 'stop' button on the remote being pressed.The transfer quality is excellent though the subtitles appear slightly smaller and more 'European' than on other Tartan Bergman's I have.".

It seems that if one were to get a virgin to allow herself to be despoiled before marriage the eye would be cured. So the Devil sends the great lover Don Juan to perform just the task. He has been in Hell for over 300 years and embraces the challenge. He takes with him his Sancho Panza like character and they invite themselves into the home of a vicar who has the lovely daughter and a hypochondriac wife who is hiding from the world. While Don Juan goes after the daughter Pablo the other guy goes after the wife. He has also been getting ready for as long as his master. They are accompanied by a demon who is sort of their chaperon since Pablo has been told not to mess around. What is interesting is that Don Juan is able to start making inroads immediately into the young woman who is ready to marry in a few days. What happens is a kind of commentary on faithfulness adventure religion and any number of subjects. What is also interesting is how this invasion shows the cracks in the foundation and invites the characters to figure out how to deal with them. There are also a few slams made against the idea of heaven and hell and God and Satan. This is a really interesting film and probably good because Bergman can't turn off his talent.".

In a sense some people seem to have grace such that even sin can't touch them even sinning can't touch them because of how they do it somehow skirting the devil while they don't by any means have to become angels themselves. wow!".

	onyx:emotionText "this film gets off to a very slow start and some aspects of the production are pretty cheesy... the period costumes and some of the sets and the manner of conveying that we are in hell when we are there are not exactly stunning.... also Bibi's husband to be is said to be 25 and he looks about 40.but do stick with it because it does become really really funny and there are a lot of great lines I have to have at least 10 lines in my comment so I'll praise Bibi's acting... also the other woman who plays her mother... and Ill say the film is also very sweet.Bergman fans will not be disappointed in the lightness cause there is plenty of heaviness too in the scenes between the maiden and DJAfter thinking about this film awhile it hit me a lot harder what's seems to be being said. In a sense some people seem to have grace such that even sin can't touch them even sinning can't touch them because of how they do it somehow skirting the devil while they don't by any means have to become angels themselves. wow!";

	schema:reviewBody "I admire Ingmar Bergman Sweden's greatest director hugely. His films are incredibly well made and thoughtprovoking as well as on the most part superbly directed and acted complete with memorable images. The Devil's Eye is not one of his best it does get off to a slow start the ending does feel rather weak and there are a few scenes that feel a little too talky. However it is still worth watching even if not up to the standards set by The Seventh Seal Fanny and Alexander Wild Strawberries Cries and Whispers Persona and The Virgin Spring a lesser from one of cinema's most influential directors is still better than some directors when at their best. The Devil's Eye is not the most stunning visually of Bergman's films but it is still skillfully made and has nothing that comes across as cheap. The music is simple but hauntingly beautiful at the same time. The story is atypical Bergman with a structure that is very like it was set out as a play but it is also wonderfully ironic while the script on the most part is funny with a couple of thoughtful moments. Bergman's direction may not show him on his best form but still shows a director who knows what he's doing and what he wants. The performances are fine Bibbi Andersson does give a strong performance Nils Poppe is very funny and Jarl Kulle displays a lot of verve as the playboy released from Hell sort of character. Gunner Bjornstrand is good to see though he has been better. Overall worth watching funny and interesting. Just not one of Bergman's crowning jewels. 710 Bethany Cox".

Do you watch kungfu? after deciding that he could care less about work. Several hours ago I was faced with the same situation Do I study for my exams or do I some watch kungfu movies? Well after some consultation and noticing the unwatched copy of 'Martial Outlaw' sitting on my desk I came to the conclusion that I would be better off watching some kungfu. That would come to be the best decision I've ever made.Jeff Wincott plays Kevin White a DEA agent master of the ways of arse kicking and notquiteyet a master of the snappy comeback. On the trail of a Russian druglord named Niko Vladimir Skomarovsky Kevin ends up back in his hometown of Los Angeles where his brother Jack Gary Hudson is a cop and also master of the ways of arse kicking. Jack is quite jealous of his little brother Kevin went to college Kevin is a better fighter Kevin is a higher paid and higher ranking cop and Kevin has a more impressive physique. OK the last one was a guess Kevin removes his shirt at any opportunity while Jack stays clothed for the whole movie. When Kevin arrives in town Jack sees an opportunity to make a deal with Niko and walk away a millionaire.The box makes a point of stating that 'Martial Outlaw' is from the makers of 'Martial Law' which might explain why the plots for both movies were... almost exactly the same. That's right tweak a few details and 'Martial Law' becomes 'Martial Outlaw'. Awesome. Naturally both the plot and acting in this are as weak as Jeff Wincott is ripped but that is to be expected when watching a directtovideo martial arts film. In fact Gary Hudson sounds suspiciously like Bruce Campbell the king of bmovies through most of the film...The action scenes are somewhat impressive given the nature of the film. Small action movies are generally entertaining but 'Martial Outlaw' could fool you into thinking that it came from Hong Kong in the 80s  early 90s. The fights aren't THAT good but for a small action movie they are well choreographed. Unfortunately they degenerate into the pure silliness mastered by Hong Kong movies from the 70s. Still is more entertaining and better choreographed than nearly anything with a big budget that has come out of Hollywood recently. Awesome.David Carradine is nowhere to be seen in this movie. On the other hand Al Leong can be spotted doing his generic Asian bad guy thing. I guess an Al Leong appearance is always assumed for any American action movie.'Martial Outlaw' is an entertaining action movie but the only people who should watch it are the small group of action fans who have even heard of it. Bad plot and acting along with rampant silliness would turn most people off  610 Awesome count The word 'awesome' was used twice in this review.".

While there he ends up teaming up with his brother Jack White Hudson not the ghoullike guitar playersinger from the White Stripes. Thankfully for us both brothers are karate cops who can put baddies in their place with their feet and fists. Jack is more of a bull in a china shop almost literally going by his introduction in the film. Unfortunately Jack is also dirty and he's double dealing  helping the baddies and his brother. All this causes their father known only to us as Mr. White Jaeckel to crawl into a bottle of generic whisky. Will these blood brothers spill blood while proving that blood is thicker than water? Find out today! Martial Outlaw you gotta love that title makes a great companion piece with Mission of Justice 1992. Both are done by the same people they have a similar look and feel and both of course star Jeff Wincott. They even have a similar strategy for their placement of fight scenes  in Mission the big blowout fight was in the garage and here it's in the restaurant. They both have a scene in a gym where Wincott beats up a lot of people. We would certainly recommend the two for a double bill of VHS action brilliance.Outlaw reinforces our love for Wincott  he has a powerpacked fighting style which is infectious for the audience and he can do it while wearing a turtleneck and sportcoat. It's all complemented by his cool 90's hair and his stylish sweaters he wears to the gun range are the icing on the cake. His line of casual gunrange wear would singe the retinas of Bill Cosby. But what else would you expect one to wear when in a state of deep concentration? But he's also likable which is more important than a thousand sweaters which are the exact words we're all taught in school.Funnily enough Wincott or should we say Kevin White can always find a way to have two Arnis fighting sticks in any situation no matter how dangerous. Two legs will break off a chair and fall into his hands or bigger sticks will break in two. You can almost set your watch by the regularity with which Kevin White pummels opponents with two handheld sticks.Physically Gary Hudson and Wincott are perfectly cast as brothers and their psychological tension as siblings is believable and even compelling. And Richard Jaeckel was a nice choice as dad. The baddie even has a goon which closely resembles Martin Kove. Adding further interest are the fax machines pagers and classic computers which are all hallmarks of a certain place and time we just can't seem to get enough of seeing on screen.Martial Outlaw delivers what fans of 90's DTV action want and it is indeed a satisfying experience. We recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has everything an action film could want  heroes and villains and great fight scenes. It stars Jeff Wincott and Gary Hudson. Wincott made a name for himself in a number of great martial arts movies and fans will remember Hudson kicking ass in the classic movie Roadhouse. Here they play two bothers taking on the Russian mob.It starts out in San Francisco where DEA agent Kevin White Wincott promises a snitch that he'll protect him from the Russian drug dealer Rochenko and his hired muscle Sergei played by the massive real life bodybuilder Stefano Miltsakakis. The scene switches to L.A. where we see hero cop Jack White Hudson wasting 3 Asian thugs while foiling a pawn shop robbery.The two brothers couldn't be any more different. Kevin is a straight laced law enforcement professional who trains hard in martial arts. One look at him shirtless working out on the heavy bag reveals a chiseled physique. Jack on the other hand is all street muscle with a powerful body built to punish the trash he encounters on patrol. Rivals for the affection of their excop father and disapproving of each other's style they hook up once Kevin's case takes him to L.A. Though they start out reminiscing the tension between them is obvious. In a key scene Jack challenges Kevin to a friendly sparring match and it's only a matter of time before it leads to fighting for real. Though evenly matched after trading some wellaimed blows Kevin's superior training gets the upper hand over Jack's brute strength and it's easy to see he enjoys administering a savage beating to his younger brother.Angry and humiliated Jack turns dirty and throws in with Rochenko where he trades inside information for a cut of the drug money. Rochenko tests Jack's loyalty by ordering him to slay Kevin's snitch. The street cop carries out the assignment and executes the innocent man in cold blood. Meanwhile Kevin is attacked by a musclebound latino street thug and after a ferocious fight offs him with a powerful kick. Standing over the dead thug Kevin shakes his head muttering L.A. hasn't changed a bit. Jack starts playing a double game feeding Rochenko information but still helping his brother against the Russian enforcers. In a great scene in a restaurant the two brothers take on a bunch of Rochenko's musclemen and leave the place littered with bodies. The best fight scene comes later when Kevin is lured to a dojo and faces the Russian Circle. Directed by Sergei a dozen muscular killers surround Kevin and take turns attacking him. The fights are bloody as they vie for the chance to kill him. With bare hands swords chains and clubs they each take their turn  but Kevin is faster stronger and better trained. One by one he expertly takes each Russian's life. When he's done Kevin's shirtless torso is gleaming with sweat. He asks Sergei Is that the best you got?! Sergei not liking the odds disappears.Conflicted Jack's plot unravels and Rochenko makes plans to flee with the money. Exposed as a dirty cop Jack follows and the ultimate showdown takes place. Kevin finally squares off against Sergei and the two struggle barehanded muscle to muscle until Kevin proves the stronger twisting Sergei's head until we hear the sharp crack that lets us know that Kevin has snapped his thick neck. Though Jack still wants the money his brother tells him he needs to give himself up and it looks like the two brothers might have to fight it out again  this time to the death. Rochenko intervenes and when he tries to shoot Kevin Jack instinctively jumps in the way taking the bullet meant for his brother.The movie ends with Jack's hero's funeral and Kevin realizing that for all his bad deeds his brother Jack was a good cop. This tale of two brothers has a good ending and both Jeff Wincott and Gary Hudson do an excellent job playing these tough cops. The martial arts fights are the centerpieces  especially the Russian Circle where the action is white hot.".

Sergei not liking the odds disappears.Conflicted Jack's plot unravels and Rochenko makes plans to flee with the money. Exposed as a dirty cop Jack follows and the ultimate showdown takes place. Kevin finally squares off against Sergei and the two struggle barehanded muscle to muscle until Kevin proves the stronger twisting Sergei's head until we hear the sharp crack that lets us know that Kevin has snapped his thick neck. Though Jack still wants the money his brother tells him he needs to give himself up and it looks like the two brothers might have to fight it out again  this time to the death. Rochenko intervenes and when he tries to shoot Kevin Jack instinctively jumps in the way taking the bullet meant for his brother.The movie ends with Jack's hero's funeral and Kevin realizing that for all his bad deeds his brother Jack was a good cop. This tale of two brothers has a good ending and both Jeff Wincott and Gary Hudson do an excellent job playing these tough cops. The martial arts fights are the centerpieces  especially the Russian Circle where the action is white hot.";

I also didn't see what people hated about Pauly Shore.  When you're 11 years old you don't find a dude like that obnoxious.  Now...he pretty much annoys the crap out of me.I'm not jumping onto the bandwagon of Pauly Shorehaters.  As a matter of fact I recall very few comic actors who hardly retain an ounce of merit. The thing that's jarring about Shore is he tries hard to hammer a laugh out of his audience but he does it in such a dull lowkey manner.  If you're gonna be obnoxious flaunt your obnoxiousness.  Obnoxious can be funny. Just look at Vince Vaughn's portrayal of Trent in Swingers.  Shore is like that class clown who tries hard to annoy everyone in sight yet at the same time tries hard to be liked.  If Shore had charm that might be possible. A guard dog has more charm than him.The cast is pretty much secondrate.  Tia Carrerre would grab any script that's hurled in her direction and so would Abe Vigoda.  Sure Vigoda was popular in his hayday but that's the whole point.  He was popular IN HIS HAYDAY.  Andrew Dice Clay has an amusing cameo though.  And what in the world was Stanley Tucci doing in this film??!!!  Yes THE Stanley Tucci. The Stanley Tucci from Sidewalks of New York and Big Night.  And here he is playing a fanatical environmentalist.  I can betcha 100 bucks this film is now crossed off his resume.Unless you're a diehard Pauly Shore fan this film is as boring as sitting in a jury for 4 straight hoursand the movie's only 90 minutes long! The only hints of wit are occasional references to 12 Angry Men.My score  3 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a scene early on in Jury Duty when Pauly Shore stands on a bus and imitates a town tour guide. It is obvious that this scene was written to showcase Pauly Shore's comedic talents however he makes noises and is loud and generally obnoxious and unfunny. Jury Duty is the point where Pauly Shore officially abused his stay in movies. After this movie he would forever be sanctioned to the lunch table in the corner with the smelly kid Carrot Top and the Noid from the Dominoes commercials. But not until he showed the world his versatility in BioDome.Jury Duty is bad. Not bad like In the Army Now but close. There is little originality to the script no amusing characters and about four funny lines. I did enjoy the scene where the witnesses from restaurants give testimonies in their respective fast food uniforms. There isn't much else here. It just isn't funny.Shore also lacks the wit his idiotic leading men contemporaries like Adam Sandler and Chris Farley showed in the 90s. These were all more or less bad versions of Steve Martin's wonderful Jerk character. All Shore shows in this movie is that he has the talent to bug you. Of course not all the blame can be put on his shoulders. He has no script to work with. Nothing. I don't know why Stanley Tucci thought this movie would be good for him and or how the studio blackmailed him into being in it.I remembered both Encino Man and Son in Law were kind of funny in a stupid way. Jury Duty  on the other hand is stupid in a very unfunny way.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is a scene early on in Jury Duty when Pauly Shore stands on a bus and imitates a town tour guide. It is obvious that this scene was written to showcase Pauly Shore's comedic talents however he makes noises and is loud and generally obnoxious and unfunny. Jury Duty is the point where Pauly Shore officially abused his stay in movies. After this movie he would forever be sanctioned to the lunch table in the corner with the smelly kid Carrot Top and the Noid from the Dominoes commercials. But not until he showed the world his versatility in BioDome.Jury Duty is bad. Not bad like In the Army Now but close. There is little originality to the script no amusing characters and about four funny lines. I did enjoy the scene where the witnesses from restaurants give testimonies in their respective fast food uniforms. There isn't much else here. It just isn't funny.Shore also lacks the wit his idiotic leading men contemporaries like Adam Sandler and Chris Farley showed in the 90s. These were all more or less bad versions of Steve Martin's wonderful Jerk character. All Shore shows in this movie is that he has the talent to bug you.

Richard Riehle starts out like everyone else wondering how he got into this mess and how to get out but then gets brainwashed to down to Shore's level. Some of the film is funny much of it is not. Shore's dog a longhaired chihuahua does a better job at being funny as well as carrying the movie. Another thing which makes the movie is spotting the celebrity cameos through out the plot.

A year before the awful BIODOME ended his film career there was JURY DUTY possibly the only comedy from the 1990s that is hated as much as BIODOME. Currently JURY DUTY holds a 3.5 user rating here on IMDb which is undeserved in my opinion. I'm willing to bet half the people that voted a 1 for this movie have never even seen it. They simply voted it a 1 because they are one of the millions of Pauly Shore haters in the world. As I said before I find him to be somewhat funny which is probably why I enjoy the film to a certain extent. It's pretty funny for what it is. I enjoy the premise and the energy of the film. It's not a great comedy by any means but it has some good laughs and Pauly Shore is likable in the lead role. Besides any movie with Tia Carrere is okay in my book. It's not Pauly Shore's best work though its passable fun entertainment. Highlights included the opening scene at the strip club and the penis penis penis scene. My rating 510".

Not even Stanley Tucci Tia Carrere Brian DoyleMurray Shelley Winters and Charles Napier can even redeem this rubbish.Easily one of the most forgettable movies out there and it looks like this is one of many movies out there that has thankfully not surfaced on DVD or BluRay but instead found itself somewhere on the scrapheap.Don't bother.110.".

It's like we have to wait so the movie can catch up. If you've seen detective mystery criminal or investigations shows this shouldn't be very difficult to piece together. I was able to point out the suspicious one and come to a consensus on the trial in about forty minutes. Not a very complex film.Once more we have Pauly Shore who's fine in this film. I didn't adore him in this film and it does not come close to the humor brought to us in BioDome. I think In the Army Now is better than this as well. Jury Duty doesn't exceed the averagebelow average qualities it should to be unique or special. It does exactly what it's expected to do. Like a little kid on his way to the market because his parents said so. He walks straight to the market and straight back. Doesn't stop and chat doesn't smell the daisies and doesn't lollygag. Nothing out of his expectations.Pauly Shore is lovable loser Tommy Collins who is in desperate need of money and a job. He is stuck at his parent's house with his dog Peanut and his dignity deteriorating day by day. Tommy is called on jury duty and like everything else in his life he's hesitate on following through with it. Until he learns that the duty pays 5 a day and there's a hotel in it for him as well. A few hours of sitting and listening to go back to a hotel all for 5 a day? Why not? As you would imagine Tommy doesn't want to give this up. He meets a sexy juror Tia Carrere who he is friendly too but she wants nothing to do with him. Tommy gets the idea that if he continues to stall the trial by voting not guilty every time he can pretty much get 5 a day for doing nothing but expressing his false opinion. Ingenious! The film has taking a good beating by Gene Siskel Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin. I enjoy Pauly Shore but didn't find this film too funny. Some parts I smiled or laughed but as a comedy it greatly fails at it's job  to make the audience laugh. If a comedy doesn't make the audience laugh it's practically as lifeless as a soap opera drama. Just characters with no purpose.To date this is the worst Pauly Shore film I've seen. Too bad. This could've been a very enjoyable film but the film just doesn't feel like trying to be original. It just thinks that it can get by by being the simplest it can possibly be without failing. If only the film would experience a little and realize it's a comedy film where possibilities are endless it's critical and audience reception wouldn't be so sour.Starring Pauly Shore Tia Carrere Stanley Tucci Brian DoyleMurray Shelley Winters Abe Vigoda and Billie Bird.

He was fired by Biyun's mother and he had to escape from TaiWan. HoweverBiyun was determined to wait for Chen. She engaged with him the day he left. Chen came to mainland served as a doctor in the army participated the Korean War and went to Tibet after the war. In Korea he met Wang JindiLi BingbingJindi fell in love with Chen who refused her because of Biyun. But Jindi's love is sincere.She paid full respect to Wang Biyun and she knew it's impossible for Chen to reunite with Biyun. Chen was in a dilemma for one thing it's not probable to see Biyun again for another Jindi's sacrifice made her love hard to refuse. He get married with Jindi.Several years later he was killed in an accident. In Taiwan Biyun was still waiting for him and took care of his mother for him.This waiting lasted for as long as her life.Tai Wan get rid of Japanese Control in the year 1945 and from then on there's gap between Taiwan and mainland. Especially before 1970's no communication is possible.Under distorting political events young people's love is always smashed. We all should think about whether it is worthwhile to wait for a lover that much. I think yes for the more we cherish love the more resplendent love is. But I fully respect your choice for we are not living in a movie after all.".

He was fired by Biyun's mother and he had to escape from TaiWan. HoweverBiyun was determined to wait for Chen. She engaged with him the day he left. Chen came to mainland served as a doctor in the army participated the Korean War and went to Tibet after the war. In Korea he met Wang JindiLi BingbingJindi fell in love with Chen who refused her because of Biyun. But Jindi's love is sincere.She paid full respect to Wang Biyun and she knew it's impossible for Chen to reunite with Biyun. Chen was in a dilemma for one thing it's not probable to see Biyun again for another Jindi's sacrifice made her love hard to refuse. He get married with Jindi.Several years later he was killed in an accident. In Taiwan Biyun was still waiting for him and took care of his mother for him.This waiting lasted for as long as her life.Tai Wan get rid of Japanese Control in the year 1945 and from then on there's gap between Taiwan and mainland. Especially before 1970's no communication is possible.Under distorting political events young people's love is always smashed. We all should think about whether it is worthwhile to wait for a lover that much. I think yes for the more we cherish love the more resplendent love is. But I fully respect your choice for we are not living in a movie after all.";

Personally I think the two stories share a sneaky antiChristian undercurrent but other than that they don't share a lot of similarities. The first story is based on a book by Joseph Conrad Heart of Darkness which is about a firsttime navel officer who while on watch finds a murderous refugee from another ship swimming in the ocean.  It had a thoughtful and steady pace and was fairly serious in its storytelling and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The second story is based on a Stephen Crane book about the gunslinging Marshall of a small western town who gets married in San Antonio.  It's a more lighthearted story which is surprisingly funny at times especially when the town drunk puts on his 6shooters and decides to stumble around town raising heck. I don't know why these two 40odd minute movies were stuck together in order to make a feature length film but it seemed to work pretty well because it told two complete short stories in under 90 minutes.  A neat and enjoyable film.  Whee!".

He tells a story so convincing in his justification for the homicide that Mason decides to help him flee.No real action in this one it's Mason with his crew and then with Pate doing a lot of talk talk talk. This was not one of the better film versions of a Conrad story by far.The Bride Comes To Yellow Sky concerns Marshal Robert Preston who has cleaned up the town of Yellow Sky so much so that he's gone to San Antonio to wed Marjorie Steele and bring her home. The only problem is that old time outlaw Minor Watson has gotten all liquored up and is terrorizing the town waiting to kill Marshal Preston. Watson who usually plays dignified establishment type figures is really in an offbeat role as the old time outlaw and he's good.Marjorie Steele at the time was Mrs. Huntington Hartford and note the fact that Hartford is producer at RKO for this film. He would have had to deal with Howard Hughes who owned the studio then and the negotiations between those two billionaires must have been something. Though she's fine in the part of the bride the film did not lead to a big movie career for Mrs. Hartford.If you watch the film I'd skip the first half lest you be bored and go right to The Bride Comes To Yellow Sky in Face To Face.".

	schema:reviewBody "There that's the easy bit. But I must admit that I'm hard pressed to think how to convey why it's so good. Or even what it's about.OK it's about friendship. That much is easy. And there is a story though for the first half of the movie you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise because the movie is in no rush to tell you it. Basically there is a legend amongst the kids at a certain school about an epic fight years before between their school and the a Seoul school in their city on a field trip. The scale and bloodiness of the fight is said to be still unmatched and in their minds the kids who led the two schools into battle are the ultimate heroes. What they don't realise is that one of those leaders runs a small street noodle stall and the other is actually their home class teacher. Not the powerful gangsters they expected them to be. The one kid from the school that did grow up to be a top gangster is ironically the only one that didn't take part in the fight but who studied and developed his brains instead of fighting.The movie is basically a character piece and each character has their own thread of story that sometimes run parallel to each other sometimes cross each other and do eventually tie together. The main characters are the teacher and the gangster who meet each other after all the intervening years and strike up a friendship they could never have had when one was the school boss and the other the school geek. The two of them clash however when they meet the sister of one of the teacher's pupils an incredibly cute and sassy girl. Their story is echoed in the secondary thread about the girl's brother and his friends  high school students who are enamoured with the tales of gangs and gangstered and cynical about the value of an education.That's probably more than you need to know but still no way towards really describing the movie. The story is a rich and subtle one  subtle enough that I'm sure many viewers won't even notice it's there at all. Perhaps that's because it's not a story of actions and events it's a story of people and relationships. The movie focuses on who the characters are rather than what happens to them. Plot development exists mainly to develop the characters and as such it is kept in the background so as not to distract too much. The characters in the movie are excellent very complex and interesting and distinctive. Very memorable. The acting is superb such that I never really noticed it as acting  the people were the characters and it was never a stretch of imagination to keep that in mind. I especially liked the actress playing the sister  Kim HyeSu and would love to see some more of her.A lot of the movie is dialogue heavy and it's very well written and delivered never becoming boring. Thankfully the subtitle translation is excellent as this is a movie that would die with poor subs.So half the movie is dialogue and it is excellent. And the other half of the movie is... well people beating the crap out of each other for the most part. There is an absolute ton of fighting in the movie indeed for the first half there is more fighting than talking and the fighting only stops briefly after that. No kungfu here just street fighting but well choreographed and filmed.The movie is sold as a comic action special on the DVD case which I think probably creates the wrong expectations. It's not 'comic action' at all. It is a funny movie but it's a subtle humour that's mainly in the performances and dialogue delivery rather than anything that is said or done. Possibly wryly humourous though it's so long since I've used that phrase I forget exactly what it means .I still find it hard to find something to hang this review on to capture the essence of the movie. It's not the kind of movie that can easily be distilled and packaged. Ultimately I probably can't do much more than say It's really really good and hope that you will take the time to confirm this fact for yourselves .".

	schema:reviewBody "Kick the Moon is very much the predecessor to Attack the Gas Station the director's previous film. While the setting and the characters have changed the way the characterizations are handled the style of humor the plot twists all strike such a similar chord that it's hard not to see the resemblance between the two.The story however is quite different. This revolves around two people a former school badass turned respectable teacher and a former school geek turned badass gangster. They meet by chance as the latter returns to the hometown to take it over. They start a tense friendship that flares into antagonism as a firecracker of a woman appears in their lives. Of course things get increasingly crazy with multiple other players involved including a bumbling cop a displaced gangster a quartet of high school students and more.The film sprawls over the town its set in but fortunately we don't lose sight of any characters during the process. However due to the sheer number of side characters it can get a little unwieldy to keep track of what's going on in the story. At the same time because the leads work so well together both in terms of acting and story it's still easy to follow what's going on. This isn't a classy or artfully shot film. It's a roughandtumble overthetop comedy that manages to be amusing. But I do wish it were cut down a little so that there wasn't so much going onat the same time that would take away from its sometimes bewildering nature.In the end this is an enjoyable film that suffers a little from just having too much going on. If you liked Attack the Gas Station you will likely enjoy Kick the Moon. It lacks the social commentary of the first film but adds in a more meaningful story about friendship so it works on a slightly different level. However it's not for everyone. Decent. 710.".

When one thinks of the Rom one thinks of oppressed people and it is perfectly consistent to see a young woman from an oppressed group as a sexpot that's their value. It is no accident that the story has been redone with former slaves Carmen Jones and by Senegal although in that case while still oppressed and clandestine she is more in command than some of the others.

Born to a rural family in Taiwan unprepared for the birth of a blind son Siang was a curious and precocious child. Touch and sound was everything to him. With the love of his mother and support of his family he grew up with no barriers  that is until he had to face the real world as he left his family behind in order to attend university where he had to compete on the same playing field as the sighted students and to find his own way. He soon crossed paths with Jie Sandrine Pinna a beautiful but frustrated cold drinks vendor who dreams of being a dancer but whose struggles against the harsh realities of her life render her helpless. However when she witnesses Siang's fearless determination and understood his optimism and inner peace she is inspired and determined to hold on to her dream. Touch of the Light  a story ...";

In a nutshell it is about a blind pianist fought with his own self doubt to being recognized as a worldclass performer. The standout about this film is the smoothness of the dialogue. I have noticed recent Taiwanese films being plagued by awkward and often cringe inducing dialogue. But not here the jokes are genuinely funny and tender moments emotive. The leading actress is gorgeous and this is the first that I have seen her. I really admired this film. Sadly it's likely only to be viewed by a very limited audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a given that the latest Hur Jinho film is going to be a bit of a romantic slowburner tracing the delicate path of attraction and flirtation and connecting it to the variable weather of the seasons Christmas in August April Snow. It's almost inevitable that this seasonal disruption is also going to signal a darker side to the tender relationships just recently established with sickness death infidelity or simple incompatibility leading to trouble and breakup. You could call the films of Hur Jinho bittersweet but the bitterness usually has a bit of a kick to it. With a title like A Good Rain Knows you can be sure that Hur Jinho's latest film follows the now familiar template.The delicate relationship in its tentative first flower of spring is one that has been rekindled when Korean businessman Park Dongha arrives in Chengdu in the Sichuan province of China and reencounters an oldflame May a Chinese girl who he once studied with in college now working as a tour guide at a park dedicated to the poet DaFu while she works on a thesis for college. They both have different memories of just how close they used to be Dongha believing that they were practically girlfriend and boyfriend May denying that they even kissed. Nonetheless Dongha is attracted to May and there are signs in the affectionate friendship that develops that they may be able to restart a relationship that has been divided by time and distance.This is all handled by the director with customary delicacy and a lyrical attention to the detail of attraction and romance. The seasons are of course evoked in it being spring when May and Dongha meet the rain playing an important part in bringing them together and holding them slightly apart the pleasure of anticipation and timing noted in references to DaFu's poem that a good rain knows when to come. The sense of rebuilding is there also in Dongha's work his company sending him over to sort out arrangements for the reconstruction work after the devastating Sichuan earthquake the previous year. Hur also uses the image of a bicycle to good effect as a metaphor for relationships learning to fall in love again being like learning to ride a bike again.However cleverly evoked  the gentle music the gazing thoughtfully into the distance the walks in the park and to the zoo to see the pandas terrific panda footage though  all this is rather insipid stuff that brings to mind the director's airbrushed efforts in the earlier April Snow with the two leads rather blandly perfect and not assisted in achieving any greater emotional depth here on account of them having to communicate in faltering broken English. What of course keeps the viewer interested  if they are familiar with Hur Jinho  is anticipating when the director is going to drop the bombshell that shatters this cozy little arrangement. And inevitably it comes with a bang...Such is the reliability and slight predictability of the element of crushing tragedy eventually arriving in a Hur Jinho film that one is inclined to think there is something either of parody or even sadism about it all that the director is enjoying the slow buildup before delighting in sadistically sticking the knife in. This isn't the case however. What Hur is interested in is exploring the boundaries of love and romance. As the otherwise comedic element of Mr Nam observes to the nave Dongho love does have borders and Hur explores these limiting factors on idealistic love the boundaries where it fails crashes and burns. Rather than being destructive then it's these boundaries that define love and give it meaning where otherwise it would indeed be bland and insipid.This is all very well. A Good Rain Knows is beautifully filmed if a little too clean and bright played out with sensitivity and no small amount of irony and humour  a fine example of the director's work on this theme that will intrigue any viewer unfamiliar with his earlier films. For anyone else who has seen Christmas in August One Fine Spring Day and in his last film Happiness oh the loaded irony in all those titles! you will unfortunately have seen it all done before much better and with a great deal more bite than this.".

It's got dancing in a downtown square bamboo groves even a scene with a panda bear. Gao Yuanyuan as Mei a tourist guide in a Chengdu park has never looked more radiant. Jung Woosung is a South Korean heartthrob but his acting ability is curious. He always seems nervous. He plays an architect Dongha who travels to Chengdu on assignment and runs into Mei an old and dear friend. There is no plot to speak of just the unfolding of their past and present relationship that gives the film its purpose.Dongha a Korean and Mei a Chinese communicate almost exclusively in English. Since their relationship is presented as fragile and tentative and since Jung is a nervous actor anyway having them communicate in broken but understandable English is a stroke of genius from director Hur. If you're bothered or unmoved by the stilted verbiage the film won't work.In typical Hur fashion and this film sees him in perfect stride not much happens. We're presented with a couple characters testing the water to see if when and how love will factor into their relationship. The lens slowly gets closer revealing inner layers until a small explosion occurs. And in typical Hur fashion this explosion takes place far beneath the surface. We know it's a big one but all we see are the rippling aftershocks hint on the surface.Hur is a fascinating director. In some ways his films are just cheesy romances with questionable soundtracks but he possesses an emotional intelligence and an eye for subtle soulsearching details that make his films powerful when he gets it right. He got it right this time. A good rain knows when to fall.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts with a sensational serial killing case shocking the whole nationthis is probably the third or fourth time I encounter the serial killing in Korean movies in this year. Recently having a prime suspect get killed the police have lots of pressure from the citizens the media and above all the President who demands that the case be solved as soon as possible. They must find a way to solving the case or any other ways for retaining their public image.They choose Choi CheolgiHwang Jeongmin as the new chief of the special investigation team. He is a cop with the good record but that is not the main reason he is chosen for he is chosen due to his lack of personal connections. If the investigation is failed his discharge will not hurt anyone in the police. Cheolgi knows that well when one of his superiors personally asks him to take the case but he accepts it. He has been always denied promotionmainly because he did not graduate from the Police Academy and is willing to bet his career on this murder case.However the movie is not about solving the murder case. Under his superiors' silent consents Cheolgi does a risky cleaning job. With his men he trusts he assembles the other possible suspects and analyzes them for sorting out the most plausible suspect. It does not matter whether that suspect is guilty or not. All Cheolgi has to do is asking Jang SeokguYoo Haejin a mob boss who has been associated with him to get the suspect and 'persuade' him to be the serial killer the whole nation is looking for. Their scheme ends up being successful and everybody goes happily along with it. However the things get messy for them when the case is handled by prosecutor Ju YangRyoo Seongbeom who also has his own dirty business to be taken care of.With the original screenplay by Park Jeonghoonthe writer of I Saw the Devil the most controversial Korean movie of this year the director Ryoo SeungwanThe City of Violence2006 carefully maps out the positions of his three main characters and others from the start with the subtitles informing the date the time and the names. As the plot thickens the details about their complicated relationships are succinctly delivered to us and we come to understand how they affect each other as well as their motives. Their interests are so entangled with each other that one conflict of interests logically results in other conflict. Or the one is solved and then here comes another one. This seems endless until someone is pulled out from this power game.While closely observing the dynamics between them the movie looks far more widely at the system and its excruciating mechanism in the Korean society. It is not different from what you saw in HBO TV series The Wire the system is adamantine and the individuals are usually helpless in front of its effects  especially in case of the ones occupying the lower strata. Although there are some shifts in the power game it is eventually clear that who has the power to wield and who is the nearest at the top and who will remain no matter what happens. Although Ryoo Seungwan said he was not intended to make the movie as a social critique the Korean audience will feel lots of familiarity to the society shown in the movie thanks to the recent big scandals associated with the Public Prosecutor's Office. They probably have gutchilling feeling at the end of movie because they know too well that this is how the system works not only in the movie but also in their reality.Regardless of whether the movie is a social critique or not Ryoo Seungwan makes a compelling urban noir movie. Compared to his previous works The Unjust is a more controlled work with lots of confidence as usual. The pace is brisk in most parts the humor is wellintegrated into the story and the characters are solid. The world they inhabit is presented realistically as well as stylishly from the filthy garage disposal factory to the luxurious gallery party. There is only one notable short action scene in the movie but even with that scene Ryoo proves again that he is very good at making effective physical action sequence you can really feel the desperation in their struggle.".

It did not contribute to my appreciation.Like in the real world no one in this film was 100 good or bad. I saw more than my daily dose of ugly behavior in fact being a mixture of good and bad. Loosely translated most people had the best of intentions but less commendable methods to get what they wanted.The complex relations between the main characters leads to confusion in the story line. It makes this film feel too long for its contents regardless of the things that are continuously happening throughout the 120 minutes. Hence there should be no reason to get bored. But still the lack of purpose and direction of what we see happening does not work out well to maintain our attention.Satire seemed an essential part of the film. What I found particularly hilarious was how hierarchical lines work in those circles and how people behave differently when their boss or even higher is present. It was way different from what I am used to warning I may be prejudiced living and working in The Netherlands where subordinates are infamous for their Yes but... type of cooperation.All things considered I see not much reason to recommend this film but that is not due to technical flaws or lack of action. What I particularly miss is the logic in the proceedings. I can accept that I'm alone in this however and that I did not pay enough attention to catch the plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sat for two hours loving this woman and feeling sorry for her hoping for her. That's what is supposed to happen when you watch a wellexecuted character study.If you were to look up boring art house film in some film dictionary you might find the plot synopsis for This Charming Girl listed as the definition The film follows Junghye's quiet life and reveals the landscape of the character's inner feelings.Junghye has forged her own life out of simplicity and solitude as the result of some trauma earlier in her life. The film doesn't focus on what that trauma is or how Junghye may eventually resolve it. Instead it focuses on the mundane life she has made for herself as a result. We watch her feed her cat cook herself meals go to a job at an uneventful workplace. This is not an action movie. It's an extremely slow burn that leads to one very intense scene which involves a knife. It's an intense scene not because anything crazy happens but because we can see all of the repressed emotions inside this woman come boiling to the top. And we can see this happening because Kim JiSu's performance is nothing short of phenomenal.No use going into more detail about the events of the film. It's better to see them for yourself. If you like wellwritten wellacted meticulously directed character studies This Charming Girl is one of the best ones out there. Even though it is art house to the max there isn't a pretentious moment in the film.".

	onyx:emotionText "I sat for two hours loving this woman and feeling sorry for her hoping for her. That's what is supposed to happen when you watch a wellexecuted character study.If you were to look up boring art house film in some film dictionary you might find the plot synopsis for This Charming Girl listed as the definition The film follows Junghye's quiet life and reveals the landscape of the character's inner feelings.Junghye has forged her own life out of simplicity and solitude as the result of some trauma earlier in her life. The film doesn't focus on what that trauma is or how Junghye may eventually resolve it. Instead it focuses on the mundane life she has made for herself as a result. We watch her feed her cat cook herself meals go to a job at an uneventful workplace. This is not an action movie. It's an extremely slow burn that leads to one very intense scene which involves a knife. It's an intense scene not because anything crazy happens but because we can see all of the repressed emotions inside this woman come boiling to the top. And we can see this happening because Kim JiSu's performance is nothing short of phenomenal.No use going into more detail about the events of the film. It's better to see them for yourself.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film the evening after watching XMen The Last Stand in part to help wash out the bad taste X3 left in my mouth. This Charming Girl is a quiet introspective film about the life of a post office worker.The protagonist is quiet shy and introverted and just a little bit quirky. A meticulous cleaner we watch the unfolding of her daily events and slowly over the course of the movie we see the connections of her daily activities to past events in her life through a series of blended flashbacks.The film is meditative and places you inside the life of JeongHae by asking you to participate with her as she adopts a cat spends time with her coworkers and explores the more mundane facets of her life. However as the layers are peeled back into her past the film does a great job of building empathy for her especially in light of her past tragedies and scars and when the situations become slightly less mundane all the tensions in her past come to light in a controlled but emotionally potent way. In the end we understand part of why JeongHae is the way she is thanks to the meticulous study of her behavior and activities along with the insight into her memories.The directing is impressive in that the director manages to bring the audience into the life of JeongHae with only her daily activities and their connections to the initially mundaneseeming activities in her past. The film is not dialogue heavy and yet it doesn't really drag because of this or the fact that a lot of the film progresses in small steps.However this is not a film for the impatient or for those who are afflicted with ADD. The film does take its time letting the viewer become acquainted with JeongHae in her quiet moments but at the same time there isn't a whole lot of action in the traditional sense. In order for a viewer to get something out of this picture the viewer has to be willing to explore question and investigate JeongHae in her interactions and activities. That's probably asking a lot out of the typical American filmgoer.Still the overall impact of the film is quite potent if you're willing to explore it and is quite affecting in the end. I liked it. 810.".

I know that marabou aren't really judgmental and that pelicans aren't really pompous.

Oh never mind just watch Nova.Maybe documentary isn't the right word to describe this film which is an entertainment that incorporates nature footage and some nature fact dramatic or comedic invention and musical accompaniment.  What would you call it?  It's sort of a whatsit.  Whatever it is it warms the cockles of my heart and this cocklewarmer can be enjoyed by people of all ages  something rare enough these days.  It is in general wry and amusing but the part that made an overwhelming impact on me since my first viewing is that near the end where a pitiful troupe of abandoned pelican chicks are dying in the scorching sun.  The threeday struggle of the clouds to drop rain onto the desert and the sun's efforts to prevent it are depicted as a titanic battle of opposing armies with spectacularly beautiful footage of clouds and sunlight dramatically accompanied by the Liszt tone poem Les Preludes.  I still find this imaginative interpretation of these natural events absolutely gripping and I imagine it must have made a powerful impression on many young kids who've seen this film over the years.  The final scene is pure joy.Do see this film.  Buy the DVD.  It's excellent and the chances are overwhelming that you will like it.  Most people seem to.".

I watched this at the age of five and it captivated me. Why?Because director Uys uses sound effects that doesn't always ocur in nature. For instance see the little beatle run. See how it runs. Suddenly it stops dead in its tracks! And when it stops you hear the sound of screeching tires! Classic! The narrator sometimes sarcastic remarks are funny too.There is also a part where a nest with birdies is set alight by a natural occurence that would have any child in hishers right mind in tears. I didn't cry which only proves my statement.But even though it is zany at some points it is still informative. It's a documentary after all. Buy it and see it. If you dont like it then there is something wrong with you!".

	onyx:emotionText "Beautiful People is a masterpiece. Why? Becuase its a two hour long documentary that children can see without getting bored. I watched this at the age of five and it captivated me. Why?Because director Uys uses sound effects that doesn't always ocur in nature. For instance see the little beatle run. See how it runs. Suddenly it stops dead in its tracks! And when it stops you hear the sound of screeching tires! Classic! The narrator sometimes sarcastic remarks are funny too.There is also a part where a nest with birdies is set alight by a natural occurence that would have any child in hishers right mind in tears. I didn't cry which only proves my statement.But even though it is zany at some points it is still informative. It's a documentary after all. Buy it and see it. If you dont like it then there is something wrong with you!";

	schema:reviewBody "Animals Are Beautiful People was made in 1974 and was a staple at most movie theaters and Driveins at that time. It was shot in the desert regions of West Africa and traces the trials and tribulations of animals trying to survive throughout the wet and dry seasons of this harsh region. The narration and editing endeavor to give it a comical slant although there are a few harrowing scenes as well. The cynical technical geeks will quickly note the occasional crude use of 1970's computeranimation tricks but it does not really detract from the context of the movie. It is interesting to watch and would suit most ages. Given the age of this movie the region it covers has probably changed a bit over the years but the situations there today are probably similar to this. If you enjoyed documentaries like The Vanishing Prairie and The Painted Desert you will enjoy this as well. Well worth a look.".

In this movie the director shows how much of a comic genius he really is. The scenes are wonderfully played out considering the animals are not acting makes me wonder how many thousands of takes the director must have had. The director plays the role of the narrator in a sort of zoological commentary on how animals of the Kalahari act really like humans and they really do. They even get drunk like humans. The editing is great and the colours are wonderful in my point of view. I remember the first time I saw this movie I thought I would have died of laughter 4 or 5 times I even had to check my pulse to make sure. That is how funny this movie is. It is worth the money and the time by a longshot. Enjoy everyone.".

About four years in the making itself this is an endearing film with an often comedic bent.Its main intent is to document animal behaviour in the forbidding environments of the White and Red Namib deserts where many species struggle to survive. It also shows us an isolated jungle paradise in the middle of the desolation along the banks of a river and how the beasts that live there tend to take their easier lives for granted. In the final half hour or so Uys introduces us to some of the indigenous people of the region and their own methods for survival.Some of the most memorable bits involve some ingenious behaviours in the animal kingdom such as the mother bream that allows her thousand offspring to swim into her mouth so that they are safe from predators. Some species actually collaborate on the search for food which is fascinating to see. Some of the comedy comes from animal actions we see as recognizable when the various species ingest too many of the berries from the Marula tree and basically stagger around in a drunken sort of state. It's also funny to see when that one bird constantly foils the efforts of a tribesman to obtain his prey.The film may be perhaps a little too precious and manipulative at times it didn't need the comedy sound effects on the soundtrack but it never goes truly overboard in terms of sentiment. Some of the most riveting material involves the often perilous lack of water that can kill off many animals.Enhanced by classical works by the likes of Brahms and Tchaikovsky Animals Are Beautiful People is wonderful entertainment for anybody who's ever taken interest in nature documentaries on TV. It has a delightful cast of twolegged feathered fourlegged and manylegged area residents and is delightfully narrated by Paddy O'Byrne.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was never a fan of Jang geun suk nor did I like him much as an actor. But he is decent in this but his English threw me out of this movie. And despite the trailer and the poster making it seem like he is the main character in this movie. He is barely in it and most of the scenes are taken up by the guy that is trying to find out and get to the bottom of what really happened. And find the killer responsible. The thing is there is barely any attachment to any of the characters. Even when it comes to the victim who got stabbed multiple times and killed. Nothing really made me focus and grab me with the situation at hand. Maybe slightly near the end but that is about it. And that is because of the victim's parents and family and what pain they must have gone through. Since there is no attachment to any of the characters and because people get killed all that time. It's sad but that is what happens around the world but even one victim can lead a movie like this. But unfortunately that isn't the case for this flick. The two possible culprits gets caught early on and what drives the story is trying to find out which one is the one that actually did the killing. Despite the somewhat interest premise since it's based on a true story it made me angry. Especially since foreigners like the culprits in this movie ruin chances for others to go and teach in other countries. And because of morons that are portrayed in this movie or just go and cause trouble. Has lead Korea too crack down and is way more strict with it's regulation of foreigners going to Korea in order to teach. And ruins it for people that genuinely want to teach build friendships and have fun in a responsible manner. Anyways this is a boring movie that will make most audiences lose interest in it early on. The cast was good especially the one that played the semiretarded culprit. The story is choppy at places and the direction is overall just poorly done. The most positive thing that stood out though is how it shows how flawed the justice system is even in Korea. There is a bit more to this story that isn't shown in this movie since it came after 2009 which is the date this movie came out. And more of what happens comes after. I feel bad for the victims but as a movie this one is a poor crime mystery thriller.4.510".

She was a magician's assistant who fell miserably in love with her boss. Now she runs a remote restaurant on the windswept coast of South Korean's Jeju island. Their paths cross after he escapes from prison visiting the young woman at the request of a fellow inmate. She gives him a job as a chef and they begin to get closer. Despite the relaxing seaside idyll and the ray of hope shining down on the characters' stark lives happiness is forbidden them.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Suspicious Customers is not only a comedy but also a human drama. This movie reminds us of the poor people living around us and the director works their stories out mixing it with plenty of comic acting. In this movie one of the best insurance agents ByeongWoo BaeSeungBeom Ryu attempts to transfer from a small company to a bigger company. Before moving to a big company he faces his past a big mistake which he made because of a contest. He accepted 4 people for life insurance and they all have experience of a suicide. If they commit a suicide pretended as an accident they can get the insurance money. This is why they keep paying the insurance money even if they are in grinding poverty. Of course they are not intending a suicide but are getting bogged down in the swamp of suicide. On the other hand ByeongWoo has to prove that their death is a suicide if they pretend their death as an accident. Otherwise both his company and his careers would receive a setback. Therefore this movie shows us the two different desires which are colliding into each other.SeungBeom Ryuin Korea  is the best Movie Star when he performs in a comedy movie. Who can overcome his comic acting? He is really humorous and his adlib acting seems to be a real. Whenever he acts he makes the audience laugh and cry. This time he plays in a movie Suspicious Customers 2011 and he tries again to show his talents as a comedian.In movie the customers are going to die and ByeongWoo tries to protect their life. This is the main story of this movie. The four people whom ByeongWoo is trying to protect are a representative of our neighbor and we can find those people if we are able to pay a little attention. Those people are tempted into a suicide but one important thing that this movie tries to show us is to give information that a suicide can be healed by our helping. This is the reason that a movie is sufficient to give us plenty of impression.This movie is the first work of director JinMo Jo and he did very well. There are laughs and tears and if you like SeungBeom Ryu I would recommend you to watch this movie.".

An excellent biopic of the beautiful  strongwilled 15 yr old consort of King Kojong from the Yi period played by the Korea's enchanting Jaewoong Choi. It revolves around a 15 yr old girl named Jayoung who later is crowned Queen Myeongseong considered a national heroine in South Korea today and her bodyguard Moomyoung. Moomyoung starts off as a Joseon dynasty headhunter who tracks down fugitives and lives off their rewards. One day he encounters a beautiful noble girl Jayoung and falls in love with her. A few years later Jayoung enters the royal palace as the next queen of Joseon Empress Myeongseong. Lovesick Moomyoung becomes the personal guard to the Empress in order to be closer to her.Empress Myeongseong 19 October 1851  8 October 1895 is arguably one of the most controversial figures of the entire Joseon Dynasty back in the Yi period. Her parents passed away when she was 9 leaving her a poor orphan who had to live with the Mins of Yju the place of her birth. She was made the royal consort in 1866 at the urging of Lady Min consort of Hungsn Taewngun and mother of her future husband King Kojong. At barely 16 she married the 15 yr old boy king at the Joseon Dynasty. She's portrayed as pure innocent but not nave devoted and defiant. This movie is about her rise to power and bloody assassination at the hands of the Japanese which all seems to fall in line w historians. After Japan's victory in the First SinoJapanese War she advocated stronger ties between Korea and Russia in an attempt to block Japanese influence in Korea which was represented by the Daewongun her fatherinlaw. She is an assertive and ambitious woman unlike other queens that came before her and later becomes quite interested in politics and the western world via a French friend Sophie Broustal the arrival of electricity in the country and international power politics. Miura Gor the Japanese Minister to Korea at the time and a retired army lieutenantgeneral backed the faction headed by her fatherinlaw whom he considered to be more sympathetic to Japanese interests. She tries to modernize the dynasty by allying with foreign nations but becomes turmoiled into a political power struggle. Moomyoung must fend off devastating threats from her fatherinlaw and the foreign armyJapanese in order to protect Jayoung from harm.A powerful  moving biopic. The Koreans have in recent years produced some pretty decent swordplay movies Bichunmoo The Restless The Duelist and Shadowless Sword being some of the more memorable movies. 9 out of 10 from me!".

	schema:headline " An Entertaining Historic War Feature that Despite a Few Notable Issues Brilliantly Encapsulates a Story of Unrequited Love and Dedication";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sword With No Name is both a historic reenactment and a romantic narrative regarding a dark time in Korea's past the love story being the driving force that makes this feature so enjoyable. Despite sporting costumes that are as attractive as they are vividly colorful several of the small settings alongside the depiction of events where obviously significantly more people would be attending as an example during ceremonies and upon the battlefield suggest the budget of the film which is heightened by the use of computer generated effects for at least half of the fight scenes. In so doing although entertaining the addendum these are not executed with wires or other like realworld mechanics forbids these particular encounters from being realistic. The soundtrack during these moments however is quite immersive though it is the score accompanying the film's emotional segments that strongly deserves kudos.The occasionally humorous and more lighthearted moments do not take away from the seriousness of the feature instead strengthening the relationship between the two lead characters though at the same time there are certain exchanges that seem to contain little pertinence. During one scene the Queen is presented with the skin of a tiger however never does this make a reappearance despite the suggested importance conveyed during an exchange of dialogue.Moving on Cho SeungWoo is especially enjoyable in his portrayal of MuMyeong the mysterious expertly trained fighter who develops an infatuation for the Queen. His unwavering dedication and willingness to sacrifice his own existence is well articulated his feelings being realistically portrayed furthering the believability of his character. The magnificently beautiful SooAe as Queen Myeongsong exhibits intellect compassion and professionalism in her role heightening the courage and confidence she reveals in the depiction of this historic figure. Due to my lacking knowledge on the historical period I may question the Queen's willingness to spend time with no offense intended a lowly commoner like Myeong though the feelings she demonstrates for his character appear very legitimate which ultimately build upon her character's ability to proudly serve.This however is potentially hindered by the intensity of the sex scene. It is by no means explicit though the screams of raucous passion the fierceness of the bodily thrusts and the vision of intertwined limbs has a way of stealing the focus of the film. Despite serving a purpose which is well executed though at the same time highly exaggerated the belief viewers may have held prior to the scene might be diminished or perhaps compromised and I personally found myself questioning the necessity of such a scene.Moving on the King's father the influential Dae Won Kun Cheon HoJin largely appears indecisive and spontaneous over the course of the feature this especially due to the lack of exploration or presence his character receives in contrast with the two leads an argument that can be potentially made about other characters. Noe Jeon Choi JaeWoong as the expert swordsman exhibits multiple agendas that audiences may have difficulty placing while King Gojong Kim YoungMin appears as a jealous coward on more than one occasion with potentially nefarious motives up his sleeve the few scenes he is given being barely enough to reveal him as a leader. Such characters needed extra screen time in order to make their personalities and intentions more comprehensible. Similar remarks can be made about the interpretation regarding the invading Japanese who are presented as arrogant selfish and violent offenders the solely Korean perspective prohibiting viewers from accurately gauging a complete awareness of their intentions. This lacking information is furthered by the addendum that several subplots are unresolved by the conclusion though those familiar with the period may be privy to such knowledge.Despite the occasional lack of context and a couple potentially unnecessary moments The Sword With No Name tells a very well developed story of unrequited love that may be quite relatable to viewers who have experienced similar emotional strife. The acting by the leads is one of the feature's most powerful qualities further strengthening the film's most dramatic moments while keeping us vested until the final poignant sequence.".

And sometimes seemed over the place a bit at times but it's still a good movie and a well shown story. This isn't a mindless sword fighting movie but there is some actual meat in the story. This movie is based on a true story that has historical characters in it but I am not sure how much is accurate. Especially because it has some fantasy like elements in it sometimes and comes off a bit fairy tale like...Well not entirely though. The plot mostly revolves around a man who is a bounty hunter but falls deeply in love with a person that is soon to be the queen of Joseon Dynasty. She is a open minded queen that didn't mind building ties with other foreign nations especially with Russia in order to stop Japanese influence. Since japan at the time tried to oppress and meddle in the affairs of Korea constantly. So there is some politics and rebellion going on inside and out. And while this is going on the man that fell for the queen doesn't give up his devotion to her and tries his best to protect her no matter what. This is a movie that probably won't grab the attention of the audience right off the bat but as it progresses you will get more invested in it. If the development of the story and editing was a bit better this movie would have been great. If your looking for a bright and happy romance movie this won't be for you. But what is brings out is emotional and heartwrenching story with great actresses and actors.810".

A stout young fellow and brilliant swordsman with his sortof chopping axe falls for the delicate and edible Queen before she is crowned when she takes his punt to the seashore. Plenty of canoodling at this point. Later she is Queen in the palace and the young man's prediction comes true there's nothing but trouble in that there palace. He manages to barnstorm his way into the Palace guard after successfully testing a new bulletproof jacket. From then on he is dedicated to saving the Queen from destruction and his sword is irresistible. At one point he leaps around among the stars as he takes on the biggest swordsman in the Guard they fight to a standoff. When he runs off with Queenie for a few days to save her the King's attention is alerted and he decides to abandon his mistress and vigorously knock up the Queen missionary and cowgirl positions. Eventually the historic Japanesefriendly chancellor swears to kill the Queen and our friend makes a brilliant but suicidal attempt to defend her. She is graphically run through by several supersharp swords and dies with the young man's name Johanes on her lips for the first time. This is a grotesque romanticization of an ugly part of Korean history and the director does Korea no favours with his fantasy nonsense. Not strongly recommended.".

And even though there were only about 20 minutes of torture left I just couldn't do that to myself. So this review isn't for the ending of the movie which may have been the sweet ending to the verysour beginning. I will never know.As another reviewer mentioned the editing of this film isn't very good. It terribly disrupts the flow of the story lines. Because of this I simply couldn't fall into the plot and follow our protagonists along their journey.When editing fails the chemistry between the actors must pick up in order to make up for the audience investment. But don't expect that here. There was no chemistry between our starcrossed lovers the Queen and the Bounty Hunter making their romance unbelievable. And when that force of attraction isn't there to push the story along the whole movie falls apart.That isn't to discredit the acting. I thought the actress who played the Queen did a good job emoting depths of feelings while the actor who played the Bounty Hunter was decent in his own right. Perhaps one should blame the casting director for putting two actors who didn't possess the magnetic pull towards each other into these roles.As for the fight scenes? Less than mediocre. I always enjoy action especially wellchoreographed fight scenes. The ones in this film are far less than impressive. Hit me here. Hit me there. I'll tumble here. And... we're done. I've been on a binge of South Korean movies lately and I have been impressed by the acting story lines directing and editing for the most part. But The Sword with No Name is a stinker.".

The wedding ceremony alone was so funny I almost fell out of my chair from laughing so hard. I thought this could be one of the funniest movies of all time. At about the halfway point though it stops being a laughaminute riot and kind of settles down into more of a quiet romance movie. The scene at the basketball game with the man who worships Murphy is the last really hilarious thing that happens. After that it never again reaches the energy of the beginning. This is not really a bad thing though it is still enjoyable from start to finish even during the quiet parts. It has good actors and it is fun to watch and that makes it a great movie. I highly recommend it it is one of my favorite comedies. I give it 8 out of 10 stars. See it if you haven't.".

Look sharply for Vondie Curtis Hall of tv's Chicago Hope as an overly welcoming fellow native stateside Cuba Gooding Jr. in a blinkandyou'll miss cameo getting a haircut and the clever inserting of Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as the Randolph Brothers from Murphy's and director John Landis' previous joint effort Trading Places.  Best bit Murphy becoming a real New Yorker and greeting a screaming abusive neighbor with Yes! Yes! ... and FK YOU TOO!!!".

Murphy does a fine job as an African prince unhappy about his upcoming nuptials to a woman he has never met so he sets off to New York to find his true love and queen with some sweet moments as well as comic thanks largely to his and Hall's neat hat trick of playing several different characters thanks to the miracle of Rick Baker's make up.  Look sharply for Vondie Curtis Hall of tv's Chicago Hope as an overly welcoming fellow native stateside Cuba Gooding Jr. in a blinkandyou'll miss cameo getting a haircut and the clever inserting of Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as the Randolph Brothers from Murphy's and director John Landis' previous joint effort Trading Places.  Best bit Murphy becoming a real New Yorker and greeting a screaming abusive neighbor with Yes! Yes! ... and FK YOU TOO!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "I once used to be a fan of Eddie Murphy and his movies but in recent years the only one of his movies that I loved was 'Shrek'. He's excellent as the voice of Donkey but the rest of his movies aren't exactly the best examples of fine humor think of movies like 'The Nutty Professor'. It's a good thing that from time to time you can still see one of his older ones on the television so you won't forget that the man really has some talent.In this movie Eddie Murphy plays most of the time the role of Prince Akeem of Zamunda. On his 21st birthday he'll have to marry a woman he has never seen before. Because he isn't too happy with that and because he wants a wife that can do more than doing exactly what he tells her to do like for instance barking like a dog he decides to go to America to find the love of his life. The only problem is that the girl shouldn't love him for his title and his money but for his personality. At first all he gets is a big culture shock but eventually he'll find a girl he really likes...This movie is really one of the funniest Eddie Murphy has ever made. It has a good story and offers plenty of laughs but this isn't a comedy full of toilet humor and may therefor seem dated to the youngest viewers let's say those who were born in the nineties. Personally I really appreciated the fact that not all humor was about farting vomiting and other bodily functions but perhaps that's just me perhaps I'm just getting too old to understand today's humor almost 27 right now. There are some excellent parts in the movie I really love those old men at the barber shop for instance and overall the quality is high enough to enjoy the entire movie. That's why I give it a 7.510.".

This movie is proof that when given the chance a comic actor like Eddie Murphy is capable of playing a complex character that is central to a story.

The film works because actors selected have great timing.Eddie Murphy Akeem et al is quite versatile as the lead. He's in his very best form earnest when he needs to in this feelgood comedy with onpoint comic timing.Shari Headley Lisa McDowell she's level headed perfect in delivering outrage and frustration as well as contentment and laughter.Allison Dean Princess in Cool as Ice as Patricia is not only hot I love her nappturality hair styles. Shari's got some nice ones too. Allison ideally portrays the jilted petulant and golddigging little sister.Eriq La Salle Darryl is the outlandish villain you can actually feel sorry for. His Jeri curl damn it's atrocious.Arsenio Hall Semmi et al was a great smarmy sidekick.I could go on and on. The supporting cast from James Earl Jones King Jaffe Joffer and Madge Sinclair Queen Aoleon to Frankie Faison Landlord and Samuel L.

	schema:headline " Pure 80's fun ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Coming to America is one of these films that best exemplifies the 80's exuberance and unique appeal it's raunchy and outrageous on the surface but sweet and goodhearted inside. And the film carries such a tender naivety in its portrayal of the fictional country of Zamunda and Royal Family's lifestyle that it makes today's films depressingly cynical in their desperate attempt to copy reality by any means or feature likable losers making their bones on redeeming bitches.Yes a country like Zamunda is very improbable but that makes the beginning of the film so fascinating. That Prince Akeem waking up on his 21st birthday would be treated with such an exaggerated devotion echoes one of Cinema's greatest values escapism and dream. It doesn't work in every case but here it does and for a simple reason the Coming to America plot line perfectly contrasts with the Coming from Zamundasetup Zamunda had to be in a total opposition with New York for the film's own comedic purposes. It doesn't avoid some clichs like the passing of zebras and elephants to show that the film is set in the African continent yet it's one of these moments we remember the most from the film just before as the trailer says the fairy tale stops as soon as the first shot of New York City appears.Coming to America directed by John Landis and starring Eddie Murphy is in the same vein than their previous work in Trading Places a movie that I compared to Frank Capra's classics. Only this time it's not a wags to riches story but quite the opposite it's a Cinderella story told in reverse since it's the Prince Akeem who comes to America to marry a woman and as he explains to his friend Semmi Aresnio Hall  I want a woman who will arouse my intellect as well as my loins. This premise leads to a succession of situations so funny that you almost forget about the romantic purpose of Prince Akeem's trip and the presence of Arsenio Hall as the second lead of the film is responsible of that as he literally outshines all the other cast members and creates the perfect comicstraight man duo that this kind of stories need. Semi's priceless look from the window when Akeem shouts Life. Real life! A thing that we have been denied for far too long! is the perfect counterpart to Akeem's naive enthusiasm as he joyfully gives the Fword back to an angry neighbor.After they find a place to live and a job the whole New York's discovery part is a tribute to the actors' extraordinary talent to portray different characters from chatting barbers to drags from singers to pervert reverends they both nail their roles and we as viewers are invited to spot them every once in a while. Eddie Murphy is top notch as the old Jewish man in the barbershop such an uncanny impression that I admit it fooled me the first time I saw it. The beauty of Coming to Africa is that it features two levels of true appreciation one on the story and another through a series of sketchlike vignettes demonstrating two sides of the actors' talent without overdoing them. In a way Coming to America prefigures the appeal of Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor and his wonderful talent as a comedian when given a good role and Prince Akeem is one of his best. But to attribute the success of the film only on Eddie Murphy's talent would be untrue and even more unfair.Another force of the film relies on the whole casting starting with the perfect couple that could have ever played Akeem's parents James Earl Jones as the authoritarian King Jaffe Joffe and Madge Sinclair as the most comprehensive mother but no less Queen Aoloan both who'd team up later to play much ore memorable royal couple in a certain Disney film set in Africa. Both Jones and Sinclair possess a majestic and absolutely irresistible aura and the powerful image of King Jaffe Joffe inspires an ominous sensation beautifully conveyed by the music that accompanies his own entrance in New York. The rest of the cast include another veteran actor John Amos as the McDowell restaurant chain owner Shari Hadley as his beautiful daughter Eriq La Salle as her soontobe exboyfriend Samuel L. Jackson in his typical scenestealing 80's supporting roles and it also features briefs but heartwarming cameos of Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as  you know and if you don't well make a guess.As a comedy and romance not a romantic comedy mind you the film is not without some predictable situations but it delivers what is expected it's funny it has a happy ending and most of hits scenes can be watched regardless of their context. It's a great movie to watch and rewatch and its classical status can't be denied since 24 years later after its release the image of Murphy as the Old Jewish man Arsenio Hall as a woman the McDowell's logo and the unforgettable 'Soul Glo' will forever be associated with the 80's a decade where movies were made just for fun and only for fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Eddie Murphy comedy was somewhat funny at times but I don't know...for me it missed the mark. Started out relatively strong but faded in the end when it got a bit to sentimental which admittedly a lot of comedies tend to do. The story has Murphy as a Prince who is to be married to a woman who has been groomed to be his bride by following his every command. Eddie's character does not want this though he yearns to find real love so he is off to America a place where not everyone knows who he is to find Mrs. Right as it were. He gets a job as a worker at a McDonald's rip off type joint which to me is the funniest parts of the movie and falls for the daughter of the man who runs this establishment all the while keeping his identity as a prince a secret. Arsenio is rather good as his faithful traveling companion as is most of the cast. They are not the problem the fact this movie tends to lag is. Slow lengths of the film where there is not all that much funny stuff going on the movie is under two hours but feels more like a two and a half hour movie. I say I would have liked it more had they trimmed it down ten or so minutes and kept the laughs going throughout the whole movie as they were the first part of it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This Eddie Murphy comedy was somewhat funny at times but I don't know...for me it missed the mark. Started out relatively strong but faded in the end when it got a bit to sentimental which admittedly a lot of comedies tend to do. The story has Murphy as a Prince who is to be married to a woman who has been groomed to be his bride by following his every command. Eddie's character does not want this though he yearns to find real love so he is off to America a place where not everyone knows who he is to find Mrs. Right as it were. He gets a job as a worker at a McDonald's rip off type joint which to me is the funniest parts of the movie and falls for the daughter of the man who runs this establishment all the while keeping his identity as a prince a secret. Arsenio is rather good as his faithful traveling companion as is most of the cast. They are not the problem the fact this movie tends to lag is. Slow lengths of the film where there is not all that much funny stuff going on the movie is under two hours but feels more like a two and a half hour movie. I say I would have liked it more had they trimmed it down ten or so minutes and kept the laughs going throughout the whole movie as they were the first part of it.";

Although it never becomes great and is quite uneven at times entering its rough spots where the jokes seem to slow down and become not quite as funny the movie is always entertaining and Murphy's charismatic lead performance displays his skills as a comedian  unfortunately Hall is not as fortunate. Frankly he stinks.The movie features a wide range of cameos andor star appearances before they became stars  James Earl Jones Louie Anderson and Samuel L. Jackson popping up in various scenes.The movie works as a sort of sequel to TRADING PLACES 1983  both star Eddie Murphy both were directed by John Landis both deal with the prospect of trading places or countries in this situation etc.Also it features a great selfreferential moment linked to Trading Places when Murphy gives a couple of bums a wad of money. It turns out the homeless guys are more than just familiar faces...Recommended. 45".

While there were some decent moments here and there it just seemed like Murphy was standing around smiling at the camera expecting to be loved and adored instead of being funny.

Me and my mother used to watch Coming To America like crazy before my mom made the big mistake of lending the tape to a friend we never saw again. Years later I'm finally reunited with this movie and decide to write this review.The story as you all know is about a Prince named AkeemEddie Murphy that grows weary of being pampered and being given a bride chooses to flee to America to find a bride of his own. He moves to a slum in Queens New York and lives in a rundown hotel and works at the local McDonald's knockoff called McDowell's owned by Cleo McDowellJohn Amos. He ends up falling for Cleo's beautiful daughter LisaShari Headley.The chemistry between Eddie Murphy and the rest of the cast is perfect. Arsenio Hallwho plays Semmi as well as Eddie Murphy show you that they are experts at playing different characters in the movie. The barber shop scenes will always be the funniest scenes in the movie but the scene at the club when Akeem and Semmi are searching for that special lady is not far behind. Even most people will claim its kind of cheesy but I found the scenes with Prince Akeem and Lisa charming and they don't make a bad looking couple on screen. Movies like Coming To America are the reason why people are always going back to Eddie's early films as opposed to his films in the 2000swith the exception of Dreamgirls of course. He looks like he wants to be in these movies and he puts his all into his roles in contrast to the movies that are terrible where he phones in his performance. Coming To America is a great film and is one of the best comedies to come out of Black cinema. Strongly recommended to anybody that likes blasts from the past.".

At times I almost thought it would be like Arthur but it isn't much like it though thanks to multiple roles.

	schema:headline " This movie makes you feel royalty";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so rich with funny scenes that you can't help feeling good about yourself after watching this movie. There are so many gems in this movie from the She's Your Queen song the McDowell's vs. McDonald's shtick to the preacher relating a bikini pageant to God's creation. There is countless amounts of funny humor. Coming to America stars Eddie Murphy as Akeem. Akeem is an African prince from the made up country of Zamunda. The depiction of Zamunda was hilarious and I'm floored that some critics took it serious due to it making fun of Africans natures. First off the portrayal of Africa is nothing like Africa itself and I think we all know that not all African women are subservient and are only interested in wealth. Yes the African culture stresses obedience among other things but there is a fine line between being obedient and being subservient. Let's note that the portrayed is very fictitious so don't get too serious about this. Most people who saw this film surely know that many African countries suffer from dire poverty so some people might not find the story of a fabulously wealthy African Prince aristocrat going to America not interesting. The reason for this is that Zamunda is based on the country of Zaire. Akeem's father King Jaffe Joffer James Earl Jones the cap and lion pelt sash wearing king is modeled on Mobutu Sese Seko who ruled the country of Zaire now the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1965 until shortly before his death in 1997 was one of the most evil dictators of the 20th Century right up there with Hitler Stalin Pol Pot and Idi Amin. The idea of a popular movie glorifying this level of theft treating it as an object of amusement is nauseating to some. Still the movie is interesting. Akeem go to Queen to avoid a loveless arranged marriage and find a wife whom he can respect for her intelligence nonmaterialistic and independent. That's so funny in a way because how he misunderstood that by going to Queens that we will find a royal type woman. He will give up all his wealth and stand up to his domineering family in the name of freedom to feel disconnect in America due to the fresh off the boat misunderstanding of everything and getting into all kinds of ridiculous situations with being an immigrant in America. Eddie Murphy's playing of the pampered prince was equally funny as Murphy manages to look smug and naive at the same time. I could easily understand his need to get away from the Royal Family and see what some other part of the world was like. Akeem and his sidekick Semi Arsenio Hall get mediocre jobs at a McDonald's rip off McDowell and meet some interesting characters on the way. Characters like Lisa McDowell Shari Headley and her father Cleo John Amos. Star spotters will have a field day locating Cuba Gooding Jr. Donna Summer Louie Anderson Eriq La Salle and Samuel L. Jackson in their minuscule supporting roles. Not only those Murphy and Hall play the two main characters but countless amounts of sub characters in makeup. The make up on this film is amazing. Eddie Murphy was Clarence the barber and horrible singer Randy Watson. Believe it or not the Jewish guy is also Eddie Murphy. Mind blown. Hall was also Morris the barber and Reverend Brown in the film. The movie was light and frivolous just as expected. Gags were aplenty. The acting bordered on corny but that's common in comedies. I left the video wondering if Queens was actually that bad or if it was just all part of the joke. Good funny movie and a very sweet story made at the peak of Murphy's popularity. Check it out.".

It is not that this is something new but rather the make up is so well done that you cannot even recognise them. One character that Murphy plays is in fact white and when I suggested to my friend that this was Murphy his reply was  it can't be he's white! The basic plot is simple. Murphy is Adeeb the heir to the throne of an obscenely rich African country and he is going to be married to a woman whom he had not known until she was presented to him on his 21st birthday. He has had everything done for him since he was a kid and is getting sick of it. When he learns that his wife to be's opinion is tailored so that everything he likes she likes he gets fed up and decides to go on a trip. His father thinks that it is to sow his wild oats but he wants to find a wife. So he takes his servant and goes to Queens in New York because logically thinking that is where he is going to find his queen. Moreso he wants to live like a pauper and hires the grungiest flat available and gets a job as a floor mopper at McDowells a restaurant that is very similar to a certain other restaurant which shall remain unnamed so as to protect me for defamation.The plot and themes aren't deep but that is not why I watch these movies. I watch them because Murphy has a cool sense of humour. He plays Adeeb a naive African prince really well and he plays the other characters even better. The barber shop scene is the highlight of this character swapping even though he also plays the lead singer of a band called Sexual Chocolate.The movie is very formulaic with the beautiful woman that Adeeb loves and the horrid slimy boyfriend. In the end as can be expected she decides to marry him. This is not what I am interested in but rather the spice that Murphy adds to his movie. Also the tiein with Trading Places is also quite cool.".

I have to say that my friends were right this was just a really funny and enjoyable movie. We have Eddie as the lead and John Landis directing there is no wrong. Well that's wrong of me to say just love these two guys. But is the movie as good as everyone says it is?

Akeem concocts a plan to travel to America to find a wife he can both love and respect. He and his servant  friend Semmi arrive in Queens  New York and after several scrapes find an apartment. They begin working at a local restaurant called McDowell's passing themselves off as students. Akeem falls in love with Lisa Mr. McDowell's daughter who possesses the qualities the prince is looking for. The rest of the film centers on Akeem's attempts to win Lisa's hand in marriage while adjusting to life in America and dodging his royal duties and prerogatives.I know everyone loves the line the royal penis is clean but my favorite that had me on the floor is when Prince Akeem has moved to Queens and he's all excited goes outside to scream good morning to everyone and some guy says F you! and the Prince doesn't realize that it's actually an insult and screams Yes! Yes! F you too!. Trading Places is one of my favorite comedies of all time and I loved that John Landis included the Duke brothers joke into the movie I nearly died laughing but there is a flaw in that joke. Unfortunately for those who hadn't seen the movie would not get that joke and John should have taken that into consideration. But I really did enjoy this film I'm really glad that my friends wouldn't stop teasing me that drove me to see Coming to America this is the Eddie Murphy that I will always be happy to watch.810".

Unfortunately for those who hadn't seen the movie would not get that joke and John should have taken that into consideration. But I really did enjoy this film I'm really glad that my friends wouldn't stop teasing me that drove me to see Coming to America this is the Eddie Murphy that I will always be happy to watch.810";

Eddie's Prince Akeem and his manservant Semi Arsenio Hall arrive in Queens pretending to be broke and get jobs at a fast food restaurant where Akeem falls for the owner's daughter Shari Headley. This film is lavishly produced and well cast James Earl Jones and the late Madge Sinclair are perfect as Akeem's parents the King and Queenbut there's a certain emptiness about the whole thing that doesn't sustain a film of such length and expense. Murphy is charming as Prince Akeem and he also gets to shine in one fabulous scene in a barbershop where he and Hall play everyone in the scene but the film does not sustain interest until the end. Eddie later became involved in a lawsuit that claimed he stole the idea of the film from someone else which also casts a pall over the film which makes it hard to view all these years later but it was one of Eddie's biggest hits and for his hardcore fans there are laughs to be found but personally I think Eddie has done better work BOOMERANG THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN THE NUTTY PROFESSOR BOWFINGER DREAMGIRLS but judge for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know this is going to put me in the minority but I am not at all a big fan of Eddie Murphy's over the top and in your face style of comedy. In fact in many of his movies I find him to be vaguely irritating. That is not at all the case however with Coming To America which  in my view  must surely rank as one of his best efforts.In this movie Murphy adopts a deliberately lowkey and somewhat innocent style of comedy as Prince Akeem of Zamunda which serves to make him all the funnier. Akeem travels to America in search of a bride after rejecting the arranged choice of his parents the King and Queen the great James Earl Jones  who was perfectly cast as the King  and Madge Sinclair respectively. He decides that the appropriate place to find a bride who will eventually be Queen of Zamunda is of course Queens N.Y.  and the story takes off from there. There is a stellar cast of primarily black actors. In addition to Murphy Jones and Sinclair we see established actors such as John Amos in a very funny role as the father of Akeem's love interest and Arsenio Hall as Akeem's servant. Also interesting are somewhat early views of then 1988 lesser know black actors such as Samuel L. Jackson Vondie CurtisHall and Eriq LaSalle. Shari Headley with whom I was unfamiliar does a reasonably good job as Lisa who Akeem falls in love with.There are not many weaknesses to this movie. Unfortunately Murphy slips back into his more outrageous style playing a couple of lesser characters who hang out at the local barber shop and as I often find with Murphy I found those scenes irritating. But as Akeem he was wonderful. Headley's performance didn't blow me away although it wasn't bad and the scene in which Akeem and Semmi Hall seem to interview prospective brides in a Queens bar started out humorous but got old very quickly. Minor quibbles though. This is a very funny movie.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming to America is directed by John Landis and adapted to screenplay by David Sheffield and Barry W. Blaustein from a story originally created by Art Buchwald. It stars Eddie Murphy Arsenio Hall James Earl Jones Shari Headley and John Amos. Music is scored by Nile Rodgers and cinematography by Sol Negrin and Woody Omens. Plot finds Murphy as Akeem Joffer an African prince who comes to the United States in the hope of finding a good woman he can marry.Released at a time when Eddie Murphy was ruling the 80s Coming to America proves to be viable material for Murphy's talents. That's not to say it's a great film a good one? Debatable now and it was for sure a success at the box office but it feels like a lazy excuse for some one liners and the picture hangs on a flimsy premise thread. As a whole it barely works as a romantic comedy in fact the romance is distinctly tepid but as a series of comedy setups for Murphy and Arsenio it does entertain the nostalgists and those who like immature gags. You do feel that with director Landis stating that Murphy was a pain on setthat Eddie had lost the zest and the willingness to learn that he had on Trading Places five years earlier that Murphy didn't let Landis produce the picture the director originally envisaged.No doubt about it I liked the film much better back in the day back then the fish out of water comedy hadn't been done to death and of course Murphy was still coasting in on the wave of charismatic success which to myself and many others was enough to warrant being in his company. However watching it now it feels tired and weary the one film in Murphy's 80s comedy output that doesn't hold up a chore to get through at nearly two hours in length many comedy sequences stretched too far the multi character gimmick played by the leads runs out of steam an indulgence to ride in on the appeal of the film's two stars. The film actually marks a turning point for Murphy he would follow this film with eight years of cinema mediocrity something which I do believe lends Murphy fans to praise Coming to America far higher than they should.It's certainly not a stinker not at all. There is occasionally fun to be had some well written gags honest intentions to create a charming characterisation for the people. While a cameo appearance by a future star is always worth watching. But in the minority as I am about it and I do consider myself a Murphy fan I have to say the film smacks of cheating and laziness and no amount of penis gags can alter how I now feel about it. I'm off to cuddle my copies of Trading Places 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Creaking with metaphors it is a lovely story to watch with a knockout cast wellskilled in ensemble acting. But it plods along documenting the making of a wedding quilt that incorporates the lives of each person who contributes to it. Finn Dodd what a hideous name played by Ryder at her tentative and mysterious best is spending the summer with her aunts while finishing her thesis. She is also engaged to Sam Mulroney who seems to get needier as Finn seems to be getting coldfeet. The quilt is a gift for Finn's wedding and is a labor of love among a group of women whose lives are intertwined in the northern California wine country each of them sewing a panel that expresses the theme Where love resides. But love resides in many different places among these women  from sisters Glady Jo and Hy entertainingly played by Bancroft and Burstyn who are exactly the kinds of aunts anyone would like to have in their family to the prickly Em Simmons and the unconventional Constance Nelligan. So many different stories as interpreted in quilting panels do not always make a pretty quilt and much negotiating and compromise is the very nature of putting the quilt together as it is in life. Not Ryder's best work but Burstyn and Bancroft are delightful as the potsmoking aunts rockin' out to Neil Diamond's Cherry Cherry. Simmons is a pleasure to see  with quite a lengthy career behind her she doesn't appear often. Samantha Mathis is always charming  it would be nice if things would really click for her career. Kate Nelligan is fabulous  I was never able to abide her work presuming her to be like the kind of tightassed judgmental characters that she portrayed. But I unexpectedly caught her in Frankie and Johnny with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer and could not believe I was watching the woman I had scorned for so long. Now I look forward to seeing her every time she appears. In spite of many fascinating and multifaceted characterizations this vehicle does not serve any of these actresses well. One expects Greatness out of such an enormous and worthy cast but the Entertainometer stops short of Just Okay and one wishes that such talent had been applied to a script that utilized their collective talent better. The concept of the story revolving around this groupeffort is a fine concept but director Moorhouse has to work hard to keep the story from fragmenting into oblivion. Though not weighing in as a heavyweight the multitude of fine performances ensures that it is fine entertainment on a lazy day.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some bits of interesting stories here that could have been made into a powerful exploration of human relationships. There is a glimpse of a couple who after their children are born see their dreams fade and their marriage die. There is a short scene about a black girl who is seduced left pregnant and abandoned by a white rich boy visiting from college. But all of this heavy material is left up in the air. It is the sideshow to the main part of this film which is such a farce that is seems that the circus has come to town.Before I get to that a few positive comments. American Quilt is beautifully made. The lighting sets costumes camera work often create a magical atmosphere which is warm and comfortable. Another nice part is Winona Ryder who I praise for not being anorexic like so many young actresses. She is fine in her role. Maya Angelou also gives a good sometimes tough stoic performance.Now the grim details. This movie centers around a young woman named Finn who has cold feet about getting married and so cheats on her fianc. This part of the plot is so predictable. As soon as the handsome swimmer shows up we know this will happen. Now Finn's mother is known to have a different man every month or so. So far this is plausible but there is much more. Now to Finn's grandmother. Grandma had an affair with her sister's husband while grandma's husband lay dying in the hospital. Now grandma and her sister live together. Only in Hollywood would these two elderly supposedly small town women light up a joint and puff away and live happily ever after even though one woman slept with the other's husband.What's really amazing is that this movie expects us to believe that this could happen twice in the same small town. You see the grandmother and her sister belong to a group of women who are making a quilt for Finn. Another woman is having an affair with another woman's husband. Two women have had affairs with two other women's husbands and they all get along in this quilting group. It's truly amazing. After being surprised and chuckling about all of this I still tried to appreciate the better parts of this film. But what led me to give up hope is that just after Finn confesses that she has cheated on her fianc a violent wind comes blowing her masters thesis out the window. Please what is this the Ten Commandments? I can only feel sad when I see half of a good movie here wasted by being cobbled together with Hollywood nonsense. This is a lesson in how to make an American movie mess.".

	schema:headline " Never More Than the Sum of Its Devices";
	schema:reviewBody "I have spent many pleasant hours mocking How To Make An American Quilt to friends but at this moment I want to play fair.  I'm sure that there are many things to like about this movie and that somehow they escaped my notice.  For me it was never more than a series of plot devices stitched together ha ha to form an unsatisfying story.Winona Ryder is always a pleasure to watch.   I've liked her better in more irreverent titles like Beetlejuice or Heathers.   Still she wears earnestness well and manages to make bearable the Poloniusesque quilt speech at end of the picture see the quotes section.The supporting players should be every bit as watchable with several centuries of acting experience among them they ought to be.  I wish I'd been allowed to watch them act.  Their function was to sit in front of the camera quilting  and say a few words of introduction before the flashbackas if they were hosts of a documentary.I want to pause for a moment over Maya Angelou's casting.  It's always a tricky thing introducing a famous person from another discipline as an actor.  I call it the Hey you're Kareem AbdulJabbar problem based on the scene from Airplane where a kid recognizes the basketball player in the copilot's seat.   The joke is in how much time he spends denying it. Maya Angelou has screen presence but does nothing to dispel the problem. My dominant experience watching her was Wow they got Maya Angelou world famous poet!  Maybe this was the idea.  Maybe the filmmakers felt her famous presence would in itself add depth to the proceedings so why muddy it with anything as messy as an interesting character?   Her appearance was less acting than promotion.  Maya Angelou wouldn't appear in a dog would she?Well...The plot reminds me of a line Robin Williams had about alcoholics You realize you're and alcoholic when you repeat yourself.  You realize you're an alcoholic when you repeat yourself.  You realize oh dammit.  Each woman's story follows a similar pattern.  Girl meets boy sleeps with boy marries boy boy leaves boy comes backeach time unconvincingly I wonder how far any guy has ever gotten with the opening line You swim like a mermaid.  The Alfre Woodard story is the only variation and as a result the only interesting one among them.And of course Winona Ryder's Finn has a similar problem.  Does she marry Dermott Mulrooney or does she go off with the local stud muffin.  I call him the local stud muffin because that's all he is.  The actor who played him didn't convince me that there was anything under the perfect Idon'thavetoworkout abs that would compel her to do more than roll in the field with him.

	onyx:emotionText "I have spent many pleasant hours mocking How To Make An American Quilt to friends but at this moment I want to play fair.  I'm sure that there are many things to like about this movie and that somehow they escaped my notice.  For me it was never more than a series of plot devices stitched together ha ha to form an unsatisfying story.Winona Ryder is always a pleasure to watch.   I've liked her better in more irreverent titles like Beetlejuice or Heathers.   Still she wears earnestness well and manages to make bearable the Poloniusesque quilt speech at end of the picture see the quotes section.The supporting players should be every bit as watchable with several centuries of acting experience among them they ought to be.  I wish I'd been allowed to watch them act.  Their function was to sit in front of the camera quilting  and say a few words of introduction before the flashbackas if they were hosts of a documentary.I want to pause for a moment over Maya Angelou's casting.  It's always a tricky thing introducing a famous person from another discipline as an actor.  I call it the Hey you're Kareem AbdulJabbar problem based on the scene from Airplane where a kid recognizes the basketball player in the copilot's seat.   The joke is in how much time he spends denying it. Maya Angelou has screen presence but does nothing to dispel the problem. My dominant experience watching her was Wow they got Maya Angelou world famous poet!  Maybe this was the idea.  Maybe the filmmakers felt her famous presence would in itself add depth to the proceedings so why muddy it with anything as messy as an interesting character?   Her appearance was less acting than promotion.  Maya Angelou wouldn't appear in a dog would she?Well...The plot reminds me of a line Robin Williams had about alcoholics You realize you're and alcoholic when you repeat yourself.  You realize you're an alcoholic when you repeat yourself.  You realize oh dammit.  Each woman's story follows a similar pattern.  Girl meets boy sleeps with boy marries boy boy leaves boy comes backeach time unconvincingly I wonder how far any guy has ever gotten with the opening line You swim like a mermaid.  The Alfre Woodard story is the only variation and as a result the only interesting one among them.And of course Winona Ryder's Finn has a similar problem.  Does she marry Dermott Mulrooney or does she go off with the local stud muffin.  I call him the local stud muffin because that's all he is.  The actor who played him didn't convince me that there was anything under the perfect Idon'thavetoworkout abs that would compel her to do more than roll in the field with him.  He wasn't a character so much  a plot device meant to set up an obvious choice.  Handsome rogue or dependable architecht?  Given the way the flashbacks ran take a guess.There are more scenes to pummel here.  There's the thesis blowing away in the wind she's the only grad student I've ever seen with no notes no paperweight and since she was using a typewriter no carbons and there's her random meeting with the Stud Muffin who just happened to be hanging out in the groves with a picnic basket and a blanket for her.

	schema:headline " Ryder and Kaminski";
	schema:reviewBody "There are only two reasons to watch this film Winona Ryder's wonderful as usual performance and Janusz Kaminski's spectacular cinematography.Ryder breathes life into Finn Dodd portraying her as a charming intelligent and highly sensitive young woman struggling to define what love and commitment mean to her. Ryder is one of those few actresses who is able to relay a world of meaning in just her facial expressions alone. She's mesmerizing to watch onscreen.Added to Ryder's enchanting performance is Academy Award winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's beautiful flowing images. There are many tiresome flashback sequences in this film but they are all worth seeing just for the artistic value of the photography. Kaminski makes wonderful use of fluid camera movements and grainy filters to capture the essence of each time and place portrayed. It's no wonder Kaminski won an Academy Award for his work in Schindler's List and will most likely win another for Saving Private Ryan.Other than these elements this film has very little going for it. The screenplay is muddled and jumpy and there are far too many characters with far too many inconsequential flashback sequences that say very little about the nature of either love or commitment. The story concerns nothing more than a bunch of old women sharing completely onesided and sexist sob stories. Like The Joy Luck Club and Waiting to Exhale this film portrays men as little more than duplicitous moronic emotionally immature children who are incapable of either expressing true love or loyalty. It is a completely shallow look at adult human relationships and has nothing new or profound to say about anything.As a male supporter of feminism and feminist artistic expression it saddens me that films like this are first of all even made and then marketed as movies that modern women should see and even cherish. There are many far better films about women and their unique experiences the most recent one being a small film called High Art written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and starring Ally Sheedy in one of 1998's best performances.".

	schema:headline " Adultery Indecision and Needlepoint";
	schema:reviewBody "This adaptation by screenwriter Jane Anderson novel by Whitney Otto presents us with a character named Finn Dodd Ryder a 26year old college student who has just gotten engaged to her longtime sweetheart Sam Mulroney.  She begins to realize the many changes that will come about because of her acceptance to his proposal and needs time to think and adjust. She decides to spend three months at her grandma Hy's house in Grasse CA which is the center of operations to a longtime quilting bee. During her tenure she continues working on her master's thesis a project of which she continuously changes her topic all the while listening to the quilting bee's romantic horror stories as they craft Finn's wedding quilt.To sum it up How To Make An American Quilt' is the quintessential chick flick awash with many familiar faces including Maya Angelou.  The Pulitzer Prizewinning poet stars as Anna the queen of an eightmember sewing circle consisting of Glady Jo Cleary Anne Bancroft Hy Cleary Ellen Burstyn her daughter Marianna Alfre Woodard Em Reed Jean Simmons Constance Saunders Kate Nelligan and Sophia Darling Lois Smith.  Anna winds up in the Cleary household at 16  pregnant unmarried and helpless.  She will dwell there until the birth of her child meeting Hy and Glady Jo for the first time.  Little does she know that these two young women will remain in her life for years afterward their interest and skill in the art of quilting mounting over the years by Anna's guidance.There is also the story of Hy and Glady Jo themselves and their unspoken bitterness towards each other  we learn that Hy is the reason for Glady Jo's selfexpression' all over the walls of the laundry room.  Then there is Sophia an aspiring diver in her adolescence and later an abandoned mother of three Em wife to a histrionic artist suffering his recurrent infidelity Constance a decent woman who endures the loss of her nearest and dearest left with only her precious memories and Marianna a lover of many but starved for the discovery of her soulmate.We find as the film goes on that many instances of infidelity exist in the characters' cluttered histories.  Half the women in this movie commit adultery at some point and even Finn falls victim to temptation. Where as once I could not relate I find myself agreeing with many of Finn's thoughts and opinions on marriage upon becoming engaged  this includes a question in the very beginning that Ryder's voiceover poses to the audience How do you merge into this thing called 'a couple' and still keep a little room for yourself?  How do we even know we're only supposed to be with one person for the rest of our lives?'  These kinds of questions number in the hundreds of intended couples as they come closer to walking the proverbial aisle.  I know that I have had my own reservations about marriage ever since I got engaged and many of my questions will never have an answer  I must trust my heart.and my gut.Performances range in the areas of premium to mediocre.  Who comes at the top of my list are screen veterans and Academy Award winners natch Ellen Burstyn and Anne Bancroft.  These two never cease to amaze me with how they can turn a character inside out and make it their own.  Winona Ryder is soso as she is in most of her movies as Finn but she does manage to touch a few nerves with her dark and luminous eyes  those pretty peepers are half of her dramatic capacity.  Alfre Woodard is excellent giving Marianna a carved edge but a soft core.  Kate Nelligan is also wonderful but if you really wanna see her flex those acting chops take a deep breath of Lila Wingo in The Prince of Tides'.  Dermot Mulroney always seems to play a nice guy that gets taken for granted The Thing Called Love My Best Friend's Wedding Point Of No Return etc. and he does it again here  actis repeatus you might say.  Jean Simmons is a little disappointing as Em the once beautiful and poised actress now only a shadow of herself.  Maya Angelou does fine as Anna and some of Gen X's more popular faces make brief appearances in supporting roles Claire Danes Samantha Mathis Jared Leto and Jonathan Schaech.This film is a fairly even scripttoscreen production and will please many that seek a decent character study.  Of course you can't outdo a detailed and poetic novel or the insightful author who writes it.  As long as novelists continue to exist and evolve filmic adaptations cannot compare though there are a few exceptions here and there e.g. Dolores Claiborne. This is not to say that How To Make An American Quilt' isn't enjoyable  it's just not on par with what can be translated through literature.  For those who have read Otto's novel it will earn your rigid criticism.".

Personally as obviously true as the above statement from Finn may be I'll still take 1 Corinthians 138  love never fails. It sounds so much more hopeful! As for this movie it was just a dismal portrayal of love marriage  and men who generally come across here as rather unlovable adulterous and shallow twits.Much of the movie is told in flashbacks. Finn is a young college student writing a master's thesis who gets engaged and then promptly heads off to stay with her grandma and aunt and their friends for an entire summer while they make her wedding quilt. The movie revolves around the stories of the women's loves  and for the most part it ain't a happy story! They've all failed at love in one way or another or more usually the men they loved failed them and they end up getting poor Finn to the point of wanting to back out on her own wedding.From my perspective none of the performances here were particularly memorable including Ryder's and the characters not all that interesting or memorable. The movie ends with what appears to be some attempt at redemption but you have to be able to stick with it long enough to get there and then the redemption itself is a sort of qualified one as Finn ends her narration by essentially saying that she and her fianc Sam might as well go through with this marriage thing because they have as much chance of succeeding as failing and maybe their love will tip the scales ever so slightly on the success side of the scale. Isn't that heartwarming or pathetic! 210 and I'm struggling to remember why I decided to go that high!".

Many women will find this movie touching and heartwarming but it did nothing for me. The overriding theme is that every woman is a patchwork product of the other women in her life so when we choose our path of love it's not really because we're choosing it it's because all the other women's experiences in love have taught us and shaped us. I've never been a huge fan of estrogenfest films but if you like them rent this one with your girlfriends.".

The overriding theme is that every woman is a patchwork product of the other women in her life so when we choose our path of love it's not really because we're choosing it it's because all the other women's experiences in love have taught us and shaped us. I've never been a huge fan of estrogenfest films but if you like them rent this one with your girlfriends.";

	schema:reviewBody "How to Make an American Quilt is a nice comfortable movie and unlike so many other films belonging to the 'coming of age' genre it doesn't leave the viewer feeling emotionally drained.  It is also unusual in that it attempts to breach the generation divide in its appeal however its success in this respect is debatable. Finn is 26 and hoping for some peace and quiet in which to complete her Master's thesis she heads for her greataunt's house in smalltown Grasse California.  She also needs time to mull over a marriage proposal from her boyfriend. This is an entrance cue for a smoulderingly handsome strawberry farmer in an unnecessary plot complication to hinder Finn's contemplations.      Greataunt GladyJoe lives with her sister Hy and their constant bickering is portrayed with sensitivity and humour by Anne Bancroft and Ellen Burstyn. The two sisters belong to a quilting group who are in the process of creating Finn's wedding quilt  thematically titled 'where love resides'. This evokes something different for each of the women all of whom  in artificially contrived teteatetes  explain to Finn the story behind their contributions to the quilt.  The viewer is transported to a time when these elderly women were young and through them we along with Finn learn that times may change but affairs of the heart will always be unpredictable. These dalliances in the past are refreshingly piquant unfortunately this is countered by the film's occasional heavyhandedness.  The symbolic crow that leads the women to their true love has all the subtlety of a flashing neon sign.  Ultimately however even if it does perhaps tie up the loose ends too thoroughly the film will leave the viewer pleasantly satisfied.".

She decides to spend the summer with her grandmother and aunt in a very small California town so she can figure things out.  Her grandmother aunt and their quilting circle get together to make Finn's wedding quilt and share stories of their past and current loves.Some of the acting is quite good I especially liked Gena Rowlands and Anne Bancroft.  Ryder is as usual kind of drippy. A little too cute to be your average Jo it's hard for me to take her seriously.  In any case the women's stories are usually interesting but lack depth.  I'm sure the movie didn't do the original story justice.On the positive side there is the nice use of flashbacks into different times and places and I think this movie was just as much about how men relate to women as it was about women trying to deal with their men.This film also features Winona once again narrating herself a technique that is beginning to wear on my nerves.  All in all I was disappointed by the overall product it was rather like a few intriguing patches being wasted in a pretty but unimaginative quilt.".

All women are schmucks? but just more discreet about it. Marriage is crap? Marriage is about love? i.e. the where love reside them of the quilt.At the end of the day I expect a movie such as this to tell a good story.

'Quilt' couldn't make up its mind what to cut so there is a bit of everything. I felt the movie was on fast forward for the entire time.The message was also a bit muddled. All men are schmucks? All women are schmucks? but just more discreet about it. Marriage is crap? Marriage is about love? i.e. the where love reside them of the quilt.At the end of the day I expect a movie such as this to tell a good story. Stories like real life don't necessarily have clear messages. So putting all the artistic crap aside this movie had a nice little story and it was a decent way to spend a few hours.";

Let me preface this by saying that it isn't that this film doesn't have a high powered cast of fine actresses. It does. It's not that the direction isn't completely competent and appropriate for this sort of sentimental subject matter. It is. My complaint about HTMAAQ is its total embrasure of traditional gender roles and the message it sends to young women.Basically smart and sexy but confused young Finn the alwaysappealing Ryder has a decision to make Does she finish her Ph.D and enter the world of academia or marry her nicebutslightlychauvinistic longtime boyfriend who is VERY anxious for the baby action to begin? Well this is a Hollywood picture made during one of our most conservative decades so don't you just know what that decision will be?Finn spends the summer listening to the narratives of her grandmother's little coffee klatch. These stories mostly involve how their lives were made better by men even the really nasty ones marriage even the unhappy ones and of course childbirth. These yentas manipulate our Finn something fierce and when a huge wind from nowhere or is it God? blows the pages of her dissertation all over town Finn sets out and finds...her devoted man just awaitin' for her. At movie's end Finn presumably decides it's time to fergit all about that there professorin' settle down and have some babies.The problem with this film is obvious. It sends the strong message that women depend on men for their personal growth and very selfdefinition and hints strongly at that oldest of lies the inherent superiority of fulltimewifeandmommyhood. In all HTMAAQ is romantically filmed well acted and doesn't require a lot of critical thinking. Pat Robertson couldn't have come up with a better infomercial for our culture's barefoot and pregnant ideal for women. I give it my Golden Barbie Award for gender stereotypes and utter vapidity. Avoid this one unless you're doing a term paper on sexism in popular culture.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was stunned at what this film did to me. An absolutely brilliant display of psychological horror. Alan Parker made the scariest film of the eighties maybe the scariest film of the second half of the century with this picture. The hell with Psycho Angel Heart is where it's at if you want horror.I don't know how Parker hasn't become the Hitchcock of his generation after this film. I know some of his other work  Evita and Mississippi Burning are two films of his that I happen to think are pretty good. But they're nothing like this. What Parker does so well here what he seems to get better than any other director I've noticed since this film was made is how atmosphere makes a movie. He has a real sense of place and time that's a key component to making the terror of this movie real.Aside from Parker's talents there are three performances without which the movie just wouldn't work.Robert de Niro gives the second best performance of his career here right next to Raging Bull and even that's pretty close. I'm not even normally a huge fan of de Niro's  I mean don't get me wrong he's a legend but I find most of the time that I'm less impressed with him than most people are. Not here. In this movie de Niro makes the simple act of eating an egg into a treatise on mortal dread. He should have received the Oscar for this performance no question about it.Lisa Bonet  what happened to her? Every couple of years I'll see her in something like this or High Fidelity and she's got all this charisma  she really is a superb actress. What she does here is really interesting because you can see that it's very underdone a lot of subtlety. Which is a strange way to go if you're playing a voodoo priestess. But she's very vulnerable here. I think it's a shame she didn't become the star she could have. I'd love to see more work from her.Mickey Rourke is another resident of the Where are they now? file. I've heard more from him recently though. He's been making a comeback of sorts. He's actually the primary reason I rented this movie because I saw him in Sean Penn's The Pledge and wanted to see more of his stuff. He's the third performance that makes this movie complete and he's the one who really has the hardest job who has to strap it to his back and get it across the finish line. His is also the most important job because he needs to instill the terror in you. It's through his eyes that you witness these bizarre events and it's his reaction that makes it all the more terrifying.Again brilliant. Can't say enough about it. The last thirty seconds or so kind of sucks those of you who've seen it know what I'm referring to but I can just turn it off before that. Oddly it doesn't ruin what's come before.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was stunned at what this film did to me. An absolutely brilliant display of psychological horror. Alan Parker made the scariest film of the eighties maybe the scariest film of the second half of the century with this picture. The hell with Psycho Angel Heart is where it's at if you want horror.I don't know how Parker hasn't become the Hitchcock of his generation after this film. I know some of his other work  Evita and Mississippi Burning are two films of his that I happen to think are pretty good. But they're nothing like this. What Parker does so well here what he seems to get better than any other director I've noticed since this film was made is how atmosphere makes a movie. He has a real sense of place and time that's a key component to making the terror of this movie real.Aside from Parker's talents there are three performances without which the movie just wouldn't work.Robert de Niro gives the second best performance of his career here right next to Raging Bull and even that's pretty close. I'm not even normally a huge fan of de Niro's  I mean don't get me wrong he's a legend but I find most of the time that I'm less impressed with him than most people are. Not here. In this movie de Niro makes the simple act of eating an egg into a treatise on mortal dread. He should have received the Oscar for this performance no question about it.Lisa Bonet  what happened to her? Every couple of years I'll see her in something like this or High Fidelity and she's got all this charisma  she really is a superb actress. What she does here is really interesting because you can see that it's very underdone a lot of subtlety. Which is a strange way to go if you're playing a voodoo priestess. But she's very vulnerable here. I think it's a shame she didn't become the star she could have. I'd love to see more work from her.Mickey Rourke is another resident of the Where are they now? file.

Cyphre assigns Angel the task to find a guy named Johnny Favorite who has disappeared with whom he has unsettled debts. The task is much harder than it first looks however as Angel bumps into several murders in the process and as if that were not enough the quest makes him realize some very unpleasant truths about himself and Mr. Cyphre.As noted before both Rourke and De Niro are excellent in their roles a high mark goes for the rest of the cast as well with Lisa Bonnet standing out as charming and apocryphal Epiphany Proudfoot.

Alan Parker's Angel Heart' is one of the chosen few! Complex and confusing at times but warmly recommended to fans of the occult and mysterious cinema. Mickey Rourke shines as protagonist Harry Angel. An unshaved chainsmoking private eye with a chickenphobia! The year is 1955 and the place is Brooklyn when Harry is hired by a malevolent Mr. Louis Cyphre pronounce this name aloud a few times in a row to find a missing crooner who got severely traumatized in the war. The money is good and the job doesn't seem that risky so Harry accepts. Pretty soon the search takes him to all kinds of poverty human misery superstition and alternate religions. Every important figure in the search for Johnny Favorite the crooner finds a violent death after Harry talked to them and apparently our private detective is a lot more involved than he initially thought. As mentioned before Angel Heart is a darn complex and very coherent film. One viewing is enough to understand the entire premise and main storylines but a second third or fourth viewing sure isn't redundant. It would be a shame if any of the carefully worked out details and characterconnections would go unnoticed. Angel Heart' and especially cinematographer Michael Seresin also receives a huge plus for the dark and depressing portrayal of the film's surrounding. Angel Heart looks unattractive vile and ominous which creates a superb horrific atmosphere. The supernatural aspects about the story are a bit overly stressed by clichs like silent and staring nuns or foggy New York suburbs. But this small negative element is largely made up by the subtle violence and compelling mystery this film features. The acting is outstanding with Rourke at the absolute top of his career. During the second half of the 80's Mickey was the unforgettable star of several brilliant films such as Barfly' Year of the Dragon' Nine  Weeks' and of course this Angel Heart'. Robert DeNiro as Louis Cyphre was a downright brilliant casting idea! There isn't that much De Niro content in this film but when he's on screen evilness nearly drips from the screen. Bobby De Niro is probably one of the only actors who can make it look eerie to eat an egg! Lisa Bonet in conclusion isn't the world's most talented actress but Angel Heart sure is her best film. All in one Angel Heart is a very good film that'll be appreciated by thriller fans and the admirer of slightly more intelligent horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the problems with the story of Faust the man in the German legend who sold his soul to the Devil is that we never understood why anyone would make such a foolish bargain in the first place. A few decades of wealth power fame and sex in exchange for an eternity of suffering the fires of Hell? Evil may be fascinating but stupidity never is and we quickly lose interest in the fate of anyone dumb enough to do that. The story fares much better when understood in the allegorical sense of course but it is always better if a story makes sense literally if it is to have much value figuratively.This movie solves that problem. Johnny Liebling is a crooner who thinks he knows a way to trick Satan. He makes a pact with him in which Satan gets Johnny's soul in exchange for fame as a singer under the name Johnny Favourite. Having made the deal and benefited from it he then performs a ritual that involves cutting the heart out of a soldier and eating it. By so doing Johnny is able to substitute the soldier's soul for his own the result being that the soldier's soul will have to suffer the fires of Hell while Johnny's soul does not. The soldier's name is Harold Angel suggesting his innocence of course. As part of the ritual the soldier's dog tags are sealed up in vase. Only if Johnny himself opens the vase will the ritual be undone. Because Satan wants Johnny's soul and not Angel's he must trick Johnny into breaking open the vase.When World War II breaks out Johnny is drafted and subsequently suffers an injury which causes him to have amnesia. He spends some time in a hospital but his friends get him out. Not knowing what to do with him they simply drop him off in a crowd of people on New Year's Eve. As a result of Johnny's confused memory about swapping souls with Harold Angel he comes to believe that he is Harold Angel and eventually starts working as a private detective under that name.Ten years after the war which is when the movie starts this Harold Angel is hired by Louis Cyphre Lucifer to find Johnny Favourite. Angel does not realize it but he has been hired by the Devil to find himself. We do not realize it either at this point and we are encouraged by the movie to like Angel and to identify with him. He seems to be basically a nice guy. As he starts investigating he begins experiencing disturbing images from the past. Little by little he begins to suspect the truth. He is horrified at the idea that he might be Johnny Favourite and having come to like him and identify with him we are horrified too.In his desperation to assure himself that he is who he thinks he is he breaks open the vase and the dog tags of the real Harold Angel fall out. The spell is broken. At this point Louis Cyphre appears announcing that Johnny's soul now belongs to him. Finally recent memories that Johnny had distorted are replaced by accurate ones and he is forced into the realization that he has murdered several people.Because Johnny thought he had a way to trick the Devil this story works on a literal plane. And by making us like him as Harold Angel and identify with him the movie forces us to realize that we too may not be as good as we like to think we are that we too have something inside us that is evil.But a remark made by Louis Cyphre gives this Faustian story a new twist. Cyphre says that Johnny was doomed the minute he cut that boy's heart out. In other words all that dabbling in black magic and making a pact with the Devil was just so much hocuspocus. In itself it was harmless nonsense and Johnny would never have gone to Hell for that. It was only when he did something truly evil when he murdered that soldier that Johnny was damned. By this remark Cyphre links the literal understanding of this story with its allegorical one.".

The film is a bit difficult not in that it's hard to understand the plot but that there are so many details to sort through. You must pay attention to make sense of all the names mentioned the flashbacks the twists and a tricky backstory that is given to us piece by piece. That said when all the things come together it does work well for the most part. Alan Parker's direction is both subtle and sharp and he really does a fine job capturing the noirtype mood. He's also able to bring the 50's era to life without going overboard or relishing in it he just simply shows it. The slushy New York locations contrasted with rainy humid New Orleans suit the story very well the change in climate being a reflection upon Harry's own comprehension and indeed fate as does the bluesyjazzy soundtrack. And that pounding heartbeat really helped to turn the tension levels up. Mickey Rourke is excellent as Harry. He's got just the right amount of New York accent and brings true emotions to his character formidable frightened or distraught he performs realistically. Now Robert De Niro it's just a pleasure watching him as a sly Satan! His mannerisms from a slight grin to a menacing glance to eating an egg are wonderful. I've read some negative remarks about Lisa Bonet's acting in the film but I thought she did just fine with her role as did the rest of the cast.So aside from the sometimes confusing plot points I thought Angel Heart was a very good horror mystery and holds up well for being nearly 20 years old. I really do enjoy storydriven films dealing with such subject matter and was not disappointed with the one in Angel Heart.".

The film's ending just gives me the creeps because it just comes at you from out of no where and there is nothing that hints it.

	schema:reviewBody "I have often said that horror is the most difficult to master.  I believe this to be true because although it seems any moron with a camera can stalk a would be victim and try to psyche the audience out by shaking a few trees then flagitiously embellish the film with blood instead of atmosphere true fear is difficult to capture on film.  I think we have all seen films that lay it on pretty thick but ultimately fail.  I truly believe you can hire someone to make a dummy and stuff it with blood and even some rudimentary designs of intestines and hearts and various other functioning organs that have the ability to make the squeamish cover their eyes.  But if you remember some of the greats some of the icons of the trade you will see that a good horror film is more about minacious shadows the vicissitudes of lights the ominous and foreboding music and finally the brilliant sagaciousness of the story.  I think many people overlook the relevance of a story in the horror movie genre.  Many inferior films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Idle Hands and such will present us with a halfassed story and then try to build on it by bombastically insulting us with the banalities of gore and other not so shocking elements.  But what they forget is most horror films that either succeed or develop a cult following are films that somewhere along the way hit a nerve in the collective mindset of their viewers.  Friday the 13th's attack the very foundation of one of adolescent's unadulterated joys that being camping.  Halloween invaded our trick or treaters and Nightmare On Elm Street surreptitiously alienated our dreams.  In short we were not safe from these abominations on any front. Angel Heart follows that trend.Spoilers Ahead... if you have not seen this film do not read from here on out.The basic premise of Angel Heart is a detective story at heart.  This is a 40's style film noir complete with rain soaked streets seedy detectives and lots of questionable characters.  We meet Harry Angel  Roarke as he is taking a phone call from a stranger.  This stranger is from the law firm Winesap and MacIntosh  any similarities here?  think about it.  They would like to meet with him as they have a client that is familiar with his work. The client's name is Monsieur Louis Cypher.Is your client foreign?  Is he a foreign gentleman?Harry then travels to a church  strange enough place to meet a client who wants to hire a detective where he enters the room and is first greeted by Winesap who looks a lot like Stephen Tobolwolski and then he sees his client.  But what we see first is long perfectly manicured finger nails a strange cane a ring that has either the star of David in the middle of it or a strange cult like pointed symbol you decide.  Also the client's hair is put up in a bun and the man dressed impeccably.  The man does not rise to shake Harry's hand.  But he smiles with a diabolical factitious grin that seems warm and inviting but reeks with deceit.Harry then gets the facts of the case and is told that he will be searching for a crooner that owed Louis some money but disappeared during the war. So in essence all Louis wants from Harry is to find out if this crooner is alive or dead.  Cypher offers him a lot of money to find the guy and so Harry accepts.You must want this guy pretty bad Harry says with a chuckle.I don't like messy accounts Cypher replies deadseriously.And then just before the meeting concludes Louis says to HarryI've got a funny feeling we've met before.  Harry has no recollection of ever meeting the man and he would remember seeing how Cypher sticks out like a sore thumb.From here Harry goes on a labyrinthine journey to find out what happened to this crooner.  It takes him from Coney Island to New Orleans.  And along the way dead bodies begin to show up.  First he interviews a doctor that had something to do with the case.  He shows up dead in the next scene.  Next we see an old guitar player named Toot Sweet and then he shows up dead strangled with a part of the body meant for pissing with.  Now Harry is a suspect in two murders and it just keeps getting worse.Every 20 minutes Louis Cypher shows up to check on his progress.  And every time he does more strange religion seems to get introduced to the plot. This French gentleman is obviously a fanatical devout religious iconoclast.  He is not just seeking this missing person for personal accounts it seems more like a reckoning.  And the further Harry gets into the mystery the more liable he is to be implicated in things that he had nothing to do with.  To make matters worse Cypher tells him that he has old fashioned and bucolic ideas about justice You know an eye for an eye that sort of thing.  Finally Harry in desperation asks him in one of their sittings Who the  are you Cypher?  Cypher's reply Watch your language this is a church.By now the film has us both intrigued with it's eccentric and neurotic characters and confused in some ways by the abstruse manner in which the story is unfolding.  This apparent confusion is by design because this film takes pride in laying the foundation out for us but not the glue.  We have to use our heads to figure things out and that is rare in many films especially the horror genre.  That may sound contradictory to what we are all lead to believe about most horror but it is true.  Horror true horror has gone the way of the dodo bird.  It is all but extinct.  Angel Heart however is more of a heterodoxy than one might think.  It takes all that is good with the genre and makes it even better.  Every scene in this film seems to quietly show us another piece to the puzzle.  Every twist and turn seems to unravel the story like the layers of an onion.  Without giving away the plot and the secrets to the film here are a few scenes to digest and think about.Take for instance the not so subliminal use fans in the film.  Every time Louis Cypher is in the room fans are first shown.  This is relevant in some scenes because of the heat but what about on a cold blustery day in the Bronx?Also examine some of the intriguing lines that slither out of DeNiro's mouth.  Lines like They say there is just enough religion in the world to make man hate one another but not enough to make them love. Or Would you like an egg Mr. Angel?  After Harry says no Cypher replies you know they say the egg represents the soul.  He then bites into the egg and chews it with perfect equanimity.  You can never tell if Cypher is mad or satisfied.  All we know is this man is here to find a missing person. Some of the time he cracks a smile but what he is really smiling about is just somewhere underneath the surface.There are also a few times when Harry catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror but he sees two images of himself the mirror is cracked or split or mangled in some way.  And he always looks pensive and confused when he looks into the mirror as though he sees something.... but then forgets it.We are also privy to scenes that are ripe with contradictions.  Bullets are stored in a Bible a nun is cleaning blood off the wall a priest wants to drive in a Rolls Royce a heart is cut out almost like a butcher did it and took pride in his work and a few other images that confuse yet enlighten you at the same time.  Angel Heart is the true working of a paradox in progress.The climax of Angel Heart is one that will have you shell shocked.  I wasn't prepared for it when I saw this film as a 17 yearold and even now when I am pushing 30 and have seen the film over 100 times I am still in awe when I watch Harry and Louis banter about as Louis tells him of his ultimate fate.Alas.  How terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise Johnny.My name's not Johnny.I know who I am.  Cypher I know who I am!When all is about to be revealed Louis tells Johnny to take a good look in the mirror because no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror you reflection always looks you straight in the eye.  And when he does all that we didn't know but may have suspected is now revealed to us.Angel Heart is not the type of horror film that will scare you every five minutes with ghosts that bounce balls down stairs or with pumpkin candles that flicker coyly enough to see a shadow float across the ceiling.  But what it will do is turn your insides upside down with the promise that something pernicious and final is about to take place.  Angel Heart is opulent with undertones of doom and sumptuous with forbidden overtones. Just as Blair Witch attacked us with what could be there Angel Heart admonishes us to stay away from things that should not be there.  Harry Angel has entered into an inchoate project and it is one that he will wish he never sought out in the first place.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and along with Halloween and Jaws not only does this film rank highly on the horror charts it cross polinates into the top films ever made.  I am not sure where I would put this film because to compare a film like JFK and Raiders of the Lost Ark with an atmospheric spine tingling film like this is like comparing a top of the line BMW to a top of the line Jaguar.  Where do you start and how do you stipulate which is better.  All I know is that this film made me fear what it warns us about.  And it made me interested to read the Bible again. That has to count for something.  After all the Bible is filled with stories of fire brimstone people turning to stone and burning bushes and deceit and betrayal.  Sounds like fun doesn't it?10 out of 10 This is the epitome of horror and if you have not seen this film I urge you to find it and watch it this weekend.  Mickey Roarke and Robert Deniro are priceless and keep in mind this is brought to you by the same team that gave us films like T2 First Blood and Basic Instinct. This was a different kind of film for Kassar and Vajna and I am thankful they decided to take a chance on a dark film like this.  Add Alan Parker to this brilliant behind the scenes team and you have all the ingredients for one hell of a ride.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have often said that horror is the most difficult to master.  I believe this to be true because although it seems any moron with a camera can stalk a would be victim and try to psyche the audience out by shaking a few trees then flagitiously embellish the film with blood instead of atmosphere true fear is difficult to capture on film.  I think we have all seen films that lay it on pretty thick but ultimately fail.  I truly believe you can hire someone to make a dummy and stuff it with blood and even some rudimentary designs of intestines and hearts and various other functioning organs that have the ability to make the squeamish cover their eyes.  But if you remember some of the greats some of the icons of the trade you will see that a good horror film is more about minacious shadows the vicissitudes of lights the ominous and foreboding music and finally the brilliant sagaciousness of the story.  I think many people overlook the relevance of a story in the horror movie genre.  Many inferior films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Idle Hands and such will present us with a halfassed story and then try to build on it by bombastically insulting us with the banalities of gore and other not so shocking elements.  But what they forget is most horror films that either succeed or develop a cult following are films that somewhere along the way hit a nerve in the collective mindset of their viewers.  Friday the 13th's attack the very foundation of one of adolescent's unadulterated joys that being camping.  Halloween invaded our trick or treaters and Nightmare On Elm Street surreptitiously alienated our dreams.  In short we were not safe from these abominations on any front. Angel Heart follows that trend.Spoilers Ahead... if you have not seen this film do not read from here on out.The basic premise of Angel Heart is a detective story at heart.  This is a 40's style film noir complete with rain soaked streets seedy detectives and lots of questionable characters.  We meet Harry Angel  Roarke as he is taking a phone call from a stranger.  This stranger is from the law firm Winesap and MacIntosh  any similarities here?  think about it.  They would like to meet with him as they have a client that is familiar with his work. The client's name is Monsieur Louis Cypher.Is your client foreign?  Is he a foreign gentleman?Harry then travels to a church  strange enough place to meet a client who wants to hire a detective where he enters the room and is first greeted by Winesap who looks a lot like Stephen Tobolwolski and then he sees his client.  But what we see first is long perfectly manicured finger nails a strange cane a ring that has either the star of David in the middle of it or a strange cult like pointed symbol you decide.  Also the client's hair is put up in a bun and the man dressed impeccably.  The man does not rise to shake Harry's hand.  But he smiles with a diabolical factitious grin that seems warm and inviting but reeks with deceit.Harry then gets the facts of the case and is told that he will be searching for a crooner that owed Louis some money but disappeared during the war. So in essence all Louis wants from Harry is to find out if this crooner is alive or dead.  Cypher offers him a lot of money to find the guy and so Harry accepts.You must want this guy pretty bad Harry says with a chuckle.I don't like messy accounts Cypher replies deadseriously.And then just before the meeting concludes Louis says to HarryI've got a funny feeling we've met before.  Harry has no recollection of ever meeting the man and he would remember seeing how Cypher sticks out like a sore thumb.From here Harry goes on a labyrinthine journey to find out what happened to this crooner.  It takes him from Coney Island to New Orleans.  And along the way dead bodies begin to show up.  First he interviews a doctor that had something to do with the case.  He shows up dead in the next scene.  Next we see an old guitar player named Toot Sweet and then he shows up dead strangled with a part of the body meant for pissing with.  Now Harry is a suspect in two murders and it just keeps getting worse.Every 20 minutes Louis Cypher shows up to check on his progress.  And every time he does more strange religion seems to get introduced to the plot. This French gentleman is obviously a fanatical devout religious iconoclast.  He is not just seeking this missing person for personal accounts it seems more like a reckoning.  And the further Harry gets into the mystery the more liable he is to be implicated in things that he had nothing to do with.  To make matters worse Cypher tells him that he has old fashioned and bucolic ideas about justice You know an eye for an eye that sort of thing.  Finally Harry in desperation asks him in one of their sittings Who the  are you Cypher?  Cypher's reply Watch your language this is a church.By now the film has us both intrigued with it's eccentric and neurotic characters and confused in some ways by the abstruse manner in which the story is unfolding.  This apparent confusion is by design because this film takes pride in laying the foundation out for us but not the glue.  We have to use our heads to figure things out and that is rare in many films especially the horror genre.  That may sound contradictory to what we are all lead to believe about most horror but it is true.  Horror true horror has gone the way of the dodo bird.  It is all but extinct.  Angel Heart however is more of a heterodoxy than one might think.  It takes all that is good with the genre and makes it even better.  Every scene in this film seems to quietly show us another piece to the puzzle.  Every twist and turn seems to unravel the story like the layers of an onion.

I hadn't seen it in years and stumbled across it one afternoon.I was stunned as I was completely drawn into the world of Detective Harry Angel and sat mesmerized for the next two hours until the film's stunning conclusion left me breathless even though I knew what was coming.This is not a simple movie but the simple plot line is that a hard nosed private eye gets in too deep when hired by a mysterious client to find a missing person. What follows is a complex twisted tale of morality secrets and the fact that you can never outrun your past no matter how hard you try. For those of you who only know Mickey Rourke as the hulking ruin you saw in Sin City you really need to see this film. Rourke was at his prime here and gives a performance that is both believable and shattering. It is a portrait of a man who knows he is losing his hold on everything that he knows to be true but is unable to stop going down the road that he senses will lead him to oblivion.The first time I saw this movie I was a teenager and thought the movie was too slowly paced. Now with a more mature set of eyes I think the pacing is perfect. Languidly allowing the viewer to be steeped in the humid foreign atmosphere of a sultry Louisiana.The cinematography is fantastic with every detail authentic down to the fact that people didn't wear antiperspirant back then I absolutely believed in the world that Harry found himself being trapped by and the horror kept growing as every new detail was slowly brought to light.This is a film that demands to be seen at least twice. I have watched it twice more since that afternoon and I am still finding new details that I had not noticed before. Be warned it is intense but it is an unforgettable classic film.".

Always one step away from trouble Harry takes a new case from a rather sinister fellow named Louis Cyphre DeNiro. It seems that a singer named Johnny Favorite owes Mr. Cyphre a debt that he is to collect upon Favorite's death and it becomes Angels' job to find him and determine his status. When all roads lead to mysteries involving the occult and voodoo Harry will have to uncover a terrible truth and the cost could be his immortal soul.Acting The acting is superb as each actor brings some really great nuances to their characters. Little scenes in this film seem to be made huge with these little additions. Like the scene where Angel meets Cyphre and DeNiro is rolling the hardboiled eggs and Rourke counters the menace by tossing a pinch of salt over his lest shoulder. These are the little things that make performances priceless and enduring.Direction  Writing  Expertly written and directed by Parker every frame of Angel Heart seems to have an inherent grunginess that becomes more menacing as the film progresses. Beautifully setup scenes do at times seem to have such a textured darkness that the darkness itself seems like a character that threatens to envelope all the characters. Technical The technical aspects of Angel Heart don't disappoint either. Trevor Jones musical score runs a gamut of emotion and feeling.

	onyx:emotionText "Title Angel Heart 1987Rating     12Version Reviewed  Lions Gate NTSC  Region 1 Video Anamorphic Widescreen 1.851 Audio English dd 5.1 Running Time 15250 Rating RDirector Alan Parker Pink Floyd The Wall  Fame Writer Alan Parker Mississippi Burning  Evita  The Commitments Music Trevor Jones From Hell  Dark City  Labyrinth Photography Michael Seresin Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  Birdy Editor Gerry Hambling Pink Floyd The Wall  FameStarring Mickey Rourke Fade to Black  9  Weeks Robert De Niro Godsend  Jackie Brown  Mary Shelley's Frankenstein Lisa Bonet High Fidelity  Bank Robber  Enemy of the State Charlotte Rampling Swimming Pool  Orca Stocker Fontelieu Mandingo Brownie McGhee The JerkSynopsis  Harry Angel Rourke is a rather ragtag and rough and tumble private detective. Always one step away from trouble Harry takes a new case from a rather sinister fellow named Louis Cyphre DeNiro. It seems that a singer named Johnny Favorite owes Mr. Cyphre a debt that he is to collect upon Favorite's death and it becomes Angels' job to find him and determine his status. When all roads lead to mysteries involving the occult and voodoo Harry will have to uncover a terrible truth and the cost could be his immortal soul.Acting The acting is superb as each actor brings some really great nuances to their characters. Little scenes in this film seem to be made huge with these little additions. Like the scene where Angel meets Cyphre and DeNiro is rolling the hardboiled eggs and Rourke counters the menace by tossing a pinch of salt over his lest shoulder. These are the little things that make performances priceless and enduring.Direction  Writing  Expertly written and directed by Parker every frame of Angel Heart seems to have an inherent grunginess that becomes more menacing as the film progresses. Beautifully setup scenes do at times seem to have such a textured darkness that the darkness itself seems like a character that threatens to envelope all the characters. Technical The technical aspects of Angel Heart don't disappoint either. Trevor Jones musical score runs a gamut of emotion and feeling. Menace longing jubilant jazzy and erotic overtones make for one of his best scores and he has made several. The editing is top notch too every scene seems to wield yet another piece of the puzzle and is presented very well.

Indeed stupidity is not only hilariously rampant it's inherently heredity as all of Spengo's Inhabitants are idiots as well. The emperor takes Marge Nelson hostage and plans to marry her while Dick Nelson escapes and joins a group of rebels led by Raff's son Sirk Dwier Brown who seek to overthrow the monarch. To do this they enlist the Earthman's help. Upon learning the Rebels are incredible stupid he nevertheless decides to help them with words of encouragement such as  OK. So you're Idiots they're Idiots too. Just because you're stupid doesn't mean you can't run a planet. Hey! Come to Earth sometime. Along with varied group of Fish and dog people a general named Afir Thalmus Rasulala and a prisoner called King Raff Eric Idle Mom and Dad have their work cut out. From beginning to end this movie is playfully exciting and contiguously funny. So much so it easily earns the title of comedy Classic. Highly Recommended. ".

Director Greg Beeman working from a blithely inane and goodnatured script by Chris Matheson and Ed Soloman pitches the cheerfully dippy humor at an appropriately broad pitch and maintains an infectiously lighthearted tone throughout. The humor is essentially Monty Python meets Dr. Seuss with several inspired moments of surreal silliness the cute killer mushrooms and the gag about the deadly light grenade are especially sidesplitting. The cast have a field day with the divinely asinine material Garr and Jones make for appealing leads their bickering scenes in particular are hilarious Lovitz is an absolute riot as the hopelessly stupid and arrogant Tod Thalmus Rasulala contributes a winning turn as General Afir Kathy Ireland looks positively delectable in her skimpy outfit as Semage and there are nice bits by Eric Idle as the absentminded King Raff and Wallace Shawn as meek torturer Sibor. Tony Gardner supplies a bunch of funky creatures the fish ladies and bulldog men are simply adorable.

The story revolves around various loveadulterinesexy affairs with an array of extremely comic situations. The brilliant dialogue is written with outstanding care. Much fun is based on a goodnatured satire of the French cultural fashionmania of that epoch Existentialism leftist rive gauche ideology Sartre Juliette Greco and so on. The cinematography is excellent even too much for this sort of lightminded film. In fact it seems to be an amiable mocking of the nouvelle vague style another cultural icon of the early 1960s.The audience is gratified with the dazzling beauty of 21yearsold Catherine Deneuve at the start of her career in a minor but remarkably sexy role. The whole cast makes an outstanding job. JeanClaude Brialy and Claude Rich are wonderful. A young soontobesuperstar Jean Paul Belmondo is excellent in his trademark role of the nice rascal. Look at the nod he makes to invite the aged rich woman to sit down at his table in the Greek tavern how could a guy be nicer than Belmondo?The first part of the film is perhaps the funniest with a sequence of weird flashbacks to introduce the characters. But the second part is made precious by the presence of sweet Francoise Dorleac. I have a very soft eye for that poor girl. She has not the perfect beauty of her sister Catherine Deneuve but in my opinion she is one of the most appealing women to have graced the screen. There she is beautiful nice and keen charming sweet lovely incredibly attractive and sexy look at her eyes! and so much talented really a borntoact girl. It is heartbreaking to see Francoise on the screen always on the verge of falling in love with her... meanwhile knowing that she was killed in a terrible car accident at age twentyfive.Well that is La chasse a l'homme a little masterpiece plus the jewel Francoise Dorleac.".

Catherine Denueve Marie Laforet and Francoise Dorleac are some of the girls. Dorleac is extremely good here she has never been better. Her death is truly a loss for us all. Everyone gives a great performance no face is wasted as directed by Edouard Molinaro who later directed La Cage Aux Folles who has a very good eye for comedy. Male Hunt is at times brilliant. The opening sequence is breathtaking. Cinematography is by Adreas Winding. Definitely a plus for Molinaro nearly as funny as La Cage Aux Folles more than a decade before.

	schema:reviewBody "This is what I would call a goodbad film. Let me explain on the one hand La Chasse  l'homme Male Hunt is a pretty good comedy witty with dialogues by Michel Audiard that says it all wellmade by the always competent Edouard Molinaro and played by an impressive bunch of great actors many of whom are the children of the French New wave. It is fun and lighthearted. Plus there are beautiful Greek locations and the rhythm is good. The question can be asked then  what more do you want ?Well it seems to me that for a work of art to be worthwhile it must rest on sound bases and this is the more I missed to make me enjoy this otherwise good quality product to the full. For if the form of La chasse  l'homme is satisfying that is not the case with its substance. Blame it on its awfully misogynist tone which makes adhering to the story and the characters difficult. And whose fault is it? Believe it or not ... a woman's ! For the scriptwriter is none other than France Roche better known as a journalist. A woman lashing out at creatures of the same sex that may seem paradoxical at first sight but this is hardly the first time a girl has shown herself on par with the fiercest macho female bashers. Even worse maybe also because the writer is a woman men are not spared either. Which results in an ultra cynical apologue whose moral can be summed up as follows women and men all despise each other but all women invariably manipulate all men into marrying them however macho and bigmouthed they may be. Sorry Miss Roche but all that is a bit brief don't you think?Luckily Edouard Molinaro will pursue the malefemale relationships issue in a less cynical more inspired way. Filmed two decades later L'Amour en douce is an exquisitely delicate romantic comedy this time reflecting the director's true colors.Of course La Chasse  l'homme being an unpretentious movie the viewer can easily set aside all the considerations above and just have fun. After all it is a film that can boast amusing finds a hunting party in which the hunters are women and the game three barechested men a parody of French gangster films in the Belmondo episode the same scenes seen differently through the subjectivity of the three main characters .... One can also admire Molinaro's technical mastery  it is a known fact that he always gives close attention to the movie he makes even when they are just commercial. In the present case he resorts to all kinds of devices upward and low angle shots picturein picture speed up editing silent scenes with voice over spoken ones with subtitles so as to make La Chasse  l'homme something other than the bomb it would have been in more careless hands. And of course there are the actors. The stellar cast is justification alone to watch it. It would be too long and selfevident to sing in detail the praises of Belmondo Brialy Claude Rich Franoise Dorlac Catherine Deneuve Blier Francis Blanche and there are some I am forgetting but Marie Lafort is an absolute scream as Gisle Antoine's languid depressive and poetic rich fiance.It will then be for you to decide whether La Chasse  l'homme is a good film it does have entertaining virtues or a bad one for being hollow and overcynical or else to join my club and find it like me a goodbad film.".

It would be too long and selfevident to sing in detail the praises of Belmondo Brialy Claude Rich Franoise Dorlac Catherine Deneuve Blier Francis Blanche and there are some I am forgetting but Marie Lafort is an absolute scream as Gisle Antoine's languid depressive and poetic rich fiance.It will then be for you to decide whether La Chasse  l'homme is a good film it does have entertaining virtues or a bad one for being hollow and overcynical or else to join my club and find it like me a goodbad film.";

Male Hunt may be not as famous but it is nevertheless a watchable movie in spite of a monotonous script you get very quickly the idea that women are all manipulative little temptresses.

And there is Francis Blanche who is as usually a riot as a Greek! detective!!. Bernard Blier is also hilarious as Catherine Deneuve's father. The other strength of the movie is its brilliant dialogs. Michel Audiard had apparently a lot of fun when he wrote sparkling lines that equal almost Sacha Guitry in his best plays. Then Molinaro wrapped the whole thing up in a flashy cinematic style with scenes caught from oblique angles images within frames chases  la Mack Sennett....A young idle bachelor JeanClaude Brialy aims to get married. His best friend Claude Rich thinks he is daft and desperately diligently persuades him to give up the reckless idea telling him horrible marriage stories. But on a breakaway cruise of the Greek islands our chap meets a predatory young woman Franoise Dorlac whose intentions are much more deceptive and whose aim more sure than those of any of the girls he has met...OK this movie is not likely to stick in your head for 10 minutes after you've seen it but you might give it a try.".

However it is neat to see almost anything that in trying to be so new and modern at the time it was filmed that has now become so dated as to be a time capsule. The film is like a slice of modern life for the time and so is to todays eyes quite a farce indeed.If remade now with all the trappings for the world we live in it would i'm sure be very well received as a weekly sitcom on T.V. There is a youthful perspective on the impermanence of love. Joie de vivre rules the day and night in multiple locations and combinations of several couples. The little bar that plays a main role reminds me very much of the one in Amelie. In the end everyone seems happy enough for the time being I suppose.".

They decide it's best to shut down all ops and make sure make everyone involved disappears. They try to take out Aaron Cross who is part of another op called Outcome but he manages to survive.

	schema:reviewBody "Questionable follow up to the Bourne trilogy that has the right pieces in place but lacks the conviction to justify its existence. Taking place almost at the same time of the climax of the third Bourne film Ultimatum this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of Operation Blackbriar and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. Outcome the program in question is an offshoot of both Treadstone and Blackbriar but with a huge difference they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them. In order for me to tell you what is good about this movie I have to explain what is wrong with it and that is the fact that you get the feeling fifteen minutes into the film that there is no reason for it to exist. The last film Bourne Ultimatum pretty much closed the book on the series with little to no wiggle room for an encore. This movie feels like a studio trying to milk dried what was good from the original trilogy in order to make more sequels. The bad part is that they did it in the most unbelievable way so much so that you really need to forget what you saw in the last three films in order to believe what was going on in this movie. Tony Gilroy Who wrote the first three movies directs and writes this one but falls flat on his face with halfhearted explanations that try to justify this movie's existence. Not to mention the fact that the villain of the movie is a lightweight compared to what came before him plus the glaring fact that Edward Norton's performance as the heavy is pretty much phoned in. He does not have the confidant arrogant swagger that Chris Cooper's character had in the first film nor the desperate menace of that Brain Cox's character brought to the second. Norton's character is more in line with the villain of the third who was played by David Strathaim who has a cameo in this film. However Strathaim's character had a sense of justifiable menace that drove him while Norton's character just seems like a man trying to justify his actions for the greater good making him more of a government shill than a villain. The science fiction angle that comes up is insulting to what the last three films were not to mention the fact that the direction here lacks the kinetic energy that Paul Greengrass brought to the last two movies of the series. Say what you may about the shaky camera work but he knew how to stage a thrilling action piece of pop art. Gilroy's motorcycle chase towards the climax is decent but lacks kinetic spark. He is however very good in staging small intimate moments within this movie but that is more a compliment to the A  cast Mainly his two lead actors than the terrible script that they are forced to working with.Jeremy Renner is a talented actor with serious range and complexity. However the character he plays is not much of a character and the script that he has to work with is riddled with clich after clich. He can do anything a secret agent can do but better but the character is not very compelling or interesting to say the least. Jason Bourne was a compelling character that needed to find himself and through that journey in the original trilogy we saw complexities that were compelling and thoughtful. He was a conflicted man whose drive was dictated by an inner sense of redemption. The character of Aaron Cross is a cartoon character compared to Jason and that is the main problem of the script for this movie. It is though Renner's efforts as an actor that we care about the character of Aaron Cross and that is one of the few bright spots this film has. Renner injects likability and vulnerability to this character and because of it we want him to succeed in beating the bad guy and save the girl but Renner is working with a script that goes against itself and we are left with a half fast story that deals with supermen than a human story about survival. It is through Renner's efforts as an actor that we see humanity and conflict in this character while the script itself does not give that sort of detail and Renner is working overtime to accomplish that. Renner would have done wonders with a compelling character like Jason Bourne unfortunately that is not found with the character of Aaron Cross.Rachel Weisz is one of the most versatile gifted and complex actors working today. An actor's actor in every sense of word but like Renner she does not have much of a character thanks to the clich script they both have to work with. Her character is on the run with Cross through out the film and acts as his doctor and object of protection. It is through Weisz's amazing strength and range as an actor that we are able to witness levels of complexity and humanity in the character of Dr Marta Shearing that we really do not get from the script. Because of that we are not only able to care and identify with her but Weisz actually makes her character more complex and interesting than Aaron Cross himself. You can tell that Weisz was working overtime in achieving that and her efforts pay off ten fold which is a blessing considering that most of the characters outside of her and Renner come across as cardboard cutouts.It is a shame because Renner and Weisz try their best and for the most part succeed despite all odds but they like the fans deserved better.".

	schema:headline " 'Jason Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg.'";
	schema:reviewBody "It is understandable that there is a difference of opinion about THE BOURNE LEGACY but comparing it to the original three Jason Bourne movies is unfair. This is a 'legacy' left by the environment in which Jas Bourne was hatched an as such for this reviewer it works very well. The film is beautifully shot in superb cinematography has a series of tight incidents that demand explanation but which get little due to the fact that this is a spy film about the various intelligence agency and occult secret scientific projects that are always in progress in every country. It is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.As someone distilled the plot 'this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of Operation Blackbriar and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. Outcome the program in question is an offshoot of both Treadstone and Blackbriar but with a huge difference they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them.' Suffice it to say that the new cast handles this very obtuse plot with a high degree of fine acting. Jeremy Renner is excellent always reminding us of his humanity while he flies around in incredibly impossible flight situations. The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. The solid support cast includes the always excellent Edward Norton Scott Glenn Stacy Keach Albert Finney Oscar Isaac David Strathairn and Joan Allen just to keep the balance form the previous Bourne films in place.The speed of the action the poundingly purposeful musical score and the nonstop fascinating twists and turns make this a topnotch film. It does carry on the 'legacy' of Ludlum's ideas but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "It is understandable that there is a difference of opinion about THE BOURNE LEGACY but comparing it to the original three Jason Bourne movies is unfair. This is a 'legacy' left by the environment in which Jas Bourne was hatched an as such for this reviewer it works very well. The film is beautifully shot in superb cinematography has a series of tight incidents that demand explanation but which get little due to the fact that this is a spy film about the various intelligence agency and occult secret scientific projects that are always in progress in every country. It is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.As someone distilled the plot 'this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of Operation Blackbriar and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. Outcome the program in question is an offshoot of both Treadstone and Blackbriar but with a huge difference they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them.' Suffice it to say that the new cast handles this very obtuse plot with a high degree of fine acting. Jeremy Renner is excellent always reminding us of his humanity while he flies around in incredibly impossible flight situations. The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. The solid support cast includes the always excellent Edward Norton Scott Glenn Stacy Keach Albert Finney Oscar Isaac David Strathairn and Joan Allen just to keep the balance form the previous Bourne films in place.The speed of the action the poundingly purposeful musical score and the nonstop fascinating twists and turns make this a topnotch film. It does carry on the 'legacy' of Ludlum's ideas but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals. Grady Harp";

I am one who really liked it. Comparing Legacy to the originals more specifically Ultimatum is like comparing Batman Returns to The Dark Knight. A good movie to a fantastic one. If Legacy was a regular spy movie with no connection to Bourne it would definitely be in higher regard. But as it has the Bourne name associated with it certain things were expected 1. Insane nonstop action. 2. Insane nonstop action. 3. More action.Legacy is extremely dialogue driven. About 34 of this movie is dialogue. And the dialogue is very technical and very scientific and it flies way over some people's heads. The previous Bourne films were not filled with this technical jargon. The performances though are very good. Renner and Weisz are absolutely perfect in their roles. Renner perfectly captures the manhunting super agent with ease. He's a natural action hero and one of my favorite actors. Though Edward Norton is devilishly underused. His character merely sits behind a screen and barks orders. The Verdict When you go into Legacy don't expect insane nonstop action. Yes when the action happens it is really awesome. But this is a dialoguedriven spy movie with lots of highvocabulary dialogue. I really enjoy dialoguedriven films and this film does entertain. A".

	schema:headline " Wonderful performance by Renner and Weisz despite the lack of a coherent storyline and a poorly written script.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Bourne Legacy is the fourth installment of the Bourne franchise and evolves around a new main protagonist Aaron Cross. The story runs parallel with the end of the third Bourne movie and concerns itself with the result of Jason Bourne's exposure of the Blackbriar program. Outcome another government program is trying to cover up themselves by eliminating their agents in order to not get pulled down by the coming scandal set in motion by Jason Bourne's actions. Outcome is an affiliate of Blackbriar and Treadstone with one significant difference however. Their agents are chemically enhanced to be quicker stronger and smarter by ingesting a set of pills. This is where we meet Aaron Cross. Being hunted by his own agency while trying to get the pills he so desperately need. What makes this movie watchable is NOTHING but the performance of the lead actors Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz. Both talented actors with great depth and experience. It is obvious that they are struggling to tap into the emotional vein of their characters and the script taken into consideration it is not strange. Despite this Renner and Weisz manage to pull it off beautifully. This is no doubt due to the undeniable chemistry between the two. Weisz's sensitive and innocent character fits together beautifully with Renner's stoic cold and very charming character. Weisz in particular brings some much needed sensitivity to the movie which otherwise would have been pretty boring to watch. She becomes Cross's object of protection and it is because of her we even care about his attempt to find safety from his assailants. Without her this would have been a movie about a man trying to find medicine. In short I have nothing but respect for these two people and they do a wonderful job despite what would have otherwise been an insult to the series and the genre in general. Regrettably Edward Norton's character as Eric Byer the bad guy hunting for Aaron Cross seems spineless and unnecessary compared to the other two. This makes him annoying and superficial when he's on and you can't help but get the feeling that he shouldn't be there. Compared to Chris Cooper's mysterious and secretive character as Conklin the head of Treadstone from The Bourne Identity Norton seems even more spineless and unnecessary.This is once again more of a critique of the script than of Edward Norton as an actor since we know from for example American History X and Fight Club that Edward Norton can really act. This is the kind of movie where they show every single action sequence in the trailer. As you start watching the movie you're wondering when it's ACTUALLY gonna start and when it does start you're wondering what it's actually about. It's very hard to keep track of and it seems to want to be two things at the same time. It is impossible to watch it without forgetting what you saw in the last three films because it is so far from the original ones. It is like you are in a completely different universe and it lacks the charm mystique and wit that makes a real Bourne movie. Paul Greengrass managed to be innovative without compromising the dark mysterious kindofcharming feel of the first movie. For whatever reason Tony Gilroy has not. The Bourne Legacy is so far from the other three movies that it is hard to believe it's in the same universe. At the same time it is impossible to understand the plot without keeping track of what happened in the original ones. That way it's trying to be two very different things and ends up worming itself into a strange borderland between Knight And Day and Quantum Of Solace which leaves you puzzled to its existence and unconvinced to its plot. The movie does have some pretty decent action sequences with great effects but lacks the storyline motivation drive and intimacy to justify them. They're redundant.Towards the end of the two and a half hour ordeal that this movie really is you find yourself not really caring anymore and just want it to end decently. And then the air goes out of the balloon with a poof. Out of nowhere the movie ends with no conclusion no explanation and no reason whatsoever for it to exist. You're left with a lot more questions than answers and feel unsatisfied with what you've just seen. Perhaps it was due to my high expectations that I couldn't enjoy this movie as much as I wanted but I feel like i've seen enough to know what makes a great movie and distinguish between a good and a bad scripts. It's a real shame because Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton are three of my favorite actors and I think they could have worked miracles with the right script. In short I have nothing but respect for the actors but don't feel like this is worthy of being called a Bourne movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is never just one. We've reached our fourth globetrotting adventure based on the novels of the late Robert Ludlum and the first without former series lead Matt Damon as the enigmatic superspy Jason Bourne. With its name taken from a 2004 installment not actually penned by Ludlum The Bourne Legacy explores the ripple effect of the events that played out in The Bourne Ultimatum. While little could be done to cushion the drop in quality that was bound to come with well anything that followed that nearmasterpiece of action Jeremy Renner makes an apt substitute and the thrills wit and set pieces are all top notch even if it won't quite have audiences asking Jason who? In the mischievous and highly top secret world of clandestine CIA superspy programs the program previously known as Treadstone has once again morphed  from Treadstone to Blackbriar and now to Outcome officially known as Alcom a bioweapons division in New York State that operates under the ruse of a pharmaceutical research firm. It is through this project that Rachel Weisz's Dr. Marta Shearing crosses path with Outcome agent Aaron Cross as her employer's cloakanddagger endeavors supply its agent with viral treatments that boost both physical and mental efficiency. While on a training procedure in Alaska Cross is nearly assassinated by his own people after it's been decided by the powers that be that Jason Bourne's actions in Ultimatum have metastasized beyond repair and all outlying assets must be eliminated including Dr. Shearing and her peers. Going on the run is one thing for Cross but now without the pills he has been taking to keep himself stimulated he faces the threat of crashing like a lifetime heroine addict gone cold turkey  a dire situation which would indefinitely lead to his  and the doctor's  death. With Tony Gilroy some will be relieved to be done with the shaky cam approach of Paul Greengrass but what does remain intact is Gilroy's dense jargonfilled dialogue that even if being dumb always sounds so incredibly smart. There is certainly no mistaking that this is a film from this universe. The Bourne Legacy is easily the goriest of the bunch and at times really pushes the envelope when it comes to a PG13 rating. As evidenced in the trailers there is an earlyset shooting involving Weisz's character and it is quite disturbing and effective in its robotic ruthlessness. Forget the controversial scene in Gangster Squad that is being reshot due to the Aurora Colo. shootings this sequence is bound to give anyone close to that event vivid flashbacks. And speaking of Weisz even in her quiet moments and she has plenty of loud and quiet she steals her show coming off as both devastated and strong and nimbly sidesteps the oft seen trope of the shrieking helpless female victim.Gilroy's foray has a number of inspired instances and though Legacy could have used about 15 minutes of trimming it never bores. There are a number of intense and wellchoreographed sequences that aptly showcase Cross' lethality and they're presented with enough frequency amidst the bureaucracy. An electric and immensely entertaining sequence takes place back when Cross is back in Alaska and attempting to avoid a quick death both by a military drone and a pack of wolves. I won't spoil anything but it puts a whole new spin on the slip your GPS tracker so your pursuers think you're somewhere else clich. At other times however it seems like Gilroy is just going down the Bourne checklist even down to playing Moby's Extreme Ways at the end credits I was really glad about that actually. Bourne beats up some unsuspecting guards  check. Bourne engages in an extended car chase in an exotic location  check. Bourne evades capture by running along rooftops  check. Another agent is sent to eliminate Bourne  check. The only check missing is the inclusion of the man himself. However in lieu of giving us an utter deconstruction of the series or nothing at all why should we be disappointed that The Bourne Legacy gives us everything we could expect and at times quite a bit more?It also becomes clear pretty early on that Damon's Bourne is not the only one who has been given a redux. David Strathairn's Noah Vosen who is under investigation following his attempted coverup has been given the form of Edward Norton's Eric Byer and Joan Allen's Pamela Landy who is also having problems with her treason as it were effectively with Donna Murphy's Dita Mandy only changed one letter in the last name there. It's safe to say despite strong performances they feel like a downgrade when recalling the fiery antagonism shared with Vosen and Landy in The Bourne Ultimatum.One thing The Bourne Legacy makes utterly clear is that at the distinguished age of 41 Jeremy Renner has proved himself to be a formidable action hero both bringing a classic look to Cross but also matching Damon in displays of physicality and athleticism. He has now proved his leading man potential and I look forward to Renner headlining further action adventures be it in this series or others. But after all the conspiracies have been unmasked and the last bullet drained I still couldn't help but miss Damon in the lead role. We all knew how great he was as Jason Bourne but it would seem that I at least took his work for granted perhaps failing to truly appreciate how magnetic he was in his asskickery. Let's hope Damon comes to miss his involvement and teams up with Renner in future missions because that would be an onscreen duo worthy of all kinds of legacies.".

The characters in this film are only there to get from A to B and none of them with the exception of Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner Who you can clearly see are both working beyond the call of duty to make something out of their paperthin roles has any real purpose at all. Poor Edward Norton is only there to bark orders and you can clearly see how frustrated he is with his role in certain scenes. The direction is not even very good with pacing problems and a running time that excessively too long for its own good.

The camera shaking was just too much. It made it very hard to follow the movie. This one tho was just smooth and cool! Well done Tony! Having said that I would have liked that Matt would have made at least a cameo Its sad and unprofessional for Matt do take a stance like that. I will only do Bourne with Paul What are you twelve?. Matt you are the coolest guy on earth but Tony made a better Bourne then Paul did with the last two.I really hope Renner and Damon will be in the next Bourne and Tony Gilroy directing!".

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely loved every minute of this movie but let me start out by saying that I'm not a fan of any of the first three Bourne movies. I will also say that because this story is so different to the previous movies it would have probably been better to give it a different title. There didn't need to be any reference to Bourne at all.One of the highlights for me was the level of accuracy in the CIA search team. It was surprisingly refreshing to see satellite feeds from across the world portrayed with their accurate limitations. This made me engage with that part of the story on a much deeper level and I really felt the tension as the search team grew closer and closer to their target.The chase sequence is one of the best I have seen. Manila was an amazing choice of location. It had it's one cheesy moment but I was holding onto my seat the entire time. I enjoyed the lull after the first part of the chase and I especially liked the very sharp and conclusive ending. The acting was absolutely spot on.I loved the details that helped to set the tone for certain scenes. For example the Australian character at the Manila laboratory really helped to create a general overtone of semiincompetence which was crucial to the belief that their breakin and escape was actually plausible.I loved the storyline and found it very refreshing after seeing too many movies that deal with revenge or uncovering conspiracies. Perhaps it says something about my personality but I really enjoyed the premise that all they wanted to do was get away and live in peace. I thought the suspense was really well managed during the scene where the border guards were checking their passports. The final scene of the movie released all of this builtup tension and I think it was a perfect happy ending. The ending reminded me of the movie 'Limitless' how the character's world can collapse at any moment but they make it to the end and are wellprepared to deal with any threats in the future. So there you go. One 10 star review in a sea of disappointed critics.".

The people who ran illegal black ops fear they will be exposed to the government and decide to kill off all these warriors and the scientists who make the meds so they cannot talk. Basically this is one big chase movie and it is very exciting. The editing during the foot race car and motorcycle chases later on are fantastic. I am not sure how much CGI was used as everything looked too real. Great stunts. Kudos. The supporting cast of Edward Norton Stacy Keach David Strathaim Scott Glen and Albert Finney do a credible job just as a supporting cast hey it's not their movie trying to kill off Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing Rachael Weisz the doctor who knows how to make the meds Cross needs. The way Cross and Dr. Shearing are tracked by Col Byer Edward Norton and crew is really incredible as they have access to cameras and satellites worldwide. Quite smooth the way it was done. I had my doubts about Rachael Weisz in this but she proved more than capable and quite sexy beautiful. She couldn't have been any better. Okay yes I fell in love with her. Now why Jeremy Renner as a new action hero? Did you forget his role in Tom Cruise's movie Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol? He did a bangup job in that one looking out for Cruise's Ethan Hunt and had some moves that opened important casting eyes. So it made sense. See?I almost expected a meeting with Jason Bourne Matt Damon and Aaron Cross because in this movie Jason Bourne is alive and doing his thing. They did show Jason Bourne's picture early in the movie and that got me to thinking about a meeting. Didn't happen. But may in the next movie as you know these sequels will never end. And that is a good thing. 910Violence Yes. Sex No. Nudity No. Language No.".

This was the first film in the series I'd seen on the big screen.Its not perfect but then neither were the Matt Damon ones. It was pretty good though. Things really improved with Rachel's involvement. The scene where Renner and Rachel meet after Renner kills 4 or 5 assassins in a stunning sequenceis fantastic and its high octane all the way after that. There are some reflective moments which give the talented leads a chance to shine and the two have fantastic screen chemistry together ironically better presence than Weisz has with her real life husband in the disappointing Dream House. The big action scene in Manila is jaw dropping. The tag scene sets things up for another film that I really want to happen. So what's not perfect?The problem is that all the flashbacks to Ultimatum are not needed and slow down the opening of the film. Bourne is gone and the film should concentrate 100 on the new characters. STILL WANT THAT SEQUEL THOUGH".

The storytelling felt disjointed and the action sequences had way too much camera shake to enjoy them the first trilogy wasn't so bad. Other than Manila and the solitude of Alaska location is one trademark of the legacy that just wasn't there. In the first three films the assassins didn't need to speak to have personality and character  this film's assassin was just a ghost in your memory.Even though not directly stated I think most people would understand by watching this film what MAY have actually happened to Jason Bourne.

	schema:headline " Bourne Identity remake with a scifi twist the Bourne franchise deserves better";
	schema:reviewBody "Jason Bourne is one of the more intriguing film characters of the past decade. He methodically and purposefully found out who he was who was responsible for his condition and attempted to bring everything back together again. Even better he was not a superhero Jason was just a guy who went through a lot of training. He is elite but deep down he is still one of us. Aaron Cross Jeremy Renner on the other hand has been tweaked a little bit. He pops pills to up his physical and mental skills. Yes he is still human too but perhaps a bit genetically modified. This splash of scifi does not help an audience tuned in to the adventures of Jason Bourne connect with the new guy.When I first heard there was another Bourne installment this time without Matt Damon I figured someone either wrote a good script to carry on a new story line or the studio wanted to churn out a guaranteed cash cow under the title of a proved and successful action series. Writerdirector Tony Gilroy wrote the scripts for the first three Bourne films but this is his first time behind the camera in the series. He successfully directed Michael Clayton and the under appreciated Duplicity but now the magic is gone. The Bourne Legacy is stale. Enduring a painfully slow beginning The Bourne Legacy reveals it is set at the same point in time as The Bourne Ultimatum. In fact if you have forgotten the plot points and supporting characters of the previous film take the time to either watch it again or read about it online before heading into the new feature. Jason Bourne's escapades have thrown multiple CIA operations out in the open and the shadowy powers are frantically trying to sweep them under the rug before either Congress or the press start asking questions. Eric Byer Edward Norton orders the termination of Project Outcome the new series of super agent represented by Aaron Cross. Instead of telling the agents to pack up and go home the CIA chooses to assassinate them instead. Oh and they try to wipe out all of the scientists who made them so super in the first place.Dr. Marta Shearing Rachel Weisz is one of those scientists seeking ways to alter chromosomes to make a more perfect human. After surviving annihilation himself Aaron conveniently scoops the good Dr. out of harms way which sets up an 'us against them' theme quite similar to the one you remember from The Bourne Identity. Unfortunately The Bourne Legacy noticeably lacks the quality script and thrilling action sequences of that first film. The chase scenes in the new film are edited so atrociously especially during motorcycle elements that they are almost impossible to logically follow. You know they are weaving in and out of traffic there are near misses and flying bullets but there are only quick glimpses of that on the screen in the midst of the unsteady camera work and splitsecond jump cuts.The Bourne Identity also had a mystery to unravel and wandered around the world trying to find out who was behind the curtain. There is no curtain now Edward Norton is pulling the strings in plain sight using all of the means in the intelligence community he can lay his hands on. There are armed Predator drones devious mopup CIA killing squads and even a possible super duper agent imagine the Schwarzenegger Terminator battling the new T1000. Renner and Weisz do their best to remake a film which was already pretty great. Yes they have new names and faces but they are running from the same agency dodging the same bullets but this time they have a higher chromosomal level on their side. The Bourne Legacy will be known as that film which derailed the very respectable Bourne franchise. Paul Greengrass the director of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum was correct when he said any further film would feel like The Bourne Redundancy.".

Between awkwardly chosen locations some scifi drug twist and and incredibly oversimplified and at times dull plot line this is hardly an action movie let alone a Bourne movie. Also and this part really bothered me I feel like Tony and Dan Gilroy did things with some of the Bourne characters that were not true to Robert Ludlum's vision even going so far as to change the initiation program and the amount of information leaked at the end of Ultimatum. Secondly the direction was very close up the entire time and during many of the chase scenes I found myself unable to watch. The entire time it is very shaky and because of the closeness it's difficult to get the whole picture of what's going on.Lastly some of the acting wasn't very good. I've never liked Jeremy Renner and this movie didn't change my opinion on him. It's not that he's a bad actor it's just that I don't like him as an actor. Edward Norton though was incredibly stiff and robotic the whole time as were some of the other government workers. The best performance was probably from Rachel Weisz who did well as a woman trying to deal with shock and guilt. If you happen to like almost all action movie go ahead and watch this but if you're a Bourne fan I wouldn't bother wasting your and tarnishing some aspects of the past movies.".

However the principal performers in this film Jeremy Renner Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton infuse the franchise with a welcome rush of new energy and considerable onscreen charisma. The locations look great and the action sequences are genuinely exciting and impressive. The film begins somewhat slowly but this results in a degree of characterization that helps us invest in the wellbeing of the hero and heroine and the pace definitely picks up in the second half.

However the saving grace was the actors themselves that pulled this out of the crapper in my opinion. Nothing new was added here except another layer to the Treadstone Black Briar and other Government absurdities from the other three movies. This sequel deals with genetics and DNA manipulation and since this is mentioned in the trailer there is no spoiler alert needed. These genetic mutations were supposed to eliminate the inconsistencies that existed with Jason Borne also in the trailer and the operatives in his program. The way they dealt with how they supposedly fixed the inconsistencies is really what was made this an unbelievable script. However the action and the acting of the two lead characters Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner make this movie tolerable. There was no reason to cast people like Stacey Keach or Edward Norton to this cast as they added no value other than their name to this film. Really any no name actor could have provided the same quality to this film without having to pay for these actors. The plot wasn't too hard to follow but be prepared for a few flashbacks to the other three movies which to me upsets the flow to the movie. The only reason I think they put them in in the first place was for people who may not have seen the other three Borne movies. Other than that I don't think they're needed. I wouldn't waste admission price or popcorn on this movie. I only saw it because it was only 5 at the drive in and you got to see another movie after it went off so it didn't cost me that much. Don't worry it will keep until it comes out on Netflix or Redbox and then you can watch it without worrying that you are throwing away your money.".

It has great actors great ideas and great script it has action love and suspense. I can not understand why the score of this movie is less than the score of Prometheus.

Many negative comments were posted mostly from the fans of Bourne movies however I did not watch any Bourne movies because I did not like their movie trailers. So I can express my opinion without any prior attachment. This movie trailer though was surprisingly right on the money. It has great actors great ideas and great script it has action love and suspense. I can not understand why the score of this movie is less than the score of Prometheus. This movie is a lot better than total recall 2012 expendables 2 avengers amazing spider man men in black 3 etc.";

Its worst sin against humor to my mind is that the fun here is based entirely on a the antics of a few angry and arrogant narcissists. I'd have called them psychos but that would make them sound too interesting. The fact that they're also brilliant surgeons doesn't outweigh their mentalhealth issues unless you get a lump in the throat just watching SOB's save lives.All Quiet on the Western Front is antiwar. Paths of Glory is antiwar. You don't need to be told that because they show war itself as cruel and dehumanizing right up on the big screen.MASH is not antiwar and would be pretty poor even it were because most of the dehumanizing is done by the protagonists themselves. It was marketed as antiwar something quite different because being antiwar sold in 1970. The posters that showed a peace sign morphing into a leggy babe had nothing to do with the movie except to convince people that it was antiwar and therefore great sexy hilarious and more than worth the price of admission. In fact MASH is none of these things.Hawkeye Trapper John and their buddies are not against war or even the war. They do and say nothing about any war. All they do and say is whatever they feel like tormenting female nurses outsmarting superior officers taking their petty vengeance and unmotivated peevishness out on everyone around them. Sound funny? Wrong. The Marx Bros. might have been able to pull it off but not this crew. MASH is antiauthority but that's a whole lot different from being antiwar. MASH is also antimilitary but in a motiveless way unless raking in the bucks was a motive. All the army ever did to these distinguished surgeons was to replace temporarily of course their zilliondollar a year civilian careers with the opportunity to play golf football and crude practical jokes while occasionally saving of patients whom they obviously do not give a  about personally.The primary antiwar message here is that surgical operations involve lots of blood squirting around. That's it. Why not say MASH was is antisurgery or antimedical profession movie? Because that would nail the picture for the fraud it really is.Note I know that medical students can be krazy kutups especially when it comes to spare cadavers. MASH is a lot less funny.".

	schema:headline " Strange film";
	schema:reviewBody "Strange film basically entertaining but not exactly a masterpiece. One of the most likable things about Robert Altman is that every film of his has been in some way an experiment and almost none of these experiments even the very good ones work perfectly. This is a great example. As is obvious from the many user comments here it's difficult to talk about MASH without comparing it to MASH and in fact the most important cultural thing the film may have done is establish an aesthetic universe for the TV series to exist in and that really is the only thing the film and the TV show have in common  as many have pointed out the tone style timing and even character personalities are quite different between the two. But taken on its own MASH is not really the antiwar polemic it's been made out to be nor is it the jokedriven movie comedy we might expect from the series' style. Instead it's a kind of exercise in blackcomic tone it subverts the idea of war not by explicitly criticizing it even through jokes but rather by being exactly the opposite of what we expect a traditional war film to be. Here we don't see courage or valor or heroism or honor we see cowardice and nastiness and vice and stupidity even from the good characters. The movie subtly suggests that war makes ordinary people into silly stupid and vicious ones and Hawkeye and Trapper are no more exempt from this law than Frank Burns in fact if anything they are more angry and mean than he is. This unusual approach to the subject matter is wellmaintained throughout the film and never becomes too harsh or ugly  and yet Altman missteps with some oddly chosen episodes Painless's suicide attempt for instance and the overlong if symbolic football game and the ending of the film is abrupt making what's come before seem even more pointless and inconsequential.

	onyx:emotionText "Strange film basically entertaining but not exactly a masterpiece. One of the most likable things about Robert Altman is that every film of his has been in some way an experiment and almost none of these experiments even the very good ones work perfectly. This is a great example. As is obvious from the many user comments here it's difficult to talk about MASH without comparing it to MASH and in fact the most important cultural thing the film may have done is establish an aesthetic universe for the TV series to exist in and that really is the only thing the film and the TV show have in common  as many have pointed out the tone style timing and even character personalities are quite different between the two. But taken on its own MASH is not really the antiwar polemic it's been made out to be nor is it the jokedriven movie comedy we might expect from the series' style. Instead it's a kind of exercise in blackcomic tone it subverts the idea of war not by explicitly criticizing it even through jokes but rather by being exactly the opposite of what we expect a traditional war film to be. Here we don't see courage or valor or heroism or honor we see cowardice and nastiness and vice and stupidity even from the good characters. The movie subtly suggests that war makes ordinary people into silly stupid and vicious ones and Hawkeye and Trapper are no more exempt from this law than Frank Burns in fact if anything they are more angry and mean than he is. This unusual approach to the subject matter is wellmaintained throughout the film and never becomes too harsh or ugly  and yet Altman missteps with some oddly chosen episodes Painless's suicide attempt for instance and the overlong if symbolic football game and the ending of the film is abrupt making what's come before seem even more pointless and inconsequential. Which may be exactly Altman's point of course . . . so here we have another Altman film that manages to be simultaneously witty jokeless boring entertaining confusing beautifully thought out artfully constructed and artless symbolic and realistic. It's recommended but viewers should ideally go into it with no expectations whatsoever. 7 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm at a loss to know what the makers of this movie were trying to achieve. The two main characters Hawkeye and Trapper John are possibly the two most obnoxious characters ever committed to celluloid smug bullying misogynistic devious and self centred. That would be fine if Altman had intended to show these ugly traits as being part of human nature brought to the surface by war but he seems perversely to show such qualities as admirable.The atmosphere resembles that of a school playground with bullying towards nonconformists being much in evidence. Conformity here is of course alcoholism gambling and womanising. Again this would be fine if the film makers intended this moral inversion and reversion to adolescence as being a bad side effect of war in a sort of Lord of the Flies way but the impression is that the lawless pack are the good guys while anyone who represents order is to be humiliated simply because this is fun. Doing things by the book is such a drag maaan.Robert Duvall is the first to be mocked simply because he happens to be praying. He is later punched by Trapper on a thin excuse and for which Trapper receives no punishment. Next he and hot lips have their passion broadcast for the amusement of all. The slender justification for this is that he is married although almost everyone else is ignoring their wedding vows. Duvall is soon goaded into a fight and unjustly carted off in a strait jacket. Hot Lips receives a great deal of ritual humiliation simply because she is not popular. And the repulsive part is we are meant to be laughing AT her not feeling any sympathy for her. She soon has her dignity removed by having the curtain pulled away while she is showering again to the amusement of a cheering mob. Her desperate plea for justice is treated like a joke by the commander and the director.All of this is shocking but is presented as light entertainment. At no point to we get the impression that the descent into the baying mob mindset is a bad thing. Next the dentist who has concerns over his sexuality tells this to the 'hero' Hawkeye the priest having heard this in the confession virtually breaks his vows in his eagerness to let Hawkeye know about it. Hawkeye then blabs this sensitive info to everyone who jeer at the dentist and laugh at his intention to commit suicide. He is cured of his gayness by a mock last supper with heavy influence of Da Vinci mock funeral and then a sexy girl. Hey presto all is alright. Hawkeye and Trapper continue their obnoxious antics in Japan where they treat some nurses with contempt then gas and make compromising photos of a commander who dared to question them.At this point the audience is expecting the pair to receive their well deserved comeuppance. Alas this never comes. Instead the movie lurches into a long football match which includes a black player called spear chucker and which they win by cheating. Perhaps this is meant to be some allegory of war? Since we are shown several images of the opposing team sitting on the bench sharing a joint I guess the intended message is that the best option in war is to sit on the sidelines and take drugs.This football sequence also points up the inconsistency in the writing. Hot Lips having previously opposed the playing of football suddenly becomes the chief cheerleader. No explanation is given. She is still treated to derogatory comments and ends up meekly sitting at a poker table obediently watching the men play cards. The Stepford Wives has nothing on Mash.The writing has this inconsistency throughout. Rambling sequences. General sloppiness. Characters who disappear. Duvall goes early on. Then the young boy he was teaching is taken off for a few days by a doctor who notices the boy's high heart rate. We never know what happens to him. The dentist disappears after his moment.This is not a well made film and a waste of the talent of all involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "MASH broke barriers and defied conventions when it was first released in 1970. It still does today.The pendulum has swung back a lot since 1970 and for that you still get a sense of the pioneering spirit with which the film was made. The overlapping dialogue. The nonlinear characterdriven plot. The caustic humor. The attacks on religion real religion as the New York Times noted when the film came out not false sanctimony but actual belief in God.Yes in those ways the film is as powerful now as it was when it was first released. But you see something else something audiences didn't see in 1970 so blown away were they by the newness of it. That is the picture runs out of gas halfway through.You have a powerful beginning that eerie montage with the strange song Suicide Is Painless playing mournfully while doctors nurses and orderlies silently rush to relieve choppers of their human cargo. It's quietly effective immediately giving you a sense of the 4077th MASH unit looking much bigger and grimmer than it ever did in the TV series and coming as close as the movie ever does to delivering an effective antiwar statement. The movie builds from there as we meet the various characters beneficiaries of their actors' strong improvisational work. It feels like realtime eavesdropping on a community of actual human beings. Scenes like Major Burns and Hot Lips' transmitted tryst and Painless Pole's suicide attempt are not as funny as we are meant to think but they are well shot especially the Painless Pole bit the best thing in the movie for pure entertainment. The way all the guys in the Swamp crack up when Painless tells them he's decided to kill himself may be the film's funniest moment.What happens next feels like a wrong turn. Hot Lips becomes the subject of a camp bet that exposes her to massive humiliation. Call it indecent or politically incorrect it is just plain wrong exposing the film's and its director's nasty streak toward women and alienating any concern you might have built up for the characters. When she and Burns were targeted before you had a sense they had it coming because of her overbearing military approach and his blaming orderly Boone for killing a patient. This time she's a spent force no threat to anyone and a damn good nurse as Trapper says just doing her job as best she can despite her earlier bad experience. I'm struck dumb at the idea I'm supposed to be laughing when she rushes into Col. Blake's tent in shock and tears.The film never recovers. Instead it veers wildly off course away from the camp and into two radically pointless subplots one involving a trip by Hawkeye and Trapper to Japan where they operate on a congressman's son and a sick infant some sort of parallel there though lost on me the other a football game that apparently was director Robert Altman's comment on the folly of war but to me just shows what happens when you allow your characters to veer offscript for so long you can't make it back to the ending as written. The game takes up too much time throws in goofy circus music complete with slide whistles and features the once ironwilled Hot Lips in the role of outlandishly enthusiastic cheerleader for all the people who tormented her so viciously for the duration of the film. Sally Kellerman's performance in the second half of the film is nothing like it was in the first half it's embarrassingly cartoonishly bad. Altman should have reined her in but you get the feeling he was just rushing by then to get it all in the can before the studio figured out what he was up to and took his film away.Altman was just so much better making Nashville. Obviously he learned a lot. It's amazing how pasty everyone in this film looks particularly Donald Sutherland who seems leprous. No wonder he tried to get Altman fired. So much of the supporting players faded away and though they do good work it's not a surprise. They all seem so squalid and ugly as Altman shoots them.It's interesting comparing the characters here to their counterparts in the TV series. For me the TV characters are usually preferable. Robert Duvall mines zero comedy from Frank Burns playing him very seriously in comparison to Larry Linville's more likeably miserable TV Burns. Roger Bowen had a great voice but is nearly robotic as Blake having none of McLean Stevenson's panache. What's worse than a pompous moralizing Hawkeye with Groucho affectations? How about that annoying whistle! Even Gary Burghoff the one real holdover from film to series plays a nastier Radar in the movie meaner tougher less innocent.The whole film is mean tough less innocent. It gets points from me for that. Altman and his cast develop a magnificent mood right away. But they fail to do very much with it. MASH is a great 45minutelong movie that just goes on too long.".

	schema:reviewBody "And then there was Korea.  In an understaffed and overstretched medical camp Lt Col Blake puts an order in for more surgeons.  Dispatched to him in a stolen army jeep are Captain's Hawkeye Pierce and Duke Forrest who immediately start chasing the nursing staff and annoying their tent mate Major Burns.  When chest cutter Trapper John McIntyre joins them in the camp it starts a working practice that ignores authority and tries to find as much fun as possible in the middle of their bloody war.I had watched the TV show for a long time before I finally got to watch the movie  I prefer the cynical comedy of the film although I have always loved the more sitcom style approach of the series.  Many critics have hailed this as an antiwar film that exposes the brutal effects of war to some extent I suppose that is true but it is far from being a part of the main narrative  even to call it a theme would be generous! It does have some scenes of blood and gore but it is far from having anything substantial to say about the cruelty of war.Instead I always find this film to be a very episodic freewheeling comedy some bits of which work and some others don't.  On the whole it is pretty funny and uses the sort of sporadic dialogue and action to move it forward. At times it is based on imaginative banter between Trapper and Hawkeye and at others it is out and out slapstick such as the chaotic game of American football at the end of the film.  The downside of this is that sections of it just don't work  Painless Paul's dilemma is pretty uninspiring at least  however on the whole it is energetic and very funny.  Altman's use of overlapping dialogue and his usual use of overlapping scenes as opposed to a traditional narrative flow is good here but it would have been better if it had been toned down somewhat.The cast is what really carries the film  the plot is weak and they have no characters other than what they create themselves and although the dialogue is good I couldn't help the feeling that the cast did as much as the writers.  As such the lead two of Sutherland and Gould stand out as great comedians with great witty touches their characters are the largest and their lines are the funniest.  Skerritt starts out as equal to them but quickly becomes a third wheel despite still giving a good performance. The support cast are all a good mix of characters whether they be played by actors such as Duvall and Kellerman or less well known faces such as Burghoff or Bowen.Overall I am still unable to see what those who call this a brutal antiwar film' see but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as a comedy.  As such though it is very episodic and really lacks a solid narrative flow meaning that any 10 minute period could be good or bad.  Aside from this lack of substance it is a funny enjoyable comedy but it doesn't deserve the classic reputation that it has obtained.".

Skerritt starts out as equal to them but quickly becomes a third wheel despite still giving a good performance. The support cast are all a good mix of characters whether they be played by actors such as Duvall and Kellerman or less well known faces such as Burghoff or Bowen.Overall I am still unable to see what those who call this a brutal antiwar film' see but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as a comedy.  As such though it is very episodic and really lacks a solid narrative flow meaning that any 10 minute period could be good or bad.  Aside from this lack of substance it is a funny enjoyable comedy but it doesn't deserve the classic reputation that it has obtained.";

He even gets into a coffin believe it or not in preparation for his expected demise. This is followed by his friends filing past him and in turn paying their last respects. The only thing that makes this ludicrous scene at all watchable for me is the terrific acoustic guitar and vocal performance of the MASH theme song Suicide Is Painless. The dentist incidentally seems to be neither confused nor surprised by the fact that he is still alive the next day. Instead of dying after taking the pill he had been helped through his crisis by a very kind and desirable young nurse. Not long afterward the unrulyyetskilled surgeons travel to Japan to play some golf and oh operate on a congressman's son and help a sick infant . . . along the way disrupting a hospital drugging and framing a colonel and telling off a snooty head nurse.Eventually comes a muchtoolong totallyoutofplace scene in which the MASH unit hustles another army outfit in a game of football by bringing in a ringer and drugging the other team's star  who inexplicably is oblivious to a needle being stuck into his arm after being tackled. Where the football uniforms equipment field scoreboard goal posts and referees come from is a mystery. Incidentally during this segment the aforementioned bythebook strongwilled regular army chief nurse is magically transformed into a brainless pompom girl enthusiastically cheering the very maniacs who have been harassing and humiliating her throughout the movie . . . and pretty much getting everything wrong.Add to all of this the fact that the M in MASH stands for Mobile yet this particular MASH unit never moves even once during the entire film.All in all a beautiful original concept which got lost somewhere along the way.Luckily for us all a group of very talented individuals later took all of those great basics of this movie which I mentioned at the start of this comment and transformed them into just about the greatest television series of all time. When you play the TV series DVDs and eliminate the chuckle track you are treated to what this movie quite possibly could have and maybe should have been.Asked to give this movie a 110 number rating I gave it a 7 5 for the movie itself plus an extra 2 for giving the TV series its initial main characters a setting and a visual style.".

Altman wanted to make a statement about war without really understanding what it was really like to be in a combat situation in Korea. The surgery scenes are gruesome yet they don't seem real enough. There is no sense of connection in the operating room with the pain of war. There are no artillery shells. They even have lots of time for horsing around and playing football. Basically it is good guys versus bad guys. The bad guys are Major Houlihan and Major Burns. Both Kellerman and Duvall are very good in their roles. Sutherland is pretty decent but poorly developed. You get the sense that he likes dogs and is pretty decent but he comes of as a complete painintheneck. Gould is disappointing. He comes across as a hippie not as someone who really existed in the 1950s. Basically there were amusing moments such as the football game but I never felt that this movie was anything more than an ego trip for Altman. I never felt that it was an honest look at the Korean War.".

The best thing I can say about it is that it gave birth to the long running television series of the same name which may still be the best television series ever made. But how anyone could watch this movie and get the idea to make it into a television series is beyond me.I readily confess of course that as with almost everyone born in the 1960's or later my introduction to and conception of MASH is the TV series. It's truly difficult for me to relate to Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye Pierce for example. Not that he or any of the actors did a bad job. It's just that the TV series is so ingrained in my mind that it's hard to see different actors putting their unique spins on familiar characters. Hawkeye Trapper John Elliott Gould Frank Burns Robert Duvall Hot Lips Houlihan Sally Kellerman and Col. Blake Roger Bowen are portrayed very differently than their TV counterparts. That's fine and the actors did well but it's still disconcerting.The problems I felt with this movie went far beyond the difficulties involved with relating to an unfamiliar cast playing familiar characters though. The story focuses on the experiences of Captains Pierce and Duke Forrest Tom Skerritt at the 4077 MASH in the Korean War. It opens with their arrival and closes with their discharge. But to me the movie lacks any clear focus or consistency. It doesn't seem to be building to anything and in the end it just fizzles out quietly without any real climax. The zany antics of the doctors come across here as meanspirited more than fun and there's way too much emphasis on the football game between the 4077 and the 325th Evac. I mean  who really cares? To me this movie didn't even seem to have a strong antiwar message. Antimilitary perhaps but not antiwar and the two are not the same thing in my opinion.I realize that I'm not in tune here with most people's thinking but as far as I'm concerned the best thing about this movie is actually hearing the words to the familiar MASH theme Suicide Is Painless. I also appreciated the fact that this being a motion picture rather than a TV series the horrors of war ie the wounds of the soldiers could be more graphically and therefore more soberingly portrayed. Aside from that nothing much here appealed to me.210".

It's claim to fame is supposedly its anti war theme which is complete bunk unless the point is war turns men into degenerate sexist anti social pigs! Is this behaviour supposed to be justified because they are talented surgeons? There is no stand against war here just juvenille narcissistic bullies engaging in criminal behaviour and tormenting everyone around them. I am an atheist but I found the ridicule of a religious character to be a bit much. Thwarting a noble attempt to teach a child in a war torn society to read and then using said child as a personal lackey is funny how? As for its treatment of women it is offensive in a way that would not have been acceptable in the actual 50's even less so in the 70's and is downright disgustingly criminal today. Coercing a woman a character is supposed to have feelings for to have sex with another man to turn him from being gay. The man himself preferring suicide over homosexuality. The degrading shower scene and the following emotional breakdown are shocking to watch and its mind boggling to think anyone could actually think this was funny. It's truly frightening to read how many viewers rate this movie so high. It's interesting that the TV show is so much better mainly because thankfully they had to tone down the characters and give them compassion to make them likable. So far I have only reviewed movies I have enjoyed but this one is so bad on so many levels I felt compelled to warn others. I only give it a 1 because 0 is not possible. Oh yeah besides infuriatingly offensive it is totally boring without a real plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a legendary comedy MASH isn't that funny. It's mostly mean petty arrogant and selfrighteous.As anyone familiar with the TV show spawned by this film knows MASH is the story of 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War. It primarily follows the exploits of surgeons Hawkeye Pierce Donald Sutherland and Trapper John Elliot Gould as they joke their way through bloody surgery and dealing with Army bureaucracy. There's really not much of a plot to the film. It's just the characters moving from one situation to the next mostly becoming more absurd as they go along.There aren't that much more than a handful of real jokes in the movie and most of them are the simplest sort of slapstick. Almost all of the alleged humor of MASH comes out of the characters' irreverent attitude toward each and every thing around them. But being irreverent isn't always the same as being funny. Sometimes being irreverent is just being a jackass and in the case of MASH sometimes it's just being a cruel child lashing out at anyone different than you.My problem with this movie started with the scene where Hawkeye and his fellow newly arrived doctor Duke Tom Skerrit encounter Major Frank Burns Robert Duvall. As they enter their tent they find Frank trying to teach a young Korean boy how to read and he's using the Bible to do it. Hawkeye and Duke find this to be odd and somewhat offensive behavior and give the boy a girlie magazine to look at instead. Later on Frank prays for the safety of U.S. soldiers in the field their commanders on the ground and their CommanderInChief and again Hawkeye and Duke find this behavior objectionable and openly mock and deride Frank for praying. And it's very clear that the movie wants us to agree that Frank's actions are strange bad and laughable. But the movie never bothers to explain why.Trying to teach a Korean kid to read English is a noble thing especially because the movie never implies that the kid has any real education to speak of and in contrast to the way the movie's heroes treat him as nothing more than a servant. Praying for the well being of others should be about the most unobjectionable thing anyone can do yet MASH implies it shouldn't be tolerated in polite company. Frank Burns is constantly treated like a terrible person but Duvall's Frank isn't the complete weasel that Larry Linvile portrayed on TV. The only sin Duvall's Frank ever commits is being a little uptight. He never does anything any normal person would consider that bad yet because he doesn't think and act the way Hawkeye and Trapper John do he's subjected to cruel torments and physical violence.It's even worse for Major Margaret O'Houlihan Sally Kellerman. Again her only real offense is being a little uptight. But she's repeatedly subjected to the most vicious sorts of humiliations and unlike Frank who at least gets to strike back at his tormentors Hot Lips laps up the abuse like a whipped dog and later in the film grinningly pals around with the very people who treated her like the lowest form of garbage.I can only imagine that MASH was supposed to reflect the cultural attitudes of the day. Audiences were supposed to identify with Hawkeye and the gang as us and laugh uproariously as they heaped abuse on them. But if the narcissistic crude intolerant vindictive sadistic and awful thinking and attitudes embodied by this film really did represent the true face of the late1960searly 1970sno one should be surprised that there are so many people who deeply despise that era and everything it stood for.".

That moviewithinamovie grabs all the trite clichs that infest Corean melodramas and brings them to their ridiculous conclusions.Someone Special or A Woman I Know direct translation is a romantic comedy but it's build on a completely different foundation than the typical Corean melodrama. In fact the closest analogue I can come up with to this film is Punch Drunk Love which is also a completely different kind of romance. Unlike Punch Drunk Love however Someone Special is completely aware of all the genre rules and even follows them in parodic but not spoofing fashion subverting clichs of terminal illness tearjerking moments and remarkable connections between lovers. And even though it acts as a parody of the romantic comedy genre it still retains the heart of a romantic comedy.The story on the surface is a little unremarkable. It's essentially about heartbroken baseball player and a young woman who has a onesided crush on him. The comedy is derived partially from parody flights of fantasy erratic behavior and comedic situations as well as some sharp awkward dialog. A few directorial touches that I love is the inversion of background and foreground and the overall approach to the look of the film.Another thing I love about the film is the acting. First of all the male lead doesn't have modellike featureshe's a rather average looking guy. And the female lead portrays her rather bizarre character with gusto and while she's costumed rather dumpy she conveys a genuinely addictive naivet. The rest of the film is peopled with rather amusing persons all played well by their supporting actors.I did have some issues with the editing which I felt didn't do enough to cut down the running time as there were more than a couple moments where I felt like we could have more elliptical storytelling. Also although I remain neutral to it there are many setups where a handheld camera is used and it can be distracting to those who expect a still camera when shooting a still scene. It's a little unorthodox and I can't find a compelling reason to shoot it the way it was shot but at the same time it's a rather memorable technique even if excessive. Finally sometimes the music was mixed too much up front and while I understand the use of pop songs in certain parts as part of the genre critique at other times it was just a little overbearing and distracting.Despite that I felt like a few more things could've been done to improve the film I still have to admit that I was really entertained by the film and loved its intelligent and yet still genuine take on the romantic comedy genre. With great characters atypical amusing comedy and a really unique energy Someone Special ended up being something special for me a really enjoyable romantic comedy that considerably pushes the genre into a new place. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "As much as I love Korean cinema I tend to get bit selective when it comes to melodramatic romance films mainly because I rarely find myself in the mood for some extreme tear dropping. But once in a while I get an itch to watch a good K romance drama without the flashy action or over the top comedy and when I heard that this film was directed by Jin Jang I was more so interested since I enjoyed both Guns  Talks and Ditto and also knew or hoped that it wouldn't be a typical genre piece.First thing I noticed from the start of the film was that just as sentimentality was about to overtake the screen Jang would quickly sneak in humorous imagination sequences or have his characters simply swallow their words to lighten up the mood instead of delivering long compelling lines. At the moment I took that as his trick to slowly digress into full fledged gloominess but to my relief that wasn't meant to be.I think the casting of these actors was done perfectly as both Jaeyeong Jeong who shows his strength as a veteran actor and Nayeong Lee equally shone through with their natural and effortless delivery. Since Jaeyeong's character is facing an illness his somewhat average looks helped him to convey his inner sadness better than most actors ever do in these type of situations. Nayeong keeps herself confined although her character has a lot on her mind and heart which essentially enriches the moments when she shyly smiles or tries to comfort Jaeyeong all at the same time without becoming over bearing or needy.Still I had my reservations about how the ending would take its final shape with this hocuspocus of a sensitive story but in the end I couldn't have asked for a better way of providing a closure. Jin Jang was able to smartly craft the oldest tale in the history of cinematic romances with a refreshing twist. This film might be even more enjoyable with the second viewing especially if the first time around you didn't get the hint on what Jang was aiming for. My only complaint is about the music which I felt was a bit too typical for a film that was heading toward the abstract but perhaps it was added intentionally to surprise the audience even further.I wish more romantic comedies were like this completely drag free and without the sappy fluff but I guess good things come in small doses and that's just another reason why I'd recommend this film so enthusiastically.".

Nayoung Lee plays her role perfectly and in hindsight which they say is 2020 I can see no other actress who could have played it. I honestly did not know this actress before this film and during it I was confused as to whether she was supposed to be blind or not. Just due to the way she looks and acts. In fact I had to say she looked very odd. But aside from the initial reaction she melted into her character and was great. The character development of this film was spectacular all romantic comedies from the motherland all try to have a dramatic scene in the rain with everyone crying and such this movie uses a blend of awkward 'getting to know each other' time and the occasional dramatic yelling and screaming over the pitter patter of cg rain to produce a ... awesome end product. Sorry couldn't think of a better word. I feel this is more a sappy guy who likes to watch sappy chick flick movie then a regular chick flick but all you ladies are welcome to get your ben and jerrys and settle down in front of the computer or TV because your heart will be warmed up instantly by this cleverly written and directed diamond in the rough.".

What is worse he experiences a constant nosebleeding and hears from the doctor that he is only given three months to live due to a malignant tumor in his lung.

She apparently has lived close to Chiseong and monitored him closely over the past 10 years suffering from an unrequited love.Someone Special has been highly anticipated for no other reason that it is director's longawaited followup movie.

Once more I was not disappointed.The plot is not as simple as in most romcoms but include fairly decent twist. Main character Dong Chiseong is just a guy in constant pursuit for love which is field with failure and disappointment. He also has serious health problems. After meting his doctor Chiseung is desperate so he turns towards alcohol and then he meets Han Yiyeon. AS I noticed before and its the same with this film Korean directors are restrained in showing affection between characters its often big advantage just like in this film. After they met Chiseong isn't too friendly. Thats the plot in an nutshell.Camera work isn't perfect. I don't understand why scenes with lack of movement were taken by hand camera. I just don't get it. Soundtrack is typicall for the genre maybe creators wanted to throw off audience so the twist could have had better impact. Acting is good enough or the cuteness of Yiyeon just blinded me. Performance of Nayeong Lee is very balanced just not too needy nor too shy.Funny moments are very tasteful sometimes even disarmingly ridicules I refer to certain box that just made me cry. Film can be even considered as an parody of the genre that it is representing by itself. Very clever script and amazing directing created unusual film for all those who are bored with stories that always unfold the same.".
