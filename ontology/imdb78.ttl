	schema:reviewBody "Although some of the early scenes were filmed with striking black and white compositions as the story unfolds the film's style devolves into that of a standard glossy melodrama.  However the overwrought drama whose title translates as Ash Wednesday has been done in style and it is reminiscent of Hollywood's golden age of women's pictures.  This tale of unrequited love and retribution is told against an interesting backdrop of early 20th century Mexican history when Roman Catholic clerics and nuns were persecuted and antiCatholic feelings ran high.  The central character Victoria is a strong woman who carries a hatred for clerics from a devastating incident in her youth.  Lana Turner or Joan Crawford would have chewed scenery in the part and probably have chewed Maria Felix to get the role.  However Maria Felix suffers and hates and wears high fashion with the best of Hollywood's leading ladies and she has an elegance beauty and talent of her own that dominate the film.  None of the male actors makes an impression and the object of her supposed unrequited love elicits no visible sparks which leaves the viewer mystified as to why she is attracted to him especially when two younger and better looking men are interested in her.  However if you love Joan Crawford movies of the 40s and 50s then you might want to wallow in this one.  Note  the DVD is in Spanish with NO English subtitles.".

Linus Roache playing Kate's secret love brings tortured Merton Densher where does James come up with these names? vividly to life.  He has the sort of intense good looks and physical presence required for this role in spades and his dramatic ability shines though especially in his last scene with Millie where he acknowledges his duplicity before the allaccepting love of the dying girl with an incredible raw emotionality.   I was most impressed with Allison Elliot's Millie however.  The angelic Millie could have been a big clich of a character but in Elliot's skillful hands Millie takes on the luminance of spirits and love of life that grow even as her physical strength fails.  The story and the actors are tremendously aided by gorgeous cinematography especially the mournful beauty of rainsoaked Venice  costumestodiefor by Sandy Powell who wore that fabulous red dress to this year's Oscar accepting the award for Shakespeare in Love.

She meets and befriends a wealthy but terminally ill American Milly. She decides that Merton will court Milly inherit all of Milly's money when she dies and have the funds to marry Helena. The film is about Merton's moral awakening as he realizes how horrible what he's doing is and WHO Helena's character really is.You would have to read the novel to understand how difficult it is to adapt this material and what a great job they really have done. Bring your hankies for the scene near the end not in the novel actually in which Merton apologizes to Milly. This invented scene crystallizes all of the emotion and makes the movie fulfilling in a way a straight working of the novel could not have been.Helena is good but her character is simplified somewhat from the book.

Director Iain Softley and writer Hossein Amini made the smart decision to move this up in time to the 1910's which enables them to get to the passions more than James does here.  Softley also makes this darker than most literary adaptations in look and in tone without suffocating it and he avoids making this a film about production design rather than about a story.  He does labor a bit in trying for tragedy but that's only a quibble.Alison Elliot a good actress I liked her in THE UNDERNEATH and the otherwise flawed THE SPITFIRE GRILL takes awhile to warm up as Millie because she seems a little too modern but she avoids easy sentiment as the dying heiress.  Linus Roache who I thought was a little awkward in PRIEST here avoids the trap of being the third wheel making us understand what both Millie and Kate see in Merton.  But the real triumph here is Helena Bonham Carter who gave the best performance of the year.  One character says of Kate There's something going on behind those beautiful lashes and that can usually be said of the characters Carter plays but sometimes she's overly detached.  Here she's completely engaged and she pulls off the difficult trick of never losing our sympathies even when her character does something despicable.  And where James sort of made Kate just manipulative Carter makes her human and longing.".

I couldn't help but keep my eyes glued to the screen the entire time. It flows beautifully and never moves too far ahead or too slow for the viewer. There wasn't a single second where I was bored or waiting for the film to end. I'm not usually the biggest fan of a period romance but I was blown away by this one. The score is incredible. It sets the perfect ambiance for the film and makes you feel like you are with these characters. The ending left me in a complete catharsis. I was just numb staring at the screen in disbelief. Helena Bonham Carter is unexplainably phenomenal. She is one of a rare breed of actors who can display more emotion simply with her eyes than most actors can with their entire body. I feel blessed to watch her perform. Her extreme versatility and authenticity is unparalleled. Her performance is the best from a female that I've ever seen. The Academy should be in jail for giving the Oscar to the mediocre Helen Hunt over Bonham Carter's flawless tour de force.".

She and Glenn Close acted circles around the guys  her expression in the midst of the play within the play is lasting over years in my memory. The whole film revolves around that moment.Also lasting are several images from the ostensibly unambitious Oscar and Lucinda.' But I also carry many lasting film images that are junk courtesy of Lucas and Spielberg. That brings us to the second condition for a film to be classic evocation of the images the remembrance needs to be multidimensional to elevate rather than dumb down.Measured by those rules this film is remarkable. For a few years I have carried the image of the next to last scene where Carter makes love and in the act discovers the truth about her love. This is so wonderful so tragic so true that it has stuck with me together with the secondary images the memories of Venice and Millie that Merton is in love with.

	schema:reviewBody "Kate Helena Bonham Carter is a young woman in love with a poor journalist Merton Linus Roache. Its Edwardian England and having no money of her own Kate lives with a wealthy aunt Charlotte Rampling who is avid to marry Kate well. Thus the beautiful lady will not be free to wed Merton or any man of her choosing if he doesn't have the goods. They meet secretly and passionately even arranging a clandestine trip to Italy. Once there the two cross paths with an extremely wealthy American Millie Alison Elliott who casts her eye on Merton. Since neither Kate nor Merton have revealed that they are a couple a difficult triangle is created for Millie also chooses Kate as a friend. This becomes even more complex when the British duo learn that Millie despite being young and beautiful is incredibly ill with a respiratory ailment. Temptation arrives. What would happen Kate asks Merton if HE romances Millie marries her and inherits her wealth upon her death? Why the secret lovers would be set for life! Merton is appalled at the idea of making advances on a dying girl but eventually gives in. What neither Kate or Merton count on is the young gentleman's growing attraction to Millie for she is sweet and funny as well as very lovely. Is tragedy in the future for this trio? Unfortunately yes. This stunningly gorgeous film based on the novel of Henry James is a superior piece of movie making that cannot be denied. The three actors Bonham Carter Roache and Elliott are extremely compelling in their difficult roles and all of the lesser cast members do fine work too. Then the setting in Italy mostly is lovely with cinematography of the very finest. Costumes too are gorgeous especially Elliott's garments and accessories. But naturally it is the powerful story of love and deception with tragic results that is the strongest asset of all. It should be stated that there are a couple of explicitly sexual scenes that might upset a few viewers. But for the majority of film fans they will be accepted as a necessary part of the story's elements. If you have never picked up this film don't delay! Wings of the Dove is a soaring achievement that should be seen by everyone who loves great cinema.".

Essentially Kate and Merton are two people who are stuck in the oeuvre of Walter Sickert and want to move upmarket into Whistler territory. But they fail and are doomed to spend the rest of their lives in squalid Camden Town scenes. Incidentally this means there are artistically valid reasons for Helena Bonham Carter getting her kit offthe final scene is pretty much Sickert's What Shall We Do for the Rent? with live actors. While this visual metaphor is superbly played out it is at the expense of James' intricate verbal edifices. The film grates when anyone opens their mouth as animated paintings the characters are literally twodimensional. This is a film which is at its best when noone is saying anything and would have worked much better as a silent movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wings of the Dove 1997Yes this is a quite indirect thoughtful movie. But it is never slow. And the acting is incredible almost as incredible as all the dresses and interior sets which will blow anyone's mind. The story by Henry James the master of indirect but probing feelings is about love of all kinds. And about being a good person really. Three of the four main leads struggle with doing the right thing and they do the right thing. The fourth struggles falters then comes forward again then falters finally by making a demand that can never be met.It's unfair to compare this kind of period movie set around 1910 even though James's book was published in 1902 to A Room with a View set in the same decade but the reason this happens is that the 1985 MerchantIvory masterpiece seemed to open up a new way of making period films filled with beauty and lingering thoughts and well feeling. Not the feeling two people have for each other but a feeling of a time and place. It so happens the star of this 1997 film Helena Bonham Carter also starred magnificently in the first one.The other star is a man Linus Roache who almost overplays his understated character by making him dry and deadpan and polite. But it works over time to help make the final few seconds of the film which are so important succeed. The third lead really in this lopsided triangle is Alison Elliott who puts in an equally subtle performance. So much of the movie is about little changes in facial expression the acting had to rise to the needs of the plot. Bonham Carter above all does this with chilling perfection.But those dresses! This is what is called Edwardian England the first decade of the 20th Century a time when modernity swept Europe with a passion Picasso and Klimt and when cars and other new technologies were surging. The styles of the dresses are part Art Nouveau with its Asian influences and part European excess a showing off of style and wealth and material sensibility. Thank god! It's just breathtaking. The interiors are likewise brimming with tiles and flowers and paintings and light of all kinds.All of this is handled with a cinematic control that reminds me of the color coordination of midcentury Technicolor films where the palette of a scene is often limited to a pair of colors. You'll see many scenes where a mix of blue and rusty orange are the only two colors in various guises and these are most common because of the hair and eyes of Elliott. The cinematography is by Eduardo Serra one of a handful of the most sumptuous contemporary shooters in film Girl with the Pearl Earring and What Dreams May Come. And he lets the light and color inhabit every scene never letting the photography get in the way. Just beautiful.So what does it mean to be a good person? Who cares with all this great acting and beautiful filming? But really you do care and it's a touching and provoking film in all its quietness. And it's not a bit obscure. Henry James never quite liked the book but I think it's because he expected more from it the themes and characters are so promising. Critics have come to see it as one of his great late novels and that much is here. Director Iain Softley takes a couple of turns that the book avoidsa little sensational talk toward the beginning and a frank and sex scene at the endand both are okay in the film but not actually in keeping with the tone of the rest of it which is about never quite showing your hand even to your closest friends. It's about waiting to speak and hiding even good intentions for fear of seeming good when in fact part of being good is simply being good not merely seeming it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wings of the Dove is a sinister fascinating love story.Helena Bonham Carter plays Kate Croy an ambitious but poor young woman who lives on the generosity of a rich aunt. Unable to live poor but not wanting to surrender to the husband her aunt is trying to find for her she hatches a genius and simple plan to let her boyfriend Merton Densher Linus Roache seduce the rich and dying American millionaire Millie Alison Elliott so that she will leave all her money to him.Carter shines in this movie and her performance is one of the main reasons to watch it. It's one of those rare performances in which all the character's thoughts and feelings are transmitted by the eyes Carter's eyes are always expressive she barely needs any dialogue.And yet Hossein Amini's screenplay is also one of the brighter aspects of the movie. I cannot judge ho well he adapted the novel since I haven't yet read it but as a movie it's a joy each dialogue is essential precise and enjoyable no words are wasted or out of place. The movie's pacing is constant deceptively calm but always filled with tension for deception is pretty much the theme of the movie how far will someone go to deceive another and what effect will it have on them? For Merton the moral consequences of the deception haunt him as he realizes he may be falling in love with Millie whereas Kate fears she may be losing her beloved's affection. Between this strange dynamic we have the innocent cheerful Millie.The movie is also a fine period piece Sandy Powell got a a muchdeserved Oscar nomination for the costume design but in truth all aspects of the movie deserve merit for their recreation of England in 1910. This movie takes us to places period movies seldom do the underground system the interior of bookshops and opiumdens the interior of museums in a wonderful sequence the characters attend a Klimt exhibition.And then there's the way Eduardo Serra's cinematography captures Venice in 1910. Serra is an underappreciated director of cinematography although he's left his mark in many memorable movies. His best work perhaps remains this movie in particular the segment taking place in Venice. The way he captures the old canals the gondolas the colors at night during Carnival the decay of the buildings the beauty of the monuments perhaps surpass the classic Death In Venice.The Wings of the Dove was a pleasant surprise an underrated movie that caught me completely by surprise with its perfection. Although it was nominated for several Oscars back in 1998 it seems time has forgotten it. That's a pity but for those who dare to give it a look it'll be a huge source of joy!".

Although it was nominated for several Oscars back in 1998 it seems time has forgotten it. That's a pity but for those who dare to give it a look it'll be a huge source of joy!";

I was expecting something along the lines of a very slow moving MerchantIvory period drama. The storyline was much more compelling than that. Through much of the film I was thinking that I've seen similar stories on soap operas and I knew how this was going to end. However midway through the film the story line ended up taking very interesting twists and turns. By the end of the film I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen. The film was lushly photographed well paced and suspenseful. It made me want to read the original source material.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not all of Henry James' work has adapted well to screen but there are three film adaptations especially that were adapted beautifully and are brilliant films in their own right. They are 1949's The Heiress my personal favourite 1961's The Innocents and this.It is hard to decide where to begin praising The Wings of the Dove but a definite starting point would be the production values. Simply put The Wings of the Dove is not only one of the most visually stunning films personally seen in recent memory but also one of the most beautiful ever strongly reminiscent of a MerchantIvory film. It's exquisitely shot especially in the Venetian scenes and the final scene between Millie and Merton the settings and period detail are so colourful and evocative and The Wings of the Dove has to contain some of the best and jawdroppingly amazing costume design in all of film. The sensitive and beautifully elegant music score and rightly restrained direction also add a great deal.Hossein Amini received an Oscar nomination for the film's script and it is not hard to see why. It is a literate deliciously dark and beautifully nuanced script that is never devoid of emotion and adapts very difficult source material remarkably cleverly and with utmost coherence. The story is deliberate in pace but dark and poignant the latter scenes being incredibly powerful emotionally and it is throughout told with complete control and respect for James' work. It also succeeds brilliantly as a mood piece the darkness poignancy and lyricism very well brought out. The characters also fascinate compellingly real and human rather than labelled just good and bad.The Wings of the Dove contains fine performances with that of Helena Bonham Carter ranking among the year's and her best her character makes some questionable decisions to put it lightly but the many nuances Bonham Carter brings to the role allows one to really sympathise with her and understand why she makes them. Allison Elliot was also charming and heartbreaking in a role that easily could have been played annoyingly or blandly in lesser hands and Linus Roache handles the hardest role of the whole film and story very very well. Charlotte Rampling Michael Gambon Elizabeth McGovern and Alex Jennings are all talented actors too and give excellent support.All in all wonderful film and one of the best Henry James film adaptations ever made. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wings of the Dove is a downbeat brooding adaptation of the Henry James classic American novel of as usual with Henry James Americans abroad. The film as the novel by the same name and almost all of James's novels is about money and status and the power they confer on the individual.Beautifully filmed the scenes of Venice steal the show and are the film's real attraction. Helena Bonham Carter is good as Kate Croy the schemer who persuades her lover Merton Densher played by Linus Roache to marry a wealthy American woman who is dying but overall the film is lackluster especially when compared with the much richer and more vibrant film by Jane Campion The Portrait of a Lady 1996.Henry James deals with subtle nuances of meaning and thought but this is not why the film fails to satisfy. James's novels have been successfully filmed before most notably by Jane Campion. In addition the very Jamesian book by Edith Wharton The Age of Innocence was adapted into a wonderful film The Age of Innocence 1993 by Martin Scorsese. If the novelistic ambiguities of Henry James are not to blame for the film's failure what is?Perhaps the actors do not fully embody James's characters as portrayed in the novel. Linus Roache for example is slightly wooden in his portrayal of the radical social activist. Is he idealistic a champion of the downtrodden or merely a shallow opportunist who becomes a victimizer?!!!!! SPOILER !!!!!Alison Elliott plays an interesting Millie Theale the American millionaire who loved both Carter and Roache and her presence is felt long after she quits the mortal scene. Strangely enough the one rather long nude scene with the beautiful Ms. Carter fails to be erotic. Instead there is a morbid air of the tomb that surrounds the couple's frantic lovemaking.The deep black darkness of the lovemaking scene suggests that the soul of the dead Millie watches over them. After all Millie was the bond that held them all together when she was alive. Her death will dissolve the bond of love and greed that unites Carter and Roache. Ultimately the love scene fails because of the unpleasant associations with Millie and becomes simply depressing.In a way the film emphasizes the point so well made in James Joyce's wonderful story from Dubliners The Dead that the dead hold power over the living. The way the film builds up to this climax is its greatest triumph. John Huston's adaptation of the James Joyce short story was his last film The Dead 1987 and a worthy addition to that director's list of masterworks.".

Yes the acting is good especially if one doesn't mind watching Helena Bonham Carter perpetually whimpering and simpering with one of her three facial expressions. The costumes were lavish and there was a lot of money spent on making the film appear to be authentically 1910. The muchtouted scenes of Venice are nothing special. The most beautiful scenes are on screen for only seconds and then it's back to the set. The sex scene near the film's conclusion is pretty gross this is the most liberal definition of R I've seen in some time. All in all this is for soap opera fans exclusively. A four hankie job.".

Remember every Christmas when I used to say 'Well looks like Aunt Bessie didn't send us a card again this year?' Oh yeah Hank says. Meanwhile Marvin the two women's bedridden father has been dying for the past twenty years. He's doing it real slow so I don't miss anything Bessie tells Dr. Wally.

	schema:reviewBody "This film took this jaded toughtomanipulate moviegoer and reduced him to a blubbering mass of water. Instead of the usual overthetop death scene the film finds a clever noncontrived way to end by leaving these characters at a magical moment of mutual understanding. It is one of the most powerful endings I've ever seen in a film and believe me I've seen thousands. What I found most remarkable about it was how the film revealsdespite the sisters' major character differenceshow similar they really are. Both abandon one part of their family to sacrifice for another partthey each merely take different parts and that's why Lee's character is not as bad selfish or onedimensional as she first seems. Lee's problem was understanding love. Despite all her lovers Lee Streep had to learn the real meaning of love from her spinster sister Bessie Keaton.The film is full of irony. One such moment is when Lee rather tactlessly says to Bessie that she finally feels as though her life has begun. To which Bessie who is surely about to die can only sigh. The greatest irony of course is that Lee finds herself at the same juncture she was 20 years prior. Will she choose to sacrifice to care for her sister just as her sister had chosen to do with her father and aunt? Bessie in contrast had come to find that she hadn't thrown it all away to care for sick relatives. What first seemed a sacrifice had become transformed through her own experience into another valid way of experiencing life. To Lee's perspective the elders where millstones hindrances inconveniences robbed of their humanityalmost the antithesis of life. Yet behind the eccentricities of Aunt Ruth Verdon and otherworldly silence of her chronically ill father Marvin Cronyn she had found and reveled in their uniquness their humanness. Making Lee's two sons very different also added complexity and depth to the film. It's obvious that Hank DiCaprio is his mother's son it's just that his mother doesn't realize it. Hank too is at a crucial moment of choice Will he abandon his selfishness or will he abandon his familial and moral obligation to help Bessie? And what accounts for the polar opposite behavior of the younger son Charlie Scardino? The movie doesn't give an answer. Genetics environment relationships and all the other things that make us who we are are complex things. The scriptwriter is smart enough to realize that. Touches of humor keep this from becoming an oppressive Bergmanesque angstfest and its patient character development steers it out of obvious soapy ie. Terms of Endearment territory. Although the thing has a sort of TVmovie aesthetic in the staging and the scoring the writing and acting are everything you'd want. Beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's such a wonderful story not at all as dreary as one would expect. The late Scott McPherson injected so much humor and heart into this film it's hard not to just go along with it. Diane Keaton got the Oscar nomination but Meryl Streep's character drives the film as she works her way back into a family she turned her back on so she could have a life of her own. She was right to do so as her sister Keaton has become consumed with caregiving for her father and aunt taking absolutely no time out for herself. The film also features a nice departure for Robert De Niro from his typically heavy roles. That alone is worth seeing and fans of his typical performances should be forced to watch this.This quiet film may not have enough action for some but it is far better than most films dealing with serious illness. The journey these sisters begin is something that has been explored in countless TV movies think Lifetime but what separates it is the humor and the character development that makes the viewer wish heshe could stay and watch the family long after the film ends. The film also benefits from the presence of Leonardo DiCaprio who gives an unlikely nuanced performance as the older son who develops some character and helps his flighty mother grow along with him. The great thing about his presence in the film is that younger viewers mostly female probably will be more likely to see this movie and get something out of it in the process.Finally a word about Gwen Verdon and Hume Cronyn. Their contributions to this film are immeasurable. And as already mentioned it's great that younger viewers can watch this film and get a last look at them in these touching roles and see how charm never fades with age. Cronyn has little to do but lie ill in bed yet somehow his character remains a focal point. And Verdon's comic relief pairing with the younger son is a real highlight. She also manages a poignant moment or two in a her scenes with Keaton. This truly is an ensemble piece and it wouldn't have been without their talent. Why I don't yet own a copy of this sweet film is a mystery.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scott McPherson adapts a beautiful screenplay from his own play. 'Marvin's Room' could have easily been just another one of those sentimental diseaseoftheweak type TV films but McPherson stays true to the story injecting it with a delightful dose of humour. The film focuses on broken relationships and how it's never too late to take the step to mend them until you're gone. The execution is simple and that works very well. The score is in sync with the flow. The writing is beautiful. The dialogues are cleverly written.Diane Keaton is marvelous in a role that could have easily turned out to be a clich if it were played by a lesser actress. She plays her part naturally with a quiet and yet layered restraint. Meryl Streep does a fine job as the slightly more rebellious and estranged sister who had escaped from having to take care of her father and is proud of her diploma. Leonardo Dicaprio isn't bad either. Robert De Niro is great in a more laidback role. He also reveals a flare for comedy. His scenes with a splendid Dan Hedaya had me laughing. Gwen Verdon is a delight and she provides excellent comic relief. Hume Cronyn doesn't have a scene out of bed but he definitely makes the viewer take note of his performance.My favourite scene is towards the end when the two sisters chat in the kitchen. Keaton's Bessie may have been 'consumed' by taking care of her ailing father and aunt not 'leading' her own life like the typical American woman but the amazing thing is that she doesn't regret it because she is proud that she has given them so much love and that she can do the same now with her sister and nephews. Then there's the ending which is superbly done. You're left wanting to know how these wonderful characters are doing but at the same time one can acknowledge that it's the best way to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marvin's room turned out to be a brilliant movie assisted well by a great performance by some veteran actors like Meryl Streep Diane Keaton Leonardo DiCaprio Robert De Niro  although he wasn't the center of attraction as he was the doctor .Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton are two sisters who have estranged each other for 20 years and Diane calls upon her sister to take care of their father as she herself realized that she was suffering from Leukemia. Leonardo portrays the character of Hank who does not get along with his mother Meryl on account of her abusive behaviour. Diane Keaton wants Meryl to take care of her Aunt Roth and their father when she would be gone. Meryl portrays a mean woman who is afraid of responsibilities and is troubled by the deliberate acts of her son Hank Leo. The movie is a beautiful depiction of how Meryl Streep decides to eventually aid her dying sister by stepping into her shoes and taking enough pluck to set things right between herself and Hank. Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep acted exceptionally well not to forget Leo. Altogether their performance was brilliant. I was touched by the movie. I'd rate it a 7 on 10. It was certainly one of the finest flicks that I've watched.".

	onyx:emotionText "Marvin's room turned out to be a brilliant movie assisted well by a great performance by some veteran actors like Meryl Streep Diane Keaton Leonardo DiCaprio Robert De Niro  although he wasn't the center of attraction as he was the doctor .Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton are two sisters who have estranged each other for 20 years and Diane calls upon her sister to take care of their father as she herself realized that she was suffering from Leukemia. Leonardo portrays the character of Hank who does not get along with his mother Meryl on account of her abusive behaviour. Diane Keaton wants Meryl to take care of her Aunt Roth and their father when she would be gone. Meryl portrays a mean woman who is afraid of responsibilities and is troubled by the deliberate acts of her son Hank Leo. The movie is a beautiful depiction of how Meryl Streep decides to eventually aid her dying sister by stepping into her shoes and taking enough pluck to set things right between herself and Hank. Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep acted exceptionally well not to forget Leo. Altogether their performance was brilliant. I was touched by the movie. I'd rate it a 7 on 10. It was certainly one of the finest flicks that I've watched.";

	schema:reviewBody "We were raised under the lie that families are and should be the epitome of perfection. Ozzie and Harriet. The Bradys. The Nelsons. However we all know that this is never the case and more often than not a trivial incident is the dividing moment where siblings decide to go their separate ways and this is the case here two sisters have been estranged for about twenty years. Bessie has stayed with her parents and has taken care of them while Lee has pursued her own interests with a marked selfishness that hides an inability to cope with familial duty and in the interim she has raised two boys of her own. Now father Marvin is ill with senile dementia and can barely muster words. Bessie has been diagnosed with leukemia and her chances of survival depends on a bone marrow transplant and only her estranged family can give her that. And on top of this Lee is having her own trouble with her oldest son Hank just burned their house down and landed in a mental institution so the thought of traveling down to Florida to visit Bessie seems less than welcome and more than an inconvenience.Bessie and Lee's reunion is appropriately awkward and filled with tension that is simmering under the surface ready to explode at any time. Like enemies they circle around each other throwing their personalities at each other and there is a confrontation scene that is inevitable but doesn't quite resolve anything. I was reminded of Ingmar Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS in which two sisters and a maid were taking care of their third sister who was dying each of them with their own baggage of selfhatred and inability to love and be open. Jerry Zaks' film is not that deep or stylized nor does it intend to be. His is an honest straightforward examination on Scott McPherson's stage play about the shadow of death lingering over one family and occasionally lapses into humor with its supporting characters. That works well because to make this a heavyhanded meditation of death especially when three of its characters are on the brink of it would be asking too much for its audience. Only its implied nature is seen here but its effect is no less devastating even if glimmers of hope seep through the fabric of this family and makes its bond tighter.Being a slice of life story characters are on center stage at all times so they must be defined through their tempers. Lee is quite a shrill woman who throughout her stay at her parents' seems on the brink of just grabbing her things and driving as fast as she could and could be a version of any of the healthy sisters in the Bergman film. Meryl Streep takes on the role against her ethereal type and uses her body language and strong voice to convey a loud woman who needs so much reassurance that she can't see a little thing as family getting in the way. On the other hand Bessie is closer to the maid's character in CRIES AND WHISPERS and Diane Keaton's portrayal is quiet thoughtful and on rare occasions only hinting at her own terror as her illness progresses.The third actor who reveals himself here is Leonardo diCaprio. He plays the troubled son Hank and his interactions are mainly with both sisters. Watch his body language with both whenever he's with Lee he's angry and borderline threatening. I get the hint that even when the credits are over they will always have a brittle relationship and this is due to Lee's own selfishness. Meanwhile Hank and Bessie break the ice and in one touching scene share a drive on the beach. Their childlike laughter speaks volumes of what their relationship would have been had there never been an estrangement. Leonardo DiCaprio tackles the role with intensity and urgency and there are a couple of moments when I thought he might resemble James Dean without the pout but the sheer anger.MARVIN'S ROOM doesn't try to give simple answers after all all families have dysnfunctions but instead is like a canvas that reveals itself for the many layers of dynamics between its players and does so in an uplifting manner much like the beautiful moment when Bessie and Lee witness Marvin's delight in seeing a display of light coming from a mirror Bessie is holding. It's a quiet moment one of intense love that shows the power of family despite the odds and what better way to end the film with Gwen Verdon's last line? Hope is all around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two sisters try to set their familial differences aside  one in hopes of saving her own life  in this drama with comic accents.Marvin's Room is a film based on the play of the same name by Scott McPherson.The play which was directed by David Petrarca was adapted for the screen by McPherson and directed by Jerry Zaks. It stars Meryl Streep Leonardo DiCaprio Diane Keaton Robert De Niro Hume Cronyn Gwen Verdon Hal Scardino and Dan Hedaya. Bessie has lived in Florida for the past 20 years where she's been caring for her chronically ill father Marvin and her Aunt Ruth who does not seem well acquainted with reality. While Bessie's life has not been easy she feels that it's rewarding in its way and she's come to love her father very much. However when Bessie is diagnosed with cancer she's told that the only treatment likely to save her would be a bone marrow transplant from a close relative  which leads Bessie to contact her sister Lee for the first time since their father fell ill. Bessie and Lee have a number of issues with each other that they've never resolved many concerning their responses to Marvin's illness as Bessie rushed to his side while Lee preferred to stay away and Lee's own life has been difficult. She's gotten herself out of a bad marriage has only recently started supporting herself as a beautician and has to raise two kids on her own. Tenyearold Charlie tries to simply ignore the chaos going on all round him while Hank a troubled 17yearold was recently institutionalized after burning down the family's home. As the straightlaced Bessie and the earthy Lee reestablish contact after two decades they discover just how much emotional ground they have to cover before they can meet on common ground. Based on a play by Scott McPherson's who died of AIDS it's impossible to watch the wellacted film particularly Diane Keaton who got an Oscar nominationas she was given a rare opportunity here to remind us that she's not simply a fine comedienne and she's marvelous.Meryl Streep Robert De Niro Leonardo DiCaprio Hume Cronyn and Gwen Verdon add to the greatness of the cast's brilliance and excellent performance.And most of allit provides great themes about the various approaches to love the strength of family bonds in times of death aging parents reconciliation and the healing power of selfless love.It was one good movie inspite of being dull and slow at times.A can't miss movie.".

Just goes to show you the kind of cast a good script can attract even for a little film.Little film big emotions. Marvin's Room is about two sisters who haven't been in touch for 20 years. Diane Keaton is Bessie the sister who stayed home and took care of her elderly relatives  her father Marvin Cronyn who is bedridden and nonverbal and her dizzy but sweet Aunt Ruth Verdon. Meryl Streep is Lee the sister who got out of Dodge Dodge being Florida got married had kids got divorced and is about to get her cosmetology license. When Bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and is told she needs a relative's bone marrow she calls Lee. Lee packs up the kids and drives to Florida so they can all be tested.The film begins with Lee's son Hank DiCaprio burning down the family dwelling and getting arrested. It's an understatement to say he's angry with his mother blaming her for the divorce. He forms a bond with his Aunt Bessie and doesn't want to leave. His mother vehemently doesn't want to stay. In their big confrontation Bessie accuses Lee of being selfish in not staying and sharing the burden of taking care of their family. I took care of my family Lee reminds her. I had a husband and children and I never heard from any of you people. This is one of those family dramas that hits home and with the boomers now in the position of taking care of their parents it's even more relevant than it was 13 years ago. Each member of the cast gives an honest and realistic performance. As the smoking nononsense nothing can touch me Lee Meryl Streep is marvelous. I have to admit that I am not always a fan of hers only because I can sometimes see her making acting choices. Lee is one role where she just IS the character. Keaton is excellent as the softer warmer more nurturing Bessie who sublimated many of her own dreams. As the rebellious teen Leonardo DiCaprio gives a wonderful performance as the confused Hank who discovers family he knew nothing about.There are two sisters and there are also two brothers  Robert DeNiro who plays Bessie's doctor Dr. Wally and Dan Hedaya the doctor's slow brother Bob who works in Wally's office. Bob isn't much help but Wally seems to tolerate him with no problem. He's family and Wally's responsibility.One scene that really cracked me up  Aunt Ruth loves soap operas and when we first see her she's watching a soap opera scene with veteran soap star John Callahan All My Children and Kelly Ripa. It's hilarious. I mention it because later on it comes into play.Jerry Zaks' directing is excellent. Just have a box of tissues nearby. It's a story about a family with lots of love underneath the problems.".

	schema:headline " Above average drama about family dynamics in the face of aging and illness";
	schema:reviewBody "Bessie is a middleaged woman who has been caring for her father Marvin since he had a stroke some twenty years earlier. Marvin is on his back in bed and cannot speak but he does have a limited understanding when spoken to. Marvin's sister Ruth is also in the household and while still in possession of her faculties and ambulatory her life seems to center around what is happening on her favorite soap operas. Bessie finds out that she has leukemia. What to do? Bessie's only hope is for a bone marrow transplant and the only possible donors are her sister Lee estranged since Marvin's stroke and Lee's two sons.Rather than concentrating on the grim details the focus is on the changes in the family dynamics precipitated by Bessie's illness. Bessie calls Lee and tells her the story and Lee packs up her two sons and takes out from Ohio to Florida. All those years ago Lee and Bessie split over Marvin's illness and care  Bessie took it over and Lee got away as fast as she could. So a good part of the movie has the sisters dealing with old wounds. A subplot concerns the relationship that develops between Bessie and Lee's rebellious seventeen year old son Hank. What raises this film above the ordinary is the great cast and some well written scenes. Streep and Keaton are in good form and play well off of each other. There are a lot of awkward and intense moments between them  I particularly liked the scene where they meet each other for the first time in twenty years. Hume Cronyn as Marvin never says a word but his presence is felt throughout the film. Leonard DiCaprio as Hank is so good that you wonder if he is playing Hank or just being himself. Playing against type Robert De Niro puts in an appearance as Bessie's somewhat maladroit doctor.What didn't work for me was the attempted comic relief. Ruth seemed just a bit too ditsy and her pain relief device operating the garage door was forced humor. De Niro's brother's role was solely to interject some dimwitted comments.Bessie's comment about how privileged she had been to have loved so deeply stuck with me. I had never stopped to think of the delight in loving as something to be valued in itself requited or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "How families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this starladen 1996 movie but stage and TV director Jerry Zaks screenwriter Scott McPherson and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant. Based on a play by McPherson before he succumbed to AIDS the semiautobiographical plot focuses on two estranged middleaged sisters. In Florida mousey spinster Bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father Marvin and their eccentric aunt Ruth. In Ohio Lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in Ohio only to see things fall apart. Lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when Bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to Lee and her sons as potential bonemarrow transplant candidates.The rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable. Intriguingly while the soap opera elements are strictly bythenumbers there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece. It also helps that Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play the sisters. As the embittered guiltridden Lee Streep moves easily back into bluecollar Silkwood territory and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her selfcentered character. However it's a vanityfree Keaton who really radiates as Bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances. A year before Titanic Leonardo di Caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as Lee's oldest son Hank a textbook example of teenaged pyromaniac angst.The rest of the cast is fine in limited turns  Robert DeNiro one of the producers as well as the bumbling Dr. Wally Dan Hedaya as his even more pixilated brother Bob Gwen Verdon as wildeyed soap operaobsessed Aunt Ruth Hal Scardino as Hank's selfcontrolled little brother Charlie and Hume Cronyn who is forced to play Marvin with severely limited expression. There are predictable moments throughout but some surprise and a few actually enthrall including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when Bessie recalls the drowning death of her openmouthed carny boyfriend. There are no extras with the 1999 DVD release.".

	schema:headline " Very quality story and acting but overshadowed by movies with better film value";
	schema:reviewBody "Marvin's Room is undoubtedly a solid film that slipped through the cracks during the slough of great films of the mid 90s getting overlooked in 1996 by Fargo and The English Patient among a few others. It's sole recognition was an academy award nomination for best actress for Diane Keaton.Keaton stars as Bessie a middleaged woman who has spent her entire life taking care of her father Marvin and Aunt Ruth who both are not mentally sound who has discovered she has leukemia. Her doctor played by Robert DeNiro informs her that her only chance of survival is if she can convince her sister Meryl Streep who she has not spoken to in 20 years or nephews Hank Leonardo DiCaprio and Charlie who she has never met. The drama that ensues is all built around the family tension as Streep's character Lee has not spoken with Bessie because she refused to help take care of their father.Keaton and Streep both deliver fantastic performances and we even get a taste of preTitanic DiCaprio. The performances make the movie which is simply the play put on the silver screen which comes as no surprise when the playwright Scott McPherson is also responsible for the screenplay. Keaton's honesty and innocence due to her living her life as her father's aid are incredibly apparent in everything she does and Streep clearly lets Lee's rollercoaster ride of different emotions become apparent at every stop.The film's weaknesses lie mostly in the deeper thematic areas. The symbolism felt much more appropriate for the stage where from a film perspective there was nothing very active about the plot aside from a few moments. Most of it is dialogue and hitting on themes through character interaction which is vital in the theatre but not as effective in film. So those that love the theatre will find Marvin's Room very good for those reasons but those who have a deeper love of film will find something missing from this story despite the stellar acting and touching story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This drama was a surprising good one. The story might sound overdramatic and sappy but the execution of it all is surprising good. The director chooses an approach with lots of humor present. It makes Marvin's Room a well balanced drama that despite its heavy subject never feels overdone or gets too heavy to watch.It's sort of too bad that this movie is always sort of regarded to as a Leonardo DiCaprioflick. Its a movie from the period when he wasn't a well known male Hollywood lead yet. The mainstream audience had yet to discover him which they did a year later with Titanic while certain smaller groups of movie viewers already discovered this great young talent in movies such as What's Eating Gilbert Grape The Quick and the Dead and Romeo  Juliet. This movie however deserves so much more than just being regarded as as a Leonardo DiCaprioflick. I'm sure of the fact that this movie is regarded as such scares lots of people of from watching this movie mainly Titanic haters. Yes Leonardo DiCaprio is in the movie but no he doesn't play the main lead or a pretty boy which he more often did in his later movies which are the reason why he also has so many haters all over the world. So really if you're not a fan of DiCaprio's later movies after 1997 you'll most likely still enjoy this movie. So please just give this movie a chance it's certainly worth it.I was not sure what to expect from this movie. The story sounded overdramatic. It's the sort of story were one problem is not enough. Basically every characters has several problems and issues. A movie like this can easily go overthetop or it can get too sappy and overdone. I'm glad to say that the movie however surprised me and surpassed my expectations. Because of the fact that the movie is told with quite some humor it doesn't make the movie an heavy one. Sure there are plenty of dramatic scene's still present in the movie but it all is extremely well balanced all. It never gets too heavy but it also never gets too humorous either. It makes both the drama and the humor work out really well in the movie.It also certainly helps the movie that there are lots of stars present in it. They make the characters and events feel more likely and realistic. Meryl Streep is perhaps one of the best actresses of all time although this role is certainly not her best one but I think that says more about Streep herself rather than her performance in this movie. Of course Diane Keaton is no lightweight either. She delivers a powerful performance. Also Leonardo DiCaprio shows that he is more than just a pretty face. A smaller role is there for Robert De Niro. It's the sort of role basically everyone could play and it doesn't make a very big or lasting impression so don't expect much of him when watching this movie. The only reason why he plays a small role in this movie is because he also was one of the producers for this movie. But if you take away all those great actors would this still had been such a good movie to watch? I don't think so. At certain moments while watching this movie I even wondered why all those famous actors ever agreed to be in this movie. I think that the movie had some great casting persons and some powerful influential producers. It probably also had to do with the director Jerry Zaks who was a very successful award winning Broadway director prior to this movie. Perhaps he also had already worked with some of the stars out of this movie? But really the story on its own is not good or powerful enough to carry the entire movie or make it an incredible interesting or emotional powerful one. So on its own the movie is a pretty empty and formulaic one but it is made interesting good and powerful thanks to the wonderful cast and refreshing directing and approach by Jerry Zaks.Of course this movie is mainly for the lovers of drama movies but everyone should be able to appreciate and enjoy this movie thanks to its approach of the heavy themes and the professional cast playing the characters.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed by MGM on the same sets as the English version but in German Garbo's second portrayal of Anna Christie benefited from practice and her apparent ease with German dialog. Garbo appears more relaxed and natural under Jacques Feyder's direction than under Clarence Brown's and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared which made her transition to sound complete. The strength she brought to the character remains here although it has been softened and Garbo reveals more of Anna's vulnerability. The entire cast with the exception of Garbo is different from the previous version of the film and Garbo benefits from not having to compete with Marie Dressler who stole every scene she was in during the Englishlanguage version. In Feyder's film Garbo holds the center of attention throughout although the three supporting players particularly the father gave excellent performances.Feyder's direction was more assured than Clarence Brown's and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of Brown. The film moves with more fluidity than the English language adaptation and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest. Even William Daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the Brown version. He captured Garbo's luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style. Also the screenplay adaptation for the European audience made Anna's profession quite clear from the start and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the Brown filming. However the film was made before the Production Code was introduced which made the censorship puzzling.Garbo's Oscar nomination for Anna Christie was always somewhat mystifying and I suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance. However some of the Academy voters may have seen the Germanlanguage version of the film and they realized as will contemporary viewers that her Anna Christie under Feyder's direction was definitely Oscar worthy.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Garbo's introduction to sound in Clarence Brown's Anna Christie Jacques Feyder made a German version of the movie where all of the cast except for Garbo were different. While the American version is still more available in the USA and most of the American viewers have primarily seen this version the Germna Anna Christie is more likely to be viewed in Europe. As I have seen both films I feel the right to compare the two closelyknit productions. Is Jacques Feyder's film different? Is it better than Clarence Brown's? In this analysis I would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common. They have identical sets very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes. Here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life. Here you also have the humorous though a bit shorter sequence in the amusement park. However when emphasizing Garbo herself I address the first difference. She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking. The viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to 1931 viewers. Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here. Yet to me she seems even more genuine in the German version. It is noticeable that Garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much the effort that was artificially created by the sensation GARBO TALKS!. Her German is not very well pronounced yet no one cares everything is perfectly understood. Therefore I can easily say the same I did in my American version comment Skaal Greta Garbo! Yet the film differs in one very important issue the rest of the cast. Here comes the question which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure? The differences are filled with varieties. Salka Viertel or Salka Steuerman Garbo's lifelong friend does not do the equally great job as Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy Owens. She is not bad she is different sometimes overacts from today's perspective but is no longer that genuine in the role as Marie Dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time. Some people even claim that Dressler was better than Garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth. Theo Shall is more sympathetic as Matt than Charles Bickford but when applied to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks.Who shines in the German Anna Christie who is really worth greatest attention is Hans Junkermann in the role of Chris Christopherson Anna's father. George F. Marion vs Hans Junkermann is like a day vs night difference. Junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict a man with hopes with fears who overdoes the care of his daughter. The scene of Anna's first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of Chris' conversation with Marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance. Junkermann is the Chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you sympathize with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind. Great! If you have seen the American Anna Christie and have a chance to get the German version I would highly recommend to you this movie because it's a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine enrichment to Clarence Brown's movie and foremost a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance Hans Junkermann's. Skaal or Prost Hans Junkermann!".

Garbo is if anything more commanding or more beautiful as a screen presence and her acting is more restrained. And she seems frankly more at ease probably for a lot of reasons but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture so had adjusted quickly.Without comparing always one film to the other this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with too many words. His themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway. There are some scenes missingthe Coney Island section is shortened and isn't as goodbut overall it's a direct echo of the first film. The director Jacques Feyder BelgianFrench is simply redoing what was done already which I assume must be a frustrating experience.It's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way not only the sets but the shots are all the same. There is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier filmsome of the storm understandably but also a brief scene where Marie Dressler from the English language version is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal drunk as can be. But they are just silhouettes and when the next scene shows their faces we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no replacing Dressler for sure but for me the German father is more believable and honest in his performance.Clearly the themesimmigration wayward fathers daughters turning to prostitution and the troubles of finding true lovehave strong currents back then especially with European threads.

Even the past two years hadn't been easy for Garbo's or anyone else's films to be seen there.But early in the sound era it was the tradition of several studios to make foreign language versions of their films. Garbo's sound debut in Anna Christie was accompanied by a German language version with an entirely different cast of players. All were imported from Europe. Playing Charles Bickford's part is Theo Shall and playing George Marion's role is Hans Junkermann. I noted that both had substantial careers in the German cinema. It must have been at some expense for MGM to import these people to America but MGM had a lot invested in Garbo and they wanted her career in sound to last.Salka Viertel better known as a writer played Marie Dressler's role and she stayed in America.

	schema:reviewBody "I agree with Greta Garbo. I think the German version is most definitely superior to Metro's English language attempt to bring O'Neill's heroine to the screen. For one thing she has a better script here and  dare I say it  a better support cast. For a start it was certainly a bright idea to jettison the timewasting introductory scene between Chris and Marthy. We now pick them up as they wend their way to the Lady's Entrance of the waterfront dive in which Herman Bing now officiates. Pleasingly Bing's part has been built up and it's fascinating to see him handle a good dramatic role  even if it does mean standing in the background for most of the time. Just his very presence lends color to a scene. I see that most everyone agrees that our hero here Theo Shall is much more accomplished  and indeed charismatic  than Charles Bickford. That would not be difficult. Bickford had barely started his movie career at this stage. Anna Christie was his fourth of around eightyfive movies. But I also thought that Hans Junkerman was more convincing and far more communicative than George F. Marion and that Salka Viertel was at least the equal of the scenestealing but just a little too pushy Marie Dressler who tends to overact. Salka was less charismatic but far more convincing. Available on an excellent Warner Archive DVD.".

We now pick them up as they wend their way to the Lady's Entrance of the waterfront dive in which Herman Bing now officiates. Pleasingly Bing's part has been built up and it's fascinating to see him handle a good dramatic role  even if it does mean standing in the background for most of the time. Just his very presence lends color to a scene. I see that most everyone agrees that our hero here Theo Shall is much more accomplished  and indeed charismatic  than Charles Bickford. That would not be difficult. Bickford had barely started his movie career at this stage. Anna Christie was his fourth of around eightyfive movies. But I also thought that Hans Junkerman was more convincing and far more communicative than George F. Marion and that Salka Viertel was at least the equal of the scenestealing but just a little too pushy Marie Dressler who tends to overact. Salka was less charismatic but far more convincing. Available on an excellent Warner Archive DVD.";

Maybe because it was in her native language maybe because of the different actors or maybe it was the fact that it was so familiar at that point never the less this is the version to see. When Garbo makes her screen entrance in the 1930 version she looks gorgeous but in the 1931 version she looks like death warmed over and hating the world while at the same time looking like she could have been the most beautiful women in the world once in her life.

This movie stays true to the actual play and is able to convey the intensity of the story. And this happens because there is no ambiguity over Anna Christie's profession and this is key to the entire plot. Candidly showing Anna for what she is intensifies the subsequent interactions between her and the other characters thus strengthening the movie. Also the actors who play Chris and Matt perform their roles well and in a far less stagy style. That the movie is in German also lends it a more realistic quality in that all the key characters are Europeans. For this movie is not only about a woman confronting personal issues it's also about immigrants dealing with separation from their own home lands. One further point in this movie Greta Garbo is absolutely beautiful and proves her strength and versatility as an actress and artist.".

Fortunately Turner Classic Movies recently showed this German language version and I found it was a bit better than the English language one.First some background about the German language version. I don't say German version because this one was actually made in the USA by MGM. Why would MGM do thisusing the same leading lady?! Well it seems that once the studios switched to sound they missed all the money they'd made in foreign sales and tried something very radical. Instead of using subtitles or redubbing the film MGM actually made multiple versions of its most popular stars' films. Aside from this Garbo version MGM made many Laurel Hardy in Italian Spanish French and German! And like the Garbo film these other versions were quite different from the American versionswith mostly foreign languagespeaking supporting actors filling in for the normal supporting actors! So why did I like it more than Garbo's other Anna Christie? Well the story was close but I noticed two main differences. First because German standards and morality were different from that in the States the German version is much more explicit in saying that Anna had worked in a brothel though this word and the word 'prostitute' were still not used. In the regular American version this was much much more vagueand made the story seem a bit silly. The German version explains a lot and makes more sense. Second while I adore the films of Marie Dressler she was NOT a positive addition to the English language version as she played the part a bit broadermore for laughs.

	schema:reviewBody "Anna Christie is a an American Germanlanguage movie from 1930 so this one was made between the two big wars and to be precise 3 years before the Nazis came into power in Germany. It runs for approximately 80 minutes and it was directed by Belgian filmmaker Jacques Feyder. There exist two versions of this movie from the same year and the Englishlanguage version is from another director and with other actors a nonGerman cast except lead actress Greta Grbo who turned into a big Hollywood star around that time and was nominated for an Oscar for the Englishlanguage version. She scored two nominations that year but lost out to Norma Shearer. In here Garbo plays a woman who worked as a prostitute in the past and with these shadows still luring upon her she tries to reconcile with her dad and a new man enters her life who is obviously also very concerned with the past of his girl especially if you take into account how 85 years ago morals and values were something entirely different compared to today. Garbo looks pretty attractive but I still felt she came off as way older than in her mid20s. And she sounded older too. Maybe it was intended to show that the characters has aged a lot more compared to other woman from her age group. As a whole I must say I was not really wellentertained with this film let alone impressed with Garbo's performance of the title character. She sure has great screen presence and charisma but I also felt that moments of overacting were way too frequent for my liking. Then again this was generally a problem back then. Convincing subtlety was really rare but it was even worse in the days of silent film. My final verdict The negative outweighs the positive. I do not recommend the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nag nag nag that is what is happening when Uwe Boll is making a new movie. It is a must to break down flicks made by Uwe Boll but not for this reviewer. I don't like all his flicks but if it does deliver something then you must admit that too and just don't walk with the crowd to say I hate it. Bloodrayne 3 as we can state it is indeed a downfall towards the 'names' of the actors. Face it part one had Kristanna Loken Terminator 3 and Ben Kingsley Ghandiin the leading role. In fact storywise it doesn't follow the line it had in part 1 it's more a flick on his own. It was filmed back to back with Blubberella that film really was a turkey but Bloodrayne 3 was rather okay. Were it leaves for example the script of the original one is that here we do have e lot of nudity even on the part of Rayne this time played by Natassia Malthe as seen in Bloodrayne 2 and Lake Placid. She did well and by saying that I mean the acting was okay but don't think to see an Oscar performance. Some shots that you will see are exactly copied in Blubberella like for example the scene at the whore house were Rayne takes a guy by his balls while he's messing up a whore. The idea of taking the story to the Nazis makes it a bit cheesy for some but what if I say Dead Snow there we had zombie Nazis too but it worked due the gore added to the scenes. And that's maybe what Bloodrayne 3 lacks the amount of blood. Oh yes it do flows but it is always in the same way slashing offcamera and you see blood sputtering before the camera. Just one gory shot was added one soldier intestines are cut out maybe the scene with the vampire on the table being cut open by the doctor is worth mentioning. I was also surprised by the nudity added in this flick a lot of titties are shown even those of Rayne and a small lesbian love scene was added too. I enjoyed it and the flick was over just before you know it clocking in at 75 minutes. Bloodrayne won't be Underworld but that's a fact of money. Some CGI was added and didn't bother me at all. Simple story and one maybe to watch with your boozer friends.Gore 25 Nudity 25 Effects 25 Story 25 Comedy 05".

	onyx:emotionText "Nag nag nag that is what is happening when Uwe Boll is making a new movie. It is a must to break down flicks made by Uwe Boll but not for this reviewer. I don't like all his flicks but if it does deliver something then you must admit that too and just don't walk with the crowd to say I hate it. Bloodrayne 3 as we can state it is indeed a downfall towards the 'names' of the actors. Face it part one had Kristanna Loken Terminator 3 and Ben Kingsley Ghandiin the leading role. In fact storywise it doesn't follow the line it had in part 1 it's more a flick on his own. It was filmed back to back with Blubberella that film really was a turkey but Bloodrayne 3 was rather okay. Were it leaves for example the script of the original one is that here we do have e lot of nudity even on the part of Rayne this time played by Natassia Malthe as seen in Bloodrayne 2 and Lake Placid. She did well and by saying that I mean the acting was okay but don't think to see an Oscar performance.

During the fight leather clad half human Vampire half human Rayne Natassia Malthe takes out Nazi Commandant Ekert Brand Michael Par but is shot in the process  her Vampire blood mixes with Brand's human blood which revives him as a powerful Vampire with all the immunities that Rayne has. Brand turns to Nazi mad scientist Doctor Mangler Clint Howard to assist him through his transformation Brand wants to capture the powerful Rayne to collect her blood so Adolf Hitler can drink it  become an all powerful  immortal Vampire!This American Canadian  German coproduction was coproduced  directed by Uwe Boll  is the third entry in the Bloodrayne franchise which originally started life as a video game the first Bloodrayne 2005 isn't that bad actually  might even be described as alright  while I can't really remember Bloodraye Deliverance 2007 I doubt it was any worse than this. The first Bloodrayne was set in 18th Century Romania Bloodrayne Deliverance was set in 1880 in the American wild west while the script here opts to place Rayne in 1940's Europe during World War II fighting Nazi's no less  ultimately the so silly it's fun concept of trying to stop Adolf Hitler from becoming an immortal Vampire. With a story as outrageous as that surely Bloodrayne The Third Reich can't fail but be awesome right? Well wrong because it's a rather talky  bland film with a boring plot that only hints about the Hitler plan every clich in the book is used  even the action  gore setpieces are totally forgettable. Bloodrayne The Third Reich could have been a cult trash classic instead it's a boring  silly mess that only last's for 70 minutes but feels a lot longer  every piece of potential the concept had is wasted. The dialogue alternates between bland  downright hilarious it's obvious this was written by someone whose native tongue is not English  doesn't really care about treating World War II the Nazi's  death camp's with any sensitivity.To give Bloodtrayne The Third Reich some credit it does look quite nice Natassia Malthe reprising the role of Rayne for the second time is hot but she is given little to do other than swing her sword's during the tame  repetitive fight scenes. The 1940's period is well realised  the costumes locations  props look authentic enough. There's not a lot of gore here there's a fair amount of blood splatter but not much actual nastiness. Boll throw's in some nudity  a couple of sex scenes sure they kept me from losing total interest but they hardly save the film. Released in the US in both 'R' rated  'Unrated' versions there is no difference between the two at all other than the Unrated DVD has more extra features. Had the working title Bloodrayne 3 Warhammer  was retitled to The Blood Reich Bloodrayne 3 when released here in the UK on DVD.The IMDb says that Bloodrayne The Third Reich had a budget of about 10000000 which I think is total crap you can probably knock at least one zero off that. Filmed in Zagreb in Croatia. The acting isn't great as mentioned earlier Malthe looks hot so I assume that was the reason behind her casting rather than her thespian skills. Great to see veteran actor's Michael Par  Clint Howard over 300 acting credits between them with Howard boasting over 200 film credits turn up although they are obviously slumming it Clint Howard's Nazi uniform looks about five sizes too big for him! I won't mention their German accents either...Bloodrayne The Third Reich is a mixed bag at times it's silly  unintentionally funny while at other's it's a total bore but some sex a hot looking leather clad babe in the lead  some fun to be had at Michael Par  Clint Howard's expense means it's not a total disaster  bad movie fans should gain some pleasure from it the short 70 minute running time helps too.".

Rayne and one of her companions we're captured and we're being escorted to Hitler. Along the way there was a sex scene between the two captives again unnecessary and afterwards they we're rescued very easily  TOO EASILY. The rest of the movie just ends awkwardly after that.The major issue with the movie is that Uwe Boll has yet to read up on Vampire Folklore  Rayne is HalfVampire a Dhampir. Most of the scenes happen during the Daytime. A Dhampir is STILL Vulnerable to Daylight yet Rayne receives no damage at all from the sun in any part of this movie.End of Spoilers This movie has more problems than the last two and it just doesn't take itself seriously enough to be enjoyable. Uwe Boll took something unpolished added some unnecessary sex scenes gave it a title and told us to like it.If you enjoy watching these kind of movies and don't care how weak the plot is then this movie is for you.If you are the kind of person who enjoys watching real movies you can skip this one.".

The heroine by the way never actually wears those painted on pants. Ever. Sorry. This movie is neither bad enough to be good nor is it passable as late night brain dead viewing.

If I hadn't heard the director mention on the DVD's audio commentary that there was lack of time and money I'd still have noticed it easily from the quality jumps. At the beginning you think this is going to be Schindler's List II or something like that slowly enough building up the atmosphere before it's unfortunately too rushed afterwards. There are some brilliant scenes my favorite is when the doctor says about the vampire This creature no longer has any bond to the moral laws of Man  while he is just cutting him it? to pieces alive! That tells you more about what inhuman means than some highly acclaimed movies did inability to realize how evil it all really is. However there are some downfalls after that especially the fight scenes are less spectacular than some in the previous two movies and Bloodrayne's character isn't developed much pretty much a ball in a pinball machine same player shoots again... Actually the bad guys are more interesting especially the lieutenant who is in doubt whether he should follow the doctor and the commandant afraid they might turn him into a vampire too. I voted 776 for the three movies.".

There are some brilliant scenes my favorite is when the doctor says about the vampire This creature no longer has any bond to the moral laws of Man  while he is just cutting him it? to pieces alive! That tells you more about what inhuman means than some highly acclaimed movies did inability to realize how evil it all really is. However there are some downfalls after that especially the fight scenes are less spectacular than some in the previous two movies and Bloodrayne's character isn't developed much pretty much a ball in a pinball machine same player shoots again... Actually the bad guys are more interesting especially the lieutenant who is in doubt whether he should follow the doctor and the commandant afraid they might turn him into a vampire too. I voted 776 for the three movies.";

	schema:headline " Very Good!";
	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning I'd like to say I'm sick and tired of this silly antiBoll mania and you should be too. So I want to review this film without the clich of obligatory insults targeted at the infamous director. First of all I'd like to point out that some of socalled reviews including the socalled very first web review reported on IMDb are from the people who obviously haven't seen the movie at all!! The made up the reviews based only on the trailer. That's a crime of internet journalism. Shame on you. But let's get to the film shall we? Bloodrayne The Third Reich is the third chapter of Uwe Boll's saga based on games about halfhuman halfvampire. The first film was set during Middle Ages the second in Old West times this time we're in the dark days of The Second World War. We find Rayne beautiful Natassia Malthe reprising her role from the previous film somewhere on the Eastern Front fighting side by side with the rebels against Nazis. The film is an action horror with some hot scenes and good thrills. I found it very interesting. Firstly there is a certain pseudodocumentary feel to the film which gives it a fresh breath. It's not yet another plasticfantastic super colorful Hollywood blockbuster. The atmosphere is dark and depressing and it feels real. On this craftfully designed background the director and writer paint the wolf pack of very interesting bigger than life characters. There's Rayne  deadly dangerous and yet very sexy. She's a true warrior but also a woman who hides under the iron shelter a human heart. There's the crazy Dr Mangler played by Clint Howard in a top form and Nazi Commandant Michael Pare who accidentally becomes daywalking vampire thanks to Rayne's own blood. It's a treat to see those persons because they are very charismatic strong big. Whoever said anything bad about the acting in this movie hasn't seen it or doesn't understand what kind of a movie Bloodrayne The Third Reich is. It's an escapist violent sexy fun movie not a period costume drama with ambitions to get Academy Awards. C'mon if don't like the performances here what can you tell about the performances in for instance Iron Man 2? I don't think that Mickey Rourke overacted his role in IM2 and in the same way I don't think Clint Howard overacted his role in BR3. These characters are supposed to be archetypes caricatures supervillains. So in my opinionacting here is top notch. Especially Natassia Malthe is very believable as a super humansuper vampire with her almost ballet like moves during the fights. I don't need to say she is very beautiful because it's obvious but also she does have big acting talent. Look at her more quiet scenes or even her voiceover in BR3. She is perfect here. If you look at her role on the paper  this is a very tough role to play without being unintentionally funny or fake. Malthe plays her role extremely good real and  although I do like Kristana Loken from the first Blodrayne movie  I have to say Natassia is the perfect Rayne. Last but not least I'd like to stress out that Natassia has some very cool sensual scenes in this movie and she decided to do some nudity something totally rare in her career for this movie and for this role. Thank You Natassia. You're the best!!! Clint Howard is funny and every scene with him as the evil soulless doctor archetype is funny like hell. Michael Pare does a good job and still has this special charisma of his. So we have interesting settings very good actors and thirdly good directing. As far as directing goes  it's a movie with a certain style the further evolution of naturalistic Bloodrayne 2' style. It's nice to see Uwe Boll is making progress with his every new movie. The action scenes the suspense even erotic scenes are well crafted and directed. You can notice how Boll step by step becomes the master of using natural lights in a clever way plays more and more with the depth of perception and tries unusual palette of colors. If you add dynamic montage and very powerful music you have five reasons to give Bloodrayne The Third Reich a chance. So is this a perfect little movie? Of course not. There are some mistakes here and there and the bigger budget could help. But it's is the best DVD premiere movie in the recent years and the best film in Bloodrayne saga so far.All to all Don't trust all those people who basically say every Boll's film is a bad filmbecausedohit's film from Uwe Boll. Bloodrayne The Third Reich is worth a try. It's better than most of Vampire Slayer flicks. Although a small budget film  it's far far better than for example Underworld 3 Perfect Creature Daywalkers Lost Boys 2  3.".

	schema:reviewBody "Uwe Boll strikes again. The Third Reich is the third film in the Bloodrayne franchise set this time in Europe during WW2. What drew me in wasn't that I was a fan of the films or even Boll but the concept of a war torn backdrop with Nazis tackling the supernatural in the shape of a vampire. Even with a bad reputation these premises I would gladly take the risk. However The Third Reich was a risk not worth taking. In 1943 Europe during WW2 Rayne and a group of resistance fighters take on Nazi commandant Ekart Brand turned daywalker who plan to grant Hitler immortality. While I was mildly amused by first two films this entry was utterly dull with a constantly stilted if rambling script with too little action to compensate it. Boy did Clint Howard's German scientist have plenty to say very laborious too. For most part it's talky and with such a daft and lazy script these characters sure do like to use phrases and sayings best little was said but Boll thought otherwise. It just meanders from one shot to another. Natassia Malthe returns as Rayne rather sexedup just look at her outfit oozing with confidence and angst but a little more whinny than I remembered. Again her dialogues were often cringelike but when it came to the action choreography her sword skills do deliver on the mobility and carnage. Although the gun combats felt sluggish in its staginess. Also she does get her gear off where Boll throws in random lesbian eroticism. Michael Pare monstrously hams it up as the German commandant who's turned by Rayne. Interesting concept which can't hide the fact it's on the cheap and downright junky. Gotta love Rayne's nightmare sequence involving Hitler.Fking Nazis.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my god! What went wrong here? The first Bloodrayne movie was actually quite good. Then part 2 came out and it was a notch down the ladder. Now this Bloodrayne The Third Reich is out and it is about to hit rock bottom! The story in the movie is actually good enough most parts of it anyway. There were certain aspects of the movie that was just too corny and too unnecessary.Alright well lets delve into the acting. For most parts the acting was good enough but then in the opposite end there was so really horrendous acting as well. Clint Howard playing doctor Mangler words doesn't even begin to describe his performance. It was like watching a leech trying to scale a wall it was dull and uninspiring. The lead role of Rayne was played by Natassia Malthe. Her acting was adequate but come on we all know why she was hired for this. She is hot and kicks ass and that pretty much sums it up.Set in the period of the 1940's during World War II you are wondering why the Germans in the movie are all speaking English. I hate that in movies get into character and have the Germans speak German. It just works on a grander scale. Having them speak semibroken English with a flatulent accent not so much. That really brought the movie down a notch for me.Something else that brought down the movie was Rayne's costume. Now sure it was stunningly hot and sexy. But this is the 1940's no one wore that kind of outfit back then vampire or human! That was just over the top and it really brought the movie down. It was out of place and time! Don't just have a costume in a movie because it looks hot it is just too lame! As for the German's costume well hats off for that lots of nice touches and details there. So that worked well enough.Another thing that shouldn't have made it to the movie was the lesbian love scene. Come on! Most people don't want to watch that! It was too much! And again this was the 1940's I am pretty sure people weren't openminded as people are today. Again it just seemed out of place and almost turned the movie into a softcore porn. That was just too much!One thing that did work for the movie however was the sets and the details put into the sets. It was like I would believe the 40's Germany would be like and the emotional state that the country had would be like.For a movie in the Bloodrayne legacy Uwe Boll managed to take that whole concept and totally screw it up. The end result of this movie was bad! I didn't even make it to the end. I gave up about twothirds into the movie. I was fed up with its tacky nonsense. And I had looked forward to this liking the first part so I thought it had to be better than part 2 but no I was disappointed.Uwe Boll have some good movies to his name and also some bad movies Bloodrayne The Third Reich adds to the list of bad movies! If you like watching a woman in hot totally out of the time period costume and with way too much cleavage going on then this movie might be something for you though.".

I was really happy with myself with that decision because the movie had no substance what so ever and I really don't have that high standards.The movie started out fair. There was action and it was okay for a low budget movie. But after the fighting was done 23minutesI just got bored. The plot really did'nt work for me and I just wondered how one could mess up a day walker vampire fights evil nazivampires. Instead of saying that you should'nt watch this movie I would suggest you too wait till it is on the television and when you get to the scene where the mad evil nazi doctor appear make a decision whether to watch the rest or to spend your time elsewhere. The movie won't be getting any better this point forward.".

Bloodrayne 3 offers pseudo documentary gorilla filming style and it sets the dark mood of World War II very good. What you won't see in this movie is a bunch of wooden stakes being pounded into hearts or garlic being waved in a pointy toothed person's face. Instead you have beheadings knife stabbing and a lot of cool deaths. If you're just looking for some fun in a dark disturbed world of Rayne heavy metal loving gods BloodRayne 3 delivers.

But this film is way better at least it try to capture more of the original game.I am an huge fan of the games so i will review this title as a game adaptation.First of all Rayne. OK she is not like she should be still but there is major improvement on her look. Her costume look better than in the second film she dosen't have the red hair but at least have red part... The way her costume is made she seem to have much bigger boobs which is a good point and altought i am disappointed she used ordinary sword instead of the trademark sword of the game at least she do use swordsecond movie was all about guns I still think Natassiaa good actress that i really like is not meant to be Rayne but Mynceeven tough she never appeared in the movies Rayne should be like a bright red hair version of Magda of this movie for example. She is supposed to have green eyes look more European than Asian.Fight scenes are correct nothing exceptional but not bad either.Story well its correct wish it could have been closer to the game too but well we will settle with this i guess. It was entertaining enough so i could have fun trough it.OVERALL this is still a direct to DVD Boll Product so its low budget its Boll... lol what can i say BR was i guess never big enough to have a big Hollywood block buster movie. I don't know why they never wanted to do it with the game setting. Same costume same look same characters and stories. Of course twickle it but still use the game overall style.Anyway i guess having this is still better than nothing and like i said this movie redeem a little bit the 2 previous bad movies made about BR.And to finish Rayne using a little bit of her trash talk is really good to see this is from the game at least and Natassia nude scene was ....huuuum delicious.".

This film is fast and interesting and there's my all time fav actor in it Michael Pare. He plays the new damphir half vampirehalf human here and you can see he has a lot of fun with this role. His best scene is when he confronts Rayne near the end of the movies and tries to drink her blood. Very crazy stuff. Bloodrayne 3 is full of surprises and is rather unusual very dramatic and gore yet still fun. It's not a film for the guys with weak stomachs but I always say scary movie should be scary.

Rayne and Nathaniel Brendan Fletcher the local resistance leader must teamup to stop Brand's plans.This film has all the hallmarks of a Uwe Boll film. The acting is terrible especially Clint Howard who speaks his lines in English with an incredibly stupid German accent. It is pity there wasn't anyone on the set who might have been able to help the actors sound a bit more authentically German. The resistance fighters are a spectacularly unimpressive bunch of terrible actors. I couldn't believe it when one character was supposed to be a genius codebreaker just 'cos Boll read a book about the Enigma machine and other cool war stuff and shoved it in the script for no reason at all. Boll also indulges himself in a lengthy soft core lesbian sex scene just because.Like in all badly written films the Nazi troops can't hit anything unless the script calls for a character to be injured. Even the vampire Nazis died very easily. For a vampire film there were not enough vampires and the vampires Nazis and vampire Nazis never ever seemed a credible threat at all.This is not the worst film I have ever seen but it is badly written directed edited and acted.

The rest of the cast gave outstanding performances as this movie was a true joy to watch. All around it was excellent in every aspect and is a movie I will enjoy watching again and again.

Ingrid Bergman is riveting and enigmatic  does a great job with portraying a deeply hurt woman underneath a cold stoney vengeful exterior. My palms began to sweat and I felt like I was suffocating during the scene where Anthony Quinn's character tries to leave the town on the train...an excellent mob scene that develops slowly and builds allowing you to feel Quinn's terror helplessness and entrapment. Bergman is clearly the most stellar of the cast her acting is bionic femme fatale and she looks phenomenal in her multimillionaress outfits. Yes there are some weaker spots but I think if one over analyzes any movie one is able to find something worthy of criticism. Just sit back and enjoy The Visit.".

The Visit is one of these movies unfortunately not available on video or DVD. The story is of a poor young girl who leaves a mythical country in Europe Bergman only to return years later as the richest woman in the world! The way the movie opens is with a train going across the landscape which adds to the suspense because of the title of the film and the town in this mythical country is very anxious and glad that Karla is coming to visit them since they are poverty stricken. A rare gem the story is solid and interestingnot like the critics said about it being choppy and hard to followand Ms. Bergman's costumes are an eyeful. Anthony Quinn is her leading man and together they both deliver more than fine performances Ms. Bergman's being the strongest. If you ever see this film you won't regret it. Put a tape in your VCR to record yourself a copy as The Visit is a haunting film with moral issues that are unusual for the time in which it is filmed. This is one you will want to see definitely more than once. You've never seen Ingrid Bergman like this before!!!".

It did get a minor Oscar nomination but I thought both the story and Ingrid were superb.The Visit came out in 1964 late for a black and white film and perhaps that helped limit its success. I can see why that might've been done for artistic rather than economic reasons though. It is a character study of two main characters Ingrid's and an old flame played by Anthony Quinn who also coproduced and many lesser ones and all of their lights and darks are perhaps magnified by watching in black and white.And it has my favorite of all plot devices which it uses very well. I'd tell you what but that might ruin it.I do recommend this one  and if you have Fox Movie Channel it's on again next week today being 7905. Twice.".

I saw the Lunts play the leads their theater farewell when I was 17 and still remember the play especially the ending vividly. I've seen Kander and Ebb's stab at a musical version as well. The play is a kind of dark parable or fairy tale about vengeance and the ways love can be perverted into something horrible. Claire has a line about her love growing gnarled and twisted like the roots of the trees in the forest where she made love to Schill as a girl. The film simply doesn't work. Perhaps in 1964 there was no way to get Durrenmatt's ending past what remained of the censors. Also the film looks pretty bad obviously shot on the cheap in eastern Europeand the only available DVD in the US is a panandscan version of the original 2351 BW print.".

Now she offers a fortune one million to Guellen and another million to be shared by the residents provide they execute Serge. What will the population do? The Visit is an unknown only 990 votes in IMDb masterpiece of revenge with one of the most acid ironical and cynical stories ever shown in a film. Ingrid Bergman performing an evil resented woman is a role totally unusual for this beautiful actress. The screenplay is excellent with an unexpected plot point with the revelation of the true intention of Karla. She explores the weak moral of a needy and greedy population. The conclusion is impressive. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Visita The Visit".

Now she offers a fortune one million to Guellen and another million to be shared by the residents provide they execute Serge. What will the population do? The Visit is an unknown only 990 votes in IMDb masterpiece of revenge with one of the most acid ironical and cynical stories ever shown in a film. Ingrid Bergman performing an evil resented woman is a role totally unusual for this beautiful actress. The screenplay is excellent with an unexpected plot point with the revelation of the true intention of Karla. She explores the weak moral of a needy and greedy population. The conclusion is impressive. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Visita The Visit";

	schema:reviewBody "After twenty years an old resident Ingrid Bergman of a small European town is returning. However in the meantime she married one of the richest men in the world and after his death she is immensely wealthy. The town in effect is sucking up to her in the hopes that she'll give them moneyespecially since their economy is in ruins.However when she returns she has a very strange proposalshe will give the town 1000000 and another 1000000 to be divided up among the people if they kill a man! Twenty years ago Anthony Quinn had gotten her pregnant and then denied paternityeven going so far as bribing some friends to lie and say she was a whore. As a result she was driven out of town and into a life of prostitution. In effect the entire town and Quinn had conspired to ruin her life.What makes this film so fascinating is its look at human nature. Slowly watching Quinn's good friends turn on him was fascinating. However the most fascinating part occurred when Bergman had truckloads of products shipped into town and extended credit to everyone in order to push them towards a citysanctioned murder. The most delicious scene was seeing Quinn's own wife lining up to buy this merchandise!! The film really excels at social commentary as it pulls few punches. People in this film are almost universally scum. In addition Bergman puts on one of her best performancesat times looking like a spider as she watches Quinn suffer.The only negatives were that towards the end there was a very brief scene between Quinn and Bergman by the lake that just didn't ring true plus the film seemed to go on a bit too longlessening its overall impact. But if you ignore these things and I certainly could this is an amazing and cold view of the worst aspects of human nature. A delicious drama that is creative and very hardhitting.".

In the opening credits Ingrid Bergman's entourage is credited Wardrobe designed by Rene Hubert Executed by Nina Ricci Makeup by John O'Gorman Hair by Giorgio of Rome Furs by Maurice Kotler and Jewels by Bulgari. If that seems excessive it's only because you haven't seen the movie yet. Ingrid is breathtakingly beautiful more beautiful than in any other movie. Her exquisite costumes furs hats and jewels fit right in with her character she even has a pet cheetah! Not only does she command attention by her physical appearance her performance in The Visit is perhaps the best of her career rivaled only by my sentimental favorite Gaslight. Anthony Quinn is the male lead in the filmboth Tony and Ingrid were coproducers of the filmand while it's impossible to take attention away from Ingrid in this movie his performance is also very good. Ingrid is such a largerthanlife woman that often she overshadows her leading men. Tony can not only stand up against her energy but he has an abundance of his own to give. Fans of unsettling films like A Farewell to Fools will find a new favorite in this stylized classic. It will leave you wanting more and it will drain you. And in the day and age of the feminist resurgence it could easily be remade with any number of Hollywood icons vying for the lead.Kiddy Warning Obviously you have control over your own children.

	schema:reviewBody "As an introductory note it's true that this review contains spoilers but then the main page here is full of spoilers. If you wish to be unspoiled avoid the taglines and synopsis! This movie is adapted from a celebrated European play which shares some features with other works of the period. Think Brecht Ionesco Pirandello on the cinematic side I think this film has a family resemblance to Les Carabiniers by Godard. It's not a realistic work and it avoids positioning itself in time and space. So don't waste time asking yourself what country the town of Gullen is really in the Cyrillic writing on the shops and its apparent proximity to Trieste makes me want to put it in Croatia or Slovenia  but there I am wasting time or poking fingers at the plot and asking about this country's currency or legal system or what Serge could have done if he had been quicker on the uptake. It's not realism. It's a parable. It's everytown. It's about the human race.And it's a product of a strain of postWWII European culture that is exploring why those things happened and is pretty darn cynical about the human race. The human race is being scolded here though through parable and with a tone often humorous sometimes sad sometimes bitter. I don't think this made it an uncomfortable film to watch but I'm not everyone.So as to the backstory. Twenty years ago the Ingrid Bergman character Carla was in love with Anthony Quinn Serge and was having his baby. But he chose to marry the daughter of the owner of the general store and when she sued him for paternity he bribed two guys with a bottle of brandy each to testify that she was so promiscuous the child could be anybody's. She was driven from the town the baby was taken from her and died apparently of neglect and she had no recourse but to become a whore in Trieste. That girl died she later declares. Now by a set of curious chances to quote The Mikado she returns to her old home town mouldering and hopeless as it is with all the money in the world and an entourage of lawyers underlings and thugs.The town truckles to her of course making a great show of forgetting all the unpleasant events of the past and pretending that Carla might as well. No such luck. She is willing to shower money on the town and its people but in return she wants justice namely that Serge be put to death. The officials and populace are scandalized at first but by stages and not prolonged ones they come around to her program strengthened by the realization that everyone else in the town is getting on board and by the fact that the respectable people are being realistic about it all and making it supposedly legal. Ultimately they want even Serge to admit that it's the only reasonable thing and that he would be impermissibly selfish to want it otherwise. I should say that the depiction of this process is the best part of the film and makes it well worth watching.Finally having changed the laws so as to allow for a speedy trial with a predetermined outcome  on the nowcapital charge of perverting the course of justice no less  the town collects its money and is ready to execute Serge. FINAL SPOILER at this point in the original play they kill him and the corrupt press report that he died of a heart attack brought on by joy. However this movie has radically changed the ending in this version Carla declares that the whole town was just as guilty as Serge and their punishment would be to go on living with Serge among them shamefully knowing what murderers they all are while Serge must go on living knowing that all his friends were about to kill him. Apparently this was her plan all along.Naturally your first reaction will be that this is just a cowardly way of placating the bourgeois public and evading the logic of the whole work up to that point. It was mine anyway. And it seems to me that all these people including Serge will not be harshly punished by shame afterwards as they will have cars and fine boots.However my second thought was that whatever the reason for the plot change maybe it wasn't so bad because after all she's quite right the whole town was indeed complicit in the original crime. I don't think it shocks the conscience that she wants Serge harshly punished and there are plenty of retributionhungry characters in contemporary movies who would think Serge was getting off easy if he got killed quickly and humanely. But then what kind of justice is it if he gets killed and the whole rest of the town just gets money? And by the way isn't there an argument that the postwar West had exactly the same problem? How many people and not only in Europe shared the responsibility for Nazism and didn't get condemned for war crimes but on the contrary just got rich? I wonder if Duerrenmatt the original playwright is on record anywhere with his thoughts about the movie's ending.But my third thought is that maybe the movie ends too quickly and it would be good if Serge were executed and if she then added that on second thought real justice would demand more victims  the mayor say. And maybe the priest and the police chief. And maybe more to come. The body politic surviving by eating itself up one by one. Or for that matter she could just demolish the whole town and pack everyone off to a whorehouse in Trieste. She has enough money to do it in a parable at least. Or reeducation camps? What would you do?".

	onyx:emotionText "As an introductory note it's true that this review contains spoilers but then the main page here is full of spoilers. If you wish to be unspoiled avoid the taglines and synopsis! This movie is adapted from a celebrated European play which shares some features with other works of the period. Think Brecht Ionesco Pirandello on the cinematic side I think this film has a family resemblance to Les Carabiniers by Godard. It's not a realistic work and it avoids positioning itself in time and space. So don't waste time asking yourself what country the town of Gullen is really in the Cyrillic writing on the shops and its apparent proximity to Trieste makes me want to put it in Croatia or Slovenia  but there I am wasting time or poking fingers at the plot and asking about this country's currency or legal system or what Serge could have done if he had been quicker on the uptake. It's not realism. It's a parable. It's everytown. It's about the human race.And it's a product of a strain of postWWII European culture that is exploring why those things happened and is pretty darn cynical about the human race. The human race is being scolded here though through parable and with a tone often humorous sometimes sad sometimes bitter. I don't think this made it an uncomfortable film to watch but I'm not everyone.So as to the backstory. Twenty years ago the Ingrid Bergman character Carla was in love with Anthony Quinn Serge and was having his baby. But he chose to marry the daughter of the owner of the general store and when she sued him for paternity he bribed two guys with a bottle of brandy each to testify that she was so promiscuous the child could be anybody's.

At the beginning I was trying to figure why the film looked or sounded dubbed even though the characters were all clearly speaking the lines in English. Turns out as I read elsewhere that in many European films the dialogue is overdubbed AFTER the scenes are shot which was the case here and would explain this. The sound seems detached from what the acoustics of the setting would be. At any rate it's a great story with a great premise and great acting. Ingrid Bergmann is absolutely mesmerizing here and Quinn does his usual wonderful work. There are some artificialities in this story of a wronged woman who returns to her natal town to wreak revenge but on the whole the story is gripping as we watch the town driven by greed slowly turn on one of its own. The black and white photography is perfect for the story. The final scene is a completely surprising plot twist and powerful in its fateful implications for the town. The Visit is a rarity on TV catch it if you can.".

	schema:headline " Decent enough western saved by the central performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Long Live Your Death is a western comedy. This film tries to pin down the staples of the genre while being funny and it has to be said that in doing so it pretty much misses both targets but thankfully Duccio Tessari's film is entertaining in it's own right and the central cast is just about talented enough to pull it through. The film takes obvious influence from the greatest of all Spaghetti Westerns The Good The Bad and The Ugly and it could be said in fact that the film is basically a complete rip of the earlier film. The film takes place during the Mexican revolution. Mary O'Donnell an Irish journalist wants to inspire a revolt in Mexico and pays for a revolutionary to be released from prison but unfortunately the man in question is already dead so another Mexican is freed in his place. He escapes along with a Prince Dmitri Vassilovich Orlowsky who has designs on finding some buried treasure. He teams up with the bandit and the two pursue the treasure one knows the town where the gold is buried the other knows the location.It's the central pairing of Franco Nero and Eli Wallach that ensure the film works neither one delivers their best performance but the pair is constantly entertaining on screen together. They are joined by Lynn Redgrave apparently Franco Nero's sister is law and she dons an annoying Irish accent. Thankfully her role in the film is rather short compared to the other two. The film does have a sense of humour and at times it is rather funny the location of the treasure maps for example but it's never overly funny and I'd still call it more of a western than a comedy. Duccio Tessari who also directed Giallo classic The Bloodstained Butterfly packs his film with plenty of action and this does ensure that the film is entertaining. The film only runs for just over ninety minutes and it never gets boring enough to really start dragging so that's a positive. It all boils down to a decent conclusion and overall while I certainly wouldn't call Long Live Your Death a classic or a must see it is at least worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Don't turn the other cheek is a cheeky comedy. Still it's butt ugly to watch at times.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie rarely crack me up. Director Duccio Tessari at least gave it a try. Long Live Your Death AKA Don't Turn the Other Cheek! Originally titled Viva la muerte... tua! is a 1971 Italian spaghetti western comedy that mostly a send up to more political Spaghetti Westerns called Zapata Westerns. Zapata Westerns is the nickname given to a subgenre of Spaghetti Westerns dating largely from the mid1960s to early 1970s which were set in and around Mexico during the Mexico Revolution 1910 to 1920s hints the name Zapata named after Mexican Revolution leader Emiliano Zapata. The movie often dealt with overtly political themes of that era. Based on the novel titled The killer from Yuma by Lewis B. Patten and screenplay written by Massimo De Rita and Juan De Ordua the movie tells the story of a Russian con artist Dmitri Vassilovich Orlowsky Franco Nero whom dress up as a priest hears from a last confession about a village where a treasure is hidden. He seeks out a Mexican Bandit and mistaken war hero Max Lozoya Eli Wallach who knows more about its precise location. The movie isn't anything new as there has been a lot of treasure hunting Spaghetti Westerns over the years like 1966's Sergio Leone's masterpiece film 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly'. If you replace the American Civil War with the Mexican Revolution replace the great actor Clint Eastwood with mediocre Franco Nero who sounds like he imitates Peter Lorne throughout the film replace Angel Eyes with pretty but annoying young red head angel eyes Lynn Redgrave replace the amazing music from Ennio Morricone with lousy Elevator music from Gianni Ferrio then you got this movie. Eli Wallach's Max Lozoya is just a mirror image of plain old Tuco Ramirez. He just under another name. He adds nothing new to his performance. Even the bait and switch execution mirrors that of Tuco and Blondie. It really feels like rehash stuff. The movie does have some interesting things that were later use or help influence other works such as the priest disguise that came to be used in films like 1974's The Gun and the Pulpit and 1975's God Guns. Another weird idea taken from this film is the map instructions tattooed on people's bottom that was used in 1974's Blood Money. The movie is mostly a comedy as most of its jokes were misses than hit. There were a few funny jokes that I happen to laugh at. Too bad the movie took its concept way too serious at times and the film got really dark. Lots of violent deaths and women and children dying here. How are war atrocity funny? The action is pretty over the top with examples of people shooting three opponents with only one bullet people knocking out five opponents with one punch and a soldier walking off with a toothache after being hit by a bullet. It's cheesy but entertaining. The movie also has a lot of subplots that really goes nowhere. I don't even know why the writers made Dmitri Vassilovich Orlowsky into a prince. It's hints at his past with the Russian music playing in the watch but it's never explain why he left Russia and became a con artist. Who knows if he was really a prince? Another message that kinda get lost is the William Randolph Hearst type yellow journalism as shown by the Mary O' Donnell character. The movie goes have some faults. The movie could had benefited some better landscapes. Jose F. Aguayo's cinematography is average. The camera production are bad with the camera zooming and out. I can do without the stopmotion beginning with Gisela Hahn. It was annoying as hell. I thought my DVD was skipping scenes. The movie is known for cutting scenes. For the U.S. theatrical release the film was edited down to 93 minutes cutting out nearly 17 minutes of footage. Try to find the DVD that contains the full uncut version containing 17 minutes of extra footage not seen in the U.S. theatrical version. Too bad the uncut footage was never dubbed into English so this footage is presented on the DVD in Italian with English subtitles. The DVD also contains alternate title sequences that is better than the stopmotion one. The movie might be hard to find due to how rare it is. It doesn't help that the movie go under many titles. Star Eli Wallach came up with the title Don't Turn the Other Cheek! for the U.S. release as he did not like the Italian title. Overall I can't recommend this movie unless you liked lots of stupid spaghetti westerns. It's not the worst but clearly not the best.".

It would be hard to make a bad spaghetti western with those four playing the main characters but I do have to say that although this movie was good I think it could have been better. The acting and direction just seem a little bit sloppy. I suspect that either they were having so much fun making it that they were too relaxed to take their work seriously or that they just didn't care all that much about the film. I prefer to think that it's the first reason. The US release which is the version that I saw also seems to have been edited way too much probably to make the film shorter.

	schema:headline " Gonzo Euro Comedy Spaghetti Western Mishmash That Tries Too Hard";
	schema:reviewBody "So the Spaghetti Western as a comedy. You know whatever there are some great examples of the approach the TRINITY films the priceless TOO MUCH GOLD FOR ONE GRINGO Giulio Petroni's underappreciated TEPAPA various parts of DUCK YOU SUCKER ... The formula works best when the filmmakers don't try too hard simply allowing the conventions of the genre to be as absurd as they are naturally. Terence Hill's bottomless plate of beans from THEY CALL ME TRINITY comes to mind. Beans. Eating. Cowboys. Get it? LONG LIVE YOUR DEATH tries to announce itself as a funny movie from the first frame with an oddball musical score and still images of Franco Nero yukkin' it up as a Russian Prince pretending to be a minister and holding up the congregation at a wedding ceremony for what turns out to be proceeds to help fund the Mexican Revolution. He drives a car instead of riding a horse packs an automatic pistol instead of a sixshooter and after his automobile is wounded during a shootout he puts it out of it's misery with another bullet to the engine block.Eli Wallach was of course hilarious as THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY'S Tuco the poster child misfit Spaghetti Western seriocomic leading man and is probably the film's greatest asset. Here he plays a two bit Mexican chicken thief who may or may not know the location of a fortune in gold but finds himself sprung from jail by a pretty perky Lynne Redgrave who wants to find the revolutionaries a hero to lead their struggle  write a Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper story about it. Nero and Wallach are good but Redgrave is excellent and took her only Spaghetti Western performance to heart trying a bit too hard but we appreciate the effort.So already we have several fish out of water plot threads a couple of mistaken identity skeins and ample opportunities for Wallach to mug for the camera while he eats food tries to proposition Redgrave and form an uneasy buddy alliance with Mr. Nero to find the gold.

As usual.A musical stopwatch gives composers Gianni Ferrio  Ennio Morricone an excuse to work yet another glockenspiel theme into their somewhat rushed sounding musical score a sexy mute Spanish supporting actress gives Franco Nero someone to make googlieeyes at and director Duccio Tessari had a stable filled with scriptwriters to come up with all sorts of doubleentrade laden dialog for Eli Wallach to belt out as quickly as possible when not running around jabbering excitedly and waving his arms in the air trying to be funny instead of just standing there being himself which is hilarious all on it's own. What is amazing is that he manages to be constantly upstaged by Lynn Redgrave even though she never displays her breasts.I am fairly certain the filmmakers had good intentions and talent to spare when cobbling this movie together and if it seems like I am just not getting into the spirit of things you are correct.

	onyx:emotionText "So the Spaghetti Western as a comedy. You know whatever there are some great examples of the approach the TRINITY films the priceless TOO MUCH GOLD FOR ONE GRINGO Giulio Petroni's underappreciated TEPAPA various parts of DUCK YOU SUCKER ... The formula works best when the filmmakers don't try too hard simply allowing the conventions of the genre to be as absurd as they are naturally. Terence Hill's bottomless plate of beans from THEY CALL ME TRINITY comes to mind. Beans. Eating. Cowboys. Get it? LONG LIVE YOUR DEATH tries to announce itself as a funny movie from the first frame with an oddball musical score and still images of Franco Nero yukkin' it up as a Russian Prince pretending to be a minister and holding up the congregation at a wedding ceremony for what turns out to be proceeds to help fund the Mexican Revolution. He drives a car instead of riding a horse packs an automatic pistol instead of a sixshooter and after his automobile is wounded during a shootout he puts it out of it's misery with another bullet to the engine block.Eli Wallach was of course hilarious as THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY'S Tuco the poster child misfit Spaghetti Western seriocomic leading man and is probably the film's greatest asset. Here he plays a two bit Mexican chicken thief who may or may not know the location of a fortune in gold but finds himself sprung from jail by a pretty perky Lynne Redgrave who wants to find the revolutionaries a hero to lead their struggle  write a Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper story about it. Nero and Wallach are good but Redgrave is excellent and took her only Spaghetti Western performance to heart trying a bit too hard but we appreciate the effort.So already we have several fish out of water plot threads a couple of mistaken identity skeins and ample opportunities for Wallach to mug for the camera while he eats food tries to proposition Redgrave and form an uneasy buddy alliance with Mr. Nero to find the gold.

While this does not necessarily make a good movie after all real life can be pretty boring it adds immensely to this one because much of its appeal consists of identifying oneself with various situations in the movie.

This is a film about friendship and human relationships about two men who despite being entirely different manage to make a real connection especially from Vogel's character's side who invests a lot here.Unfortunately I must say that the two protagonists did very little for me especially Brhl. I have seen him in much better roles in terms of writing ad acting. All the car references and the fast driving also didn't do much for me and felt like an equally weak tribute to the German Mantaautomobile movies from the early 1990s. It was more fun to watch when the supporting players especially Timoteo's made an impact and we see their relationships with the two main characters. However all in all this does not make up for the little memorable value in this movie. I would not recommend it and I am actually glad it was really short just 80 minutes. Thumbs down.".

The story is a nightmare Frustrated autistic insurance geek is meeting freaky gadabout who's becoming the first friend he ever had. The broker is getting the girl probably also the first one he ever had and that's pretty much what the story is. If they'd at least get drunk together or listen to good music or smoke some pot or do anything which one would call a life ... but no these chaps are driving around naked in rental cars ... uuuhsaaa ... very inspiring ... . The creative level of the piece is somewhere around zero. Schipper's directing is as entertaining as herpes. The camera work has some peaks here'n'there in terms of composition. But that's it. Don't expect any real humor magic or thrill. There isn't any. Don't expect anything unusual. It's not going to happen. Last but not least the music. Belle and Sebastian meets Dinosaur Jr after rehab meets Berlin underground wannabe. The makers should focus on TVmovies. This film is definitely not worth the effort to buy a ticket.

The story is a nightmare Frustrated autistic insurance geek is meeting freaky gadabout who's becoming the first friend he ever had. The broker is getting the girl probably also the first one he ever had and that's pretty much what the story is. If they'd at least get drunk together or listen to good music or smoke some pot or do anything which one would call a life ... but no these chaps are driving around naked in rental cars ... uuuhsaaa ... very inspiring ... . The creative level of the piece is somewhere around zero. Schipper's directing is as entertaining as herpes. The camera work has some peaks here'n'there in terms of composition. But that's it. Don't expect any real humor magic or thrill. There isn't any. Don't expect anything unusual. It's not going to happen. Last but not least the music. Belle and Sebastian meets Dinosaur Jr after rehab meets Berlin underground wannabe. The makers should focus on TVmovies. This film is definitely not worth the effort to buy a ticket. If there's anything like new German cinema this piece is far from being a part of it.";

The less you know about Womb the better the experience will be. Suffice to say its an extremely well made and honest drama about not being able to let go and the consequences that follow.The story centers around Tommy and Rebecca. After the accident Rebecca makes the controversial decision to clone Tommy to raise him as a child.Why? To get back her lover? To raise the child she never had? The film never spoon feeds us and we're left with Eva Greens brilliant performance to see Rebecca unravel.We see her care about the Tommy's clone and genuinely wants to be a good mother but there's an underlying foreboding with the possibility of incest. Rebecca struggles to keep her feelings to being a mother but there's obvious jealously when women come into Tommy's life and thats the main conflict of the film.Certainly this taboo possibility is the main drive of the second half of the film but its much more than that.Womb is brilliant because of how well its crafted.There is an isolation to the film landscapes and vistas are limited to long stretches of seas and beaches.Music is sparse too there's a haunting recurring theme that plays during decades and emphasizes the long time span of the story.Dialogue is minimum  and the film never lingers on a certain time period.Yet we miss nothing. Womb focuses not on the conversations and events but rather the emotions the characters go through. What we are left with is a deep morality love story that transcends decades.Regardless of how you feel about the inevitable outcome the struggles presented on screen is one of the more complex modern love stories. Its not about Lust but of how blind we can get in our desires to get our loved ones back.Its not for everyone though due to the slow paced nature of the film the more you give yourself to the film the more you will get.Its also not exactly the happiest film made. The depressive tone of the film may be too much for some but it stays true to itself and benefits greatly from it.This paired with the taboo subject material led with questionable marketing will probably scare off people which is a shame because this is far from the pretentious love story people seem to think it is.See it if you can its definitely a hauntingly beautiful film that makes you think long after the credits roll.P.S this is my first real review let me know what you guys think!

There's no other word for it some people would easily find this movie to be boring due to the extremely slow pace and lack of dialogue but in my opinion that all just adds to the atmosphere that the director was trying to create.There is no way at all to tell what year this film is set but I'm guessing it would be in the not too distant future let's face it the advances in science these days it's not too long before human cloning will be a part of our society. A lot of things I've heard about Womb quite often compare it to Birth which is a pretty good comparison I think both films have a lot of similarities. I couldn't help but pick up vibes from another film Never Let Me Go the controversial subject matter is similar the underlying scifi element the moral question the viewer faces and the stillness of both films are very much the same.Eva Green is wonderful to watch she gives such a wonderfully restrained performance that's it's surprising she didn't get noticed more for her role. Ever since I saw the terrific Cracks a few years ago I look forward to seeing what edgy role she decides to take on next Matt Smith who I'm not so familiar with also does a good job. The children at the beginning of the film deserve a mention too it seems as though child actors are just getting better and better as time goes on.Certainly not a film for everyone but for people who like a bit of a discussion after a film it's perfect.LOVED IT!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "At one point in the film there's a lingering shot of a snail as if an obvious metaphor that Womb gestates ever so slowly in its story covering decades of its characters' lives and does so in such a bleak and loving fashion that it provides you breathing space that sets you thinking in each scene akin to observing the quietest kid in class who turns out to be the most explosive. If you've read the synopsis by now you'd know this film deals with the issues associated with cloning and finds kindred spirits with films such as Jonathan Glazer's Birth and especially Mark Romanek's Never Let Me Go.Hungarian writerdirector Benedek Fliegauf tackles his first English language film with Womb exploring an intense underlying love story that's treated and shot with Zen minimalist principles against the hauntingly beautiful backdrop of Sylt and other equally amazing landscapes in and around Hamburg. Technical strengths in presenting this film cannot be ignored such as how patiently quiet the narrative is with little dialogue allow emotions to overwhelm on screen with sound intricately designed around emotions of frustration anger and fear. Simply put this is one journey spanning lifetimes that you'd have to open your heart out to checking that nagging thought process about the plausibleness of the story at the door otherwise you'll find yourself deeply muddled given that this in essence is like a science fiction fantasy.It's a story about attraction and how inexplicable it can sometimes be as if of a chemical nature that draws one's attention to another and how we are thought to be wired up to be attracted to a certain type profile or genetic make up with the latter of course playing a big role in this film since it involves the cloning of a human being and the existential exploration of whether a clone can ever be the same as its original or the degree it is so similar. It raises interesting arguments about that of nature versus nurture since one's personality and values are catalyzed by the growing up process and while one can be grown from a petri dish events that shape one's character are external and cannot be controlled somehow.But Womb pushes that boundary a little bit further. What if it involves a surrogate mother won't her 9 months pregnancy in carrying the foetus play a part and like the film had shown care had been taken to grow the subject in a fairly controlled environment. Rebecca Eva Green and Tommy Matt Smith are on the cusp of a budding romantic relationship where their years apart since young didn't even seem to damper their strong emotions toward each other only for a sudden road accident to cruelly snatch one away from the other. In what would be a controversial move Rebecca enrolls to have herself impregnated and becoming the surrogate mother of Tommy's clone for the selfish belief that in doing so will allow Tommy to live again much to the disappointment and shock of Tommy's mother who chose to depart rather than to see a mirror of her lost child in another human being now brought up by another woman.It's the ultimate possessive love story where one can now boast of having being there right from the start of a lover's life nurturing him from a toddler to a young adult to the point where one last left off. In most love stories the feel good factor post tragedy is to discover one expecting the child of a lover now deceased but in Womb and to a degree of morbidity it's now the expecting of the lover himself that raises plenty of alarm bells especially when sexual attraction comes into play and clearly with the ulterior motive and desire to want to somehow break through strong taboos when opportune to continue where the lovers last left off. But with Tommy 2 hooking up with a new found girlfriend in Monica Hannah Murray with the last act dealing with this threeway relationship with the audience firmly in the know of how conflicted Rebecca must have felt. Here's where Eva Green shines in playing a hopeful teenager to a woman who's confused jealous and probably with a tinge of being jilted unable to say the truth which she had hidden so well for years. Fans of Dr Who will probably lap at the chance of watching their hero in Matt Smith play the Tommy role being a youth cut down before his prime then in his second role as the relatively immature teenager who has yet to know what's in store for him when unexpected events get set in motion.So what got the censors here hot and heavy and to charge this with the highest rating possible outside of an outright ban is how there's a pervasive feeling of sexual attraction that never goes away when Tommy 2 starts to appear in Rebecca's life. Granted that a mother naturally shows unconditional love toward her child this one has a very explicit hint of intent that provokes. Take up the challenge with this unconventional love story and see if you'd squirm when you get past the amazing visuals to reach its controversial and to some shocking core".

	schema:headline " Disturbing. Emotional. Brilliant.";
	schema:reviewBody "When first reading about this film I thought to myself there is no way I shall be watching this however somehow I did end up watching it.Eva Green was absolutely incredible and gave true meaning to the character. The character's constant state of shock is beautifully performed and she manages to keep the character so real and uses naturalistic dexterity. As for Matt Smith he brought a true sense of innocence to his character and really allowed himself to connect to the audience as a thirdparty character.Director Benedek Fliegauf did a superb job at keeping the realism of the piece. Often with these types of story lines they lose meaning due to over acting and melodrama however the director allowed everything to have a sense of stillness and time was a fantastic theme used throughout the story. The use of water that appeared a lot was very well crafted to represent the process of life to death and this had good relation to the story itself.As I don't want to give away too much I shall just say the final scene left me in tears. Whilst the concept is rather disturbing as it contradicts morals and is extremely controversial it was played out in such a way it allows the viewer to actually connect with the characters and see the situation from their point of view. It's a great example of how the bad can be perceived as good and how viewers can emotionally connect with characters who did seem ever so real.".

	onyx:emotionText "When first reading about this film I thought to myself there is no way I shall be watching this however somehow I did end up watching it.Eva Green was absolutely incredible and gave true meaning to the character. The character's constant state of shock is beautifully performed and she manages to keep the character so real and uses naturalistic dexterity. As for Matt Smith he brought a true sense of innocence to his character and really allowed himself to connect to the audience as a thirdparty character.Director Benedek Fliegauf did a superb job at keeping the realism of the piece. Often with these types of story lines they lose meaning due to over acting and melodrama however the director allowed everything to have a sense of stillness and time was a fantastic theme used throughout the story. The use of water that appeared a lot was very well crafted to represent the process of life to death and this had good relation to the story itself.As I don't want to give away too much I shall just say the final scene left me in tears.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie delivers everything I seek in cinema Entrancing cinematography engaging direction stirring of emotions and challenging themes. It's beautiful intense and had me engrossed throughout. The cold stark and stunning set locations are as much a part of the story telling as the dialogue is serving to enrich the feelings and situations conveyed by the characters. It is a quiet film filled with visual beauty and soul. This is one of those rare movies that pulls you into another world one which lingers and haunts you long after the movie has ended. I watched this film yesterday and am already wanting to revisit it.Certain scenes made me feel uneasy but rightfully so given the subject matter. The sensitive storyline is conveyed well by all involved enabling the viewer to empathise with both of the main characters rather than feeling alienated from them which was a possibility with such a storyline. I think it was a clever move to not linger upon or delve much into the complexities of the actual cloning process and instead focus on the lives and emotions of the characters before and after that event. The film would have benefited from further developing the love formed between the two main characters as children so as we can better appreciate the intensity of their feelings when they meet again as adults. The director has said that they spent the whole summer together as children yet this is not evident in the film. Still I don't believe the movie suffered from this lapse as the acting by Eva Green is strong enough to convey her character's intensity and give reason to the choices she made.The topic of human cloning is a controversial and complex one and in this day and age is not as much sciencefiction as it is a genuine possibility in our future. A fictional two hour film cannot hope to provide any real answer to any of the concerns posed by such a topic but what this film manages to do is take on some emotional aspects of the topic and turn them into a haunting and thoughtful work of art. 910.".

There is not a lot of dialog delivered the story told mostly with visual feelings and mood close ups mixed with grand panoramic views draw you into the tale deliciously with an overall appealing test of your morals. Eva Green is at her sensually crazy best her eyes telling volumes of the ambivalence she has for her situation. Most will have predicted what must eventually happen but one is shocked by the outcome anyway.

I mean that one has to pay attention when one watches this because it might seem a slow movie with the abundance of shots of the German coast and snails and skies but the story develops at a brisk pace in the beginning. It's all highly implicit the passage of time is indicated by characters being played by different actors but especially in the case of the boy Tommie they look sometimes so similar it's really hard to tell.Remarkable about this movie is the start there's very little dialogue it's just a recording of kids lounging about or sitting and staring into space. There's a lot of that. I guess the director found his inner Sergio Leone and liked the famous opening of C'era una volta il West 1968 ...a lot. Here the filmmakers are exaggerating the adage that you shouldn't tell too much because only later I've learned that this part of the movie when the main protagonists are kids is supposed to be a whole summer and not just a few days as I initially thought. Very careful handling of the nudity as well. They'll get burned for it anyways but it's craftily not showing any nudity.Whether what Rebecca Eva Green does is actual incest is kind of debatable. What's noticeable is that she let's him call her mother and mom and he does so a lot. Perhaps to underline the impossibility of it all. At the end Thomas calls her explicitly Rebecca and not Mother to indicate the changed relationship.There's also some irony to let the black mother the obese mother and the elderly mother display such prejudice towards the 'copies' because it's these groups especially who have suffered from immense prejudices themselves but apparently they aren't afraid to do it to others.I think it's always risky to take a comedian and let him play a serious drama role especially when he has the same facial ticks that he has as Dr. Who. Here and there I've read that the director didn't really know what Dr. Who was or that Matt played him.The acting performances are quality all around and it's nice to see a vibrant Hannah Murray. I hadn't seen her since season 1 of Skins and it's always uncertain how child actresses turn out at a later age. She looks younger than her 21 years and is a very decent actress I'm curious to see what she would do with a more challenging role.The Melancholic Alcoholic.".

It moved so slowly that I often thought the snail a good metaphor for the movie itself. I am not an avid fan of Dr. Who so I didn't know who Mr. Smith was as an actor. I thought he did a pretty good job but at times his reactions were a bit odd and the things he did. I don't see the idea of incest really that relevant in the movie. For some reason I thought the first scene was the consequences of what happened at the end and not her being a surrogate to bring back the love of her life. He wasn't of her flesh and blood so it's debatable that anything they did was actually wrong even though he had thought she was his biological Mother through all of his growing up. The fact of the matter being that she was not. It examines what makes people attracted to each other but it doesn't really answer that question. There is a lot of silence with the little bit of dialog to leave it up to the audience to interpret. The scenery was beautiful but lonely and isolated. She gave up her life to get back this person she loved so much. It's a very sad story and a good wakeup call as to whether cloning humans is the wave of the future. How would they relate to their identity? Would they have residual memories of their previous life or be independent? Would they be shunned by society and especially the religious elitists? It's a very thought provoking movie. I felt sorry in the end for Rebecca and Tommie.".

It's definitely not something I'd watch again. It also reminds me of the trite European scifi drama crap with Kirsten Dunst called Melancholia. Both movies had a scifi element both were minimal in dialogue both took place remotely and in isolated circumstances both were crap.1 The biggest blunderfrustration I have is that if you can get a live sample of DNA from a dead body why couldn't the hospital just have gotten a live sample of the man's sperm sperm can survive for several days in the right environment and longer if frozen so the main character could have a legitimate baby and not just some weird clone? I don't care how disturbed possessive isolated smothering of a person you are who in their right mind would choose to raise their former lover from birth and then think anything good noncontroversial could come from that once they are grown up? I understand a lot of the movie's premisecontroversypurpose would be moot if there was no cloning involved.There's something definitely mentally disturbingill about the decisions of the main character. Who would be so stuck in the past deliberately trying to somehow 'prevent' the past from happening by letting it play out all over again? Who in their right mind would not at least TRY to move on move away live a new life be around people etc? It seems obsessive possessive selfish and mentally disturbing.2 What's with the sex scene at the end? I totally understand the moments of sexual attractionarousal by the mother but why wouldn't the son be completely repulsed at the mother? So despite a lifetime of being used to being around a woman as his 'mother' he suddenly becomes perversely attracted to her in an instant of emotional change just because he realizes he's a clone of her past lover and not the child of this woman? 3 I think I spent more time annoyeddisturbed at why it looked like Tommy had no eyebrows and why his eyes looked so close together compared to the little child. Comparing the little redheaded child and the adult I think the adult Tommy was cast all wrong.4 I am getting tired at watching movies of the beautiful Eva Green playing quiet and disturbed individuals. I enjoyed her in Casino Royale playing James Bond's love that broke his heart. I'd like to see her in a movie that is more positiveupbeat maybe something more of a romcom than a plain drama.5 The location of the film isolated beach town seems to fit the mood of possessiveness isolation emotional disturbedness etc but I wonder how the film could have developed more depth life meaning etc in a place with more people characters life etc. The idea of living a life in isolation out of some selfinterested purpose really just makes me miserable. The idea of living alone purposely scares me.6 The feeling I am left with at the end of the movie is more of being disturbed emotionally than anything else. Maybe that's the point but I would have hoped somehow for more of a sense of redemption hope something positive. There is a certain superficiality to that and very American and I guess that's just not the European way in film.".

That is the buzz of discussion not only for scientists but also religious people people who work with ethics morals. Cloning might seem as opportunity to bring someone back  like in this movie Rebecca decides to save her friend Tommy who died in a car accident. The only way to have him back is to give birth to his clone. But here comes the questions who will give birth? Will the clone really be the same? How other people might react to the clone? I mean all of his friends and family will be growing older and he will be in the infant age slowly growing up. Then what becomes the point of cloning? By the time the clone will grow up people might move on as they would do without the clone. So is it just some second chance for the parents? But this movie goes even deeper Rebecca is NOT Tommy's parent. She's his friend. She becomes his mother. And that motherhood is becoming disturbing as little Tommy is growing up and becoming the man he was before he died.Other people's opinion about clones is quite negative. Nobody wants to be friends with the copies. Maybe it's because everybody wants to be unique original. And there are people who are literally copies of someone. They bring back memories about that person. And not all memories can be good.Yes this movie was quite disturbing. On the other hand the music and acting are just brilliant. I know Eva Green's Rebecca might seem emotionless but you can see from small twitches the hidden emotions. Well of course she can't show all emotions  she was about to be Tommy's lover and now she's his mother. There has to be A LOT of things hidden. I believe it is also painful for her to see Tommy becoming the man who died. Matt Smith small pause for fangirling because of Doctor Who showed a spawn of emotions. Anger sadness passion goofiness love confusion  they were changing in his eyes and actions. It is very interesting to see how he starts understanding that not everything is right that his mom is hiding something. I don't want to spoil anything but it is fascinating and disturbing to see.The music takes you like into a fairytale. Yes a fairytale of science fiction which is quite disturbing and fascinating at the same time. I recommend you to watch it even though you might feel confused in your morals after it.".

Children slowly burying a mechanical toy dinosaur while it pitifully tries to walk? Easy. Weird sexual tension between a mother and her son culminating in a sex scene that made me want to squirm out of my skin? I lived. But that sheet of dirty plastic being dragged through that living room. That is the scene that will haunt me for the rest of my days.";

Mark Smith didn't do a very good job portraying his character. the chemistry felt off for me of course it's all about preferences but in a complicated romance movie like this it's crucial. two the pace it was so slow to slow the are a lot of unnecessary pause there is a ten seconds shot of a dog the character's walking in the beach which was shot from afar uninteresting i would be better to have it close up one person walking awayit take to long unnecessary paused of one dialog to anotherwhen it should be answered immediately a lot of emotionless close up scenes which i think take to long again. three the sound there aren't any scores which was fine if it would feel natural BUT jumping from one silent scene to loud waves just no. and without score it would depends on the actors to deliver emotional or dramatic scenes and the they failed. so all in all it was a very boring movie it's a good thing i can fast forward it.".

Beginning in the air over the Western Front during 1916  where ever shows up a young corporal Hitler  the picture moves from Paris to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin . It is a highly entertaining caper set in WWII Germany  where our hero  Jo Jean Paul Belmondo must help some pursued Jews and a little boy called Simon Rosenblum and being reluctantly supported by a journalist Marie France Pisier and a Nazi officer who became his friend in World War I  during their period as contender pilots . Meanwhile  Gestapo and Nazi troops on their heals . The French boxer named Jo Cavalier is charmed by a kid who asks his autograph on the train to Berlin for the Olympics in Hitler's Germany  when he results to be a Jewish child  as Jo attempts to save Simon and his family . Later on  there take place several adventurous escapes to Switzerland and chased by nasty Nazis until that the group arrives in a countryside mansion which turns out to be the Hitler Gunter Meisner refuge Berchtesgaden . This fun movie packs thrills  emotion  intrigue  exciting flying scenes  lively performances  spectacular WWII planes and a moving finale . The film includes documentary footage of 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and images about American sprinter Jesse Owens . In this action comedy Belmondo steals the show  as he runs  bounds and leaps  he jumps over balcony  cars and executes his own stunts  braving impossible odds in roller coasterstyle . Enjoyable acting by main star names  Jean Paul Belmondo and MarieFrance Pisier as Gaby  an attractive reporter . Special mention mention to Gunter Mesneir in a double role as Adolf Hitler  Angela Hitler  he is frankly hilarious as Hitler's jealous sister . Sympathetic acting by the young boy Rachid Ferrache  he is an adorable young fan as well as a Jewish orphan in danger of persecution . But Belmondo steals the spectacle  as usual at the time  he runs  hits  bounds and leaps  Belmondo makes as his own stunts as well as Jackie Chan  he jumps over buildings  drives rapidly automobiles and pilots planes . Because of its huge advertising campaign on bill boards and in metro stations 25 French critics called moviegoers to boycott L'As Des As . They argued that Belmondo would displace smaller more important movies like Jacques Demy's Une Chambre in Ville. Then  Belmondo said in an interview Critics say that my movies won't last. Who cares? I live now. Jolly and enjoyable musical score by Vladimir Cosma  including catching leitmotif . Colorful as well as atmospheric cinematography by Xaver Schwarzenberger . The picture was successful at box office  ranking second highest grossing movie of its year in France beaten only by E.T. Broke the opening admissions record in Paris selling 463028 tickets in its first week  a record at the time . The motion picture was well directed by Gerard Oury .

	schema:reviewBody "World War I and II have always been a good setting for European cinema as different films have been made by France Germany and Italy which speak about two major conflicts which have brought mankind close to the brink of disaster. As we discuss the portrayal of wars in cinema we need to mention that it is the French directors who have portrayed world wars in a comic fashion as opposed to the seriousness which a war film demands. Hence it is with immense pride can one state that a long time before Italian comedy actordirector Roberto Benigni Life is beautiful French cinema was the first national cinema to give comic touches to wars especially in their humorous portrayal of Nazism. For example  PAPY FAIT DE LA RESISTANCE directed by JeanMarie Poir. Ace of aces is one such film which recreates the magic of comedy during a war by lampooning Nazi soldiers and their leader Adolf Hitler who were in power in Germany during 11th Summer Olympic Games which were held in 1936 in Berlin. For this film French superstar JeanPaul Belmondo is paired with MarieFrance Pisier who get rid of their differences in order to help a Jewish family. It is not only the star cast which has worked wonders for this film as Grard Oury has added too many popular cinema elements to make his film a nice viewing experience for all types of viewers regardless of their age or taste. One gets to see an incredible chase of airplanes in the skies a French boxing team a bear in a car chased by Nazi soldiers Der Fuehrer 'Adolf Hitler' and his sister and even a short documentary footage of American sprinter Jesse Owens. You would not hesitate in watching this film as it represents a true example of light comedy in cinema if you have already enjoyed and seen 'La Grande Vadrouille'.".

	schema:headline " Belmondo tries his best but he just can't keep it interesting until the end";
	schema:reviewBody "L'as des as or Ace of Aces or Das As der Asse is a coproduction between West German and France that resulted in a 100minute movie from 1982 so this one has its 35th anniversary this year. The writer and director is Grard Oury also a prolific actor himself but here he was in charge behind the camera. The star in here is JeanPaul Belmondo certainly a known name to many. And he plays a former boxer who is traveling to Berlin in 1936 in order to help his fighters win a gold medal. So yes this is a Nazithemed movie. Actually the beginning is even a World War I reference. And Hitler is included on several occasions. However this film should not be taken seriously from a historic perspective. As so many other times with Belmondo it is all about the comedy. The way Hitler gets made fun of for his WWI military action and for his disapproval of Jesse Owens' successes says it all basically and it is pretty hilarious. The film apparently tries to become a bit more serious when it brings in a Jewish orphan boy that Belmondo's character has to help so that he will not get caught by the Nazis. So yes there are some more serious moments in there but honestly these did not work out well and it's also not half the tearjerk material they want it to be.I must say I like the film in the first 45 minutes perhaps but then it got worse and worse. Had it been from start to finish I'd have given it a 610 for sure but the longer it went the more absurd it became really Such a shame. It also feels the action moves further and further away from Belmondo. At the very end at the Nazis headquarter and with the Fhrer himself very present it just hits rockbottom and it just isn't funny anymore at least not to me. It was a decent watch when they were making a comedy that delivered solid jokes in the face of the historical context and not just shove it all into our faces while losing all subtlety. It seems that the drag approach to humor was pretty present in the 1980s but it almost never works out and also not in this one here I guess. So all in all I give this film a thumbsdown. The inclusion of MarieFrance Pisier was also disappointing. I guess they wanted to come up with a female love interest under any circumstance but they complete forgot to elaborate convincingly on her and eventually it is the same as if they had left her out completely. I suggest you watch something else or switch it off halfway into the movie because that's when it all goes south.".

	schema:reviewBody "LOVE MetroGoldwynMayer 1927 directed by Edmund Goulding reunites John Gilbert and Greta Garbo who were initially teamed in the steamy romance triangle FLESH AND THE DEVIL MGM 1927. From the novel Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy MGM updates the photoplay from 19th Century Russia to more contemporary setting. In spite of these and other changes the plot remains loyal to Tolstoy giant sized novel abridged to an 80 minute movie.The story opens during a violent snow storm where Anna Karenina Greta Garbo is trying to get to St. Petersburg Russia. Count Alexi Vronsky John Gilbert a young military man just passing through sees this beautiful woman in distress and offers to help her. Unable to get to St. Petersburg on time Anna is offered shelter at an inn. Alexi and Anna are then mistaken for a married couple with their bags being placed in the same room. The two find themselves in love with Alexi unaware that Anna is married to a senator Brandon Hurst and mother to a young boy Philippe De Lacy she adores. When Senator Karenin learns of Anna's illicit affair he at first decides not to do anything in hope that they would eventually destroy each other. But Anna finds she must face the decision of whether to leave home and never see her son again or remain in her present loveless environment with the only redeeming person being her son.In the supporting cast are George Fawcett as Grand Duke Michael Emily Fitzroy as The Grand Duchess and Mathilde Comont as Mazha the innkeeper. Almost forgotten LOVE was remade and improved during the sound era of 1935 restoring it back to ANNA KARENINA with Garbo reprising her tragic heroin role possibly just as famous as her other heroine of CAMILLE MGM 1936. The remake set in 19th century Russia is supported by Fredric March Basil Rathbone and Freddie Bartholomew in the Gilbert Hurst and DeLacy roles. In both versions Garbo's most effective scene occurs when Anna forbidden ever to see her boy again sneaks into the house to visit with him on his birthday during the absence of her husband. After their reunion joy spreads over both their faces as mother and son embrace. Garbo shows her ability with these scenes as an emotional and personable actress. However the modern 1920s costumes she wears in LOVE appear to be the most outrageous ugly hats and dresses ever worn by an attractive woman. The character of ANNA KARENINA returned to the screen again as a 1948 British adaptation starring Vivien Leigh and Sir Ralph Richardson. There was even a 1985 television movie with Jacqueline Bisset and Christopher Reeve the best appreciated being the 1935 Garbo remake. Long before the Turner company resurrected this hard to find cinema classic LOVE made its television debut on New York City's public television station WNET Channel 13's presentation of MOVIE'S GREAT MOVIES September 10 1973 hosted by Richard Schickel with the feature film accompanied by an original orchestral score composed for this and 12 other silent films in the series. When currently shown on Turner Classic Movies especially on its Silent Sunday Nights the score for LOVE has been changed to a new orchestration but handicapped by offscreen laughter and unnecessary hand clapping in the wrong places making one wonder why? On the plus side TCM presents LOVE with two endings happy and tragic making this worth seeing with its alternate conclusions. ".

He didn't seem like the same actor from Flesh and the Devil and A Woman of Affairs. My favorite silent Garbo film is still the light stylish The Kiss but Love impressed me greatly.By the way various sources Maltin's book the TCM host claim this 1927 version is modern. Yet it's set in Czarist Russia which is not modern for 1927! In fact nothing in the film indicates it's not a 19th Century settingthey don't drive cars they don't go to movies they don't have telephones etc. You might argue that Garbo's fashions are modern but that just means they're anachronistic for the Czarist era not that the whole setting is modern. What's really modern is the ending and that's what I want to praise.It came as a breathtaking shock to me since I had no prior knowledge of it. The TCM print ends with a happy resolution. Then we see a notice that this was the American ending and next comes the tragic ending shown in Europe. This film's tragic ending of Anna K wellknown is abrupt and unconvincing unlike every other scene in this film so welldirected by Edmund Goulding.At the risk of being a literary heretic I must say the happy ending is better! I know we're supposed to sneer at Hollywood's desecration of great literature and we're supposed to be swept up in the romantic tragedy of sacrifice how noble or selfpitying it is. But frankly the classic ending is a revolt against reason. In fact it's a conventional moralistic punishment for a supposedly strong heroine. The happy ending in which people actually behave with sense is subversive because Anna gets to have her adulterous beefcake and eat it too. Call it a crass commercial decision if you will but it's exactly what Tolstoy couldn't have published in the 19th Century and what Hollywood couldn't have done after the Production Code crackdown in 1934which is probably as much why the 1935 remake is tragic as any special allegiance to Tolstoy. The high 20s was the right window to tell the story sensibly.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderfully filmed movie! The only problem that I could possibly find with it is that it really isn't ANNA KARENINA it would have made an excellent film just on its own. The Happy Ending probably holds up better today than back in the 1920's and was a welcome after the sad separation. The best parts as the scenes between Garbo and Gilbert. I didn't quit get the scenes with De Lacy although the birthday reunion scene was very sentimental. Luckily the film also has a few laughs Gilbert burning himself on the lighted flint the Holy Lamp that goes out when Garbo opens the door to find Gilbert and especially her reactions. What's best is that it is only 82 minutes long. I did not understand the character of the Grand Duchesse she not on that long nor Brandon Hurst's Karenine they were both excellent its just that the real life of the picture is truly Gilbert and Garbo. I'm so glad John Gilbert is finally being brought back perhaps mostly do to the 100th birthday of Garbo but at least this great and talented actor is at last being given some of the praise he is due. Hopefully more of his films will be shown on TCM and YOUTUBE. Perhaps even some talkies! Thank you to everyone who have made is easier to see John Gilbert films!".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a wonderfully filmed movie! The only problem that I could possibly find with it is that it really isn't ANNA KARENINA it would have made an excellent film just on its own. The Happy Ending probably holds up better today than back in the 1920's and was a welcome after the sad separation. The best parts as the scenes between Garbo and Gilbert. I didn't quit get the scenes with De Lacy although the birthday reunion scene was very sentimental.

	schema:reviewBody "Love is a better than you expect silent film romance.There are a few remarkable qualities a film lover will encounter in Love. Foremost is how little the emotional impact of Love has faded over the years relative to other silent films. Often silent films are enjoyable because they have aged and we can delight in their quaint or oldfashioned sensibility laughing while comparing how much movies and pop culture have changed. Love however has largely maintained its original affect which is particularly amazing given it is a sentimental tearjerker romance a genre that ages perhaps lest well. These eighty years later we still can related to the feelings of both Captain Count Alexei Vronsky John Gilbert and Anna Karenina Greta Garbo while we root for their love. Of course there are plenty of moments originally dramatic that are now laughable but over all the film has age well. Most odd is the depiction of Anna and her son's love. Today it plays with disturbingly incestuous overtones. I do not know how it played in 1927.The second striking feature also related to how well this film has aged is how beautiful Greta Garbo appears. Like many elements in silent films standards are beauty may not translate across generations. Actors and actresses considered amazingly beautiful in the teens and twenties may no longer satisfy the modern movie star equivalent. Garbo however is still strikingly obviously beautiful. The final striking feature is a bit of trivia  there are two endings to Love an American ending and a European. The difference in endings is striking in that the same divergent choices would probably be made today. The European ending is bleak tragic and emotionally effective as Anna steps in front of the rushing train rather than live without her lover and son. Further it is the ending in the original text Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. The American ending is predictable saccharine and laughable. Americans in 1927 like American today want their romances to end with all the loose ends tided up all the obstacles overcome and all our couples marring to live happily ever after.Story Synopsis Love is based on Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. Anna Karenina meets Captain Count Alexei Vronsky in a terrible blizzard late one afternoon and he helps her to shelter. He is instantly smitten but she rejects him. Vronsky helps Anna back to the Czarist court and her husband Senator Alexei Karenina. Vronsky too is part of the court the top assistant to the Grand Duke. Vronsky and Anna continue to meet at various events official functions dances wolf hunts. Eventually they fall hopelessly in love. The court is abuzz as it is obvious to all who see Vronsky and Anna that they are attracted to each other. Karenina cold and authoritarian warns Anna of court gossip and commands she at least be inconspicuous and avoid public scandal. Anna and Vronsky try a number of times to stop seeing each but their love is overpowering. Eventually they abscond to Italy rejecting their former lives to live as lovers. Anna however cannot bare being away from her son. When she returns Karenina refuses to allow Anna to visit her son again. Further Anna finds out that Vronsky is going to be dismissed from his military post because of their affair. Realizing how awful that would be for Vronsky she makes a deal with his commander if she leaves St. Petersburg forever Vronsky will retain his post. She decides to leave on the next train sacrificing her happiness for Vronsky's. But Anna cannot bear the thought of leaving both her lover and her adored son. Instead of riding her train into exile she steps in front of it to her death. The ending is sudden shocking and effective. A surprisingly poignant ending to a film of pleasant surprises. American Ending Years later Vronsky happens upon Anna and her son. Vronsky has maintained his high military post Anna's husband is dead mother and son are together Anna and Vronsky still love each and will surely soon marry now that they have refound each other. And we have happily ever after'.".

	schema:headline " GarboGilbert with a dash of Tolstoy";
	schema:reviewBody "LOVE is the perfect title for this hackeddown adaptation of Tolstoy's mammoth novel ANNA KARENINA. It was made to cash in on the popularity of Greta Garbo and John Gilbert fresh from their box office triumph in FLESH AND THE DEVIL earlier the same year. Like virtually all of Garbo's silent films much of the screen time is devoted to watching the great tormented Swede abandon herself to love suffer for love contemplate love lose love die. It is interesting to compare this version of the novel with the one made eight years later in which Garbo played opposite Fredric March who while less dashing and handsome than Gilbert did give a fine performance as the impetuous and essentially cruel Count Vronsky. In the latter film Garbo is less attractive due to the clash between the curly coiffure she is given and the strong planes and features of her face. She even looks like a male in drag in some scenes. But in LOVE she is beautiful and feminine throughout. The clinging 1920'sstyle dresses help even if they detract from the authenticity of a story that is supposed to be set in 1870's Russia. Gilbert was one of the best actors of his era and the talent shows here. He is also a magnetic screen presence and one can understand why audiences in 1927 flocked to see these two together. The scenes of motherson tenderness between Garbo and Philippe deLacy do indeed seem incestuous as others have pointed out but so do the scenes between Garbo and Freddie Bartholomew in the 1935 version. I think it was just Garbo's way of expressing love on screen you see her perform the same kind of nuzzling in other movies whether the attentions are being given to a man a woman or a child. I disliked both endings but at least Garbo was ravishing in the happy one. And remember Garbo was just shy of 22 when she filmed this yet she is believable as an older woman. She had a face that could express any age. This movie cries out for a rescoring. The print shown on TCM is marred by what sounds like muffled applause from time to time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been an ardent fan of Flesh and the Devil but then I saw Love.  This movie is absolutely beautiful there's no other word to describe it.  Whereas Flesh and the Devil seemed to be crass commercialism Love is more subtle in many ways.I gave this movie a 9 due to two rather melodramatic moments where Garbo wasn't exactly restraining herself.  However there are enough scenes where she conveys Anna's inner turmoil by the most fleeting and eloquent of expressions.  The lighting in her scenes are breathtakingly beautiful and I can only imagine how long it took to set it up just right!  In so many of her scenes she is heartbreaking especially when exiled from her home she sees a schoolboy and momentarily believes that he is her son and tries to embrace him.  When he struggles and runs away she does a wonderful job portraying Anna's rather unstable mind which she does to great effect throughout the picture.  In the beginning however when she first meets Vronsky she seems to be in control of herself and there is a wonderfully imperious stare in closeup followed quickly by a closeup of Gilbert. As I watched her I was astonished when I remembered that she was only 22 in this film.Which brings us to Gilbert.  For those who think of him as simply Valentino's successor as the Great Lover being no more than a slab of meat for the delight of female audiences need to watch this film.  He is simply perfect the model of natural acting  there is not a hint of melodrama or the ham about him.  He is completely in love with Anna but there are none of the breastheaving love scenes that are throughout Flesh and the Devil.  He is jealous of anybody coming between him and Anna but there are no widened eyes and arm waving.  Simply jamming his hands in his pockets and an angry stare into the distance.My only complaint with this film was the presentation on TCM. They used a live performance and we get the audience reaction throughout the film.  Which is fine at points but for the most part the reaction is totally wrong.  Too many times there was laughter at what was in 1927 a very dramatic moment. When Jack is too busy looking at Garbo to blow out the match and ends up burning his finger that's funny.  But when Anna says the profound line to the jealous Vronsky There is no more or less in love  I love you both infinitely referring to her son the laughter was totally inappropriate.  I hope this is not the avenue of any future TCM silent movies.  Even though modern audiences are supposedly more sophisticated they aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate what worked 7075 years ago.  Even though these movies are old there are still images and lines that are as ageless as Garbo's face.".

Anna's carriage is detained because of it and she has to stay the night in a nearby inn with her travel there assisted by Count Vronsky. Her face has been covered up because of the blizzard but once inside the inn she uncovers her face and Vronsky is instantly smitten. Even the maid at the inn feels the chemistry between the two and places Vronsky's and Anna's things in the same room believing them to be married. There is one impediment to the pair's happiness though  Anna is married to a senator and has a son by him. Any spark that was ever there has gone out of the marriage but Anna feels a duty to her station in life and above all her son. Vronsky and Anna keep running into each other at government functions until they can no longer stop themselves ultimately running off to Italy together. However Anna has had to leave her son behind at the insistence of her husband and soon she finds herself missing him. Once back in Russia Vronsky's superior officer visits Anna and tells her that Vronsky will be thrown out of the service if the affair continues. She agrees to leave him if it will save Vronsky's career. There are two endings that were released with this film  a happy ending in America and a sad one abroad. Here you are getting the happy ending.There is only one way to see this film and that is the Warner Archive DVDR and I describe that product here because you might not like what you get. The visual quality of the film is good even if it is a bit soft looking. However the deal breaker is probably the soundtrack. The score was recorded at a live performance and the music chosen is good enough. However the music was recorded at a college showing of this film. In any audience you would probably hear the occasional coughing in the background. Here though you'll hear loud laughter whenever the crowd finds something funny and they apparently find something funny quite often and at the most inappropriate times such as the first time Vronsky sees Anna's face and smiles at her. It just ruins the mood of the whole film. The audience was probably filled with teenagers with nothing better to do on this particular night.I would highly recommend the film but the score and the sound effects will probably leave you feeling taken if you buy the actual Warner Archive product.".

	schema:headline " Let us drink to...LOVE...illuminated by Garbo and Gilbert";
	schema:reviewBody "When lots of classic buffs discuss Garbo's portrayal of Anna Karenina they most often refer to the sound version directed by Clarence Brown in 1935. And they are right since the sound version with Greta Garbo and Fredric March is the supreme adaptation of Tolstoy's novel during the silver screen's heyday. That is the movie which despite its 75th birthday is still highly captivating and thanks to Greta Garbo the story of Tolstoy's heroine touches the depths of viewers' hearts. However whilst developing the knowledge of Garbo's unique presence on screen and her outstanding yet short career I was deeply touched by seeing the silent production LOVE directed by Edmund Goulding the man who later directed one of Garbo's most popular movies GRAND HOTEL. Although the movie LOVE has been quite ignored by many viewers even by Greta Garbo fans it is very much worth attention as a pleasant silent film.The reason why I liked the movie does not lie in its source novel. As a matter of fact there are a number of serious liberties taken when applied to content plots and historical depiction. When you are looking for the Anna Karenina story you had better see other versions for sure. The major reason why I like it lies in the presence of Garbo and Gilbert two main characters into whose empty lives has swept a force that illumines them and changes everything. After their ultra popular FLESH AND THE DEVIL where the chemistry between the two was an absolute revelation and Garbo's magnetism on screen was the combination of thrill and joy carnal desire and overwhelming beauty here Garbo plays again opposite Gilbert and she is truly in love with him as Anna is in love with Vronsky. And the handsome Captain Vronsky though careless reckless once changes himself from within. Gilbert is no worse in the role of Vronsky than he is in his roles as Leo Von Harden Nevs or Antonio. Their scenes can boast unforgettable chemistry and appear to be timelessly genuine. You watch a silent film where two people are really in love with each other...that says for itself. It must have been a smashing success. Garbo and Gilbert are really in LOVE! That aspect is strongly combined with their scenes and moments that are hard to forget. For who can skip the luminous dance on Easter Night? Who can remain indifferent to their spiritual contact at the scenes galore for instance the one of the military race? Who is ready to ignore the tension and wit at their first meeting? This combination of magical charm chemistry and wit leaves a lasting impression in the viewer and you simply consider LOVE one of those silent films that are pleasantly watched over and over again. This power of the main couple makes you forget the source novel and forgive some inaccuracies and liberties. You simply watch a film.The supporting cast contribute to three people Brandon Hurst as Karenin George Fawcett as Grand Duke and Phillippe De Lacy as Serezha. Mr Hurst represents memorably the person who cannot stand any sensation and is a man of old morals as he says 'any gossip about my wife reflects upon me.' Mr Fawcett is the actor who portrays his role as memorably as he did portray Pastor Voss in FLESH AND THE DEVIL. Yet in LOVE he is a different person no longer raging about the sins of his sheep but an understanding general who has a sense of humor who understands delays and gets the gist of sacrifice rightly. Phillippe De Lacy is memorable as Anna's child and steals some of the best scenes with Garbo. It is important to state that those supporting cast also make LOVE a memorable silent.Therefore LOVE is another Garbo film I consider a must in my gallery a pearl of old days when cinema conveyed humane message when performances were unforgettable when there were great stars that illumined screen Garbo and Gilbert in LOVE in a bright story of Love that may face its darkness but is finally illuminated by the dawn of a new day...".

Although the movie LOVE has been quite ignored by many viewers even by Greta Garbo fans it is very much worth attention as a pleasant silent film.The reason why I liked the movie does not lie in its source novel. As a matter of fact there are a number of serious liberties taken when applied to content plots and historical depiction. When you are looking for the Anna Karenina story you had better see other versions for sure. The major reason why I like it lies in the presence of Garbo and Gilbert two main characters into whose empty lives has swept a force that illumines them and changes everything. After their ultra popular FLESH AND THE DEVIL where the chemistry between the two was an absolute revelation and Garbo's magnetism on screen was the combination of thrill and joy carnal desire and overwhelming beauty here Garbo plays again opposite Gilbert and she is truly in love with him as Anna is in love with Vronsky. And the handsome Captain Vronsky though careless reckless once changes himself from within. Gilbert is no worse in the role of Vronsky than he is in his roles as Leo Von Harden Nevs or Antonio. Their scenes can boast unforgettable chemistry and appear to be timelessly genuine. You watch a silent film where two people are really in love with each other...that says for itself. It must have been a smashing success. Garbo and Gilbert are really in LOVE! That aspect is strongly combined with their scenes and moments that are hard to forget. For who can skip the luminous dance on Easter Night? Who can remain indifferent to their spiritual contact at the scenes galore for instance the one of the military race? Who is ready to ignore the tension and wit at their first meeting? This combination of magical charm chemistry and wit leaves a lasting impression in the viewer and you simply consider LOVE one of those silent films that are pleasantly watched over and over again. This power of the main couple makes you forget the source novel and forgive some inaccuracies and liberties. You simply watch a film.The supporting cast contribute to three people Brandon Hurst as Karenin George Fawcett as Grand Duke and Phillippe De Lacy as Serezha. Mr Hurst represents memorably the person who cannot stand any sensation and is a man of old morals as he says 'any gossip about my wife reflects upon me.' Mr Fawcett is the actor who portrays his role as memorably as he did portray Pastor Voss in FLESH AND THE DEVIL. Yet in LOVE he is a different person no longer raging about the sins of his sheep but an understanding general who has a sense of humor who understands delays and gets the gist of sacrifice rightly. Phillippe De Lacy is memorable as Anna's child and steals some of the best scenes with Garbo. It is important to state that those supporting cast also make LOVE a memorable silent.Therefore LOVE is another Garbo film I consider a must in my gallery a pearl of old days when cinema conveyed humane message when performances were unforgettable when there were great stars that illumined screen Garbo and Gilbert in LOVE in a bright story of Love that may face its darkness but is finally illuminated by the dawn of a new day...";

But ninety years after Tolstoy's novel got the full MGM tratment we can get real critical over the happy ending the film got. There was a more realistic ending apparently filmed for foreign markets. But I can only critique what I see.Still for me the best version of Anna Karenina was the one Vivien Leigh did in 1948 which was closest to Tolstoy's work. The sound remake that Garbo did with Fredric March as Count Vronsky is better than this one. The ending there is tragic but there is a postscript softening of Vronsky's character. Fans of Greta Garbo and John Gilbert should still like this. But Tolstoy purists will be disappointed.".

Love hits the high points of the story though it does make the relationship between Anna and Vronsky more a case of two soul mates finding one another than what those two characters are in the novel.Garbo is luminescent as Anna. She was not only gorgeous but she could communicate such depth and soul despite being featured in so many standard melodramas. Gilbert does good and is ardent as the romantic lead but Garbo steals the show. As is usual with most 1920s MGM melodramas the production is lavish and pretty. My biggest issue is that the story is incredibly rushed everything moves so quickly and it feels like scenes were even lost or snipped. Nothing develops gradually. Aside from that problem Love is a nice romantic drama though if you want your GarboGilbert fix you're better off with Flesh and the Devil or A Woman of Affairs.".

	schema:reviewBody "The adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's classic has been brought to screen more than 20 times so far. There are a lot of interpretations of the novel a lot of visions of the sad fate of Anna Karenina. They are generally faithful to Tolstoy's novel. The minor changes entailed in adaptations are not to be criticized since each director has the right to interpret the content of a novel in an individual fashion. Nevertheless Clarence Brown's movie with Greta Garbo in the main role is the most powerful of all adaptations made so far.Before seeing this movie there are some inevitable pieces of information that one should know about this adaptation of Tolstoy's classic. Greta Garbo was cast as Anna Karenina twice in her life. This movie was in fact a remake of the silent film by Edmund Goulding LOVE 1927 where Greta played with John Gilbert one of the most powerful men in her career and private life. That version however had not survived in its popularity in the long run. The producers even made two endings a sad and a happy one so that cinemas could choose an appropriate one for the needs of their audience. 8 years later in 1935 Clarence Brown made something entirely different a movie that really fitted to Greta's talent a sort of tribute to Tolstoy and Garbo something that the fans of both waited for.There are a lot of impressive moments in the movie. From the very beginning the decorations the splendor do leave an everlasting impact in the viewer. The first time we see Anna Karenina is when she gets out of the train and her face becomes more and more visible from the steam technically very well made. Very soon there is an accident on a railroad station a kind of prediction of Anna's death. Among other scenes the moment of her death is particularly moving. Although there is a tragedy the train moves on... And does the world care...?Touching moments are something that make the movie worth seeing. Most moments of Anna being with her son Sergei Freddie Bartholomew make the eyes tearful. Greta Garbo here beautifully shows someone who wants to be a good mother and at the same time someone who desires to be loved and who has the right for personal happiness.The cast are great absolutely impressive performances. Except for Greta Garbo who raised the value of most of films she performed in Basil Rathbone's portrayal of cruel and cold Karenin is really worth your attention. After Greta he is another SHINING STAR of the movie. Freddie Bartholomew as Sergei is memorable too. He was 11 when he played in this film and he managed so well. Fredric March the symbol of the 1930s and 1940s Hollywood did not give his best performance here however there are moments where he plays really well.In spite of some shortcomings of the movie skipped plot of Kitty and Levin long scenes or sometimes dated script fitting to its era only  e.g. in Venice Anna Karenina says to Vronsky Is there still pain in the world? Brown's ANNA KARENINA is a very good film. Although it is 70 years old it is still a high entertainment a piece of film art that deserves the attention of today's audience that deserves being released on DVD.If you like this genre this film is really worth seeing. Even if you are not particularly interested in Tolstoy your pleasure may be reduced to the admiration of real Hollywood elite of the 1930s. WONDERFUL FILM! 910!".

Naturally there are aspects of the story that are forced aside too little time is spent on the relationship between Kitty and Levin who was a selfportrait of Tolstoy but Brown manages to portray the affair between Anna and Vronsky with plenty of depth and emotion.Greta Garbo one of the greatest actresses of the 30's is stunning in the lead. Frederic March is a little flat as Vronsky dressed in his military uniform in almost every scene but manages to do well with the character nonetheless. Basil Rathbone's usual grimness suits Karenin perfectly. The production design is spectacular. Brown directs his cast so that they always stand out from the scenery clearly visible amidst the decadence and imperial settings. The ballroom scenes where characters dance gracefully while exchanging crucial dialogue particularly impressed me.A delight for Garbo fans as well as anyone who likes costume pieces or literary adaptations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anna Karenina seems to have been tailormade for Greta Garbo to play. Ms. Garbo was always cast in these types of role that demanded a great woman's presence. Leo Tolstoy's magnificent novel is adapted with the emphasis on Anna because the massive book it probably took a lot of skill to adapt it for the screen.Clarence Brown the director was a man who was instrumental in guiding Ms. Garbo's American career in the movies. First as a cinematographer then as a director Mr. Brown obviously got the respect and confidence of his star as it's clearly shown in the film.Technically this was a film that was well crafted. In fact after seventy years it still has a crisp look as shown in the great DVD version of the film. The great cinematography by William Daniels shows why this genius behind the camera was one of the best in the business. The splendor of the sets and the art direction by Cedric Gibbons added a rich texture to what comes out on the screen.As Anna Ms. Garbo does excellent work. As a matter of fact her style shows some restraint as she doesn't go into those large gestures to punctuate a situation on a scene. The only thing that detracts from the film is Frederic March's Vronsky. While he was one of the best actors of his time in here he is not as effective as in the rest of his screen work. In fact their romance could have played differently had another actor been cast as the man who conquers Anna's heart.The other principal roles are well played by a wonderful company that MGM put together to support the star. Basil Rathbone is perfect as Karenin the dark figure in the novel. Freddie Bartholomew the child actor has some lovely moments when he is seen playing opposite Ms. Garbo. In fact those scenes show well Anna's tender side something that is in sharp contrast with what she ends up doing abandoning this lovely child. Reginald Owen one of the best character actors of the era is seen as Stiva with great charm. Maureen O'Sullivan is Kitty.Anna Karenina is a film that will live forever because the combination of Greta Garbo's appeal and the great director Clarence Brown that understood her so well.".

The photography and all technical aspects are superb with the costuming and makeup being the very best that money could buy. All these aspects combine to make a very enjoyable production but the fatal flaw in this much condensed version of Tolstoy's classic is the casting. Frederic March brings no passion to the role of Vronsky and noone could ever believe for a minute that Anna would give up her child and position for him. In fact it is even hard to believe that she would leave her husband at all given the totally magnetic performance by Basil Rathbone as Karenin. His is the most memorable character portrayal in the film and he acts the part with superb skill. Vronsky is immediately attracted to Anna as he watches her alight from a train and Garbo's face is suddenly revealed through a cloud of steam. This was quite a magical effect in the cinema as her face gradually appeared and filled the huge movie screen but on video and a TV screen the effect is much diminished and her face appears rather large plain and mask like. Garbo is also referred to as 'pretty' several times during the movie when 'attractive' would have been a better word. Her acting skills are beyond doubt however and by the climax one is genuinely moved when she watches the train pull out of the station and decides that life will no longer be worth living. You can almost read her mind in this scene which is photographed and scored to maximum effect and leaves an indelible impression.".

The two quickly develop as lovers a move that places Anna's future with her son Alexei Freddie Bartholomew in peril. You just know this is going to end badly.Of all the Garbo classics this film most brilliantly opens up its cinematic space and develops a real flare for storytelling that goes beyond the acting. Brown's initial establishing shot  a lavish tracking over a seemingly endless dinner table decked out for the soldiers  is both impressive and commanding. Ditto for his handling of Anna's exile from her home at the hands of her husband another marvelous tracking shot and her fatal final moments on the railway tracks. David O. Selznick personally supervised and produced this spectacular entertainment under the aegis of his MGM contract and the same meticulous attention to detail that would exemplify his own productions by the end of the decade is present here. This is a marvelous film.Warner's DVD transfer is the second most impressive one in the bunch. A generally clean image with minimal grain exceptionally fine detail solid blacks and clean whites greets the consumer. Age related artifacts are present but sufficiently tempered so as not to distract from the presentation. The audio is mono but very nicely balanced and presented at an equitable listening level.".

Her death scene is profoundly moving as is the scene between her and her son Sergei Freddie Bartholomew. Unfortunately for the film while all the supporting actors are marvelous the most important supporting player comes up distressingly short. I cannot for the life of me understand why Anna would leave Basil Rathbone's exciting and strangely attractive Karenin for Frederic March's commonplace and genuinely boring Vronsky. They needed another actor Errol Flynn springs to mind to play the role of Vronsky who is supposed to be the sort of man a woman would leave her husband her family and her entire social existence for. March just isn't all that interesting and it makes the movie more disappointing than it should have been. Rathbone on the other hand is wonderfully repressed with just enough passion lurking beneath the surface to make the viewer ask the inevitable question why would anyone leave Basil Rathbone for Frederic March? You get the sense that a simple conversation between husband and wife would have solved all the problems. 910 stars for the sheer brilliance of Garbo Rathbone and supporting cast with the loss of one star for the forgettable March.".

There are depictions of upperclass Russian rituals such as drinking games dancing and a stage production. These are for the most part welldone although the stage production seemed drawn out.Greta Garbo as Anna Fredric March as Vronsky and Basil Rathbone as Karenin lead the cast. It is an impressive roster and all of them give solid performances especially Rathbone and Garbo but the characters they played were not exceptionally interesting. Freddie Bartholomew is notable as Sergei Anna's astute young scientist of a child that has some touching scenes with Garbo.This film is watchable and has a number of decent scenes but never gains much momentum beyond a basic love story. Sadly I didn't form any strong attachments to the characters such that I was even indifferent to Anna's final fate at the end of the story. I'm not sure how other adaptations of the novel compare but this one is somewhat flat despite having three accomplished performers in the lead parts.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm willing to bet that Anna Karenina was something that Greta Garbo agreed to remake because she thought she might have her same leading man again. She had done Tolstoy's troubled countess in an acclaimed silent version with John Gilbert. When Gilbert's career wouldn't rebound after Queen Christina the year before Garbo took on Fredric March as a second choice.It's not a bad choice March makes a very good love 'em and leave 'em Count Vronsky. The book is nicely edited down to an acceptable movie length although it surely is better suited for a miniseries. But true to the Production Code and March's own image he doesn't leave Anna for another woman and MGM tacks on a cop out scene at the very end where he expresses his profound regrets over the whole business.Greta Garbo is trapped in a marriage to a career minded Basil Rathbone and is bored with the lack of romance. Along comes the dashing Count Fredric March and she leaves husband and child Freddie Bartholomew.The whole point here is the difference in what happens. Tolstoy recognized full well the sexist frame his society operated under but he thought it was a good thing. Women ought to know their place was his idea.When Garbo runs off to Italy with March and then is seen publicly with him in St. Petersburg she is shunned from polite society. March can be shed of her and his return back to his regiment is welcomed Garbo has nowhere to go and her fate is inevitable.Garbo captures the air of tragedy surrounding poor Anna so well you're in tears practically the whole film. You KNOW what her fate must be yet you still watch her entranced. No wonder Anna Karenina is such an acclaimed role for her both silent and sound versions.Basil Rathbone is a proud member of the sexist society of Old Russia yet his performance is also good in that you both feel his pain and hate him for not having an ounce of forgiveness for her.Of the supporting cast my favorite is Reginald Owen who is Garbo's brother. He's cheating on his wife with anyone in sight and then in the end HE lectures Garbo on what her duties are.No wonder there were so many Bolshevik women.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greta Garbo first tackled Anna Karenina in the film Love which she made with John Gilbert. That film however did not follow the novel totally. Under Clarence Brown's direction she now plays the role again opposite Frederic March as Vronsky and Basil Rathbone as Karenin.Having seen the Vivien Leigh version as well it's hard not to make comparisons. This version certainly moves along better than the Leigh version. Here the LevinKitty Maureen O'Sullivan romance is no longer really a subplot but a very minor part of the film. The production values are tremendous as they were also in the Leigh Anna Karenina.What the Vivien Leigh version had that this does not is Ralph Richardson's portrayal of Karenin which is magnificent. Though Basil Rathbone is very good no one can hold a candle to Richardson in this role in my opinion. Rathbone is cold and authoritarian Richardson is cold and authoritarian but pathetic as a man who cannot love. He is also frightening. The scene where Anna sneaks in to see her child and meets Karenin upon leaving had much more tension in the Leigh film because of Richardson's quiet menace. What Rathbone does with a clipped voice and cold expression Richardson does internally.Apparently for some reason casting an appropriate Vronsky missed in both films. This is a man for whom Anna gives up the most precious thing in her life her child and forgoes her reputation. Frederic March outgoing and charming isn't quite right. Vronsky is a soldier but he also has an element of passivity about him. Given Anna's controlling husband she would be attracted to that. I didn't pick that up with March and in the Leigh film Kieron Moore was TOO passive. Also I think Vronsky should be dropdead gorgeous. I mean if you're going to dump your marriage your child your reputation Vronsky really ought to be a dreamboat. Since this is an MGM film perhaps Robert Taylor would have been better handsome strong in voice and appearance charming romantic with just a touch of wimp.The production values are magnificent and Garbo is extremely effective in the role  beautiful ethereal and tragic. If she lacks anything it is perhaps the vulnerability needed for Anna. Freddie Bartholemew is adorable as Anna's son.I was much more involved with the characters in this Anna Karenina than in the Leigh which was a very detached experience. This film was directed with more warmth. Very good.".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of Anna Karenina has little resemblance with Tolstoi novel. In the first place for it's simplicity. While Tolstoi novel is a complex portrait of Russian society in the end of the nineteenth century the movie is a rather simple melodrama in which the complex and dense characters of the novel Levin Kitty Dolly and Stiva are mere extras. Anyway I think that is impossible to make a film of 2 or 3 hours about Anna Karenina. Only on a mini format we can show the whole complexity of the plot and the emotional variations of the characters. Having that in mind we can say that the film is very acceptable. It is not a master piece but considering it's old age of 70 years we can see it we some pleasure I voted a 6. The director Clarence Brown begins the movie in the best way. The plan of the feast table tracked by the camera in which the table seems to be endless is excellent. Also the ball is magnificent showing all the luxury and lavishness in which the Russian high society lived those days. To all this magnificent MGM production is not minor the role of David O'Selznick. On the other hand Greta Garbo does one more of her equal performances of alike characters. Can someone see any difference between Mata Hari Queen Christine Marguerite Gauthier or Anna Karenina? Only in the scenes with Freddie Bartholomew in which she untie herself and smile we can see that if she was allowed she could have made other kind of characters becoming a more versatile actress and getting a higher level on her actress career. The choice of Fredric March as Vronsky seems to me a enormous casting error. His Vronsky could nor enchant a woman and much lesser make her abandon house husband son and be a society pariah for the rest of her life. The performances of the supporting actors are very good with an highlight for the young Freddie Bartholomew for Basil Rathbone as Karenin and for May Robson as Vronsky's mother.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm over sixty and it took that long to get access to seeing all of Garbo's films. This begins quite well but quickly devolves into an attempt at epic filmmaking and we lose the intimacy Anna gains with Vronsky which she didn't find with her husband although her cold stifled marriage is successfully conveyed with a terrific Basil Rathbone as Karenin.In the previous silent version that Garbo sizzled with John Gilbert in the role of Vronsky in the 1927 Love more attention is given to the lovemaking. This 1935 version is well directed by Clarence Brown but transitional scenes feel truncated at the expense of large set pieces a ball the opera etc..Garbo remains imposing however not only as a physical presence but also as a woman whose choices will never make her happy. I found myself watching her hands as much as that gorgeous face.Vronsky is given short shrift here. Neither his revelry which attracts a stifled Anna nor his restlessness are ever developed. He's here and gone and she's under the tracks before we have much time to care one way or the other. The final scene with a mourning Count makes no impression on us the audience or seemingly Frederick March the actor.As a relic of David O. Selznick's famous lavish detailed productions it's memorable.".

This begins quite well but quickly devolves into an attempt at epic filmmaking and we lose the intimacy Anna gains with Vronsky which she didn't find with her husband although her cold stifled marriage is successfully conveyed with a terrific Basil Rathbone as Karenin.In the previous silent version that Garbo sizzled with John Gilbert in the role of Vronsky in the 1927 Love more attention is given to the lovemaking. This 1935 version is well directed by Clarence Brown but transitional scenes feel truncated at the expense of large set pieces a ball the opera etc..Garbo remains imposing however not only as a physical presence but also as a woman whose choices will never make her happy. I found myself watching her hands as much as that gorgeous face.Vronsky is given short shrift here. Neither his revelry which attracts a stifled Anna nor his restlessness are ever developed. He's here and gone and she's under the tracks before we have much time to care one way or the other. The final scene with a mourning Count makes no impression on us the audience or seemingly Frederick March the actor.As a relic of David O. Selznick's famous lavish detailed productions it's memorable.";

	schema:reviewBody "This 1935 version of Leo Tolstoy's famous novel did pretty much what I was expecting it to  strip the novel down to a standard melodramatic love story.Anna's affair with Vronsky and feud with her husband isn't the most interesting thing about Tolstoy's novel. It's how this love triangle is used to highlight aspects of Russian culture at the time including attitudes about class gender roles sex you name it. Anna isn't even the most interesting character and though the book is named for her she disappears for long stretches of time. The film's primary reason for existence is to showcase Greta Garbo in the title role and she suffers as nobly as she always did but what a dull affair the movie makes of that suffering. In the very first scene Clarence Brown suggests that he might direct the film with something other than studio assembly line efficiency. A reverse tracking shot down the length of an opulently decked out dinner table calls attention to itself and part of me wants to believe that this shot visually mimicking the movement of a train between parallel tracks was purposely used by Brown to foreshadow Anna's eventual tragedy. But this first shot is the last time Brown displays any amount of stylistic creativity and it ends up sticking out like a sore thumb in a movie that's otherwise directed with pedestrian anonymity.Grade C".

Garbo as great as she is in other roles got Anna right only part of the time. I wanted to see more of Anna's sunny yet vulnerable and ultimately weak personality and Garbo brought across neither the sunniness nor the weakness until the very end when she played the desperate Anna quite well. She wasn't helped though by a poor script adaptation and a shallow characterization from Frederic March as Vronsky.  Basil Rathbone got Karenin deadon as did Reg Owen as Oblonsky.  Gyles Isham as wasn't even in the right solar system as Levin.The ballroom scene was embarrassingly terrible with all the exposition taking place in stiff dialogue between the characters making the most important and tensionfilled scene in the novel into an eyerolling squirmfest for the viewer.  The most moving scene was when Anna went to visit Sergei  Garbo was at her best when Anna was at her weakest.I will be investigating other film versions of this story  despite the basic failure of this movie it felt good to see my familiar beloved characters brought to life on screen.

Freddy Bartholemew does a fine impression of the stiff cold slightly cadaverous but honorable Basil Rathbone character.It's Rathbone himself who gives the most memorable performance. We've seen him as many villains  crossing swords with Errol Flynn as Mr. Murdstone whipping Freddie Bartholemew the kind of stern autocrat who brings pleasure whenever he goes. We've also seen him as at least a few heroes  most notably Sherlock Holmes  but here his character is complex as complex as his Commanding Officer in Dawn Patrol and he carries it off nicely.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely worth seeing but I prefer Queen Christina and Ninotchka. I've seen many other versions of Anna Karenina and this like the others was rich with atmosphere and in that regard this version surpasses them but I'm not a big fan of Frederick March who overacts. Garbo was splendid as usual but miscasting the lead actor opposite her is a problem that crops up in many of her films. Garbo's style was so romantically intense that few male stars of the time could work a scene with her believably. Her remarkable intensity tended to bring out over acting in her partners who attempted to match her approach. But Garbo knew just when to turn it on and off and how to twist a phrase at the end so the moment didn't become maudlin or corny. Her male costars just stumbled over themselves trying to reach her emotional peaks. Robert Taylor had that problem in Camille as did Ramon Novarro in Mata Hari to name two. John Gilbert her costar from many silent films understood how she worked and Melvyn Douglas who took her on in Ninotchka managed to maintain his own low key acting style which was nicely offset against her specific qualities. Unfortunately in Anna March is stiff and obvious possessing none of the subtlety that Garbo managed to create in scene after scene movie after movie. To condense this massive story down to an hour and a half is a crime. The Vivian Leigh version also cut many of Tolstoy's side plots and entire characters but somehow it seemed less rushed. A much longer mini series has a weak Anna but does have the entire story and all the characters. It's a massive book with many characters and to do it proper justice a miniseries or long epic film is really necessary. Yet Garbo is always worth watching even if the scenes she has with March don't have the power they should. The ending train scene is effective and though it's been done better in other versions none of the other versions have those expressive Garbo eyes that reach to the extreme depths of her soul. What a face! As one of MGM's glossy period dramas the magnificent sets and costumes cinematography and art direction all contribute to a splendid recreation of an era but like most MGM dramas based on the classics it's very Americanized. And with the Hayes Code in place by 1935 the sheer abandon of the actual love story between Anna and Vronsky had to be toned down considerably. This may have contributed to March's overzealous acting style attempting to make up for what they couldn't show on screen  but on the other hand knowing March's acting style from many other films I doubt it. Years ago I saw Love the silent version of Anna Karenina with John Gilbert and Garbo which was my first experience of that story on film. Though the ending was shamefully changed from the book I remember being impressed with how believably passionate Garbo was and how much emotion powered her love scenes with John Gilbert. I'd like to see it again but I've read that the TMC version Warners is selling has a horrible music track recorded live with an audience laughing at inappropriate places. MGM's version of Anna Karenina is from Greta Garbo's prime and for that it is well worth seeing. She's beautiful and says more with a single glance than most novelists achieve with ten chapters.".

On the surface it is a simple tale about a woman with an unhappy marriage who seeks happiness with another man and is punished for it but the novel is actually a carefully crafted patchwork of Russian society with acute insight into the psychology of each character believe it or not that was very innovative back in the late nineteenthcentury. The general critical consensus is that this 1935 version whilst flawed is the best out of the many attempts there have been to film the novel.Greta Garbo stars as Anna Karenina married to the cold bureaucrat Karenin Basil Rathbone who is much older than her. Naturally graceful and beautiful she attracts the attention of the dashing Count Vronsky Frederic March and the two embark on a doomed affair. Meanwhile Vronsky's jilted lover Kitty Maureen O'Sullivan is pursued by farmer Levin Gyles Isham.Readers of the novel will know that the Levin subplot makes up a considerable part of the novel and may be disappointed to know that in this version it is cut down dramatically and Levin and Kitty's sweet romance is used as a contrast to the AnnaVronsky affair without showing the many problems that Levin and Kitty have to overcome. This doesn't have a drastic impact on the enjoyment of the film and it is perhaps for the best that the focus is on the AnnaVronsky affair as that is the most obviously dramatic of the two.From the iconic scene where Anna first steps off the train and Vronsky sees her emerge from a cloud of steam we know that she is doomed. Tragedy is written all over Garbo's face but she is also graceful and seductive. In just one silent moment Vronsky and Anna fall in love and their fate is sealed.March is convincing as dashing Vronsky but it is Rathbone's portrayal of Karenin that is masterful allowing the viewer to feel some sympathy towards him. Perversely some people even find prefer Karenin to Vronsky.Garbo portrays a sophisticated mature Anna passionate but not in the childlike way that Anna is in the novel. How close she is to Anna in the novel depends on which elements of Anna you focus on.As said in the first paragraph this film is flawed. At 90 minutes it is far too short and so the film is very episodic. It contains almost all the scenes you'd expect to see from the AnnaVronsky affair except the crucial scene where Anna almost dies having Vronsky's baby. We have the Hays office to blame for that.".

It was filmed on the locations where the novel's events took place its characters speak in the original language and the spirit of the book was successfully transferred to the screen mostly due to the performances and the cinematography by Leonid Kalashnikov. Tatiana Samoylova radiant Veronica of The Cranes Are Flying plays Anna exactly as Leo Tolstoy had intended her to be a victim of overwhelming passion a woman who had lost herself to love for whom the whole world had concentrated in her beloved Alexei Vronskiy and once she felt he had became tired of her she simply could not and did not want to live. The world famous Soviet ballerina Maya Plisetskaya took a role of Anna's friend Princess Betsy Tverskaya and just to see her walk is worth watching the movie. There is much more in it. Some scenes are unforgettable after so many years. Among them the Vronsky's horse race with the rapid cuts from the faces to horses' heads scene that has to be seen to believe the first dance of Anna and Vronsky  during the dance the lives of many people had changed forever or the scene in the theater where Anna dared to show up after she had left her husband and moved in with Vronsky. For a woman of her social position it was absolutely shocking and totally unforgiving. She was crucified with the looks of the St. Petersburg's Aristocracy but she was standing on the balcony all alone beautiful and smiling and no one knew what she was going through.The original music for the film was written by Rodion Shchedrin who would write later the ballet based on Anna Karenina and his wife Maya Plisetskaya will be dancing Anna  but it is a different story altogether".

For me Samoilova is the closest physically to Anna's character and for that I can forgive the gossips about the influence of her father in obtaining this role. The movie is great and until now 2005 nobody can beat it. Even taking into account the dark ages when this movie was done it it regretful that it is not known enough throughout the world.

	schema:headline " The best version of Anna Karenina";
	schema:reviewBody "Previous to seeing this the best version was Greta Garbo's with Vivien Leigh's close behind while the Joe Wrightdirected adapted fared least. Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is one of the greats of all Russian literature and while this 1967 Russian version is not quite perfect and not for all tastes it does a great job with the story and gets closer than most of the other adaptations in capturing the detail and the spirit of the work rather than just being the basic details in Cliff Notes version.Some of the editing is a little abrupt in places and Anna and Vronsky seemed to fall in love too quickly as if there was intended to be a few scenes in the film explaining Vronsky's infatuation that was cut out when it shouldn't have been. The print that the film comes in on the DVD is rather questionable the constant colour shifts the fading in and out the washed out look and compression indicating a print that was badly damaged in the transfer.Anna Karenina 1967 is generally visually wellmade. The film contains some really striking cinematography especially in the wonderfully delirious horse race scene and the tracking shots that allows one to admire all those splendid rooms and interiors in all their glory haunting use of colour and 1860s Russia is evoked brilliantly in the truly sumptuous period detail. Rodion Shchedrin's music score is not for all tastes admittedly with a few of the more dissonant parts a touch shrill but this viewer found it beautiful and effectively chilling the horse race and ballroom scenes being particularly wellscored.The script is very literate and remarkably nuanced capturing the spirit of Tolstoy's prose better than the other filmed versions. In terms of faithfulness there could have been more with Anna and Vronsky's infatuation and descent into love Levin is present but we don't get a sense of why he is so important a character and Levin and Kitty's subplot deserved better than being mentioned briefly. Other than those things though this film is one of the more faithful in detail and spirit treatments of the book and despite the somewhat short length it has more depth than most of the other adaptations. There are some unforgettable scenes here the horse race certainly is one but one cannot mention the very romantic ballroom scene the scene in the theatre and the heartwrenching suicide scene. The characters are still interesting and the important parts of the story covered well not just being a genuinely poignant love story but also a tense and unbearably tragic social drama too one of the few Anna Karenina adaptations to achieve that balance.The performances are uniformly good with Tatyana Samoylova making for a very heartfelt Anna and bringing many nuances to the part in a way that was achieved by Garbo and not quite as much by the others. Vasily Lanovoy is a dashing Vronsky but manages to bring depth to him instead of being just a handsome heroic figure he is pretty unheroic and unsympathetic actually. And there has unlikely been a more haunting Karenin on film than that of Nikolai Gritsenko. Yuri Yakovlev is amusing as Stiva and Maya Plisetskaya one of the greatest ballerinas of her day and of all time and wife of the film's composer Rodion Shchedrin is a terrific Betsy.In conclusion imperfect but very good film and compares extremely favourably with the rest of the Anna Karenina adaptations. 810 Bethany Cox".

Worst of all is Rodion Shchedrin's shrill strident score. It would be too loud and insistent for an axe murder in an insane asylum in a drawing room from the reign of Alexander II it sounds simply ludicrous and irritating.Vasili Lanovoy is handsome and romanticlooking as Count Aleksey Vronskyhis stiff bearing probably correct stylistically his costumes wonderful. He does love to stare and lurch in that IamIvantheTerrible'skidbrother manner of Soviet film. His hair piece is not very good either.Lanovoy does at least very much look his part which is more than can be said of the woman playing Anna Karenina. She looks a lot more like Anna Magnani complete with black moustache. Mme Karenin is supposed to be an extraordinary aristocratic beauty a being from the highest society. Here she looks like she has strayed from a film by Pietro Germi. The actress likes bombastic reactions right out of Mexican television drama which the camera captures with Shchedrinesque careenings.That great acting was possible even in this school of film is witnessed to by the master player of the role of Aleksey Karenin Nikolai Gritsenko 19121979. He is quite unforgettable and detailed he helps one understand Tolstoy better.Most of the film is the other way around one would hardly understand anything if one had not previously read the novel. The abrupt and disconcerting editing doesn't help.No film could ever hope to do justice to such a literary masterpiece but Clarence Brown's 1935 version is incomparably more satisfactory. Too bad.

Plisetskaya is brilliant and Lanovoy is also delightful. An interesting fact is that before a screening which took place in Sofia Bulgaria the still magnificent Vasiliy Lanovoy commented that his character Vronsky was incapable of the great love which Karenina had the gift for.

With this film Spinosa proves he has made tremendous progress to my mind at least. His hand as a director has become firmer and the subject he has picked this time around is both an exciting and accurate depiction of a psychiatric clinical case erotomania as it happens. He has also chosen Isabelle Carr the ideal actress for the role.The whole plot revolves around an attractive young woman named Anna M. is M. a reference to Fritz Lang's accursed hero? who suffers from solitude and depression. After failing to kill herself she is brought back to life thanks to the care of Doctor Andr Zanevsky. She soon falls in love with him totally disregarding the fact that the man she shamelessly calls Andr is happily married and remains totally unresponsive to her advances.Unknown to the doctor and even to herself Anna suffers from erotomania and having become fixated on him she cannot be reasoned with any more.Her behavior now laughable now extremely dangerous is very well documented and described. Open your medical dictionary and you will realize that all that is shown on the screen corresponds to what is written in the book notably the evolution of the disease in four stages illumination hope spite and hatred. Likewise the interview led by the psychiatrist before Anna is discharged from mental hospital rings true. Just like in real life the therapist tries to find out through a series of questions whether the patient can be regarded as cured or if she is faking. And does it with such empathy such humanity you would never say the scene is being played by ... an actor!Of course Anna M is not in the least a medical documentary for all that.. The story comes first and the writerdirector masters it to perfection. After a halftoned beginning tension soon rises and uneasiness sets in never to release its grip until the end except maybe during the appeased although ambiguous final sequence. The climactic scenes the attempted murder in the subway Anna with the two little girls Anna's relapse are all duly impressive and call to mind prestigious names like those of Hitchcock Psycho and Roman Polanski Repulsion among others.Isabelle Carr must be praised for her interpretation for she is the backbone of the whole effort. Had she not lived up to the spectators'expectations the film would have been a terrible flop even if it had been good in all the other departments. But there was nothing much to fear from such a talented young woman who is so committed to her art and who has already proved how varied her abilities are Les sentiments Se souvenir des belles choses Holy LolaQuatre toiles. Wholly immersed in her character she is every inch the troubled heroine in turns sweet fragile mean and wild. I now look forward to seeing Michel Spinosa's next. Will I be disappointed?

	schema:reviewBody "Anna M. begins with the titular lead staying on afterhours in a large expansive highly decorated library complete with numerous tiers and various places of study for whatnot all the while deeply immersed in her work. She's laying studious claim to her studies so much so that the entire building appears to just shut down around her the general ground floor area long since evacuated as afternoon turns into evening which turns into night which causes the building's lights to go out and render the whole area a crepuscular dead zone of objects brought to life no longer by the rays of light which before gave an odd bronze glow to surroundings. The young woman is still buried into her precise meticulous detailed studying something which the film goes to some lengths to highlight as this calculated careful and exact person is put across as such. The library is actually the zone in which she works her skills or overly enthusiastic attitude to her work and the characteristics seemingly required for it coming to leave said place of business before going on to substantially contribute to the morphing of a number of lives outside of it more often than not for the worse.Isabelle Carr here coming to eventually look a little like Julianne Moore with a headcold as things deepen and worsen plays Anna a softly spoken but desperately troubled French woman a loose canon of mental illness and illthought flitting desperately from place to place and from unbalanced instance to instance  all the while destroying or self destroying. She lives at home with her mother and their pet dog the lack of a father figure or some kind of male orientated presence at the home if it's true an element no doubt experts within particular fields would be able to highlight most certainly contributes to the sort of behaviour and attitudes certainly more broadly linked to that of men that she has. The mother appears somewhat tepid even passive at being able to do anything about anything on another occasion Anna in a clean and remorseless blow comes into contact with the pet dog off in a mechanical and somewhat insensitive manner when her desire to rest takes precedence. Writerdirector Michel Spinosa barely holds back the set of characteristics and general frustration within our Anna certainly on show.Something is definitely wrong with Anna whose first act is to step out in front of a moving taxi in a bid for it to run her down upon leaving her place of work after the opening sequences. This brings her closer to a local doctor named Andr Zanevsky Melki the man whom treats her at the hospital after the failed suicide attempt but whose very treating of her and presence will kick things off into territory just as harrowing. As an initial comingtogether Dr. Zanevsky must intimately feel and explore certain parts of the body that may have been damaged during the contact with the automobile and consequent fall the man perhaps the first to have spoken to Anna in months or even years is immediately the object of her affection and it does not take long for the girl to be smitten. Throughout the film delicately balances precisely where it is Anna lies in terms of her own mindset the ambiguity as to whether she is genuinely insane by way of her talk of hallucinations and the apparent fabrications of memories involving other people goes hand in hand with this morbid level of intelligence she carries around with her something which furthermore allows the film to present her as this conniving devilishly clever stalker whose methods of thinking and ways of getting closer to her beau tempts us into thinking she's anything but a mindless thoughtless idiot doing what she does.The film is a fascinating and unnaturally engaging piece in its own right a game of cat and mouse between an already married man whose objectification within the mind of one disturbed woman whom was the natural victim of procedure following on from her own illadvised actions is the core. The film's addressing of sexual frustration and the systematic dismissing of it as a drive for its protagonist lies within Anna's ability to flirt and successfully pull a metro worker for a one night stand which does not quench the need to continue to chase Zanevsky. An attractive enough girl Anna's issues and the film's attitude in regards to wanting to explore something a little more than a bored young woman out to cause a nuisance for herself and others around her is highlighted to be running deeper here.The film appears to be one of which was constructed by a man with a grim view of women not a sexist one but a view of which is most probably scared or a little weary. Furthermore Anna's ultimate happiness arriving in the form of what it is doesn't necessarily suggest a stance from a filmmaker highlighting that it is the only way women can be happy moreover there are numerous other women in the film whom aren't granted the solution Anna is and appear perfectly functional as is in their respective lives. It would be true to say that most of what unfolds in the film might unfold in mostly any order one would deem fit it is the manner in which such a tale of such a woman and her antics are told in the escalating fashion which they are which keeps it perennially fascinating. Studious rather agonising and nary afraid to take on a truetolife mental illness in the harshest and often bleakest of forms as numerous people around that of the sufferer are affected for the worse Anna M. is a stark and rather oddly fascinating little drama which takes a dart and hits the mark.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anna M Isabelle Carr is a poor and sick girl  she's lonely depressive she has no friends or sentimental life she's got a boring job at the Fench National Library and she lives alone with her mother who seems unable to fill the void of her life. So she naturally tries to kill herself an evening while taking the dog out. And when she wakes up at the hospital she had to find a new meaning to her life and it will take the shape of the doctor who cured her Gilbert Melki for whom she'll develop a crazy love fixation  even if it seems obvious that he only fells indifference for his patient for whom he only have professional concerns she'll convince herself that he shares with her an absolute love. The movie develops wit realism and intelligence this fixation that slowly become a dangerous mental sickness and fallows its progression steps by steps with the seriousness of a psychological study.To the crudity of this study that sometimes really penetrates the intimacy of this troubled conscience Michel Spinosa adds some horrorthriller's touch that wears a double face. Spinosa uses a fantastic tone and even some horror movies figures of style in order to describe the subjectivity of his character nighmare sequences deformed frame to underline the sickness of Anna etc. but he's also stage some horrific triller scenes that lead to the most impressive and tense sequence of the movie where the monstrous character is now in charge of children. The use of horror figures in a traditional dramatic movie is always interesting in the world of french Cinema d'Auteur even if it's more and more common see the recent Le dernier des fous in which Laurent Achard imposed a fantastic tone to a classical family study or ILS a french horror movie supposedly based on real events. And it's nice to see that the mix is quite efficient and that thanks to the the reflection of the psychological and the horror sides you're able to clearly understand the madness of the main character.This description of madness full of tension is certainly the great achievement of the movie but if you're deep in it when you're watching it it's strange to see how its effects quickly disappear after the screening. Even if I was completely emerged in the movie while watching it I didn't kept a strong memory of the movie and it didn't get much impact on me. I think it's partly due to the clinical and cold impression that crosses the all movie and to the fact that you never really fell anything for the characters. Anna is more like a figure of study an experimental subject for whom you don't really get any emotion nor compassion but only understanding than a really human being. And the Dr. Zanevsky doesn't really exist except in Anna's mind. Melki's character is just plain and mediocre and you're never really able to see it through the crazy eyes of his mad lover. That's also why at the end despite the original efforts of the movie I still got the feeling to have watched another classical french little drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Anna M.' is a stylish chilling portrait of a woman's collapse into mental illness yet it's only partially successful as a film in spite of a great performance from Isabelle Carre in the lead role excellent cinematography and an understated effective score. This is partially because at times it threatens to descend into a straightforward psychopathic stalker movie and however nicely this is worked out it's a plot line made dull through overuse and the fact that the victim by definition cannot be held responsible by the viewer for their actions. In my opinion most interesting films leave the audience to judge the character which can't be done with this plot line. Cleverly the film cleverly brings this subplot to a premature climax which turns out to be just a local peak on the overall narrative arc but that wider story although more innately interesting never quite lets us into its secret. The tale begins after all with a kind of suicide attempt what led up to this is never explained even though it's clearly the root cause of what happens after as well. For me 'Anna M.' falls in between a thriller and a character study with some of the merits of both but also not without the faults of each genre a miss rather than a hit though not without interest.".

Carre IS without doubt a Great actress and seems to have made a speciality out of sickness her portrait of a young woman stricken with Alzheimer's in Zabou Breitman's Se Souvenirs des belles choses was unforgettable and it would have been unthinkable had any other actress copped the Best Actress Cesar that year. In Anna M she does it again but this time without the selfawareness of her character in Se Souvenirs. Okay we can't drag the story into a strong light less the flaws hit us in the face  for example a woman like Anna would never in a million years secure a job as a nanny to two young girls seemingly without a single reference and based on a five minute interview nor would a locksmith be prepared to break into an apartment on the say so of a barely plausible young woman claiming to live there. We're prepared to overlook this sloppy writing solely because the performance of Carre IS so towering so majestic.We know that Americans don't do irony but can we I wonder say as much for the French in A la folle ... pas de tout Isabelle Carre played the wife of doctor Samuel L Bihan who was stalked by a deranged Audrey Tautou convinced he was in love with her in Anna M Carre plays the stalker and Anne Consigny has Carre's old role as doctor Gilbert Melki's innocent wife. The films even share a final moment when in each case the seemingly 'cured' leading lady shows the audience that this is far from the case. Tautou is of course a fine actress but Carre is a Great one who gives a ten out of ten performance here only the sloppy plotting mentioned above drags the rating to nine out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2008 Palm springs International Film Festival. This is the story of Anna M Isabelle Carr a young and lovely manuscript restorer at the national library in Paris who develops a fatal attraction to the handsome married Dr. Andre Zanevsky Gilbert Melki. Anna one day decides to commit suicide by walking into oncoming traffic and is severely injured as a result of being struck by car. While hospitalized she develops a crush on her doctor which upon her release develops into a dangerous delusional disorder called erotomania where she believes the doctor is deeply in love with her which leads to her pursuit and harassment and stalking of him. The film divided into four chapters which represent the four stage of erotomania Illumination Hope Disappointment and Hatred. The four chapters may also represent the film goers four stages of experiencing this film. The premise of the film's story is good and full of possibilities but it ultimately becomes so farfetched and implausible that it never delivers as either a psychological thriller or a study into mental illness. The doctor can never convince the police that this woman represents a dangerous threat to he and his wife. He is after all a respected surgeon and Anna M. is a woman with a history of mental illness. She just tried to kill herself and at one point in the film her mother recognizes that Anna is losing her grip on reality and comments that it's happening again so she must have a history of mental instability even before the attempted suicide. She simply resumes her life after the suicide attempt and as she escalates her harassment of Zanevsky and his wife the police take Anna's side. Anna gets a job as a nanny for tow young girls in the apartment above the Zanevsky's without any references or background checks or employment resum and immediately begins her final stage of stalking the doctor from her on site vantage point. Carr plays the role in such a onedimensional way that you are left not really caring about the character and would just like to see her locked up somewhere for along time getting the help she needs. The ending is so ambiguous that you don't know if she's dreaming it up or not and is certainly an unsatisfactory conclusion to the story. Michel Spinosa writes and directs this film that looks good and has a lot of possibilities but falls short. I would give this a 6.0 out of 10.".

Those are some fine men and they entered our shipboard environment seamlessly. During the filming on his off time Mickey Rooney performed for the crew with his own oneman show in one of the hanger bays. He played drums like one would never expect him to. He was a good musician and great fun to be around. I would sure like to thank Rooney and Holliman for making our lives pleasant in such a distant and lonely place.Once I was walking down a passageway and saw a very small pilot in a flight suit. I didn't think that one would find pilots that short because of the Navy's requirements for aviators. Then I saw his face and it was Mickey Rooney. Rooney and the film crew stayed on board for Thanksgiving and that has to be the most memorable Thanksgiving I ever had.To me that film is a time capsule and every time I see it it brings back fond memories of life on the Oriskany. The Oriskany was the last Essex class aircraft carrier built and it was about three years old when I was on it. Sadly it's been scuttled and turned into fish habitat.Anyway like I said Holliman and Rooney are excellent people I never met Holden but he was there too.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a truly superb film on any number of grounds. First and generally unknown it is based on a real incident the so called Battle of Carlson's Canyon which was waged early in the Korean War in an attempt to interdict North Korean supplies on their way to the front. James Michener had gone out to the carrier ESSEX CV9 and had been very impressed with the men of VF172 a Banshee fighter squadron. The book is astonishingly realistic...if one compares what he wrote as a novel with the contemporary Navy strike reports which were then highly classified it is amazing how much he got right. It is also a good look at carrier aviation in the last days of the straightdeck carrier with hydraulic catapults and a paddlewaving landing deck officer...all that disappeared after Korea with the introduction of the angled deck the steam catapult and the Fresnellens mirror landing system. The book is in my view the finest air war novel ever written bar none and the movie is the same for the film genre. Incidentally when made into a film Grumman Panthers were used in place of Banshees and one of the pilots who flew in the making of the film was a very young Lt. j.g. named Alan Shepherdlater one of the Mercury and Apollo astronauts. Not to be missed!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Korean War is the setting for The Bridges At TokoRi' a story of individual sacrifice and the high cost of freedom from director Mark Robson.  Navy fighterpilot Harry Brubaker William Holden a veteran of World War II is called to serve again when the conflict in Korea escalates which takes him away from his wife Nancy Grace Kelly two young children and a successful law practice.  When his plane goes down after a mission into the sea just short of the carrier he survives but he bitterly questions the fairness of what he has been asked to do while everyone back home is able to go on with the routine of their lives uninterrupted.  Rear Admiral George Tarrant Fredric March a man who has had his own share of personal tragedy he looks upon Brubaker as the son he has lost to the war himself tells Brubaker it's a matter of distance we do this because we're here back home they're only doing just as you would be doing if you were there.  When Brubaker is granted shore leave strings are pulled and arrangements are made for Nancy and the children to join him a brief respite after which he must return to face his most formidable challenge yet flying against the bridges that span the canyons at TokoRi.  Very probably a suicide mission it is nevertheless believed that knocking out these particular bridges could bring about a turning point in the war and Lieutenant Brubaker is called upon once again to play a pivotal roll in deciding the outcome. An excellent supporting cast ably brings to life the characters that infuse this drama with humanity.  Mickey Rooney is unforgettable as Mike Forney the fighting Irish helicopter pilot who fishes Brubaker out of the sea when his plane crashes.  Memorable as well are Earl Holliman Nestor Gamidge Forney's partner Robert Strauss Beer Barrel Charles McGraw Commander Wayne Lee Keiko Awaji Kimiko and Willis bouchey Captain Evans.  An excellent precursor to the more recent Saving Private Ryan' and U571' The Bridges At TokoRi' is an intimate study of individual courage and responsibility and of the moral fortitude of which man is capable in times of crisis.  There is a finality to the climax of this film that underscores the intense personal aspects of the larger conflict and of the price demanded by certain individuals chosen to fulfill a seemingly random destiny.  At the end of the movie Admiral Tarrant sums it up succinctly when he ponders aloud  Where do we get such men?'  To which we can only answer  Where indeed.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:headline " Ted Williams must have appreciated this film";
	schema:reviewBody "The famous Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer Ted Williams must have had a grimly ironic appreciation of The Bridges at TokoRi when this film came out. After serving in the Marines in World War II Williams was called back to the Marines for the Korean War and for the better part of two years flew the jets that you see Bill Holden flying here in the Navy. Just as the Korean War interrupted one of the best baseball careers of the last century in real life in this film William Holden is recalled from a thriving law practice in Denver Colorado not to mention from his lovely wife Grace Kelly and their two children. He flies carrier based jets bombing targets in the Korean War wondering like Ted Williams what he did in life to get called for two wars.A few years earlier Warner Brothers did a fine film called Task Force which depicted the history of naval aviation through the eyes of its protagonist Gary Cooper. The history went as far as the end of World War II and we were still flying propeller planes. Maybe today's viewer can identify with a film like Top Gun where the skills are now a learned routine. But the Korean War was the first fought with jet aircraft and pilots had to really learn and develop new skills to take off and land on an aircraft at supersonic speed. Everyone even the Russians were all new at this in 1950 when the Korean War started.Some critics have said Grace Kelly was wasted in this part basically doing a role June Allyson perfected. Actually if you pay close attention she's not terribly different from her role as housewife and mother in The Country Girl where she got her Oscar. She's just married to someone different is all. She has a very effective scene with her husband's commander Admiral Fredric March when she flies to Japan to be with Holden taking along their two children. My favorite in this film however is Mickey Rooney. He plays a helicopter rescue pilot and we first meet him and his copilot Earl Holliman rescuing Holden from the deep blue sea. Rooney is an irreverent sort on duty with a green scarf and green top hat looking like one of the little craitures from Ireland. Quick to brawl but a real friend when you need one I love his philosophy that you can say anything to officers as long as you put a sir on the end of it. There weren't going to be too many promotions in his future.The Bridges at TokoRi is filled with a lot of Cold War nostrums and dated in that respect for today's audience. But it is a great tribute to those jet pilots the crews that supported them and the families that loved them trying out those new skills in a brand new kind of war.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Holden is sent to bomb the Bridges at Toko Ri in the 1954 film also starring Frederic March Grace Kelly and Mickey Rooney. It's a very good film about the carrier operations in Korea and according to one of the posters here very accurate. The Korean War was the first war that utilized jets meaning that the pilots had to be educated in new techniques to take off and land on aircraft. Sometimes there were problems and they had to ditch into freezing water and be saved via helicopter. There were a lot of technical aspects of the work of the pilots shown in this film.Holden plays an attorney who is called into service and has to leave his practice and family. He is chosen by his commander March to perform a very dangerous mission bombing bridges from the air  in this case there's no way to hide from the enemy they can see you coming.There are some very exciting moments and some striking air fights throughout the film as well as good acting. It's a little heavy on star power  why was Grace Kelly in this? She has a very small role that could have been played by any young leading woman. Nevertheless she's lovely and very pretty certainly a good match for Holden. Holden was an ideal film star and ideal for this sort of film with that rugged handsome face and very masculine persona. He also plays the role with a likability and vulnerability  you really can't lose with him. Frederic March gives a strong performance as his commander. The showiest role belongs to possibly the showiest actor Mickey Rooney as a brave helicopter pilot who is a little bit shorttempered while on leave. As the jailer in Tokyo tells Holden Keep an eye on him. There's still a part of Tokyo that's unharmed. All in all a very good and sobering film. The old men send the young men off to war  and they're still doing it.".

I recommend it to all who are interested in aviation especially naval aviation. The one thing not depicted is the problems experienced by the destroyers in heavy weather as the carriers turned into the wind and out of the wind during flight operations especially during chow times. This could probably be shown in a separate movie but I still have vivid memories of my ship diving into the sea and the foam combing over the flying bridge and down both sides of my ship. Trying to log sack time during these times was also an experience unto itself. Incidentally we did lose on fly boy as a result of his ditching. We were told that exposure of more than 5 minutes in those waters could prove fatal and this guy's case it was so. Not a happy time.".

Its not until the true value of ones life is realized will one come to fully value the life they have to live. This movie presents this realism to us. Its not always the perfect presentation. But then again what is in the real world. I would suggest however that one reads Micheners' Book The Bridges at TokoRio before seeing the movie. More insight might be gained beforehand. The novel only adds to the movie. This movie was made when America was at its zenith in its place in the world. America stood alone as the first superpower. As yet unchallenged but soon to be by the very nation whose personnel manned the planes guns and radar stations seeking any incoming planes onto Korean airspace. Still even though the hero dies in the doing he still dies while doing something considered noble worth dying for. Even the hero's wife who agonizes over the whys and wherefores of her husband being part of something most of America has no idea is even happening. And the hero is not even an enlisted man. He volunteered. He shouldn't even be there! Before seeing the movie read the book. The movie was great.".

	schema:reviewBody "War is one of the most tragic human events that can occur. The Bridges at Tokori is an illustration of such. Harry BrubakerWilliam Holden was a Denver attorney who happened to be a naval combat pilot in WWII and an inactive member of the reserve. For reasons that he did not understand he was recalled to active duty for the Korean War and assigned to flying duties aboard an aircraft carrier. This recall forced him to lose his law practice lose his home and be separated from his family. After several harrowing experiences he is eventually killed in action leaving behind a beautiful wifeGrace Kelly and two lovely daugthers. Happily yet sadly he was able to see them during leave in Japan prior to embarking upon his illfated mission.The title of the movie concerns this mission a dangerous air raid against highly defended strategic bridges. After overcoming profound premission anxieties he and his fellow pilots amazingly emerge unharmed following a successful raid on the bridges. Ironically the squadron subsequently raided a secondary target where Brubaker's aircraft received a hit that caused him to lose fuel. After losing fuel too quickly to make it back to sea he attempted and survived a dramatic crash landing in enemy territory. Eventually he and two wouldbe helicopter rescuers Mike Forney and Nestor Gamidgeportrayed by Mickey Rooney and Earl Holliman Jr. who had successfully resuced him from a crash landing at sea earlier in the story are killed by enemy infantry.Our country has been served by many military reservists who can empathize with Harry Brubaker even though they may not have been called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he was. From an entertainment perspective there are some moments for laughter and an outstanding cast. The picture also features some superb aerial photography. Like most movies each time I watch it I seem to get a little more out of it. I wrote to Mr. Rooney a couple of years ago and told him that each time I watch this movie I hoped that he and Mr. Holliman could rescue Mr. Holden again at the end. I appreciate and accept though that many war stories cannot have a happy ending. It is certain that all wars have an unhappy ending for someone.".

	schema:headline " A Forgotten War";
	schema:reviewBody "For those who remember it the war in Korea remains an enigma from murky beginning to wobbly close 19501953. It wasn't even called a 'war'. Instead politicians dubbed it a 'police action' which of course fooled no one 30000 plus dead Americans. Tokori stands as perhaps the only film to capture the popular uncertainty of that conflict. Some reviewers characterize the movie as antiwar but it's not. Instead it reflects an American public's longing for peacetime following the horrific sacrifices of WWII and the fresh sacrifices of a new war they neither understood nor desired. In the movie Fredric March's fatherly admiral makes the official case for intervention. In a key scene with a skeptical Grace Kelly he lectures on communist aggression and the necessity of stopping them where they stand. In a routine actioner that would have been enough. It's not enough for William Holden's Captain Brubaker however. And the fact that the Holden character continues to question his personal role reflects the mixed feelings of ordinary Americans who continued to be torn between patriotic duty on one hand and the exotic nature of the conflict on the other. To the film's lasting credit the ending does not copout in a blaze of heroics that might have undercut the script's ambivalent message. And it is this message of moral uncertainty that makes Bridges arguably the most accurate memorandum from that longago war. The movie itself remains an Agrade production with some fine aerial photography shipboard action and special effects. It's also one of Holden's best understated performances superior to his Oscar role in Stalag 17. Not to be overlooked is the Mickey Rooney character which remains a revealing one. His buoyant hijinks and rowdy behavior amount to a holdover of a familiar WWII stereotype. Yet the clowning here fails to gel with the prevailing mood and would vanish from serious treatments by the time Vietnam rolled around. Then too by the time of the movie's release 1954 audiences were eager to get back to the certainties of WWII and studios responded with a spate of popular WWII fare such as Mr. Roberts 1955 Battle Cry 1955 and Operation Petticoat 1959. Except for a straggler or two Hollywood would make no more Korean war films. And so the process of forgetting that Forgotten War had begun. But in retrospect this was one of the few films of the decade to foreshadow the Vietnam trauma that was to follow while the final shot of Holden's Captain Brubaker proved to be far more suggestive of war on the Asian mainland than critics could have anticipated Tokori was not well received. It's only now many years later that viewers can appreciate the prophetic value of that final image along with the peculiar merits of this 1950's Hollywood oddity.".

Set in the second half of the Police Action known as the Korean War when both the United Nations' forces and the Communists were locked in a stalemate Brubaker a disgruntled lawyer called up to fulfill his reservist duty as a pilot on an aircraft carrier fumes at the injustice of having to fly again. I've done my part! Lt. Brubaker seethes at his commanding officer. Nothing will stop him from his boiling resentment nor can he stop thinking about his family his wife Grace Kelly and two daughters come to see him on liberty in Japan only adding to his internal misery.Then there are the heavily defended bridges that channel freight through a mountain range in North Korea. To attack the bridges the carrier pilots must fight their way through murderous antiaircraft fire. The bridges are important but more than that they symbolize how far the U.S. and its allies are willing to go to defeat the Communists. And this will cost lives.In this age of computergenerated wizardry the special effects of BTR really stand up. Using models for jet aircraft attacking the bridges actually works here the viewer gets the feel for the claustrophobic geography of the place where the aviators must strike. The movie is filmed extensively on one of the navy's Pacific Fleet carriers adding to the general realism.But good SFX won't take away the sting of the tragic end Brubaker faces first in his learning of how hard it will be to survive the attack then as the North Koreans close in on him after being shot down. The rescue chopper's pilot Mickey Rooney also shot down hunkers in a muddy drainage ditch with Brubaker taking shots at the North Koreans while dodging grenades lobbed at them.The last third of the movie is excruciating to watch. And to think this was made in the land of vanilla the early 1950s! My recommendation is to see The Bridges at TokoRi with your expectations of a happy ending locked away and your appreciation of the real pilots who fought in this dirty little war way out front. As Brubaker's commanding admiral Frederick March says in quiet and emotional admiration Where do we get these men?".

His main contention and that of thousands of Servicemen is 'Why me' again? Repeating what James Steward asks in Strategic Air Command. The question stems from a nagging but valid fear of attacking several dangerous supply bridges spanning a narrow gorge in North Korea. They are fully protected by numerous artillery batteries and murderous rocket crossfire which few survive. The strength of this film derives from Holden's character and that of his friends Mike Forney Mickey Rooney Nestor Gamidge Earl Holliman and Charles McGraw as Cmdr. Wayne Lee. Perhaps that's why this film is one of my favorites as it promotes rational thinking instead of slavishly adhering to obsolete archaic and oscillating military and government rhetoric. ".

As he is reluctant to fly and must come to terms with his own ambivalence towards a nearimpossible assignment and the fear of having to bomb a location of highly defended bridges .

Good production design and spectacular carriers  fighters  aircrafts and helicopters  in fact  the U.S. Navy's cooperation in the movie's making included the use of 19 ships. The shipboard scenes were filmed on the U.S.S. Oriskany whose number CV34 is well visible  however during shooting the Oriskany needed repairs and the shooting was completed on her sister ship U.S.S. Kearsarge CV33. A magnificent cast with a splendid William Holden who agreed to do the film on the sole condition that the producers keep the original ending of the novel and a gorgeous Grace Kelly . Supporting cast is frankly excellent such as Fredric March  Robert Strauss  Charles McGraw Willis Bouchey and uncredited Corey Allen and Dennis Weaver . Special mention to Mickey Rooney who stands out with his likable portrait of a helicopter rescue pilot along with Earl Holliman  this is the first of three war dramas in which Mickey Rooney's character is wounded by a hand grenade .The motion picture was well realized by Mark Robson. In the early 40s Robson was much involved with the lowbudget terror unit in charge of producer Val Lewton  for whom made Seventh victim The ghost ship and Island of the dead. In the late 1940s Robson joined Stanley Kramer's independent company and directed his biggest commercial hit to date with The champion. Years later Robson made another good film about corruption in boxing world titled The harder they fall with Humphrey Bogart. In the late 1960s his work did decline . His last movie was a jinx one titled Avalancha express. Robson and his main star Robert Shaw died suddenly from heart attacks. And of course  Bridges at TokiRi was one of his best films  rating  Above average . A topnotch cast  spectacular flying  tense images and romantic drama help make this one a superior effort of its kind . Well worth seeing  this is the ordinary War movie that Hollywood does so well .

	schema:reviewBody "William Holden is a naval aviator in 1952 flying from a carrier against shore installations in Korea. His wife is Grace Kelly. His pals who fly the rescue helicopter are Mickey Rooney and Earl Holliman. The admiral who runs the show is Frederick March who looks upon Holden as a son. Charles McGraw is Holden's immediate superior officer.Mitchener divided his novel into three major section Land Sea and Air. The movie follows suit though it begins with an incident at sea. Holden ditches in the icy ocean and is saved by Rooney and Holliman. But we are soon ashore in Japan where Rooney a hottempered Irishman gets into scraps of the sort often found in military movies. Grace Kelly has a small role. She must come to terms with the fact that Holden is putting his neck on the chopping block when he goes up never more so than during the coming attack on the bridges at Toko Ri where chances of survival seem minimal.In fact on this mission his aircraft is hit and loses enough fuel that Holden must crash short of the sea. The tension is agonizing. After he plows into a field his comrades do what they can to discourage the converging North Korean infantry and Rooney and Holliman show up in a rescue helicopter. Their helicopter is promptly shot down and Holliman killed. Holden and Rooney find themselves alone in an irrigation ditch surrounded by the enemy and it is heartbreaking when their own aircraft wave their wings and leave for lack of fuel and ammunition. The ending is tragic.Yet it's a frustrating movie. Frederick March has to give one of those discredited why are we here rationalizations in which he offers us a domino theory. We have to stop the communists in Korea otherwise they'll take Japan the Phillipines and so on. Where would you have us make our stand? The Mississippi? There is also one of those speeches in which McGraw as the commander of the final flight has to tell his fliers that if anyone wants to back out for any reason it's his duty to do so rather than endanger the mission. Right. Just try it.The aerial photography is unusually good and so is the model work. Grumman Panthers were handsome aircraft. They still LOOKED like airplanes in 1952  they had an identifiable fuselage wings and a tail assembly. It's impossible to fault the scenes in which they appear.The enlisted men are used mainly for comic relief but at that they're an improvement over March's admiral. He's human enough and is meant to be sympathetic but what a bore. It's the wrong war in the wrong place but you fight because this is the one you're stuck with. And he lathers personal advice on Grace Kelly and William Holden even when it's not wanted when it's dicey and possibly dangerous to do it  a big knowitall.None of this detracts from the impact of this film though grounded in reality not fantasy. One of our boys doesn't necessarily lick ten of theirs. When ten of theirs oppose one of ours the one of ours dies in a most unglamorous fashion. In many ways and despite its lack of gore this is a better antiwar movie than most that have appeared on our screens lately. In the end we're left with nothing but admiration for these pilots scared and reluctant warriors doing their jobs even when the outcome is liable to be lethal to them. March puts it well at the end when he muses to himself Where do we get such men?".

Michner the author did not write this book as an antiwar film. Some of his latter books were but this was not antiwar. If you read the book which I suggest you might agree with me. High Noon is not a Western. It is a story set in the West but doing the right thing even at the cost of your life is what made that movie an icon. So too is Bridges. Lt. Brubacher is like many men who are called to duty. They would rather stay at home keep their careers and stay close to their family. The doubts about giving up your personal life for your country is the core of the drama. That is what makes this movie almost as good as High Noon.The bad things about this movie is the action. Lt. Brubaker played by William Holden is a Navy fighter pilot. Fighter planes are designed to fight enemy aircraft and support ground troops. The first generation jet aircraft such as the ones Holden flew did not carry bombs. Some did carry rockets but they would not be used to take out concrete bridges. Bombers like the B29 and B25 would have been used for such a mission. Only they had the capacity to destroy bridges made of reinforced concrete and they would usually require numerous hits.So the whole military action scenes are fictional as well as poorly done. The actual flying and landing scenes are terrific. The sights and sounds on launch and recovery are great because they are authentic. So are the ditching scenes which if not from actual combat were probably from real training films about how to ditch.As for Holden's character he is real enough. If he had been married to a frump what was at stake would not have been as great. But to lose someone like Grace Kelly makes his sacrifice even greater.The cost and sacrifice of men at war has nothing to do with whether the cause is right or just. Those phrases are for the recruiters. Once you are in uniform they are meaningless. Your allegiance switches from flag and country to you and your buddies. Whether in a fox hole or in the sky it doesn't matter what side you are on. The enemy is on the other side of the hill or coming at you from above. The loss of life is part of the horror of war regardless of whether its justified or not.".

William Holden Frederic March Mitchum et all were men and taught me how to be a man act like a man be gallant and even die like a man.. At the end of the movie you had a lesson you could take home and use in life. These days someone growing up would watch Adam Sandler Mike Myers type movies where they learn nothing at all except joking around lying chasing girls etc. They could also watch fantasy Star Wars type movies that turn them into fantasy type computer addicts. After watching a movie nownot Lincoln Private Ryan but not many you would need hours of reading and therapy to negate the corroding influence of today's movie culture . Thanks to these great actors and director WWII and the Cold Warin this case gave us great plots and examples and gave those who paid attention a leg up. A very good movie is Bridges at Toko Ri that i highly recommend".

When the movie started screening in the state controlled cinemas in early 1943 the tide had turned clearly against Germany and it was becoming pain fully evident for most Germans despite the enormous propaganda machine that was so representative for naziGermany.This horribly boring film enabled war weary Germans to forget about war and leap into a world so surreal it made any episode of the Xfiles seem like a trustworthy documentary.Swedish actress Kristina Sderbaum makes a laughable effort in her role as Anna Jobst a woman whose naive take on the world for some reason in the end makes her commit suicide. Not a minute too soon although for the viewer the reasons seem to be missing due to the Clumsy editing that director Veit Harlan known nazi propaganda filmmaker performed in a haste that managed to make this incredibly poor film even worse quite a feat.It could be summed up to be a stupid movie for stupid people made by stupid people. That would however be far too simple to just dismiss this movie as a harmless movie. The plot itself is harmless the context in which the movie was made and its purpose makes it a terrible symbol of how some people are capable of ignoring the world falling to pieces around them and happily settling for lies fed to them.After her career in naziGermany with Veit Harlan Kristina could never return to Sweden or even leave Germany due to her infamous collaboration with Harlan and his propaganda films and no doubt due to her obvious total lack of acting skills.

The director is the infamous Veit Harlan and he is also one of several people working on the script. The lead actress here is his wife Kristina Sderbaum one of the defining actresses of Nazi Germany certainly also because of her looks that were widely considered the epitome of what an Aryan woman would look like. But honestly I must say that I have seen some of her works and I do not think she is a particularly gifted actress at all. And this film here does not change my attention. Admittedly you have to say in her favor that the script she is given to work with here is also not a strong achievement at all. It tries to be emotionally investing so hard and that we care so so much for the protagonist that it becomes pretty cringeworthy quickly. I must say I can understand somehow why German audiences really appreciated this film during the Nazi reign. Color was something they weren't used to and it's certainly breathtakingly beautiful to watch a film like this if you are used to blackandwhite. But in terms of the plot it makes me somewhat sad they fell for cheap tearjerk material like Harlan's work. There is really nothing special at all about the writing. I did not enjoy the watch. It moved slowly and steadily but there was absolutely nothing memorable about it. Thumbs down. Definitely a case of style over substance.".

	schema:reviewBody "G. W. Pabst is one of the few cinematic geniuses... The range and diversity of his films are enormous from studies in war to psychoanalytical case histories... 'Westfront' is a stark impressive film with a plot somewhat similar to Lewis Milestone's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'... The film follows the existence of four ordinary soldiers fighting on the French front during the last months of the war... Between them they experience love infidelity insanity and ultimately death... They are the innocent and helpless victims of a grotesque stupidity and the poignancy of their predicament is emphasized rather than diminished by Pabst's austere approach and the film's pervading atmosphere of pessimism... Pabst's intention is to remove all hints of glory and romance from war... Again and again certain motifs reappear in the film the trenches the barren stretch of land in front of the German lines torn and removed decorated with barbed wire and shrouded in smoke and fog... By the process of repetition of the same scene dialog is kept to a minimum and there is effective use of natural sounds Pabst conveys the muddy chaos and monotony but above all the isolation and deadliness... In one impressive scene the fog slowly dissolves and in direct proportion to its rate of dissolution hope rises of breaking out of the claustrophobic fear that the men and now the audience feel until the spiritual elation caused by that prospect is shattered as we see that they are confronted by row upon row of tanks steel monsters bearing fire and destruction...'Westfront' is as the French film historians Maurice Bardche et Robert Brasillach have described it a 'sombre and hopeless picture of war.'".

Between them they experience love infidelity insanity and ultimately death... They are the innocent and helpless victims of a grotesque stupidity and the poignancy of their predicament is emphasized rather than diminished by Pabst's austere approach and the film's pervading atmosphere of pessimism... Pabst's intention is to remove all hints of glory and romance from war... Again and again certain motifs reappear in the film the trenches the barren stretch of land in front of the German lines torn and removed decorated with barbed wire and shrouded in smoke and fog... By the process of repetition of the same scene dialog is kept to a minimum and there is effective use of natural sounds Pabst conveys the muddy chaos and monotony but above all the isolation and deadliness... In one impressive scene the fog slowly dissolves and in direct proportion to its rate of dissolution hope rises of breaking out of the claustrophobic fear that the men and now the audience feel until the spiritual elation caused by that prospect is shattered as we see that they are confronted by row upon row of tanks steel monsters bearing fire and destruction...'Westfront' is as the French film historians Maurice Bardche et Robert Brasillach have described it a 'sombre and hopeless picture of war.'";

Both this film and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT are terrific World War I films that give an awful and realistic view of the war from the perspectives of ordinary German soldiers. As a result both are also profoundly antiwar films that were later banned by the Nazi government that took power just a few years later. Of the two ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is a slightly better film because it has an excellent back story in other words setting up the characters and giving them some depth. Instead WESTFRONT 1918 is more like a hidden camera that just shows parts of the waronly towards the very end of WWI. Also unlike ALL QUIET this film only once follows one soldier home and shows life outside the battlefield. Mostly the film is just one battle scene after another after another. Despite seeming a tiny bit out of context because of this it is still a super effective and moving piece of film. A truly wellmade and exceptional film with ultragritty realism. It is occasionally tough to watch as there are corpses everywhere and the action is often up close and very personal.As I said this film isn't quite as perfect and profound as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT though it actually is better than the exceptional French film J'Accuse or THE EAGLE AND THE HAWKtwo other terrific WWI films that emphasize the futility and waste of this stupid war.".

But behind the apparent crudity is expert filmmaking for example when the clouds of poison gas blow away only to reveal the advance of unstoppable tanks against a bleak landscape of posts and barbed wire we realize the futility of the entire operation. There is never a distant horizon just the immediate surroundings or the next line of barbed wire and pickets. Nevertheless there is little symbolism here just a closeup picture of how life and death in the trenches must really have been. Possible spoilers follow  In one of the most compelling scenes the Student's comrades find his dead body in a mud hole all they can do for him is throw a few spadefuls of earth on the body. The tight understated camerawork underlines the restricted world and helplessness of the protagonists. There is a strong emphasis on how the ordinary person is trapped in the process of war. In several scenes an actor apologizes both in the trenches and when Karl finds his wife in bed with the butcher each time the subtitle says It wasn't my fault but the German is closer to I couldn't help it. At the end the mad and dying Karl Diessl sums it up It's everybody's fault. A French soldier tries to gain comfort from pressing Karl's dead hand is it hope for rapprochement or more futility?".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that actually doesn't really have a main plotline in terms of following one main character and have a clear beginning middle part and end. Just like war there is no logic in it and things just happen within this movie as the movie moves along. It puts you right in the middle of things and shows you the madness of war.It handles all different kinds of aspects from the war. It doesn't only show the situation from the viewpoint of the young soldiers but it also focuses on the family and girls back home. It doesn't do this by featuring it too prominently but picks out an handful of minor characters and just a couple of sequences to get the message across. This works out really well and it doesn't feel melodramatic or anything like that. Modern movies can really learn something from this.But of course foremost the movie gets set in the trenches somewhere in France. The movie is filled with some WW I battle sequences which are all surprising good and authentic looking. Guess lots of materials and places from WW I were still around during the production of this movie so they did not have an hard time recreating the look and feeling of the battles fought out in the trenches.It was the first sound movie from Georg Wilhelm Pabst and this shows. Nothing too major it are just some little things showing you that 'talkies' hadn't been around yet for very long and Georg Wilhelm Pabst wasn't also too experienced with it yet. He pretty much shot this movie in the same way as he would had filmed a silent movie.The movie is of course also original with the fact that it tells the story from the German point of view. While watching this movie you don't actually ever give you the feeling you're watching the movie from the 'evil' and bad point of view. All parties are more or less victims within a war and things are not as black  white as they always seem. Simply a real good and effective WW I production especially when considering that it got shot way back in 1930.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

For the English speaking audience it does suffer in that it has not been cared for and restored in the same way as All Quiet. The version I saw had some rather jarring at least to my English ears subtitles which showed that the UK and the USA are indeed two countries divided by a common language. I'm not sure what German words translate as What in tarnation. Having said that the film was powerful innovative and quite startling in its use of sound which we should bear in mind had only been in use for 3 years or so.

	onyx:emotionText "Although this covers the same broad subject matter as All Quiet there is a different and welcome perspective and the film making is very definitely more European in style harder edged and more matter of fact which I have to say I prefer. For the English speaking audience it does suffer in that it has not been cared for and restored in the same way as All Quiet. The version I saw had some rather jarring at least to my English ears subtitles which showed that the UK and the USA are indeed two countries divided by a common language. I'm not sure what German words translate as What in tarnation. Having said that the film was powerful innovative and quite startling in its use of sound which we should bear in mind had only been in use for 3 years or so.

	schema:reviewBody "The film Westfront 1918 is based on the novel Vier von der Infanterie Four of the infantry by the German Ernst Johannsen. Although I have some knowledge of the German literature and read Im Westen nichts Neues RemarqueKramer and Jahrgang 1902 Glaeser this one was new for me. The First World War has actually been a popular theme for film makers. For some reason mainly the Englishspoken films have managed to become part of film history which is a pity because we are naturally interested in the perspective of the most directly involved countrymen. Westfront 1918 fills in this gap. However it would be unfair to praise Westfront 1918 only because of its origin for it is in fact in all respects an excellent outline of the horrors of modern warfare. WWI has a special place in military history. In the second half of the nineteenth century the wars were often short encounters between professional armies which hardly affected the population. However by the end of the century the rise of imperialism had caused an arms race something like the Cold War which stupefied the common people. The technological progress began to allow for mass slaughter. Of course the artillery had become highly effective but there were also the airplanes the poisonous gas the first armored cars and tanks flamethrowers machine guns etc. Surgery advanced dramatically. The mass destruction reached proportions that surpassed the contemporary human imagination. Man lost what had remained of his innocence. It was this war that ended the remaining absolute monarchies and even caused the birth of an entirely new society system in Russia. It created the first insane forms of art Dada and strongly furthered the foundation of pacifism and the League of Nations. The film Westfront 1918 fits into this aftermath. Except for the war there is not really a story line. We follow four soldiers doing their duty on the western front in France Karl the main character the student the Bavarian and the lieutenant. It starts idyllic when they are quartered with a French family. They pass the time making music and the student becomes involved in a love affair with the daughter. They visit a military theater where two clowns playing the violin and the guitar annoy each other. But halfway the platoon is ordered to the trenches and now the film gets grim. We see the life between barbed wire the underground sleeping places which sometimes collapse due to the continuous shelling. In battle the student is engaged in a wrestle with a French soldier who drowns him in the pool in a bomb crater. Karl is granted leave and on coming home catches his wife in bed with another man. Classic but all too real. In tears she cries Why don't you stop this war! Back to the front Karl and the Bavarian get the special assignment actually Karl volunteers to man a forward machine gun hole during a mayor French offensive against their trenches. Here the film shows for several minutes the waves of French infantry and tanks attacking and storming the trenches and being gunned down like rats. The air is filled with smoke and exploding grenades. The Bavarian is fatally wounded. The lieutenant is driven into a state of shock and insanity continuously crying Zur Befehl Majestaet! and Hurrah! the then popular yell during a military storm. Karl is also wounded and brought to a military field hospital. The misery is beyond belief. A soldier crying Ich habe keine Beine! no legs. The hospital orderly Du hast doch noch Arme! Denk an dein Maedel! Think of your girlfriend!. The film ends while zooming in on the horrified gaze of Karl. I have seen All quiet on the Western front remake called Hallmark Hall of fame A farewell to arms both reviewed and Doctor Zhivago to follow and Westfront 1918 classifies high in this top category.".

I'm a regular Joe a combat veteran as well who may have a different take on this film from the other reviewers I have read here probably a lot cruder as well than the other posts. I watched this on TCM USA and was glad I did. Westfront 1918 is clearly a pioneering war film and would have received a 10 from me except that films of it's contemporary are so superior All Quiet On The Western Front which in my opinion is in the top 100 films of all time. I enjoyed it more from the technical aspects than so much the war film aspect. I couldn't help comparing it to AQOTWF which is probably a disservice to Westfront but I have seen the former so many times that I couldn't help it. On the plus side it was great to watch a pre Nazi war film from Germany it's amazing the changes that occurred to that nation in a short 5 years isn't it? The use of tanks at the end surprised me as I was thinking to myself that up to that point there had been no tanks as in all of AQOTWF and I was thinking that was shortcoming of both films but to it's credit it does have some tanks in it though no aircraft or observation balloons. I also liked the story overall with the homefront and all the drama involved although I don't think many in real life would have been as cold as Karl had been for so long to take that bitterness with him back to the front. The show that was put on for the troops was actually entertaining to watch even though it seemed excessively long. This film also would have been edited heavily by the censors for profanity and adult situations which for any movie made in 1930 I give credit to. So take those positive comments of mine and enjoy the film or if you want my whole opinion read on. Westfront to me seemed very crude done on way too big a scale to be effective as a truly great film. I'll start with the captions on the version I saw. The captions were incomplete this movie had a lot of singing in it both by the soldiers and in a long show put on for them. There are no captions for these moments so you have about 1015 minutes of scenes that are not captioned that seemed like a drawback to me. I started to get more into the technical aspects of the film because the battle scenes seemed totally disjointed and unrealistic. There are dozens and dozens of grenades tossed around in this film that alone is to me unrealistic as those weigh a good bit and soldiers can only carry a few with them but than when they are thrown they don't explode. The scenes also drone on forever this film needed a better editor. Will I watch this film again a mark of a film I truly enjoyed probably not. After being pampered to the excellently made All Quiet On The Western Front as I have you may reach the same opinion of Westfront 1918 but I am happy I watched this little shown early pioneering war film. Recommended 7 of 10.".

	schema:headline " Pabst's great antiwar film banned by the Nazis";
	schema:reviewBody "The 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme yesterday seemed to be an appropriate time to view WESTFRONT 1918. This German film of the trench warfare of 1918 is possibly the most realistic depiction we have of the First World War. The film is justly famous to those who are interested in cinema history and in the work of one of Germany's most talented directors G. W. Pabst. The action is set in the trenches of Eastern France and the film commences in Besancon where the German soldiers are billeted. The story is based upon a novel by the German author Ernst Johannsen 18981977 entitled VIER VON DER INFANTRIE IHRE LETZTEN TAGE AN DER WESTFRONT 1918 FOUR INFANTRYMEN AND THEIR LAST DAYS ON THE WESTERN FRONT 1918 published in 1929. The book was also published in French in 1929 as QUATRE DE L'INFANTERIEFRONT OUEST 1918 published in England in 1930 as FOUR INFANTRYMEN ON THE WESTERN FRONT and also in America in 1930 as THE FOUR INFANTRYMEN. IMDb is in error in its references to Ernst Johannsen. however. It claims that this novel was also the basis for a 'TV short' of 1938 entitled BRIGADEEXCHANGE. In fact the 1938 production was not a filmed production but a radio play which was broadcast by the BBC and was based upon a radio play by Johannsen entitled BRIGADEVERMITTLUNG BRIGADEEXCHANGE. BBC Television did not even exist in 1938! IMDb please note this correction. Johannsen himself fought in the First World War and took part in the Battle of Verdun. His writings on the subject are wholly authentic. It is important to remember that this film was made only 12 years after the end of the War and the sets and atmosphere portrayed were based upon personal knowledge and memory. The story is ostensibly about four individual soldiers but the film spreads the attention to a larger cast as well. We see the return home to Germany on leave of one of the soldiers named Karl. He arrives at his flat full of joy at the prospect of seeing his beloved wife again. He has been away for more than a year and a half. He enters quietly lays down his rifle takes off his gear and hears his wife giggling in the bedroom. He enters and finds her in bed with another man. He goes and gets his rifle and considers shooting them but changes his mind. The wife cowers and cringes and can only say 'I couldn't help it' so that her 'apology' amounts only to whingeing self pity because he had deserted her to go to war. Karl is glad to leave and get back to the sanity of the trenches. Another of the four soldiers 'the kid' or 'the student' has an affair with a French girl in Besancon and they decide they want to marry. However bombardments force her evacuation and she never even learns that he has been killed. The continual bombardments have become so commonplace to the soldiers that when they go to sleep they say to the one on watch 'Wake me up when you get the signal to attack.' The explosions crashing down over their heads without cease are no longer even noticed and do not interfere with their exhausted sleep. The only thing missing from the film is the plague of rats. Otherwise we see them encrusted with mud which they have long since ceased to try to remove and how they are continually rushing from shelter to shelter to avoid the locations where the artillery shells are falling thickest. At one point their own artillery is decimating them in a friendly fire fiasco. The phone lines have collapsed and the messenger dog sent with a message tied round his neck to Divisional Headquarters a miserable halfburied shack fails to get through and is killed by a shell. But a man does and the artillery extends its range and stops killing the German soldiers by mistake. The latter part of the film is based upon the chapter of the novel called 'Inferno' and it shows the most incredibly detailed prolonged staging of a battle situation where the French troops storm the German trenches assisted by the quaint little battle tanks of that era with men hiding behind them in their advance for cover. The carnage is immense and nearly everyone on both sides gets killed. This part of the film lasts about 15 or 20 minutes. It is possible that this is the most authentic portrayal in a feature film of First World War trench warfare and its indescribable incessant horrors. Cinastes and war historians will wish to compare these scenes with Lewis Milestone's film ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT based upon Erich Maria Remarque's novel IM WESTEN NICHTS NEUES which was also made in 1930. The most famous German war novels were IN STAHLGEWITTERN 1920 English title STORM OF STEEL and a sequel dealing with the trench warfare of 1918 DAS WAELDCHEN 125 1925 English title COPSE 125 both written by a German military hero of the First World War Ernst Juenger. However these have never been filmed. WESTFRONT 1918 has the end credit 'ENDE ?!' which means 'THE END?!' Since the film was released only three years before Hitler came to power its prophecy of more war ahead was obvious to everyone. It is no surprise that the film was banned and heavily criticised by the Nazis. The last thing they wanted was antiwar propaganda as they prepared their future wars. But Pabst's message had already been delivered war was a monstrous nightmare in which everyone loses everyone starves everyone dies. But the problem is that not enough of the German public were listening to such warnings and those that were soon would find themselves rounded up and executed or sent to camps. The jackboot was well and truly on the front foot and the world would pay.".

The story is ostensibly about four individual soldiers but the film spreads the attention to a larger cast as well. We see the return home to Germany on leave of one of the soldiers named Karl. He arrives at his flat full of joy at the prospect of seeing his beloved wife again. He has been away for more than a year and a half. He enters quietly lays down his rifle takes off his gear and hears his wife giggling in the bedroom. He enters and finds her in bed with another man. He goes and gets his rifle and considers shooting them but changes his mind. The wife cowers and cringes and can only say 'I couldn't help it' so that her 'apology' amounts only to whingeing self pity because he had deserted her to go to war. Karl is glad to leave and get back to the sanity of the trenches. Another of the four soldiers 'the kid' or 'the student' has an affair with a French girl in Besancon and they decide they want to marry. However bombardments force her evacuation and she never even learns that he has been killed. The continual bombardments have become so commonplace to the soldiers that when they go to sleep they say to the one on watch 'Wake me up when you get the signal to attack.' The explosions crashing down over their heads without cease are no longer even noticed and do not interfere with their exhausted sleep. The only thing missing from the film is the plague of rats. Otherwise we see them encrusted with mud which they have long since ceased to try to remove and how they are continually rushing from shelter to shelter to avoid the locations where the artillery shells are falling thickest. At one point their own artillery is decimating them in a friendly fire fiasco. The phone lines have collapsed and the messenger dog sent with a message tied round his neck to Divisional Headquarters a miserable halfburied shack fails to get through and is killed by a shell. But a man does and the artillery extends its range and stops killing the German soldiers by mistake. The latter part of the film is based upon the chapter of the novel called 'Inferno' and it shows the most incredibly detailed prolonged staging of a battle situation where the French troops storm the German trenches assisted by the quaint little battle tanks of that era with men hiding behind them in their advance for cover. The carnage is immense and nearly everyone on both sides gets killed. This part of the film lasts about 15 or 20 minutes. It is possible that this is the most authentic portrayal in a feature film of First World War trench warfare and its indescribable incessant horrors. Cinastes and war historians will wish to compare these scenes with Lewis Milestone's film ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT based upon Erich Maria Remarque's novel IM WESTEN NICHTS NEUES which was also made in 1930. The most famous German war novels were IN STAHLGEWITTERN 1920 English title STORM OF STEEL and a sequel dealing with the trench warfare of 1918 DAS WAELDCHEN 125 1925 English title COPSE 125 both written by a German military hero of the First World War Ernst Juenger. However these have never been filmed. WESTFRONT 1918 has the end credit 'ENDE ?!' which means 'THE END?!' Since the film was released only three years before Hitler came to power its prophecy of more war ahead was obvious to everyone. It is no surprise that the film was banned and heavily criticised by the Nazis. The last thing they wanted was antiwar propaganda as they prepared their future wars. But Pabst's message had already been delivered war was a monstrous nightmare in which everyone loses everyone starves everyone dies. But the problem is that not enough of the German public were listening to such warnings and those that were soon would find themselves rounded up and executed or sent to camps. The jackboot was well and truly on the front foot and the world would pay.";

	schema:reviewBody "I generally liked Westfront 1918 but I have slightly mixed feelings towards it. Especially the combat scenes were incredible and it's a major part of the movie so it shouldn't be undervalued. Close to the beginning there's a scene with a trench collapsing while there are still soldiers within. This more or less has engraved in my mind. Also generally the approach is really physical. Unlike many other WW I films it renders the battlefield very vast and barren. The climactic long battle which leads directly to the dreadful end at the camp is overall an incredible sequence. Which in my opinion grasps something that other WW I films do not. A lot of it is really connected to the social realism that was so integral to Pabst style. He has a fascinating and compelling take on it as the movie is general yet not impersonal apathetic or exploitative. It makes you see a much broader picture than most other war films. The delivery from the battlefield to the camp at the end plays out almost like a metaphor for institutionalized death like being controlled by a machine. The squeezing of the soldiers under the collapsing trench also connects wonderfully to this imagery empathizing the desperate position of the soldiers. The spare time spent at home and social establishment seems like an escape from this but it ultimately only draws the soldiers back in.The problem is though that while I greatly admire Pabst sensibilities and unique touches the film feels sort of fragmented and not that dynamic. I really didn't want to see that time spent of the front as I had the feeling I had seen it all before and I knew exactly where it was going and it's not particularly dramatized. It's quite dry in short. I don't really see this as a weakness in general as keeping it realistic and relatable was essentially the goal of social realism but it didn't work for me. I thought that the film felt kind of dated in that respect as I would argue that the film was immensely important when it was released but today a lot of the personal context which people back then brought with them in form of their own experiences is lost.".

The director is Georg Wilhelm Pabst again one of the most successful filmmakers of his generation. I don't know any of the cast but writer Ladislaus Cajda who adapted the novel here for the film worked with Pabst on several occasions and has his name attached also to a couple big films from that era. Westfront 1918 runs for slightly under 90 minutes at least in the version i saw. i see other runtimes here on IMDb and these may either include lost segments or just fewer frames per second.The movie is about a group of German soldiers during the days of World War I. War is depicted here as something gruesome something that needs to be avoided at all costs because of the pain and casualties it brings. You can imagines that Hitler and his gang did not like this approach at all as they identified with war as something heroic something inevitable in order to bring Germany to glory. From that perspective it is certainly an interesting watch even if Pabst obviously couldn't know yet what would happen in the next 15 years. Being banned by the NSDAP is quality an attribute that makes a film worth seeing but sadly it is just the approach that is right and interesting. I cannot say I cared for the story here or for any of the characters in particular. Overall just not a good watch. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "With his flamboyant sense of film style overthetop action sequences outrageous visual sight gags and genrebending sensibilities it is easy to see why Miike Takashi's films are so enjoyed by audiences particularly those outside of Japan. Like his contemporaries Quentin Tarantino Edgar Wright Guillermo del Toro and Robert Rodriguez Miike has really done a lot to invigorate the Japanese cinema and help make it more accessible by world audiences.Ryu Ga Gotoku Like A Dragon is a film that is pure Miike and covers many of his signature themes Yakuza innocence lost bloodlust cartoon violence and death.While it's generally a bad sign when a film is based upon a video game in this instance Sega's Playstation 2 game Ryu Ga Gotoku AKA Yakuza. However the translation here is not all that far off the mark. Of course it helps when the screenplay was adapted from a story written by acclaimed novelist Hase Seishu Sleepless Town City of Lost Souls.The story revolves around former Yakuza underling Kiryu Kazuma Kitamura Kazuki who has recently been released from prison after a lengthy incarceration and is trying to piece his life together and distance himself from his Yakuza past. Along the way he encounters Haruka Natsuo a distressed young girl who is trying to find her lost mother a former club hostess. Unfortunately Kiryu's problems slowly escalate as he is pursued by a former associate the baseball batwielding psycho Majima Goro Kishitani Goro who has a grudge to settle with Kiryu.Kiryu's encounter with Goro's men in a Osaka convenience store inspire a couple of freespirited teens Satoru Shioya Shun and YuiSaekointo robbing area stores and using the money to pay off Yui's debts and to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.If things weren't confusing enough a robbery is also taking place nearby where two gunmen are holding an entire bank hostage and have been tormenting the bank employees with their constant bickering.Other incidental characters include a nebbish gunrunner Arakawa YosiYosi a mysterious Korean assassin Gong Yoo and Nishikiyama an Osaka Kingpin who has entered into a sinister alliance with North Korean militants and is holding over 10 Billion Yen in his fortress penthouse.The amount of male machismo and bare fisted brawling in the film is reminiscent of the BeBop High School movies and are every bit as cartoonish in their overthetop violence. While the violence does not approach the sheer visceral horror of his past films like Koroshiya No Ichi AKA Ichi the Killer or Gozu there are moments where one just cringes at the body blows.Kitamura Controller X in Godzilla Final Wars is an incredibly charismatic actor who definitely has the look and brawn to play the Dragon of Dojima Kiryu. He is your atypical hero type  silent and brooding with a takumashi manly strength that seems to be a prerequisite of Yakuza heroes.Kishitani Returner Shin Jingi No Hakaba steals the show however as the manic Majima a criminal with a unique flair for destructive mayhem and yet also has a strangely sinister charm about him. Unlike Kiryu he has no honor and is not opposed to killing his own subordinates if the mood suits him. He is not much unlike Kakihara Asano Tadanobu in Miike's comic book Yakuza cult movie Koroshiya No Ichi but is thankfully not as vile a villain. If anything he reminded me a lot of Tommy Lee Jones' Harvey TwoFace character in the disappointing Batman  Robin movie  comical in his outright villainy.Shioya Shun Hurricanger Red in the Hurricanger Tokusatsu series and Saeko Backdancers! NANA are a bit wasted in their roles as Satoru and Yui and their characters aren't really given much room to develop beyond their Bonnie and Clyde type roles.As mentioned the various fights border on the unrealistic side possibly in keeping with the original video game. Both Kiryu and Majima often display varying degrees of almost superhuman endurance stamina and strength in their battles. During the final fight between Kiryu and final boss Nishikiyama the two start generating auras heat mode in the game when they fight giving off the impression that they aren't quite human. It almost takes on the cinema of the absurd when Kiryu goes into Popeye mode after drinking a special vitamin elixir that supercharges his abilities to finish of Nishikiyama.Ryu Ga Gotoku is still an enjoyable Yakuza action film with elements of fantasy and crime drama. While I would have preferred if Miike had just focused on Kiryu's story and thrown out the subplots involving the bank robbery the Korean Assassin and Satoru and Yui's story I guess the intention was to create a type of Pulp Fiction type ensemble piece. Unfortunately while it worked well in that movie it does not work well here at all and just causes a lot of unnecessary confusion. Sometimes simplicity is really better.".

	onyx:emotionText "With his flamboyant sense of film style overthetop action sequences outrageous visual sight gags and genrebending sensibilities it is easy to see why Miike Takashi's films are so enjoyed by audiences particularly those outside of Japan. Like his contemporaries Quentin Tarantino Edgar Wright Guillermo del Toro and Robert Rodriguez Miike has really done a lot to invigorate the Japanese cinema and help make it more accessible by world audiences.Ryu Ga Gotoku Like A Dragon is a film that is pure Miike and covers many of his signature themes Yakuza innocence lost bloodlust cartoon violence and death.While it's generally a bad sign when a film is based upon a video game in this instance Sega's Playstation 2 game Ryu Ga Gotoku AKA Yakuza. However the translation here is not all that far off the mark.

Unless you have played the game these characters seem like excess pieces. No character development no idea who they are or whats their purpose. It makes things rather confusing. The plot also seems to have no meaning especially the ending.To those that are familiar with the game the movie will seem to be lacking in depth characters and story. But I guess condensing at 15hour game into 2hours isn't easy. The thing is the movie is good enough to be a stand alone movie and I thing Miike may have erred in trying to make too much like the 1st Yakuza game.Good movie it kept my attention throughout. However it does feel shallow disjointed and disappointing the ending.".

	schema:headline " MacArthur is much more interesting than your usual military hero and Gregory Peck played the part perfectly.";
	schema:reviewBody "Unlike Patton Pershing Grant or Eisenhower MacArthur is a many sided character and Peck played the part as I believe MacArthur  really was. The positive PR version produced by the U.S. Army in the l940's or the negative liberal press version of the l950's are very limited in their understanding of this great man.    I have always believed that MacArthur was a turn of the century progressive much like Teddy Roosevelt at the same time both imperial  and caring who lived past his time into the l960's.  His tactical decisions were unmatched by any general in our history.  His speeches rival those of  William Jennings Bryan or Patrick Henry and I'm sure many wish we could send him  and his administrative skills to Iraq to put that mess back together.  In the years since his death  a small cult has grown up around his memory much like Robert E.Lee and to some his words are almost mystical. He was a major player in one way or another in WWI the depression WWII Korea and if you count his deathbed plea to President Johnson to get our troops out of Vietnam even the Vietnam War.  If you want to stretch things even farther he can be tied to turn of the century imperialism and the SpanishAmerican War through his part in the Philippine Insurrection following the SpanishAmerican War and if you must the Indian Wars which he experienced  as a small boy with his parents.    He has been described as a conservative a liberal a militant and a pacifist.  How could one man be so much a part of the 19th century and believe in war only between individualslike Custer and Crazy Horse or  as in feudal times yet advocate Abombing China?  He is always described as arrogant and overly dramatic but like Grant he wore a simple 2nd Lieutenant's uniform with five stars on the shoulder minus all the medals that the G.I. generals wore.   I believe his love for the people of Asia was sincere and in this was he was like Alexander or Caesar.  We are fortunate Gregory Peck did play MacArthur as such a complex individual.  To focus only on the FiveStar General with the corncob pipe is to miss the the big picture.  No wonder Patton is so easy to watch compared to MacArthur.  I have seen the movie at least 15 times and am still moved by it.".

	schema:headline " Solid biopic elevated by Gregory Peck's great performance";
	schema:reviewBody "It is inevitable that MACARTHUR will be compared to PATTON the other military biopic produced by the late Frank McCarthy.  Such comparisons are unfortunate because their subjects are vastly different albeit controversial figures and each film takes a different approach in examining their impact on history.George S. Patton commanded an Army formation in Europe while Douglas Macarthur commanded an entire theater of operation in the Pacific.  By his own admission Patton never had any political ambitions while MacArthur definitely had such aspirations.  Patton's political naivety made him illsuited as the postwar occupation commander in Bavaria while MacArthur's political astuteness served him well during the occupation of Japan.Yet both men were great if iconoclastic military leaders.  Patton's brilliant northern pivot during the Battle of the Bulge is matched by the MacArthur's daring amphibious landing at Inchon.  And both men believed strongly in their destiny Patton's belief was based on reincarnation while MacArthur was motivated by following in his illustrious father's footsteps.Surprisingly PATTON is the much more succinct less ambitious film than MACARTHUR.  It concentrates on its colorful mercurial main character during a comparatively brief twoyear period between the American defeat at Kasserine Pass in early 1943 to Patton's dismissal prior to his death in late 1945.  Although we see Patton's conflict with Omar Bradley Bernard Montgomery and Bedell Smith we never see his interaction with General Dwight Eisenhower Prime Minister Winston Churchill or General George Marshall the U.S. Army's chief of staff.MACARTHUR is a much more ambitious film covering nearly a decade from the fall of Bataan in early 1942 to MacArthur's dismissal in 1951. Additionally MACARTHUR shows a wider range of conflict between MacArthur and such individuals as Admiral Nimitz General Marshall ambassador William Averell Harriman and Presidents Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.So does MACARTHUR match PATTON as a groundbreaking biopic?  No it doesn't.MACARTHUR lacks the insightful acerbic screenplay that Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund North supplied PATTON.  The direction by TV veteran Joseph Sargent is yeomanlike where the late Franklin J. Schaffner offers a more vigorous hellforleather approach to PATTON.  Both films are handsomely mounted productions that serve as a tribute to acumen of the producer McCarthy.  Both movies benefit from film scores by the everreliable Jerry Goldsmith.While PATTON has its main character departing in a Valhallalike denouement MACARTHUR is bookended by the legendary speech that the old soldier delivered to the cadet corps at West Point in 1962 as a final valedictory.At the heart of both films are the extraordinary performances of their lead actors.  The late George C. Scott's portrayal of Patton is justly remembered but Gregory Peck delivers a performance that is both subtle and unapologetic and helps to elevate this oftenpedestrian production to a higher level.  Peck's portrayal is reminiscent of his work in TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH but with the added weight of an additional thirty years of experience and craftsmanship that this great actor brings to bear to this role.  Peck is ably supported by Dan O'Herlihy as FDR and the late Ed Flanders as Harry S. Truman.Finally I must note the presence of Dr. D. Clayton James the author of the standard multivolume biography of MacArthur who served as this film's technical advisor.".

	schema:reviewBody "There isn't much argument that MacArthur was a good strategist and a brave man. And that's the picture you get of him in this movie. Besides a bit of vanity only the slightest the general seems to have no flaws. The dark side of this genius is missing. Of course no movie not even at 130 minutes can capture all of a man's professional history but the lacunae here are convenient ones. The upshot is that this is like one of those John Singer Sargent portraits of society women that made them look sexier and prettier than they probably were.For instance MacArthur remarks somewhere along the line that his casualties are fewer than anyone else's or something like that when in fact those figures have been contested. MacArthur's aching desire to invade China is turned into a kind of a joke when he complains that he is only allowed to bomb the southern entrances to bridges across the Yalu River  In all my career I've never learned how to bomb HALF A BRIDGE. Very amusing. But then his political views as a whole which were somewhere to the right of Attila the Hun's are skipped over. His run for president fizzled because not even the most rabid anticommunist power broker wanted a war with China but this too is turned into a morbid joke when MacArthur remarks to his wife about the newly elected Eisenhower  He'll make a great president. He was the best clerk I ever had. Eisenhower's joke appears elsewhere  I spent seven years under MacArthur studying dramatics. The most illustrative revelation of MacArthur's character isn't in the film. MacArthur recruited Weldon E. Rhoades as the personal pilot of his B17 and the aviator became a loyal disciple and sometimes personal confidant. By Rhoades' own admission this meant that the general would talk for great lengths of time during which Rhoades was not expected to respond. One last point that is glossed over. MacArthur is stuck on the island of Corregidor in the Philippines surrounded by Japanese but prepared to fight it out. He is ordered to return to Australia on PT boats. He objects strenuously but in the end obeys his orders and retreats. It's a dangerous voyage on small wornout boats made of plywood. And for this he is awarded the medal of honor. The officers and men of that handful of boats made the same voyage  round trip too  and no medals of honor for them although they were acting under the same conditions following orders. An aside the bar is a little lower for highranking officers which is why their dress uniforms seem to droop with decorations like some Latin American dictators'.But it's not a bad movie as long as you're looking for a heroic picture of an undoubtedly heroic man. Gregory Peck exudes his usual sincerity and is a much more effective speaker than MacArthur himself who almost always sounded like a blowhard. And Peck had to do quite a good job to overcome that florid prose  Still I listen with thirsty ear for the tocsin call etc. Thirsty ear. In a speech at West Point McArthur also misattribues a quote from Santayana to Plato only the dead have seen the end of war but that's carping. The movie follows the same pattern as Patton. Give us an admirable hero one human enough to have a little fun poked at him. Peck emerges from a shower draped in a couple of huge bath towels arranged like a toga so that he resembles Caesar. Surround him with devoted but sometimes puzzled subordinates who when they are not courting his favor are warning him that something he plans to do might be misinterpreted by the suits back in Washington. Just don't have him do anything seriously wrong.Production values are good. This is an expensive picture. Supporting players more or less blend into one another  there's only room for one Caesar in this movie.Some things are left unexplained unintentionally it would seem since this is not the kind of movie that thrives on leaving anything up to the viewer. General Wainwright is left behind on Corregidor to surrender to the Japanese. Back in Australia MacArthur fumes at such cowardice Wainwright must be temporarily deranged. But when they meet again when Manila is liberated MacArthur greets him like a long lost pal. What happened? And the big meeting between MacArthur and Truman that was supposed to iron out the differences between them? It's confusingly staged and scripted. Both sides seem to come away satisfied but if that were the case the satisfaction must have been based on some profound misunderstandings because afterward MacArthur and Truman both went merrily on their divergent ways.I kind of enjoy watching it once in a while. The Irish Daniel O'Herlihy does a sidesplitting impression of Franklin D. Roosevelt. And the action scenes are fairly well done. I do wish that the movie had been more honest with its subject. As it is it's a flawed movie about a flawed but remarkable man.".

	schema:headline " Great well done story of the controversial American General  superbly played by Gregory Peck.";
	schema:reviewBody "No matter what you have to say about MacArthur critical or otherwise he shaped events in the Pacific theater of World War II to give him a part of history in the twentieth century. In this well done production with Gregory Peck in the leading role he gives a candid performance of the flamboyant and publicity seeking authoritative General who turned earlier defeat into ultimate victory. His great speech on arrival from the Phillipines by train at Spencer Street Station in Melbourne Australia in March 1942 incorporating those famous words   I came through and I shall return  was an inspiration to many Australians during their darkest hour.From the time of his arrival in our country he quickly abandoned the idea of defending any mainland invasion by the Japanese and decided on an offensive in New Guinea as a counter attack. Peck is perfect in the role of the self minded MacArthur doggedly pursuing the Japanese back to their homeland while arguing with his own superiors including U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt over his earlier promise to liberate the Phillipines which was planned to be bypassed. After the Japanese surrender MacArthur becomes virtual ruler of Japan modifying old customs and instituting sweeping land reforms. His authority remained absolute until the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 when he clashed with new U.S. President Harry Truman over his successful campaign against the North Koreans and his intention to take on their Communist Chinese backers. Truman wanting to avoid another world conflict relieves MacArthur of his command and he is recalled home. Peck is magnificent with his captivating speech before a band of West Point recruits where he details his life and closes the movie with that famous caption  Old soldiers never die  they just fade away. This movie is a must for the younger generation of this world to know that today's freedom was the result of the sacrifices made by their forbears.To add a final footnote my mother worked at Archerfield aerodrome in Brisbane in 1942 with her sister where they were employed as aircraft riveter's being responsible for the repair of the fuselage of damaged U.S. Aircraft used during the defense of our country during World War 2. She told me well before her death in March 2004 how she took her limited time off from work to travel to central Brisbane just to watch General MacArthur walk down Queen Street from his home base at Lennons Hotel to the AMP building in Edward Street where he had his headquarters.She said what a fine figure he cut tall and handsome and full of confidence in his goal of supreme victory. Her expectations in the faith of this great American General were ultimately justified. We are a free country today for the contribution of his great military expertise in the time of our greatest need.".

	schema:headline " General Atticus";
	schema:reviewBody "It is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film whereas Patton Lust for Glory' producer Frank McCarthy's earlier biography of a controversial American general from the Second World War has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments. Like a previous reviewer I am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other.One difference between the two films is that Patton' is more focused concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the Second World War whereas MacArthur' covers not only this war but also its subject's role in the Korean war as well as his period as American governor of occupied Japan during the interlude.The main difference however lies in the way the two leaders are played. Gregory Peck dominates this film even more than George C. Scott dominated Patton'. Whereas Scott had another major star Karl Malden playing opposite him as General Bradley none of the other actors in MacArthur' are household names at least for their film work. Scott of course portrayed Patton as aggressive and fierytempered a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race not just with the enemy. I suspect that in real life General MacArthur was as volcanic an individual as Patton but that is not how he appears in this film. Peck's MacArthur is of a more reflective thoughtful bent comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films. At times he even seems to be a man of the political left. Much of his speech on the occasion of the Japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paidup member of CND and his policies for reforming Japanese society during the American occupation have a semisocialist air to them. In an attempt to show something of MacArthur's gift for inspiring leadership Peck makes him a fine speaker but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart. It is as if Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird' had put on a general's uniform.Whereas Scott attempted a warts and all' portrait of Patton the criticism has been made that MacArthur' attempts to gloss over some of its subject's less attractive qualities. I think that this criticism is a fair one particularly as far as the Korean War is concerned. The film gives the impression that MacArthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp. Many historians of course feel that Truman was forced to sack MacArthur because the latter's conduct was becoming a risk to world peace and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because Stalin would not have allowed his Chinese allies to be humiliated. Even during the Korean scenes Peck's MacArthur comes across as more idealistic than his reallife original probably was we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters. Truman 's remark he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about Sunday' was said about Eisenhower but it could equally well have been applied to MacArthur's approach to international diplomacy. Perhaps the film's attempt to paint out some of MacArthur's warts reflects the period in which it was made. The late seventies after the twin traumas of Vietnam and Watergate was a difficult time for America and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation. Another criticism I would make of the film is that it falls between two stools. If it was intended to be a full biography of MacArthur something should have been shown of his early life which is not covered at all. The first we see of the general is when he is leading the American resistance to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. One theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of General MacArthur's father himself a military hero. I would have liked to see what sort of man Arthur MacArthur was and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model. Another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on Korea and on MacArthur's clash with Truman with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them. The way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches.It would be wrong however to give the impression that I disliked the film altogether. Although I may not have agreed with Peck's interpretation of the main role there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness. The film as a whole is a good example of a solid workmanlike biopic thoughtful and informative. It is a good film but one that could have been a better one. 710.On a pedantic note the map which MacArthur is shown using during the Korean War shows the DMZ the boundary between the two Korean states that did not come into existence until after the war. The prewar boundary was the 38th parallel. Also I think that MacArthur was referring to the tocsin' of war. War may be toxic but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since Douglas MacArthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other American not elected President he deserved a better film biography. Not that Universal's MacArthur is bad. It's just not all it should have been.Oddly enough the potential was there. From the very early Star Trek episode The Corbomite Maneuver 1966 to the recent HBO films Something the Lord Made 2OO4 and Warm Springs 2OO5 director Joseph Sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer Frank McCarthy also gave us Patton 197O the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films and Universal widely touted the fact that the film was four years in preparation and production. Yet for all of this MacArthur is perfectly adequateand not much more than that.The film begins in early 1942 shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby President Franklin D. Roosevelt Dan O'Herlihyto flee the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus this film omits  MacArthur's birth in 188O in a frontier barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by Native American tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bowsandarrows to thermonuclear weapons  his graduation from West Pointfirst in a class of 95  how he joined his famous father General Arthur MacArthur who had earned the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War on assignments in Japan China and most importantly in the Philippines  his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into Vera Cruz  how he leaped about the trenches of World War One like a mountain goat often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to Brigadier General  his postwar service as West Point's youngestand most progressivecommandant  his participation in the courtmartial of Billy Mitchell in 1924  his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932  his efforts to sustain a woefullyunderfunded Army as Chief of Staff in the early 193O's  his retirement from the U.S. Army to become Field Marshal ! of the Army of the Philippines  and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.All this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by PT boatthus we know that General Mac is a legend but not why nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to Dugout Dougand so patently unfounded.The remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly His islandhopping Hit 'em where they ain't campaign the fulfillment of his pledge to the Filipinos I shall return!his crowning achievement the winning of the peace in postwar Japan then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman a properly feisty Ed Flanders over the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing and finally his proclamation to Congress that old soldierssimply fade away after which he did just that. All quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary.Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval If MacArthur's actions appear noble let them be presented as such if they appear egotistical or bombastic let those conceptions register sans comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsagain see Warm Springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional. Historically that may be commendable but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective.And finally there is a sort of made on the cheap feel to the film as there is to Midway released about the same time. Both films were relegated to television directorsSargent in this case Jack Smight on Midway and both have a madeforTVlook. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march while perfectly serviceable lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his Patton themejust another way in which a largerthanlife man is memorialized by a very ordinary film.There was vanity and pettiness in this man inarguably there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done he won the peace.In the end MacArthurlike so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man but a poor place to end it.".

Thus this film omits  MacArthur's birth in 188O in a frontier barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by Native American tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bowsandarrows to thermonuclear weapons  his graduation from West Pointfirst in a class of 95  how he joined his famous father General Arthur MacArthur who had earned the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War on assignments in Japan China and most importantly in the Philippines  his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into Vera Cruz  how he leaped about the trenches of World War One like a mountain goat often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to Brigadier General  his postwar service as West Point's youngestand most progressivecommandant  his participation in the courtmartial of Billy Mitchell in 1924  his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932  his efforts to sustain a woefullyunderfunded Army as Chief of Staff in the early 193O's  his retirement from the U.S. Army to become Field Marshal ! of the Army of the Philippines  and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.All this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by PT boatthus we know that General Mac is a legend but not why nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to Dugout Dougand so patently unfounded.The remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly His islandhopping Hit 'em where they ain't campaign the fulfillment of his pledge to the Filipinos I shall return!his crowning achievement the winning of the peace in postwar Japan then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman a properly feisty Ed Flanders over the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing and finally his proclamation to Congress that old soldierssimply fade away after which he did just that. All quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary.Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval If MacArthur's actions appear noble let them be presented as such if they appear egotistical or bombastic let those conceptions register sans comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsagain see Warm Springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional. Historically that may be commendable but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective.And finally there is a sort of made on the cheap feel to the film as there is to Midway released about the same time. Both films were relegated to television directorsSargent in this case Jack Smight on Midway and both have a madeforTVlook. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march while perfectly serviceable lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his Patton themejust another way in which a largerthanlife man is memorialized by a very ordinary film.There was vanity and pettiness in this man inarguably there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done he won the peace.In the end MacArthurlike so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man but a poor place to end it.";

However I watched it trying to understand the reasons behind the wellknown stories of the man. He was known as an arrogant headline seeker. His battles with Adm Chester Nimitz over the Pacific strategy were mostly designed to enhance his share of the glory from the battles in that theater. At least that is what I have read over and over again. He even insisted that his own wife call him General which is portrayed in the film. But the film answered none of my questions about what made him tick. In fact it is so shallow that there are now more questions than there were before I watched it. The film's basic beginning is after WW2 has begun. His childhood and Army career prior to that point are completely ignored. The Pacific war is boiled down to only his return to the Philippines. Korea is covered in less than 30 minutes and that was his downfall albeit not militarily. The film answers no questions about who this man was. I was hoping to come out of the film with an appreciation of the General but I learned absolutely nothing about him. Indeed there is so little character deveolpment that President Truman is made to be the heavy in his relieving MacArthur of his duties in Korea. Too bad. This could have been a great film. Instead it's nothing more than a wasted opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank McCarthy who produced the Academy Award winning biographical film Patton follows it up with a strong tribute to another of America's fighting generals Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man his genius as well as his egotism. With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended.The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six hour film or a TV miniseries. It would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at West Point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. It would talk about his service in the Phillipines as a young officer his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France. It would also have to tell about him firing on the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932 probably putting the final kabosh on any chances President Herbert Hoover had of getting reelected. During MacArthur's last years he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. That must have been a subject they avoided.This film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech MacArthur's mind goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Phillipines the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by President Truman.MacArthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It's the part of the film I enjoyed the best seeing MacArthur and his relations with both these men.FDR by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness. Sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake but he was the master politician of the last century. Note how he deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time.Truman by Flanders is as people remember him a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked MacArthur's haughtiness from the gitgo. Of course it's in the history books how Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate no doubt about it.Yet I could write a whole thesis on the TrumanMacArthur relations. Along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis. I've always felt that FDR would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then.MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender at MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree.".

And American military enthusiasts are certain to have strong opinions on Douglas MacArthur already which will affect their views of the film.But all in all I think this is a remarkably balanced look at an extremely controversial person. For those who know little about MacArthur it's a good place to start. He was a largerthanlife figure and in this film you can see both why he was revered and why he was despised.Although MacArthur came of age in the 19th century and became a general in World War I this movie focuses on his high and lows in World War II and the Korean War. During that time he was an iconic figure. Iconic is an overused word but it applies to him. With his trademark hat and corncob pipe plus his curiously oldfashioned way of speaking and his instinct for controversy he was unmistakable and larger than life.During the late 1970s the postWatergate era traditional war pictures were no longer in vogue. MASH the mildly pacifist TV series set in the Korean War treated MacArthur as a rather silly figure. But this movie made in 1977 takes the man seriously while showing his flaws clearly. It also is more frank than most classic films about how little consensus there is in warmaking. Leaders quarrel and connive while making policy and the most loyal grunts are often dismayed at the decisions that put them in harm's way.Gregory Peck is excellent in capturing the complexity of Douglas MacArthur. Peck was an outspoken political liberal and one has to assume he was no admirer of the unabashedly rightwing MacArthur. But he takes on the man's persona admirably.After heaping so much praise on MacArthur I must admit it is not great cinema. It's more interesting than moving. But if you're under 50 and know Douglas MacArthur only as a name in the history books this will be an eyeopener.

	schema:reviewBody "General Douglas MacArthur Gregory Peck is giving a speech to the cadets at West Point in 1962. Then the movie flashes back to Corregidor in 1942 Phillipines. It follows him through the war into Korean and his forced retirement by President Truman.This is a very sincere old fashion Hollywood telling of a complex man. Gregory Peck plays him as a sensitive commanding and resolute man with daddy issues. Historians can quibble about its accuracy but it seems to be very Pecklike. The production skimps on the budget and this is no Patton. The action is lacking and there is a lot of old footage used. They don't even use the right Abomb footage. More troubling is the fact that the movie stops before he goes into politics. The Old soldiers never die speech and Eisenhower's nomination pretty much end the movie. That's the part where his name literally becomes an ism. This is strictly a beginner's guide to MacArthur probably good for a substitute teacher in high school history class to play.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gregory Peck's brilliant portrayal of Douglas MacArthur from the Battle of Corregidor in the Philippines at the start of the Pacific War largely through to his removal as UN Commander during the Korean War offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities. Certainly the most controversial American General of the Second World War and possibly ever MacArthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions. He claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace yet he obviously glories in war he consistently denies any political ambitions yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the President of the United States he shows great respect for other cultures particularly in the Philippines and Japan and yet is completely out of touch with his own country. All these things are held in balance throughout this movie and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man although one is left with no doubt that MacArthur sincerely and passionately loved his country and especially the Army he devoted his life to.Peck's performance was as I said brilliant  to the point actually of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film which is perhaps appropriate given who he was portraying! with the possible exception of Ed Flanders. I though he offered a compelling look at Harry Truman and his attitude to MacArthur sarcastic repeatedly referring to MacArthur as His Majesty angry frustrated and finally completely fed up with this General who simply won't respect his authority as President. Marj Dusay was also intriguing as MacArthur's wife Jean devoted to her husband whom she herself referred to as General although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one. I very much enjoyed this movie although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about MacArthur's early life. I have always chuckled at MacArthur's reaction to Eisenhower being elected President He'll make a fine President  he was the best damn clerk I ever had  which seems to sum up what MacArthur thought the role of the President should be especially to his military commanders during wartime. Well worth watching. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "When George C. Scott played the title role in Patton you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike. The most action we get from Gregory Peck as MacArthur a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his.Comparing Peck's performance with Scott's may be unfair. Yet the fact MacArthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at West Point. It's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that Oscarwinning film of a few years before. But while Peck looks the part more than Scott ever did he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a Wikipedia walkthrough of MacArthur's later career.To this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived an opening title crawl tells us. It's a typical dishwater bit of postVietnam sophistry about those who led America's military very much of its time but what we get here is neither view. MacArthur as presented here doesn't anger or inspire the way he did in life.Director Joseph Sargent who went on to helm the famous turkey Jaws The Revenge does a paintbynumbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the Chinese attack U.S. forces in Korea while the script by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins trots out a MacArthur who comes across as goodnatured to the point of blandness a bit too caught up in his public image but never less than decent.Here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the Phillipines. There you see him addressing Congress in his Old Soldiers Never Die speech. For a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in Toyko waiting for the North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details Japan's rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule. Peck's coactors Marj Dusay as his devoted wife you're my finest soldier and Nicolas Coaster as a loyal aide burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion's magnificence but garner no interest on their own.Even when he argues with others Peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence. When Admiral Nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the Philippines a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for MacArthur MacArthur comes back with the comment Just now as I listened to his plan I thought I saw our flag going down. Doubtless the real Nimitz would have had something to say about that but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of President Roosevelt.The only person in the movie who MacArthur seriously disagrees with is Harry S Truman who Ed Flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble Toucan Sam. Truman's firing of MacArthur should be a dramatic high point but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation in which Peck plays MacArthur as nothing less than a genial martyr.I've never been sold by Peck's standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his bestknown roles. But it's unfair to dock him so much here as he gets little help defining MacArthur as anything other than a speechifying bore. Except for two scenes one where he rails against the surrender of the Philippines He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet! and another where he has a minibreakdown while awaiting the U.S. invasion of Inchon inveighing against Communists undermining him at the White House Peck really plays Peck here not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet American Caesar. The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown.".

We see a frail 82 year old Gen.MacArthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor it is to serve their country. The film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on Gen. MacArthur's brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of WWII on the besieged island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942.Told to leave he island for Australia before the Japanese military invade it Gen. MacArthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior US President Franklin D. Roosevelt Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he'll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need MacArthur reluctantly together with his wife and young son did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war. It was that reason his escape under fire from death or captivity by the Japanese that drove Gen. MacArthur to use all his influence to get FDR two years later to launch a major invasion of the Philippians instead of the island of Formosa to back up his promise to both the Philippine people as well as the thousands of US POWS left behind. That he'll return and return with the might of the US Army  Navy to back up his pledge!In the two years up until the invasion of the Philippine Islands Gen. MacArther battered the Japanese forces in the South Pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops into surrender. The General did that suffering far less US Military losses then any other allied commander in the War in the Pacific! It was in 195051 in the Korean War that Gen. MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. After outflanking the advancing North Korean Army in the brilliant and perfectly executed with the invading US Marines suffering less then 100 casualties back door or left hook invasion of Inchon Gen. MacArther feeling invincible sent the USUN forces under his command to the very border along the Yalu River of Communist Red China. Told by his subordinates that he's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by Communist Chinese troops Gen. MacArthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the US  UN forces to ribbons. The unstoppable wave after wave of attacking Red Chinese troops forced the USUN forces to retreat in the Big Bug Out of 1950 with their very lives leaving all their equipment behind across the North Korean border even abandoning the South Korean capital city of Seoul! This turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in US history with the US forces losing a record in the Korean War 1000 lives on the very first dayNov. 2930 1950of the Communist Chinese invasion!Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed due mostly to his own arrogance to happened MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advancing Communist Chinese and Noth Koreans forces but his own Commander and Chief Pres. Harry S. Truman Ed Flanders in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done Launch a full scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman who had taken just about enough garbage from Gen. MacArthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out like MacArthur wanted him to against the Red Chinese this was the last straw! On April 11 1951 Pres. Truman unceremoniously relived Gen. MacArthur from his command as Supreme Commander of the USUN forces in Korea! Pres. Truman's brave but very unpopular decision also by not going along with MacArthur's total war strategy prevented a Third World War from breaking out with the Soviet UnionCommunist China's ally who at the timelike the UShad the Atomic Bomb! Pres. Truman''s controversial decision to dump the very popular Gen. MacArthur also cost him his reelection in 1952 with his polls numbers so lowin the mid 20's that he withdrewin March of that year from the US Presidential Campaign!In was Gen. MacArthur's misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war now in 195051 a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out like Gen. MacArthur wanted to against the Red Chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the US USSR  Red China but the entire world! It was that important reality of future war that Gen. MacArthur was never taught since the A and H Bomb weren't yet invented in West Point.Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur after finishing his commencement speech at West Point had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as  since his retirement from the US Military elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it. One thing that Gen. MacArthur was taught at an early age from his Civil War General dad Douglas MacArthur Sr that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very lastnot firstresort in settling issues between nations. In that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. It took a lifetime with the advent of the nuclear age for Gen. MacArthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a Congressional Medal of Honor winner like himself really was!".

Truman's brave but very unpopular decision also by not going along with MacArthur's total war strategy prevented a Third World War from breaking out with the Soviet UnionCommunist China's ally who at the timelike the UShad the Atomic Bomb! Pres. Truman''s controversial decision to dump the very popular Gen. MacArthur also cost him his reelection in 1952 with his polls numbers so lowin the mid 20's that he withdrewin March of that year from the US Presidential Campaign!In was Gen. MacArthur's misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war now in 195051 a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out like Gen. MacArthur wanted to against the Red Chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the US USSR  Red China but the entire world! It was that important reality of future war that Gen. MacArthur was never taught since the A and H Bomb weren't yet invented in West Point.Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur after finishing his commencement speech at West Point had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as  since his retirement from the US Military elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it. One thing that Gen. MacArthur was taught at an early age from his Civil War General dad Douglas MacArthur Sr that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very lastnot firstresort in settling issues between nations. In that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. It took a lifetime with the advent of the nuclear age for Gen. MacArthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a Congressional Medal of Honor winner like himself really was!";

Schaffner's epic story of Old Blood  Guts in PATTON 20th CenturyFox 1970 one could easily come to the conclusion that MAC ARTHUR Universal 1977 was imitating a Hollywood trend. That was our mistaken notion up until very recently. We finally screened the movie and discovered our folly.ADMITTEDLY THERE WERE a few carryovers from the George C. Scott tourdeforce most notably Producer Frank McCarthy and the original score by Composer Jerry Goldsmith but that's about how far it goes. The two films bore little in common outside of their both belonging to the same category of Epic Military Biographies. THE PROBLEMS IN storytelling called for a different approach for MAC ARTHUR as the period of time was much longer and more diverse than was the earlier film. In PATTON we follow about 3 years in a career that lasted over 35 years. It begins with his assuming Command of II Corps following the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in Tunisia. It ends with the aftermath of V.E. Day ending the War in Europe.THE TIMELINE OF the production of MAC ARTHUR called for the earliest days of the War in the Pacific with General Douglas Mac Arthur's being the Supreme Allied Commander in the Philippines. It extends its timeline through the end of the War and up to the Korean War of 195053.IT WAS THE conduct of the General in disregarding the orders from President Harry S. Truman that led to his being demoted and brought home albeit to great heaping of a Hero's welcome. THat included an address before a joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives.OTHER THAN THESE above mentioned factors the film MAC ARTHUR was a first class non copycat production that stands on its own two feet. Its filming locations military equipment  personnel were very convincing and accurate. The Battle scenes are convincing and did expertly weave in some newsreel footage. The production team really made the viewer feel that he was there. WE MUST BE sure to pay proper homage and respect to the ensemble cast for acting they provided that includes all support people. As for the lead role of Douglass Mac Arthur he did his best to become the man he was portraying. The inclusion of not one but two Presidents was handled with the greatest skill. Both Dan O'Herlihy Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ed Flanders Harry S. Truman filled out their roles to the ultimate level.NOTE  We feel a particular fondness for this film as this writer John T. Ryan as a preschool youngster of about 4 12 years old witnessed the famous Old soldiers never die they just fade away ! speech of April 19 1951. It was on our recently purchased Du Mont Television set. My Mother Bertha Fuerst Ryan explained who and what the General was to me. It's one of my earliest recollections and very vivid over 67 years later. Thanks Ma !".

The movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War 2.  There was a scene where I almost vomited it showed Macarthur in a bunker in Corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded one legged Filipino soldier.  The soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says  no papa no mama no uncle sam' and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that  Americans would never abandon' the Philippines.  The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by Macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute. I mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the U.S. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake.  It showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great Americans solely for redemption.  It blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE United States Armed Forces of The Far East these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated in the US military during world war 2 who died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese who walked side by side with Americans in the death march of Bataan  and defended Corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous I shall return' speech.  My late grandfather a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country.

The movie hinges on one dilemma What does a military man do when given a direct order from a Commanding Officer to kill an unarmed POW in cold blood?  The questions of right and wrong are further blurred by the fact they are informed that all the other soldiers in the unit have all been wiped out by a brutal North Korean attack.  Aboard a friendly vessel en route to reconnoiter with another fighting division a Sergeant Kirk Douglas Corporal Nick Adams and Private Robert Walker Jr. have two days to dispose of the prisoner or disobey a direct order.  For his part the prisoner shows every sign of singlemindedly waiting for an opening to escape.  He speaks no English and only one of the three speaks even a few words of Korean.  The Sergeant orders each subordinate in turn to execute the prisoner but they are both quite conflicted also.  Kirk Douglas is perfectly cast as the toughasnailsontheoutsideSergeant Briscoe.  But Nick Adams truly steals the movie as the Corporal who nearly relinquishes his humanity trying desperately to support his Sergeant. Walker gives a solid if unremarkable performance as the Private that Briscoe relentlessly tries to bully into executing his dirty work. That's all of it.  So if you are looking for a war movie with lots of action and visual effects look elsewhere.  But if you wish to look into the souls of three enlisted men faced with Hobson's choices within an unrelenting pressure cooker this fastmoving and wellacted psychological study will haunt you for the rest of your filmgoing life.  I give it 1010 for its genre.".

However during this process a North Korean plane attacks...killing one of the men. The plane soon crashes and a lone man bails out of the craft. Now when the surviving three American soldiers enter the ship they have a prisoner.Once aboard the ship the men contact headquarters and are told that they were NOT to bring the prisoner in with them. In other words they were to kill him! This is clearly a war crime...and is against the articles of war. The sergeant Kirk Douglas clearly seems to LIKE this order...one of the men one of the privates Robert Walker Jr. thinks the order is monstrous and refuses to do it. The sergeant takes delight in goading this private but despite this he will NOT kill the man. So the sadistic sergeant then tries to get the other private to do it...The story is a great look at human nature...the good as well as the bad.

A very strong film whose only shortcoming is its pacing it could have been shortened a bit and that would have made a stronger picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy watching movies and will most often make a selection because of the actors then maybe because of the theme or occasionally because of a recommendation. The Hook is a movie that I had never heard of so seeing Kirk Douglas on the cover is what hooked me for this war movie. Also Robert Walker Jr is someone that I first saw in TV's Star Trek 1966 Charlie X 1.2 qv playing a 17yr boy so what would he be like in a movie produced 3 years earlier.The opening of this movie includes This is a story of men in war not men at war. And the two are not the same. To understand my view I am a babyboomer who has never served in the military but I have known many who have served. Most of these men don't really talk about their experiences so I often wonder if my views on war movies would be very different of those people who have served. My preference would be that countries would not be at war but regardless of this I believe we need to support those who chose to serve in the roles in which they are assigned.The Hook is a title that showed no relevance before I watched the movie and I never did catch. Is this an antiwar movie or a personal interaction story or war conflict drama and this question repeats itself for 90 minutes. Regardless the movie itself is compelling. We are engaged with three surviving servicemen vacating a military post upon a 'neutral' merchant vessel plus an enemy retrieved after he has bailed from his failing aircraft. Your journey is to imagine your response to their scenarios. Would you have rescued the enemy at all? How would you treat him on this merchant ship? Just imagine how you would respond to engaging an enemy on the battlefield how is it different or the same across an eating table? Kirk Douglas Robert Walked and Nick Adams are the enlisted men facing these scenarios.I enjoyed this movie in spite of moments of I wouldn't do that!. The movie is a must for Kirk Douglas fans and highly recommended for anyone interested in war movies. I don't know if actual enlisted people would behave this way but The Hook is wonderfully acted and does not need the tonnage of special effects that are today's production norms.".

	schema:headline " Intense Korean War drama featuring Kirk Douglas from director George Seaton";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by George Seaton with a screenplay by Henry Denker that was based on a novel by Vah Katcha this intense Korean War drama appropriately features Kirk Douglas as Sergeant P.J. Briscoe who's tasked with executing a North Korean pilot prisoner he refers to as 'the gook' Enrique Magalona in one of only three films in which he appeared. The prisoner who had just killed Lieutenant Troy Mark Miller in a bombing raid before crash landing himself is humanly rescued by Private O.A. Dennison Robert Walker Jr. son of his same named actor father and actress Jennifer Jones in his film debut who's more intelligent than your 'average joe'. Nick Adams plays Pvt. V.R. Hackett the only other member of this group who's beholden to Briscoe for reasons to be revealed. The military personnel were collecting a stash of fuel which has to be transported to where it's needed by a civilian charter vessel run by Finnish Captain Van Ryn Nehemiah Persoff. When Briscoe calls into HQ he learns that a school and a hospital were just bombed by the enemy and is ordered by the South Korean officer now in charge to dispose of his prisoner of war who Van Ryn had made bunkmate of the others. So the film is an emotional and psychological thriller as the three discuss the required act and the fate of their prisoner.Briscoe has but a short time left to serve before he can retire at 40 with a full pension even though he has no one to go home to as Dennison discovers. He's a hard man whose father and military experience has convinced him that weakness means death. Briscoe has taken Dennison under his wing but rides him while trying to instill these same values. At the same time Briscoe has 'control' of Hackett who used to be a Corporal but was bucked down to Private by the Sergeant who was 'protecting' him after a drunken brawl with another officer this however turns out to have been a self serving act. At different times each of the men tries to kill the prisoner but each finds killing another man facetoface more difficult than expected. Dennison is the humanist whose words 'work' on the other two and the two Privates actually try to free their prisoner. The ship's captain and crew doesn't get involvement per their neutrality in the conflict. Later when Briscoe is about to report their combined insubordination to their superiors they learn that a ceasefire had been called effectively letting them off 'the hook' for not following orders. But they'd left their prisoner alone knowing his fate he escapes and then tries to sabotage the ship full of oil barrels. The language barrier not only prevents the Americans from telling the North Korean about the armistice but it leads to his own tragic ending.".

If you take away the name stars what you wind up with is an inexpensive and very talky B feature.Kirk Douglas is Master Sergeant Briscoe in command of two enlisted men the erratic but compliant PFC Nick Adams and the humanitarian youngster Robert Walker Jr. They are the last men to leave a post in Korea aboard a UNchartered freighter captained by Nehemia Persoff. As they leave they pick up a downed North Korean aviator half drowned. The Republic of Korea is in charge of the operation and over the radio the commander orders Douglas to kill the prisoner.There are some nice touches. Persoff runs a practical ship full of highly explosive gasoline under a neutral Finnish flag. Ordinarily a situation like this calls for a ship crawling with rats and manned by greasy scarred and rebellious lascars. Not in this case. Persoff's ship is tidy and he has a French cook who serves up beef Bourguignon petite pois and a robust and determined French wine with a fine nose.There are very few action scenes not particularly well done but a welcome interruption to the drama taking place aboard the vessel.That's about it. The characters argue mostly but not exclusively over who is going to shoot and kill the friendly prisoner Kim with that .45. Each role is as subtle as a truck. Not even the banter sounds quite right. I suspect the novel might have been better than this adaptation.Most of the time it resembles a staged play. The three soldiers and their prisoner sit in their cabin and argue. Occasionally there is a visit from the captain or the steward. The men are groomed not like grunts who have been in a combat zone but rather like Hollywood stars. Douglas' moussed hair hasn't a strand out of place. All three were shaved that morning by the studio barber.Douglas does all right by the role of the sarcastic and ruthless sergeant tormented by memories of child abuse. You see that's why he's so tough on his men especially the boyish nonactor Robert Walker Jr. Douglas is reenacting the role of his brutal father. Ho hum. I hope the Korean kid made it to the end of the movie. That's more than I could do.".

You see that's why he's so tough on his men especially the boyish nonactor Robert Walker Jr. Douglas is reenacting the role of his brutal father. Ho hum. I hope the Korean kid made it to the end of the movie. That's more than I could do.";

Also the way it was told and acted felt real to me.It is one of those movie which inspires you to be different makes you think about giving life a go not to give up in life  love and makes you think that you are not alone in this world that we all need that someone special in our life who pushes us to be more then what we are. Puts meaning to every heartbeat after all wouldn't it be sad to just follow the same routine law behaviour etc laid out for you by society family so on? This movie questions those beliefs and makes you think are you alive or just a person among 6 billion living a scheduled structured life.Excuse my above paragraph it is just what I thought immediately after I finished watching this movie. It truly inspired me. This movie may not be for everyone certainly not for impatient people. The movie is slow paced but this is what makes it so great well at list to me as life sometimes is also slow paced. If you have come this far reading my review I truly recommended it to you. But don't hate me if you don't like it and demand your last two hours of your life back because I cannot give it to you as I am not god! But I offer my heartfelt sincere apologies.".

As much as this is an homage to Blade Runner it also draws heavily from the Matrix and HK Cop films. Like a great hip hop record or a Tarantino film it weaves familiar elements together in a way that not only seems fresh but gives you a new appreciation for the original sources.One of the things I loved most about this movie was its look and in particular the way the CGI was integrated almost seamlessly with 'real' live action cinematography. As opposed to many western scifi movies for example the new Star Wars movies or I Robot where the actors are shot on a green screen and then composted over a completely synthetic background. Natural City might use a shot of a cityscape and then drop in CGI elements like a craft flying over. They employ another technique which was used a lot in 70's scifi films like Logan's Run  inter cutting SFX scenes with live action that was just shot on real futuristiclooking locations. This really balances out the artificiality of the effects and shows that a little can go a long way ...The result is an extremely realistic look and feel to the movie. I believe that this is what the world could look like in 2080.Natural City's only real flaw in my eyes is that it does tend to get slow in a few key spots. But every shot in this film is so gorgeous it's hard to know where they would cut.All in all I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read through the reviews here before I watched it and didn't know what to expect a classic or a bummer? In my view the truth is in the middle and the average vote of currently 5.8 seems justified. Natural City is by no means a movie on the Blade Runner level. Take away the futuristic eyecandy and what is left? A man is in love with a cyborg lady without really telling us why how or what for. Real character development is not happening! He gets in a conflict with his friend over the cyborgs which leads to gratuitous violence with faces covered in blood like in a million action flicks before. Meanwhile a girl plants flowers in a roof garden to provide a contrast to the postwar destruction scenery around. Natural City doesn't really have any new ideas it simply spices up the collection of familiar trade marks with MatrixEquilibrium Next Generation visuals which is fine for web 2.0 designers but not for the art of film making. Everybody who truly believes this is going to be a classic should go watch Soylent Green where it was the actors and the story that mattered. Still Natural City is a movie that has its touching or stunning moments. Actually I liked that explanations were not provided in many cases. One might argue whether it is a deliberate attempt to open it for interpretation or simply plot holes. But I think if we once really caught a glimpse of the year 2080 there would be much that we won't comprehend either. You know how silly SF movies of the 1950s seem today because they applied manners moral standards and ways of conversation that are outdated. In this respect I'm curious what people will think of Natural City in the future. Keep it in the archive.".

	onyx:emotionText "I read through the reviews here before I watched it and didn't know what to expect a classic or a bummer? In my view the truth is in the middle and the average vote of currently 5.8 seems justified. Natural City is by no means a movie on the Blade Runner level. Take away the futuristic eyecandy and what is left? A man is in love with a cyborg lady without really telling us why how or what for. Real character development is not happening! He gets in a conflict with his friend over the cyborgs which leads to gratuitous violence with faces covered in blood like in a million action flicks before.

The cyborgs and mad scientists aren't really what the film is about it's about the loneliness and detachment of the characters in a world where personal relationships have deteriorated even further than in our own. The fact that the acting is wooden is arguably deliberate as the characters have no real emotional lives.

A movie like this you have SEE you have become comfortable with the pacing and digest what is fed to you as it is fed to you but most people don't realize that there is a story there is character development that there is substance.It is a very tragic movie about a Military Policeman who is alone and unable to connect with the world or anyone else so the one thing he connects with is a living doll that is slowly slipping away and the tighter he holds on the more complicated and difficult the situation gets for the principle cast. I read a description of the movie and the lead R was described as a Cipher a person with no influence on his surroundings but it is the opposite the whole world in which he inhabits reacts to him and only him. Its beautiful and tragic.The movie ends as it should a very good ending I feel and it isn't as dark as one would think.It is a very good movie several steps above other Korean scifi like 2009 and Wonderful Days visual and more akin to Wonderful Days atmospherically.

	schema:reviewBody "Natural City is one of several recent Korean movies such as 2046 from a new school of filmmaking in Asia. And unfortunately after watching digesting and allowing this film to sink in I can only reach the inescapable conclusion that this 'new school' consists of former music video directors who have watched Blade Runner far too many times. The discerning filmgoer will even notice some exact shots are actually lifted in this movie from Ridley Scott's neonoir masterpiece. This film  perhaps even more than the source material that it clearly owes its entire existence to  relies far too much on slick but ultimately hollow and meaningless cinematography.Its story slows to a crawl and patches together pointless scenes such as R's bar fight to keep what semblance of kinetic energy it promised on the film's back cover going. Ridiculous logistical scenes are turned into ethereal minimusic videos with no point and no underlying symbolism. It's as if the director is desperately trying to emulate the emotional power of scenes in Blade Runner by using that film's same tricks  slow motion sappy music and rain. Unfortunately Natural City never hits anywhere near the mark it sets for itself and the director seems genuinely clueless as to what his movie's actual symbolic meaning is. The result is a muddled atrocity of a story that moves like frozen chocolate pudding and has to resort to a big gunfight and clich 'selfdestruct countdown' sequence as its climax to make up for its own glaring shortcomings.The good things about this movie? The lead actor playing the part of R is actually quite good at attracting empathy. Visually there are a few interesting bits. The death of one of the film's main characters is a touching but hollow scene which perhaps unintentionally works in its favor. Some of the atmosphere is very depressive and moody and really lends to the overall feel but I don't think any single scene really steps out and defines this film visually. There is a very generic scifi feel to certain things such as the M.P.'s and the gunfight at the beginning of the film.I should make very clear that while this film is clearly derivative of Blade Runner it is nowhere near the feast for the eyes that the former is and it also fails miserably at putting its own unique visual spin on the future. And as a simple aside to those who suggest that it is unfair to compare the two films  Natural City itself draws the comparisons actively inciting them on its front cover. That is this movie's gimmick and ultimately its failing.".

There is a very generic scifi feel to certain things such as the M.P.'s and the gunfight at the beginning of the film.I should make very clear that while this film is clearly derivative of Blade Runner it is nowhere near the feast for the eyes that the former is and it also fails miserably at putting its own unique visual spin on the future. And as a simple aside to those who suggest that it is unfair to compare the two films  Natural City itself draws the comparisons actively inciting them on its front cover. That is this movie's gimmick and ultimately its failing.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge Blade Runner fan and discovered this movie through a BR site. Although I tried to get into this movie without any biases or preconceptions it was quite difficult because everything in Natural City screams of Blade Runner. Some of the scenes were so blatantly familiar that it would make me nostalgically smile and even rewind just to see it again. Even the characters that some of us came to love after the Nth watching of Ridley Scott's masterpiece are quite apparent in the story. But don't get me wrong the fact that Natural City is trying to mimic one of the greatest scifi movies in history is not a bad thing at all. In fact it manages to pull it off quite nicely and delivers a great movie but unfortunately it is far from being a perfect cyberpunk scifi that Blade Runner was. For one I was sort of disappointed with the music. It's too shallow and a bit too melancholic compared to BR's powerful Vangelis tunes. Scores in Natural City that are mostly composed for piano are not bad but they're far from being good. Most of the time you won't even notice the music and I think a lot more emphasis should have been put on this since one of the lesson's from Blade Runner was that sound track plays an extremely important role in mood setting and overall effect on the movie. Also because this is an Asian movie I had trouble relating to the emotional aspects of it. Characters at least female characters were just too shallow for my tastes. There was no Rachel to speak of and the girl who sort of played her was constantly sitting in the corner with a blank expression on her face. Although it's understandable in the context of the storyline I think they could have done better than that. It does in the end make you concentrate more on the male protagonist but I think that makes the female actors kind of ignorable which I think is not right. Romance is the center of the story so having a strong female role is quite crucial. But all these disappointment are really quite minor. I have to stress that Natural City is a really interesting film and a strong contender amongst SciFi masterpieces. I'm sure it will have more fame in near future and will probably become a cult like so many other great underappreciated scifi movies did.This is definitely a must see for anyone who's interested in scifi but is also a good action flick to satisfy an average Joe. The story might be a bit complicated for a person that has never seen this type of movies before but visuals are pretty enough to keep anyone on watching.910 10 for being a great sci fi 1 for somewhat generic music".

No less and no more. If one expects ideas and human elements combined with adequate acting and direction then this product will entertain.Derivations aside even Bladerunner was an adaptation some critics may perhaps broaden their climes and see that imitation is both flattery and homage to thought and endeavour.

Set in a futuristic megacity in the year 2080 it's about a sullen policeman Yu Jitae who wants to extend the life of his beautiful android dancer Ria Seo Rin by finding a new host for her brainchip. As she's nearing her sellby date which requires her complete destruction this puts him at odds with fellow cop Noma Yun Chan and evil android Roy Batty...err...evil uberandroid Jeon Doohong who has plans on accessing android headquarters and programming a massive robot uprising. Flying police cars slowfloating dirigibles with gigantic projection screens endlessly vertical skyscrapers forming a mountain of technology in a postwar wasteland.We've seen all this before. And indeed it all looks amazing here. But what's missing is any depth of character to make the story more convincing. The leading man is a complete cipher whose motivations for prolonging the life of his robot are never explained or explored and while his robot clearly has functional difficulties with her impending doom Seo underplays these scenes to a fault generating neither tension nor sympathy only indifference about her fate.

One hopes that one day the quality of screen writing will improve to meet the superb level of technical artistry already apparent on screen. The 2disc Special Edition DVD of this film has tonnes of interesting unsubtitled materials for those inspired by its technical merits including an art gallery a sketch gallery tres Syd Mead a 45 minute TV doc with plenty of behind the scenes and FX footage a 24 minute DVD doc with more of the same a 14 minute interview with the lead effects man an 8.5 minute interview with the animator of the opening credits 6 minutes of deleted scenes an English language Cannes trailer that pumps up the action quotient cast interviews and a 20 minute walking tour of the films locations with the director and lead actor. A cool easter egg can be found on disc 2 by arrowing up on the main menu to highlight 'REC'. This will give you access to what appears to be a 7 minute effects laden music video about the plight of a country devastated by a nuclear attack which almost feels like the backstory to the main feature. 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Byungchun Min as well as being the cinematographer and writer of Natural City it then stars Jitae Yu who played the antagonist in the movie Oldboy 2003 as a member of the Military Police and known only as R in the movie who has the unenviable task of policing the city of the small group of renegade Cyborgs that have run wild killing the city's population. The plot revolves around the Love that has captured Jitae Yu's heart as his battle to keep her with him at all cost. Here we see the plot seemingly watering down this movie and I do say seemingly a typical Love story and the struggle to keep the two protagonists together. This may seem your typical love story but most definitely not in the same vain as the 1970 movie with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal on the contrary this is a completely different kind of love for a different kind of mindset in a future World that has changed all recognition between love and defeating loneliness. This is after all the year AD 2080.Where we would feel that this is an old age story line and then why not it works well it gives us the sense that love can hold no boundaries however obscure they tend to become.Where Natural City does stand out is its wonderful achievement for the SciFi  Futuristic movie genre Natural City tips over the edge of aesthetic wonderment quicker than a barrel over the Niagara Falls and really is suited for the Big Screen to watch this movie in any other form would truly be a wasted opportunity. The fantastic images and beautiful cinematography are to be envied and duly respected for their artistic qualities. The fantastic scope of depth colour light and shadow are just pure cinema brilliance the feeling of involvement in the City and its dark streets and even darker characters have us hooked on the first view of this amazing city and its surroundings. From street level grime and dirt to the ivory tower offices this is SciFi  Futuristic heaven beauty is in the eye of the beholder and behold a stunningly imaginative movie indeed.Natural City was nominated by the Festival International De Cinema do Porto Portugal during 2005 for the Category of International Fantasy Film Award. Best Visual Effects went to and was won by Byungyong Moon at the Grand Bell Award South Korea in 2004.Natural City is a future World that is possibly inevitable for us all but for the human race there will always be a longing for the past a past of when the longing of a future was only a dream.Visually stunning and sheer SciFi brilliance.Go to Natural City.".

This may seem your typical love story but most definitely not in the same vain as the 1970 movie with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal on the contrary this is a completely different kind of love for a different kind of mindset in a future World that has changed all recognition between love and defeating loneliness. This is after all the year AD 2080.Where we would feel that this is an old age story line and then why not it works well it gives us the sense that love can hold no boundaries however obscure they tend to become.Where Natural City does stand out is its wonderful achievement for the SciFi  Futuristic movie genre Natural City tips over the edge of aesthetic wonderment quicker than a barrel over the Niagara Falls and really is suited for the Big Screen to watch this movie in any other form would truly be a wasted opportunity. The fantastic images and beautiful cinematography are to be envied and duly respected for their artistic qualities. The fantastic scope of depth colour light and shadow are just pure cinema brilliance the feeling of involvement in the City and its dark streets and even darker characters have us hooked on the first view of this amazing city and its surroundings. From street level grime and dirt to the ivory tower offices this is SciFi  Futuristic heaven beauty is in the eye of the beholder and behold a stunningly imaginative movie indeed.Natural City was nominated by the Festival International De Cinema do Porto Portugal during 2005 for the Category of International Fantasy Film Award. Best Visual Effects went to and was won by Byungyong Moon at the Grand Bell Award South Korea in 2004.Natural City is a future World that is possibly inevitable for us all but for the human race there will always be a longing for the past a past of when the longing of a future was only a dream.Visually stunning and sheer SciFi brilliance.Go to Natural City.";

In fact there are a number of really cool moments scattered through the movie.Unfortunately Natural City turns out to be a remarkable example of what happens with a writer who can't put together a coherent story proves to also be a director who is unable to tell a story clearly.Nothing in this movie makes much sense. I don't just mean the story. Once it's all over I can say I at least understand what happened and for the most part why. But character motivations and reactions are inexplicable the science is ludicrous and the futuristic vision is muddled. This is a movie where a kidnapping is treated like a case of bad manners and the protagonists outrageous behavior causes barely a ripple.The lead character is unlikeable and outside of Cyon played very nicely by Jaeun Lee and some old lady named Bonggong or some such thing the rest of the cast is underwhelming. The cyborg love interest seems to have the personality of a cocker spaniel making it difficult to have much feeling for her and in fact all attempts to wring an emotional reaction from the material fail abysmally.The movie makes more sense in the last third becoming a relatively straightforward action picture but by then you're trapped in a movie with characters you don't care about making everything that happens feel trivial.The movie is slick and glossy with some nice special effects which is what kept me from turning it off that and the hope that somehow it would all come together eventually but it's just dreadful film making that gets more and more painful as it goes along.".

Once a revered officer R has been forced to commit illegalities in order to keep his beautiful cyborg girlfriend Ria Rin Seo alive pitifully fighting her short life span that will inevitably consume her. His actions have turned him against his best friend and fellow officer Noma Chang Yun who tries desperately to keep R out of trouble.When R is told by the brilliant but deranged Cyborg specialist Dr Zero Jung EunPyo that Cyon Jaeun Lee a beautiful young working girl has all the ingredients he needs to keep Ria indefinitely alive R will stop at nothing to find her. Unfortunately rogue combat cyborg Cypher Doohong Jung also requires Cyon to increase his life expectancy culminating in a violent battle for preservation.As a lead character R is difficult to sympathize with. Often aggressive and bitter the only times he is shown to be compassionate is in the company of Ria whose screen time is minimal in contrast with the other characters despite the pivotal part she plays. Characterization in general is sparse across the narrative with little backstory most characters having a very narrow agenda. Ria on the other hand says several key phrases over the course of the feature that have considerable impact however their importance is undermined by the focus on the actionoriented storyline.Moments of beautiful tenderness accentuated by the touching musical score are equally shortlived though are more memorable than the fight scenes. These are considerably violent containing a combination of gun battles and martial arts and though occasionally impressive these are also handled by using slow motion and quick shots that do not always result in appealingly fluid moments.Though Natural City is a film thematically focused around relationships I couldn't help but notice the distance between the characters even in scenes when they were barely an inch from each other. Feelings of hopelessness and the debate on mortality gnaw at you from every angle until even the sweetest parts of the film seem so utterly depressing. Perhaps I'm a romantic however I would have liked a deeper more passionate focus on R and Ria which offered a unique perspective to the audience rather than the clichd plot concerning killer cyborgs.".

War Hunt is one of the best lowbudget sleepers in the video store now available on DVD from MGM.Running less than 90 minutes War Hunt tells a powerful story about the toll of warfare on those who fight it.

The final conclusion between Endore and Captain Pratt Charles Aidman is quick gritty and comes to an unexpected powerful conclusion.Sanders' ensemble cast is superb in every way. Redford in his film debut is actually quite memorable as Loomis. The first time we meet Loomis we already know what to expect we've seen this type of cleancut fairhaired boy before. He'll go on to undergo a baptism of fire and become the hero of the piece. Not so here. Loomis arrives in Korea with ideals and patriotism much like Charlie Sheen's Chris Taylor in Platoon he comes to realize that there are only two kinds of men in warfare those who crack under its pressures like Endore and those who just want to survive like his new found friends Crotty Gavin MacLeod and Showalter Tom Skerritt. His scenes between Charlie are tender poignant and moving. His encounters with Endore are chilling and unconventionally solved. As Endore John Saxon brings a new meaning to the word psychopath. We've never met a wacko like him before. His mannerisms dialog expressions are all played with utter randomness. It's as if he was handed the role and told do what you want with it. There are times when Endore is almost completely human but something in his eyes tells us that perhaps there is something slightly wrong with this guy. As the nature of his character is gradually revealed we can't help but become shocked almost frightened.War Hunt is a clichfree freshly original and involving drama. It makes a strong statement about war's general destructive nature. This is a movie about survival and flawed idealism not heroism and courage. Kudos to the director for choosing to pick such a controversial subject. The film is almost prophetic in that it approaches the Korean War with an attitude that would come across with force and power in Vietnam films 25 years later like Hamburger Hill and Platoon.".

The story basically follows this man's experiences dealing with the others in their little platoon barracks  particularly a very odd man played by John Saxon who first appears on screen in a most memorable style  his mudcovered face suddenly appearing in closeup completely filling the screen. This man likes to go out alone at night with his face darkened on his own private war hunt as he knifes to death Koreans hiding in trench holes. This man's sidekick at camp is a young orphaned Korean boy who seems to worship the older man. At one point we watch Redford's character as he faces great fear during his first experience in combat he also desires to help the young boy and faces many confrontations with the war huntermud man.This is a very unusual film  powerful gripping and interesting the story moved along via voiceover narration by Redford as his character relates his experiences. The film features excellent thoughtful camerawork including many facial closeups and many dark nighttime scenes that gives a haunting feeling to the action. The background music reminded me in style of that often heard during Twilight Zone or even Star Trek episodes  a sort of 60s scifi feeling to it in a way. The film opens and closes with a nicely done sentimental chorus of Korean children. An excellent film all around.".

	schema:reviewBody "If memory serves the Sanders brothers came out of the UCLA film program at a time when film schools were still forming and not yet the minor leagues of moviemaking. The brothers made their mark with a prizewinning amateur production entitled Time Out of War about quiet moments during the Civil War. I may be wrong about details but I believe the thrust is accurate I wish IMDb's profile of Terry and Denis were more complete than the meagre data provided.Anyway my point is that this was a nonstudio production of stark originality at a time when war was still being celebrated by a WWIIbesotted studio industry. War Hunt is not exactly an antiwar film on the order of a Paths of Glory or Attack after all Endore's scary psychopath can be shrugged off as a wild exception to the average GI. What the movie does suggest is that a deranged mind like Endore's can prove highly useful in wartime even get a medal slapped on his chest for the tactical value his obsession with killing provides on a more strategic scale consider the intellectual value of the equally deranged Dr.Strangelove. Because of his battlefield information Endore is allowed to fight his own war by his own rules free from the restrictions placed on normal soldiers while command looks the other way. In short Endore's particular form of psychosis finds a home in combat where it not only thrives but also proves of real instrumental value to the higherups. In peacetime he would get a straitjacket in wartime he gets a commendation. Whether his psychopathic actions also promote a greater good amounts to an unspoken ethical dilemma not taken up by the picture and is likely why the script fudges the dilemma by having his obsession threaten the very truce itself. An unlikely consequence since truces are notoriously slow to take hold anyway.The movie itself is no unmixed triumph. There's no motivation for Loomis' standing up to Endore over the Korean boy unless we extrapolate some symbolism about youth representing the future and Loomis standing for American idealism. In fact the film's very last line supports some such surmise. Moreover John Saxon's Endore is truly frightening until he opens his mouth. I don't know whether it's the uninspired lines given him or Saxon's rather pedestrian delivery but neither measures up to Saxon's coldly menacing presence nor the character's bold concept. Then too the scene with battalion command fails because no one including Saxon has a good grasp of how a unique character like Endore should handle it. And on a more minor note How could he possibly get through Basic Training since he doesn't just resist authority he can't even comprehend it! as the battalion command scene shows.On the plus side stands Redford's nicely understated Loomis whose character wisely resists heroic proportions. Charles Aidman too comes across intelligently as a weary and beleaguered company commander willing to bend the rules for tactical advantage. At the same time as others point out the photography is appropriately grainy and gritty blending well with the occasional stock footage. But most of all there remains that frighteningly eerie glimpse of Endore's demonic little dance around his latest slashed throat. What mysterious god of madness is he invoking somewhere inside that dark pool that is his psyche. And what strange secrets has he imparted to the boy to carry into the future. I've seen nothing like this peculiar ritual before or since and it is truly more unsettling than the gallons of fake blood spilled by contemporary horrorfests.Judging from the Sanders' profile it looks like their careers petered out on television. What a disappointment after such a promising beginning. There must be some inside story here that I wish I knew. Be that as it may War Hunt remains truly oneofakind a really scary glimpse of a mysteriously psychotic figure freed up by the dogs of war.".

Redford not yet a heart throb plays Loomis newly assigned to an infantry company under the command of a curiously unassertive captain who shows an especially protective attitude toward John Saxon's enlisted man.  No homosexuality is implied on the part of the captain.  He seems more fearful of Saxon than attracted to him and he depends on the information Saxon brings back from his nightly solo patrols behind the Chinese lines.  The reason for the diffidence shown Saxon by the captain and by all other members of the company becomes clear when we see him in action at night his face painted a ghastly black slitting throats and doing a little war dance around the bodies.  Killing is what Saxon does.  It's practically ALL he does.  He sleeps while the other grunts work and whistles loudly and heedlessly while others sleep and he cleans his weapons.  Except when murdering or teaching his young Korean orphan friend how to play the game he maintains a vacant expression doesn't remember to call officers Sir and is convinced with absolute certainty that he's doing what he does flawlessly.  While being debriefed after a night patrol in which he discovered a heretofor unknown Chinese listening post One of them was asleep he comments smoothly the captain asks him if you know well this is kinda important and does he think he maybe should go back and make sure his information is accurate. And Saxon looks up from his coffee blankly and asks What for?  Saxon is quite good actually.  Redford hadn't yet got control of his minimalist style.  The two of them represent sets of entirely different values Saxon who is driven by the same demons that move any ordinary serial killer and Redford whose convictions are bourgeoise.  The focus of their conflict is the Korean orphan.  Redford wants to put him into an orphanage where they will at least feed and clothe him and teach him how to play baseball instead of how to murder people.  He tells Saxon this and threatens to take the matter to higher authority generating from Saxon a withering stare filled with hellish and unfathomable emotions because aside from serial killing the Korean boy is the only meaningful thing in Saxon's life.  It ends as you'd expect.  Saxon would never have made it in civvy street anway.  This is the trouble not only with efficient and committed killers like Saxon and like Steve McQueen in Hell is for Heroes as another commentor pointed out but with many military heroes alas.  So many of them seem prompted to extraordinary things without being too clear about whether their circumstances are extraordinary or otherwise.

	schema:headline " Behind Enemy Lines  And loving it!";
	schema:reviewBody "This ultra lowbudgeted and virtually unknown wardrama movie is probably the most interesting from an acting pointofview. War Hunt remarkably  but I suppose coincidentally as well  features the big screen debuts of no less than three names that are nowadays considered hugely famous and acclaimed. Director Sydney Pollack who sadly passed away earlier this year and charismatic star Tom Skerritt both appear in small yet memorable roles while Robert Redford later star of classics such as The Sting and All The President's Men debuts in the fairly complex leading role of idealistic soldier in the center of a senseless Korean war zone. And yet in spite of the more appealing great names it's unquestionably the still underrated veteran actor John Saxon who steals the show. Even more so Saxon owns the film and he's genuinely petrifying as the introvert soldier who appears to use the Korean War to give rein to his murderous and psychotic tendencies. When the young and inexperienced private Loomis arrives at the front during the last stage of the Korean War his fellow soldiers immediately warn him to stay out of the way of Private Endore and his protg Charlie a local orphan kid. Endore is a brilliant soldier and of immeasurably value to the American army but that is mainly because he singlehandedly decreases the number of Korean soldiers by deliberately sneaking behind enemy lines at night. Private Loomis protests against this especially because he wants to protect the young Charlie from his dangerous colleague. The rudimentary plot of War Hunt is actually pretty genius since it's the first and only film  at least as far as I know  that openly suggests signing up for the army is the ideal method for psychopathic killers to get away with their incontrollable urges and even get honored for them! Private Endore is antisocial impolite and without manners but his superiors never cease to cover from him because he's such a powerful weapon against the enemy. The atmosphere of War Hunt is aptly depressing and dark with some really brilliant musical choices and bleak photography. Presumably due to the absence of financial means there's a severe shortage of action scenes and hence you'll have to struggle yourself through a handful of seemingly dull and redundant moments. Still if it's not necessarily boisterous gunfire and violent battles in the trenches you're searching for I would definitely recommend War Hunt if it were only for John Saxon's stupendous performance. His menacingly painted faced the desolate star in his eyes and his completely unpredictable and impulsive personality make this one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a lowkeyed war epic.".

	onyx:emotionText "This ultra lowbudgeted and virtually unknown wardrama movie is probably the most interesting from an acting pointofview. War Hunt remarkably  but I suppose coincidentally as well  features the big screen debuts of no less than three names that are nowadays considered hugely famous and acclaimed. Director Sydney Pollack who sadly passed away earlier this year and charismatic star Tom Skerritt both appear in small yet memorable roles while Robert Redford later star of classics such as The Sting and All The President's Men debuts in the fairly complex leading role of idealistic soldier in the center of a senseless Korean war zone. And yet in spite of the more appealing great names it's unquestionably the still underrated veteran actor John Saxon who steals the show. Even more so Saxon owns the film and he's genuinely petrifying as the introvert soldier who appears to use the Korean War to give rein to his murderous and psychotic tendencies. When the young and inexperienced private Loomis arrives at the front during the last stage of the Korean War his fellow soldiers immediately warn him to stay out of the way of Private Endore and his protg Charlie a local orphan kid. Endore is a brilliant soldier and of immeasurably value to the American army but that is mainly because he singlehandedly decreases the number of Korean soldiers by deliberately sneaking behind enemy lines at night. Private Loomis protests against this especially because he wants to protect the young Charlie from his dangerous colleague.

Everyone with the exception of Pvt. Raymond Endore John Saxon.Endore is of the type of material that soldiers are made of. Tough ruthless and totally unfeeling to himself or the enemy when he's out on patrol knifing and strangling Communist Chinese and North Koreas soldiers on guard duty or in their sleep. Endore is now in danger of becoming an endangered species with the war that he loves so much about to end and him becoming obsolete.The movie War Hunt shows how those who participate in combat Like Pvt. Endore become so dehumanized by it to the point where they can never go back to society again. Endore had befriended this Korean North Korean to be exact orphan Charlie Tommy Matsud who not only looks up to him as a father figure but as a God. It's when Pvt. Loomis Robert Redford is assigned to Endore's squad that he starts to really lose it. Loomis wants little Charlie to grow up in an orphanage with little boys and girls like himself as friends to play and get along with instead of becoming an unfeeling killer like his hero Pvt. Endore.Despite it's shoe string budget War Hunt has a number of very convincing and terrifying battle scenes in it that you would have expected in a first run major Hollywood studio release. There's an nail biting Communist Chinese human wave night attack on the US or UN lines that has Pvt. Loomis freeze in his tracks almost ending up run through with a bayonet by one of the onrushing Red Chinese troopers. Endore uses Loomis' what he thinks cowardice under fire to turn Charlie against him. Loomis in his first taste of hand to hand combat did in fact freeze up but later courageously made it back to his battered platoon after killing in a brutal hand to hand confrontation a Red Chinese soldier who tried to cut his throat.With the cease fire that was to end the Korean War just hours away Pvt. Endore desperate to keep the war from stopping goes out on his own taking Charlie along with him to somehow relight the fuse. Crossing into nomans land Endore tries restart the fighting by creating an incident in killing a Communist Chinese or North Korean soldier after the cease fire went into effect. It's then when Pvt. Endore buddies who liked him so much when the war was going on turned against him.Obscure little war drama despite it's in years to come well known cast of Robert Redford Tom Skerritt and of course John Saxon War Hunt ranks right up there as one of the best as well as least known antiwar films ever to come out of Hollywood. The movie doesn't at all glorify war it in fact shows how it can turn normal men into bloodthirsty and mindless killers. Pvt. Endore got to like war and the killing that goes along with it so much that he even tried to get little Charlie addicted to it.In the end getting shot and killed by his own men may have well been the best thing that happened to Pvt. Endore. I can just imagine what he would have done when he came back to the states. With the only thing and pleasure to look forward to being him going out at night and kill like he did in the many war hunts that he participated in back in Korea Endore more then likely would have resumed his murderous obsession. This time not against enemy soldiers but innocent and unsuspecting civilian noncombatants.".

This film astutely nails the horror and humanity of warfare The one big combat sequence is genuinely harrowing while Endore's relationship with Charlie is truly moving. Endore makes for a fascinatingly complex character the sight of Endore with mud painted on his face is very chilling his acts of coldblooded murder are likewise upsetting yet his concern for Charle's well being is still nonetheless poignant. Fine supporting contributions by Charles Aidman as the tough Captain Wallace Pratt Sydney Pollack as the hardnosed Sergeant Owen Van Horn Gavin MacLeod as the disillusioned Private Crotty and Tom Skerritt as the easygoing Sergeant Stan Showalter.

	schema:headline " An excellent film which very effectively explores the dehumanising effects of war on its participants";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in the final months of the Korean War this is an excellent film which very effectively explores the dehumanising effects of war on its participants. It has a very strong script by Stanford Whitmore and it is well directed by Denis Sanders though the first 25 to 30 minutes are perhaps a bit too leisurely paced. After that however it rollicks along at a great pace and there is a great atmosphere of tension. This was the second of only five films directed by Sanders which is a shame as he could have become a successful film director if he had more opportunity to hone his craft. This is the first film that I have ever seen about the Korean War easily the least represented 20th Century war involving the US in Hollywood terms so that was very interesting. The film ends on July 28 1953 the day after the armistice that ended the war was signed but it is much more personal significance to me as the day that my dad was born.The film features Robert Redford in not only his starring role but his first credited film appearance. He is quite good as Private Roy Loomis but his acting certainly improved as he got older. Loomis is a new recruit who arrives in Korea in May 1953 by which time negotiations for the armistice are already well underway. He is a very likable character who is necessary to ground the film. In many ways he is the idealistic allAmerican boy who does not know what to expect when he reports for duty. His first experience of combat is very effectively depicted as being a traumatising one. As he listens to the artillery bombardment he stares ahead blankly hoping against hope that it will end soon. Before his unit withdraws he is injured and knocked unconscious only to awake the next morning to find himself alone. He manages to make his way back to the American lines but he is forced to kill a North Korean soldier in order to do so. After this scene Loomis seems to be more mature and sensible as this rude awakening has allowed him to grow up.While Loomis is the protagonist the best character in the film is Private Raymond Endore a cold distant detached soldier who exhibits signs of psychosis. The underrated John Saxon gives an excellent performance as Endore who is allowed to infiltrate enemy lines at night in order to gather information. It is his nightly ritual to kill North Korean soldiers with a knife and draw circles around their bodies. This could indicate that he is a serial killer and that the war is serving as an outlet for him to exercise his murderous desires but I prefer the interpretation that the war exacerbated these preexisting tendencies. One of the reasons that I think is that Endore is not completely without feeling as he does seem to be genuinely fond of Charlie the young South Korean orphan whom he has unofficially adopted. He wants to take him under his wing and take care of him even though he goes about doing so in a very warped fashion in that he intends to teach him to kill with a knife as he does. When the armistice is signed Endore is unable to accept that the war is over and he becomes even more unstable. He has become a professional killer but whether he would have always been one or whether his experience of combat aggravated behaviour that may not have otherwise manifested itself is debatable. Loomis works well as a character in large part because his normal behaviour and attitudes serve as a great contrast to Endore.The film also has a strong supporting cast. Sydney Pollack made his film debut as Sgt. Owen Van Horn but he later focused on his directing career and did not take on another major film role until Tootsie which he also directed 20 years later. He and Redford met on the set of the film and became close friends leading Pollack to cast him in seven of his films. Charles Aidman is very good as the aptly named Captain Pratt who condones Endore's nightly excursions. I would like to believe that an officer would not do so in reality but I am afraid that they probably would under similar circumstances. Gavin McLeod and Tom Skerritt whom Redford cast in A River Runs Through It 30 years later have nice but smaller roles as Private Crotty and Sgt. Showalter. McLeod brings a few occasional moments of comic relief which I appreciated as they served to break the tension. Tommy Matsuda one of the few people in the film who doesn't fall into the Before They Were Famous category is great as Charlie. It is a shame that this was his only acting role as he could have had a solid career. Francis Ford Coppola makes an uncredited appearance as an army truck driver. In a bizarre coincidence this means that the cast of the film includes three men who later directed Best Picture winners since Coppola directed The Godfather and The Godfather Part II Redford directed Ordinary People and Pollack directed Out of Africa in which Redford appeared. All three of them also won Best Director.Overall this is a very strong film which is at times quite disturbing in its portrayal of the effects that warfare can have on a person. It is also a great indication of what you can do with a low budget but a good script and good director.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm nostalgic for a good war drama pre 1970. I thought I had seen them all being middle aged but I had never watched this one before it's on TCM. At first I was dismissive Robert Redford? Oh boy this is going to suck. But no I was wrong this is a great war film. It's totally unpredictable I honestly did not know where this was going. I would suggest to not read any reviews past this point and just watch it first as a spoiler would probably ruin the film. John Saxon puts on an awesome performance and the dialog of everyone involved was real enough for me to become involved. It's not over the top it's very very character driven and very engrossing. If you liked low budget war films such as Attack! Men In War and Hell Is For Heroes you will enjoy this. 10 out of 10. It probably deserves it's mid 6 rating technically but as a character driven war drama I don't think you can do any better. I don't want to give away spoilers but every character involved in this was plausible and real. The less you know before watching the better your experience will be.".

The film also marked the screen debuts of Robert Redford as the cleancut rookie hero who stands up to Saxons fearsome grip on his unit Sydney Pollack a rare early acting stint for him as a sympathetic sergeant and Tom Skerritt as a cheerful sergeant of course the latter would later appear in the ultimate Korean War movie Robert Altmans M.A.S.H. 1970. Other cast members include Tommy Matsuda as an orphaned Korean boy taken under Saxons wing and unwisely befriended by Redford Charles Aidman as the Captain who often covers for Saxons insubordination given the importance of the information he gathers from his nightly rounds and Gavin MacLeod who advises Redford to steer clear of the highlystrung Saxon.Being set during the final days of the Korean War the film features the deceptive and ironic musical interludes played on loudspeakers by the teasing enemy prior to the inevitable combat despite its obviously modest budget and lowkey nature it is effectively shot in gritty blackandwhite by veteran cinematographer Ted McCord and nicely scored by Bud Shank. On the other hand coproducer Terry Sanders was an awardwinning documentarian who seemingly brought to the film an unusually sensitive and antimilitaristic outlook while his brother Denis was an occasional feature film director  including the scifiexploitation flick INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS 1973  who had previously cowritten the screenplay for Raoul Walshs WWII epic THE NAKED AND THE DEAD 1958. Trivia note reportedly Francis Ford Coppola appears uncredited as a truck driver also the films associate producer Noel Black later became an erratic director himself  most notably of PRETTY POISON 1968.".

We are constantly reminded that this was a war fought by the politicians and bankers to the detriment of the soldiers and the Korean people who suffered.

Redford in this one of his early film debuts dramatically questions the senseless violence.

	schema:headline " Bizarre film about the unending war in Korea";
	schema:reviewBody "War Hunt is a fictional war movie set in May 1953  the last days of the Korean War. It wasn't called war then but a police action or conflict. This is a strange film that combines some sorrows and other aspects of war with a wildly bizarre element. It makes for a weird concoction. At best it's an antiwar flick but that's not even clear. A newly trained green GI arrives in a combat unit. His natural fear leads to panic and he freezes. If he hadn't been knocked out he probably wouldn't have lived. When he comes to he kills an enemy with his bare hands. We see orphaned children but nothing that speaks of poverty contrary to the dialog. There is a tension of uncertainty that was unique to the Korean War. Endless ceasefire negotiations that lasted two years were interrupted by onagain offagain combat skirmishes. This was all after the major conflict and combat of the Korean War was over. Then there's a crazy character who sneaks off by himself at night to kill enemy soldiers. His company commander and battalion tolerate this because the guy scouts enemy positions and brings back information. To top it off the night killer has a North Korean orphan under his wing. The boy Charlie belongs to him alone. He has promised the boy that when the war ends they will go off together and build a house in the mountains of Korea. Conflict arises between the green recruit and the night killer over the kid. War Hunt has a cast of actors who were to become prominent in Hollywood. It's the film debut of Tom Skerritt and Sydney Pollack and the first credited role for Robert Redford on the silver screen. Redford had made 20 appearances in 1960 and 1961  most in TV series and one uncredited bit in a movie. Two other actors had good starts in Hollywood and would become better known in the future  Gavin MacLeod and Charles Aidman. But the top billing in this film went to John Saxon  the only bona fide star at the time. The credits list Redford last and introducing.Saxon plays the night killer Pvt. Raymond Endore. He's OK in the role but mostly in a silent emotionless and even sulking persona. Redford is the green recruit Pvt. Roy Loomis. Skerritt plays Sgt. Stan Showalter. Pollock plays Master Sgt. Owen Van Horn. MacLeod is Pvt. Crotty and Aidman is the company commander Capt. Wallace Pratt. The acting isn't very special by anyone and the music was terrible. The plot is weird and the script doesn't fit what we see at times. For instance Redford's Loomis in the opening is riding to the front lines and in voice over he says You see a lot of poverty kids starving. But the scenes of kids along a river and the road look nothing like poverty. They are just kids waving and asking for gum chocolate etc. which we see in most war movies when American GIs are present. Much more about this film seems hokey or contrived. Loomis stops Charlie who tries to knife another boy through a wire fence. It's the only place we see a fence in the whole film. Then a mother who takes the other boy under wing says to Loomis GI welcome to Korea. I hope you don't die. Toward the end when the ceasefire is announced to be effective that night at 2200 hours 10 p.m. one of the GIs losses all sense about war and walks away jumping and waving his hands. He's an easy target for the North Korean sniper who has been bugging them for days. This is a farout script indeed and just not very realistic or wellacted. The ending is equally weird. Perhaps this was intended as an antwar film. The most real thing about it probably is the fact that most GIs from most countries didn't want to be in Korea. The film might have done more to clarify why the Korean War was fought and the United Nations role in ordering the military intervention of 20 nations including the U.S. to stop the North Korean assault on South Korea. Since the ceasefire of July 27 1953 the Korean War has never been settled. Well into the 21st century hostility still exists between North and South Korea. The line between them is called the Demilitarized Zone DMZ where armed forces on either side are ready in a face off with uneasy tension. I visited South Korea in 1976 and went to the DMZ where the ceasefire was signed. A line drawn on the grounds and the walls and floor of the building separates the North from the South. The South doesn't trust the North and the North shows contempt and disdain for the South. That was evident in the belligerence of North Korean soldiers toward people from the West who visit the DMZ at Panmunjom. As the world watches while North Korea tests nuclear weapons and threatens war well into the 21st century peaceloving people everywhere might ponder the words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. In 1951 he addressed the U.S. Congress after he had been relieved of command in Korea. He said But once war has been forced upon us there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end. War's very objective is victory not prolonged indecision. In war there can be no substitute for victory. For history teaches us with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war. Like blackmail it lays the basis for new and increasingly greater demands until as in blackmail violence becomes the only alternative.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Kim Kiduk's earlier lesserseen films Birdcage Inn portrays the hard times of a young Korean prostitute and the family that makes money off her in a Korean coastal city. As with all Kim's films the plot is pretty ludicrous but this one lacks much of the sensationalistic depravity that makes most of his films conversation pieces. Kim's really attracted to prostitutes and the business of prostitution  as it seems are many of his heroines one character's transition at the end of the film foreshadows a similar character's change of heart in Kim's recent Samaria. He also seems to have a Mizoguchian lovehate feeling towards women. His girls may be whores but they have good hearts and even though they may be smacked around repeatedly they persevere.The main girl Jina has to be the prettiest whore in all of Korea working a seedy dive like the one depicted in Birdcage Inn. She's down on her luck and is the sole income provider for this impoverished family and their little inn by the sea. The family though aren't really all that bad they just have to put the kimchee on the table and the kids through school somehow. The high schooler son's obsessed with sad muppetfaced Jina and installs a microphone in her room so he can listen in on her frequent trysts with customers. The father well aside from the time when he pretty much rapes Jina he's an otherwise great guy. The mother takes it all stoically which is more than can be said for the daughter trying to get through university and court a potential fianc amidst all the dirty business. She can't stand that her family resorts to such activities and she blames poor Jina for all of it. Still Birdcage Inn eventually becomes the femalebonding film you figure it was intended to be from the getgo.Like Lars von Trier Kim tends to have his adorable lead actresses go through a good deal of pummeling and degradation in his films and he continues to incur the wrath of feminists. But as I mentioned despite its subject matter Birdcage Inn is probably the tamest of Kim's films until Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring and actually manages to finish on a relatively upbeat note. At the end of Birdcage Inn the whore's still a whore and everyone's still stuck in a deadend existence but they're all oddly content and accepting with a smiling Ozulike resolve.".

I was surprised to learn that the cinematographer Seo Jeongmin has made almost 130 movies as it seems a bit amateurish at least he did better in 'Suchwiin Bulmyeong'.The basic storyline was good. Its about values turned bad and living poor. Men are captives of their desire and the women are in difficult positions. But the script is not so good some characters are not believable and the finale was confusing. Go see 'Suchwiin Bulmyeong' and 'Seom' instead for similar but much more elaborate film art.You cant help feel sorry for Jina though. She is very fragile and even though she is misused quite a few times she is always positive.".

Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that the director Kiduk Kim used just about every scenario related to the world's old profession he could find. Unfortunately some of these scenes didn't translate well due to the cultural anomalies inherent in Korean society and in addition there were a few scenes which seemed to be a bit too slow.

Or just fatigue?Hmmm... probably a little of both combined with the knowledge that it I can always watch it again.Cinematic reincarnation!This really is a different movie and I can see it being played on my VCR time and time again at times when I want to watch something but don't...There's just so much to it so much to think about so much to see that one time thru will only give a little sip. And I'm afraid that there are times when it does help to read the subtitles  although much of the time there are no subtitles.The thing about it is rather than teach Buddhist philosophy it gives the experience. It follows its three characters on the path and gives lessons on letting go.There is a scene where a young boy returns to the grave of a bird he'd buried a few days before Unable to let go of the bird unable to accept death he finds that yes life goes on but in ways that he was not ready to accept or understand! In an instant he's startled by the cry of another bird and falls from a ledge into a pool of water there's a lot of water in this movie where he thrashes about like he's drowning  and then he stops trying to swim and simply allows himself to float. Get it?Lots of eye candy lots of mind candy. If you're a Buddhist or in any way interested in Buddhism you must not miss it for anything! If however you're not interested in the least about Buddhist philosophy but ARE interested in cinematic excellence see it. It's a masterpiece!".

	schema:headline " a quality film full of symbolism";
	schema:reviewBody "The thing about Why has Bodhidharma Left for the East that struck me the most was the life of the little boy Haejin.  In particular there are two connected scenes that were superbly done and the strongest impression I got from Why... is the symbolism to be found within them.  In the first of the two scenes relatively early in the film Haejin picks up a rock off of the ground and for no apparent reason takes aim at a bird and hurls the rock at it.  After he strikes the bird in the head and the bird falls to the ground Haejin runs over to it and examines it.  At this point Haejin clearly is stricken with guilt and is remorseful for what he has done. Rushing back to the monastery he avoids his Master and covertly hides the bird seeking to nurse the bird back to health.Later in the film Haejin is swimming with some boys in a pool of water when the boys take to dunking Haejin under the water.  As the scene progresses Haejin is seen emerging from the water repeatedly struggling gasping for air and trying to free himself as best he can.  Ostensibly the boys around him do not see that they are harming Haejin they dunk him underwater for fun and the possibility that he could drown does not even occur to them. Although after a few minutes of the dunking some boys on the outskirts of the pool look on with worried faces nobody expects that the action could seriously hurt Haejin and accordingly nobody acts to help him.The most fascinating thing about these two scenes is the parallelism not particularly thinking of the possible consequences young boys behave dangerously and someone or something ends up getting hurt.  Haejin thoughtlessly hurls the rock at the bird and damages it physically whereas the boys at the pool gang up on Haejin and dunk him underwater terrifying him emotionally.  I think this is an issue of karma Haejin does not think about the consequences of hurting the bird which is mirrored by the boys' thoughtless torment of Haejin.And yet another really interesting thing about the situation was the difference in behavior that took place after the thoughtless violence. Immediately Haejin realized that he had done something wrong that he had wounded the bird terribly so he rushed to take care of it and help it. Presumably the boys who were harassing Haejin did no such thing for in and after that scene we see neither guilt nor any attempts to mend fences on their part.  The immediate question is then why why does Haejin see the mistake he made and try to rectify his wrong whereas there is no such action by the boys?  I think that the answer lies in the fact that the viewer is supposed to note that Haejin is a Buddhist whereas the boys are from the world and it can safely be assumed that they do not follow the path of those in the monastery.  The viewer is supposed to identify the distinct difference between those of the monastery and those from the world.  The concept of the how the world is can be found in Haejin's master Hyegok's explanation to Haejin that the world outside the monastery is full of pain and thoughtlessness.  The scene at the pool is the point where the director of the film gives the viewer the opportunity to see Haejin in a situation that verifies what the Master said.  Kibong had the same opportunity when he went home to see his mother.  Although there is not much of an observable difference in the behavior of the boys during the violent behavior  for all are only little boys prone to stupidity  the emphasis is the Buddhist response to the situation as opposed to the nonBuddhist response.Although I do not think that I understood everything in the film  when Master Hyegok was talking about really deep and spiritual things he spoke quite fast and I did not really catch everything that he said  I think that I understood at least some of the movie.  Overall I enjoyed the film particularly the scenery and the painstaking attention to detail.  Most of all I enjoyed leaving the film room thinking about it and trying to understand its symbolism and messages.".

The director a professor at the Buddhist Dongguk University in Seoul took seven years to make it and used nonactors to play the parts.He recently remastered the image and dialogue in a new DVD release but unfortunately no extras or featurettes. This film is one of the greatest made and I feel sorry that it hasn't gotten the proper DVD treatment it deserves.Nonethless this movie is a meditation about Buddhism life and death and our raison d'etre.

	schema:reviewBody "How to approach beautiful crazy Zen in a way that makes sense to us in the West? In a way that it and this film can actually inform us.This problem one of translation was inherited by cinema. China conceived this poetry where humane dispassion is passionately sung about where a flower looks back at us looking at it but we know of Zen from Japan us here most likely from their cinema. Perhaps even without knowing it.But when the most fascinating form to express it in came along so did Mao. Japan shouldered the task to do what the Chinese couldn't with their affinity for broken symmetries and abstraction cultivated in the tea room but even here we concede to a certain unfamiliarity that keeps these things at a distance. Teshigahara makes some general sense to us but he's not really opened until we learn about ikebana.How to bridge the rift then? Which is bigger than we think because we have the words 'emptiness' 'desire' 'self' but mean by them wholly different things than the Buddhist.Which is to say having been brought up in a culture that distinguishes between the omnipresent creator who created something out of nothing and us as creatures separately placed in that world to atone for an original ancestral sin which means that the world itself is the punishment or still swears by Descartes' old stratagem that we are because we think how can we begin to wrap our heads around notions of emptiness as actually soothing? What are we to make of Zen poems that speak of death which so terrifies us as merely the echoes of bamboo flutes returning to the bamboo forest? When Zen Master Ikkyu says that I'd like to offer something to help you but in Zen we don't have a single thing take his word for it. He's being a bit of a smartass but that's because he wants you to listen for a moment. Which is to say that if we come to this looking for something a taste of Zen that will guide us home we'll likely have to struggle to stay awake long enough to realize that there is nothing to be offered.More precisely nothing to be taught. But if we become aware instead? If we come to embody what the film does? We are related with various aspects of the teachings here how ego and desire bind us how in stillness of mind we can free ourselves of those bonds. The illusionary burden of duality. But as the young monk meditates a cow breaks free of her captivity. So what to do?Down in the city the monk offers up his alms' bowl in the middle of the busy marketplace. This is where stillness of mind attains proper meaning in the sound and fury. But again if the film has few words to impart and it does like a visual mantra which in repetition calls for us to concentrate on the texture of the sound itself what are we to take from it? Perhaps a few pointers to wisdom mere signposts on the road.Most importantly meditational absorption the actual ChanZen. Again we may be troubled by our inclination to regard images here as symbolic as meaning something else a flying crow or a cow leading a boy when things are actually simpler which is the most complex they can be. This is not a mystical work things here mean what they are. If it is difficult to come to terms with this it's because we've been so accustomed to grasp 'flower' by what stored ideas we have of 'flower'. Descartes again.But to depart is to arrive as the dying Zen master says. To send the mind out is to see it come back again. Isn't that cool? So how to depart from established notions? How to look at the flower as it looks back at us to actually do this? One of the great contributions of Zen to this conundrum is the koan the enigmatic phrase whose purpose is to tie our tongue so that we may reflect in silence. There is a koan asked of the novice in this which points towards the kensho the awakening of the true self. The title of the film is another. Life is the most complex how to gather all the different notes we can feel played out in us into a single harmonious music? And how to play that music actively joyfully as it plays us? There is no right or wrong answer to these other than what we embody through our experience. Embodying this is enough. And by this I don't mean a fancier version of being 'mesmerized'. I mean be one with it like the calligrapher becomes one with his brush the haiku poet with his blank paper. Hear what is said then be quiet as the question answers itself.Something to meditate upon.".

I agree with the reviewers who say this film is slow and incomprehensible. The Korean art professor who made this seemed more interested in making a pseudoprofound art film than an actual good film. The Zen koanlike utterings from the monks seem just a bit cliched. There was even a monastery cat in the window sill. Does it get any better than that? Art films especially foreign ones will get a lot of rave reviews from critics and audiences alike for simply being pretentious and artsy. New York Times raved about this way back in 1993. Actually this reminds me of Ponette 1994  another very slowmoving boring foreign film from around that time.Still I give 5 stars for some beautiful cinematography hot actor why doesn't he have any other credits besides this film? and the unique subject matter. The hot actor looks like Sang Woo Kim the British Korean modelartist on Instagram.I watched this streamed on YouTube but had a really hard time following and keeping interested. Maybe it's better if you watch it in a theater. This is a very littleknown film from the 80s but I can see art film houses screening this these days. This reminds me of a more recent monastery film Into Great Silence 2005 a German documentary that followed around Carthusian monks in a French monastery. That documentary had no narrative just silent and just followed the monks about their lives. Anyway this is a decent film to attempt watching good luck if you want to add to your tiny arsenal of monastery films. You'll learn about Korean stuff you probably didn't know about like the purple rice black rice added to white turns it purple.".

These forest monks are still homo sapiens replete with all the urges and desires and wonderings that drive us mad.

These forest monks are still homo sapiens replete with all the urges and desires and wonderings that drive us mad. In both films there is an old master who is quite sure of himself and of Buddhism but that is offset by a younger monk who must leave for the world.So see both these movies and draw your own comparisons.";

	schema:reviewBody "Now I'll start off by saying that there is no reason to compare this movie to the Asian blockbusters such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Hero etc. It doesn't matter if you've seen them or not because I think this movie has it's own atmosphere and feel to it. I guess it's because this film is Korean. There is a distinct difference between Korean and other Asian action movies. They have their own style of making these fantastic actionepicdrama movies. Another great Korean movie in the same veins is Musa The Warrior so if you've seen it you have some idea what to expect. Some other comment stated that there are some weird comedic features in the fight scenes but I wouldn't point that out in the review. It was only one short scene and that's all she wrote. On the contrary I found this movie to be quite serious in the whole. Though everyone would say there wasn't much of a plot I answer There is an adequate plot to carry this movie without a problem it is after all made for entertaining purposes not for the Oscar nomination.Now more about the movie. The fighting is mostly swordfighting. There are a few more exotic arms with some of the fighters too like bows or poles. The fights were made watcher friendly in a way that you can actually see what is happening in the fights all the time. So it's not just a clinging sound and a million swordstrikes per second where you can't tell which sword belongs to who. So you can see every small detail in the fights which is in my opinion definitely a good thing. And yes there is a lot of flying in the movie but used much more tastefully than for example in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The fight choreography in general was amazing. Saw many moves that I hadn't seen before in similar films. The actors were good especially the leading actress was very convincing. When I watched this film I had been bored out of my mind all day and was about to fall to sleep. NOT after the movie started rolling. I was glued to my seat from start to end. Summary Good action and choreography good acting and very very entertaining.".

She is the best warrior of Balhae sent to bring him back to take up rulership after all the other Princes are killed. The female villain isn't half bad looking either. The villains are all very cartoon like but the fight scenes are really well done so if you like this genre of film and if you enjoyed 'House of flying daggars' you will enjoy this film as long as you aren't expecting an indepth storyline. The only downside of this film for me was the silly flying through the air scenes I know they are part of this type of film but it spoils it for me. It is probably why I preferred 'House of flying daggars' to 'Crouching tiger hidden dragon'. So I would certainly recommend this film and would definitely watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the comments I'm beginning to think I saw a different movie. We start out with what looks like a historical drama. In the time period of 976 A.D. a group has overthrown the royal family and taken over the land and people. There is but one remaining royal member someone who disappeared 14 years earlier so the counsel decides to send their best warrior to locate this man and bring him home. This is the main plot and is a very plausible and good storyline. And within this plot we have the evil group who wants all the royals killed and we learn the real reason behind this action along the way as well. Plausible plot still going. As it turns out the warrior sent to bring the prince home safely is a young woman and through flashbacks we discover the relationship between the warrior and the prince she has been sent to get. Everyhing ties in nicely. There are other flashbacks that flush out the story and fill in the blanks. What we have here is not just an action movie with a lot of great choreographed fighting scenes with everyone but the comic relief darn good looking or what could have been a real event but a love story. The relationship the develops between the warrior and the prince. The inevitable outcome. Kind of like a lot of operas which could be the case. The only thing that bothered me about this movie was that there was too much music and at times the music did not match what was going on in a scene. But when the music fit it was beautiful. A huge thanks to whoever decided to write in an English horn for a lot of the background music as this instrument helps to set the tone no pun intended. And this is a beautiful movie to watch as well though sometimes the running in the air gets to be a tad silly when overdone which happened now and then in this movie. Ladies do not pass this one by. The real story here is the love story and thankfully it's not mushy or overdone. Give this one a try.".

In fact for me she is way better than Zhang Ziyi..Frankly I wasn't expecting the level of maturity shown in direction storyline n acting. And yes it is one of the New Line Cinema's. Although this is a period movie I could make out the little differences of Korean culture from Japanese Chinese or Thai.Aah man what a movie n what a beauty... I had never praised an actress so much before.. But here I go.. I am nuts about Yoon.Well.... there isn't a dearth of beauties in good Ol India.... but hey! she knows martial arts too....I strongly suggest this one for those who liked Crouching... Hidden.

It is rare to see something new or original in martial arts movies but here the filmmakers have a great eye for visually interesting fights. The backgrounds are gorgeous and contribute a lot to the fights themselves. For instance a lot of stuff breaks pillars tiles and other objects all explode violently from destructive weapon swinging think of the Matrix lobby scene but with swords instead of bullets. Roofs are there to enable aerial battle and even being submersed underwater can't stop the sword fight from continuing!".

The CGI effects are nice and enhance a lot of the scenes without being overbearing. The acting is pretty good with a mix of drama and comedy not too melodramatic. The villains of the Killer Blade Army get extra style points for sinister appearance and for being generally evil with the monk earning best of show for his tattoos.

The Dongdam kingdom with the strength of the Killer Blade Army at their disposal is responsible for killing the Balhae royal family in their quest for total control.A final heir to the throne Junghyun Seojin Lee lives and under order from the prime minister Soha ventures forth to find him and bring him back to the capital. Essentially a story of comradery between these two characters as they traverse the dangerous environments Shadowless Sword develops an emotionally poignant story of love friendship honor remembrance restoration and growth.Alongside Soha Junghyun originally carefree selfcentered and hapless remembers his former capabilities and begins to grow beside her into the man he is destined to become. But the journey is far from easy fraught continuously with peril as Hwapyung Hyeonjun Shin a man consumed by hatred and YungOK Kiyong Lee a woman who is almost as equally efficient as Soha hunt them at every turn. The focus on the heroes characterization unfortunately leaves little room for the villains and though they are developed it lacks the sense of completion the audience feels for the protagonists by the end of the feature.Some of the abilities and military techniques used during the combat scenarios require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief which is also true for the moments when characters are able to soar across the air currents with ease traveling from one part of the field to another in record time. Initially a number of the fights are executed at an incredible pace and it can prove difficult to concentrate on what is happening during the flurry of battle although viewers will quickly adjust. Later the film includes stunts that are either executed slower or in slow motion which really allows the audience to truly appreciate the beauty of the stylized acrobatic combat.The fights are wondrously executed the violence and beauty of battle remaining steadfast throughout the same going for the dialogue which is as intelligent as it is engrossing. The score including the final song accompanying the end credits conveys underlining meaning that draws the audience further into the plot all of these features combined not to mention the brilliant acting by the cast making for tremendous entertainment.".

I expected this Shadowless Sword to play some pivotal role but no show. This film should better be named Back to Balhae or something because that's what it's all about a trek to Balhae. The storyline is pretty thin but a martial arts movie with an original and strong story is a rare thing so you shouldn't be too surprised about that.Technically this movie is very beautifully shot with excellent art direction and costumes. The stuff on screen really is exquisite and should satisfy costumeaficionados and the artists among us. The actors do a good job too no overacting or amateurish stuff but at times overdirected it seems. The two main actresses are very pretty so very nice to look at. Clearly intended to attract the mainly male targetaudience I guess. No ugly women to be seen not even with the extras. The fighting scenes are very enjoyable but they miss the rawness and directness seen in HongKong martial arts movies. And unfortunately some stuff badly copied from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And overall the pace of the movie was excruciatingly slow. I hope the director and editors will learn that even pretty shots shown too long do get boring.So bottom line Don't get me wrong it IS a rather enjoyable movie no question about that. But you'll forget in a week or two. Good shot by the Koreans at the Wuxia genre though. Keep 'em coming!".

Everything from direction to choreography was spot on and with the exception of some makeup and hair the costumes are fantastic.Aurally there are no complaints but probably nothing noteworthy.Acting is solid nothing amazing but you feel it when there's emotion and laugh when something fun or humorous is done.Script is weak very very weak. Not so much that it detracts from the overall experience but it doesn't really contribute. Sappy romance is apparent from the first few minutes and there are some underdeveloped characters.Special effects are good overall but some are over the top and weak.Aside from some glaring and weak parts this is a really astounding movie.

I enjoyed the film it has some decent fight scenes and the acting is fine imo. Yeah it borrows a lot from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon House of Flying Daggers etc... but I enjoyed the film regardless of that.I really liked JiWoo Choiwho played Yeon Soha in this film. She was great in the fight scenes and had a seriousness about her character that she portrayed very well. One thing I didn't like was some random oddness in the film. Could have been the script or it could have been the director its hard to tell but there were times where there seemed to be a comedy direction out of nowhere during some fight scenes and conversations and whatnot. I felt the film worked better as a serious drama and the random comedic parts didn't fit in well imo. Also I felt the explosion kill move that is seen a few times throughout the film was a bit corny as well.Anyhow I think a rating of 5 is a bit harsh. House of Flying Daggers Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Hero are three of my favorite films and while this film is not in a class with those three its worth watching if you enjoyed those three films. I think a 7.5 is a fair rating for this film rounded down to a 7.".

They even put a scene where they're fighting in WATER so you can only imagine the beautiful visuals and effects. The only thing I was a bit skeptical about was the explosion of action going on it made me look at it as a sort of crappy effectbut overall it has beautiful laidout action scenes along with an okay plot.

The fighting is stylized with a great deal of wire work and over done effects lots of smashing rocks columns and walls but it is serviceable. The costuming and make up involves a great deal of eye makeup on the men and everyone looks like they are from the roadshow of Pirates of the Caribbean with Jack Sparrow being the model of choice. Give the film points for looking spectacular but at the same time it plays like several direct to video films I'm seen on Voom's Kung Fu channel. Its not bad but it its not great. Its solidly good even though its clearly reaching to be so much more. A rental. between 6.5 and 7 out of 10".

THE LEGEND OF THE SHADOWLESS SWORD is a historical romp from South Korea that sees a princess and a warrior travelling through a land inhabited by lots of different people who want to kill them. It's essentially a journey narrative that meanders between moments of lively action and dull drawnout sequences of wouldbe romance and talk. Lots of talk. I wanted to like it but the lack of vitality makes this a somewhat plodding affair in places.Films like this seem to be ten a penny these days and indeed the wushu genre has been alive and kicking in China since the early 1990s. I was looking forward to seeing what a Korean spin on the story would bring to the table but sadly LEGEND OF THE SHADOWLESS SWORD has little character and style all of its own. In fact it feels heavily indebted to other productions in places with half the cast at times made to resemble Johnny Depp in the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies.The good news is that it's not all bad. The action when it hits is well handled and explosive literally so when it comes to the various death scenes I liked this touch of originality as it's an example of something we haven't seen before in a film that feels slightly over familiar. In fact the whole look of the film is great it's colourful with bright costumes finelooking sets and also some finelooking women to boot it seems the producers went out of their way to cast the most beautiful actresses they could find. It's just a shame then that's there's no more substance behind what turns out to be a fairly superficial outing.".

Did Jack Sparrow immigrate from 18th century Caribbean to 10th century Korea to father some offsprings? Although it was a fun movie Shadowless Sword is very unoriginal.

He reminds of Lars Von Trier in a lot of ways in that they both have a lot of the same weaknesses along with being remarkable filmmakers. The thing that bothers me the most about both of them is the degree to which their films obviously serve as allegories. In this film in particular like Von Trier with Dogville this aspect is particularly emphasized to a debilitating extent. Also it's worth noting that both filmmakers seem to have a lot of the same questionable ideas when it comes to women but that's somewhat besides the point.As Kim KiDuk's films go this one is actually one of the more obviously ambitious and noteworthy. The whole thing was shot in real time with a bunch of cameras running simultaneously including one digital camera that is incorporated into the story itself to alternately ingenious and irritating effect. Objectively this is one of the most promising things the filmmaker has attempted although the method is less noticeable in the final film than it perhapse should have been. Still in the moments where the technique is used effectively particularly in scenes shot in public places it proves to be one of the most admirable things Kim KiDuk has done.On a whole though the film still has a fair share of flaws. Along with the aforementioned problems i have with the unreality of his films Kim KiDuk again proves he is pretty much worthless when it comes to using music. To begin with the film as is the case with many of his has awful sounding cheap music. But even then in one scene in particular Kim KiDuk has the music come in at a terrible moment that ruins what could have been a very emotional scene. In other ways as well the understandable lowbudgetness of the project becomes glaringly obvious in a way it shouldn't particularly in the way in which the film deals with violence.That said as always there is still enough genuine talent and obvious artistic vision that shines through in his work to make me not only not dismiss Kim KiDuk but make me consider him one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. Even if on a whole the film falls short of it's ambitions it seemed to be attempting a lot of what Man Bites Dog had already done wonderfully it's still a very admirable and interesting undertaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another fine film from Kim Kiduk although not in the same league as his two masterpieces The Isle and Bad Guy.At its heart a simple revenge tale it's elevated by an interesting psychological aspect that prevents it from being just another lowbudget shocker. The protagonist is a putupon street artist who meets an alternate version of himself who jolts him into action and convinces him to exact revenge on those who have wronged him.Or he's the alternate version of a reclusive pseudoguru who uses him to exact revenge on his enemies.

An ambitious undertaking on behalf of director KiDuk Kim but unfortunately the only really impressive aspect of the film.A young street artist lives a miserable life of solitude and timidity where he spends his days drawing subpar portraits in a park for money and is constantly beaten and harassed by local thugs. In a strange and confusing scene the artist comes facetofact so to speak with his darkside and decides to take revenge on all those in his past who have wronged him. The rest of the film is a somewhat entertaining but ultimately unsatisfyingly typical vengeance film where the artist goes from one person to the next in his past taking out those that contributed to his current antisocial and introverted state...until a twist ending reveals that the whole film may not have played out as the viewer may have been lead to believe...My first problem with REAL FICTION is the subtitling. It seemed very off in places and made it hard to follow conversations at several points. Another issue is that with a film as straightforward as this the violence was very weak and understated. This is understandable in the fact that I assume the director was trying to make some sort of point by shooting a film in three hours and therefore may not have been able to stage better onscreen violence  but honestly shoot it in 6 hours and give me some more of the redstuff. I like ragerevenge films as a whole but they're just no fun without the payoff. Also the twist ending  though not ridiculously overdone as has been seen in many films nowdays seems a little too obvious and done as a way to add another element to a relatively dull plot. On the upside  the acting is welldone for a film with no retakes and to be honest had I not been aware of the way the film was being shot I probably would have never known that the noretakes aspect was it's claimtofame. Also as stated before REAL FICTION was relatively entertaining as in I didn't fall asleep... it just wasn't very original. I would say that it may be worth a look to experimental film fans or ragerevenge films for a onetime view but I think the draw of this film will be more about HOW it was done not the film itself and personally  I'm more about the finished product. 610".

An expensive failure upon its first release the film has with a couple of repeat viewings on DVD started to grow on me not that I didn't like it in the first place.The narrative has a socially disaffected gamer attempting to make the title game character fall in love with him before she dies while fending off an array of wellarmed oddballs.

There's a tricky blur between real world and game world in this often maddeningly vague film and I'm still not sure I've read all the director's messages correctly or if he even makes them at all but the visuals are so enticing the action so deliberately overblown and the philosophy so seemingly just out of reach it's tough to stop watching and watching again. I suspect that this film will develop a strong cult following in the years to come with even many of those who absolutely hated it reapproaching it from different angles and perhaps finding new meaning in it.Despite it's Korean setting and cast it's probably the least Koreanfeeling Korean film I've yet seen generally eschewing themes of identity and patriotism as well as the maudlin melodramatics so often found in Korean cinema. Somehow I suspect that was all intentional. Unfortunately the Korean DVD of this title had no English subs so most people who've seen it subbed have had to spring for the bootleg. I give it an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my experiences Korean films tend to be just as strange and baffling as their pop music is. And this film is certainly the crowning achievement of that. Loosely adapting the Hans Christian Andersen children's tale The Little Match Girl it tells about Ju Hyunsung Kim a Chinese restaurant delivery guy who dreams about becoming a progamer like his friend Lee Jinpyo Kim. But we often dreams about things we really shouldn't as Ju finds out when he shows kindness to a lonely beggar girl selling lighters and gets pulled into a strange video game where the goal is to act out the events of the original tale while also dodging other players who all want to kill you.It's weird it's nonsensical it's utterly bizarre. And like it almost always is with these types of films either you love or you hate it. Personally I love it to an extent. I still require a semblance of order when it comes to storytelling and the flow of the plot and this particular movie is barely acceptable in that regard. Especially the start of the second act is very hard to follow style over substance more than anything else and it takes you a while to get back on track.The characters are also not very captivating. They're mostly in the story to pull off stunts and highly choreographed fight scenes and while all of them are gimmicky that is to say you can easily tell them apart from one another they're not people in the real sense of the word. They're cardboard characters. Ju has probably the most character out of all of them but even he doesn't really evolve all that much throughout the film. Mostly he's there to act as the audience surrogate.But if you're going to watch this film you're going to watch it for the visuals the craziness. And for that it's a very good film. It's always moving always doing something. Sure the special effects are not as great as they could have been had they had an Alist budget but they're good enough to support the story and only really start to show their cheapness during the final climax when the crazy visuals ramp up.And that's the movie in a nutshell. It's more style than anything but the style itself is very pleasing and you certainly won't be bored. Is it for anyone? Absolutely not. But if I have aroused your curiosity then I definitely recommend giving it a chance.".

It's more style than anything but the style itself is very pleasing and you certainly won't be bored. Is it for anyone? Absolutely not. But if I have aroused your curiosity then I definitely recommend giving it a chance.";

But I thought it fizzled off to a flat unnatural conclusion that made the movie seem like it was reaching in vain for something higher. And in reaching it lost within itself any potential for critical selfawareness.The film is a pretty fair summary of late 90s early 2000s Korean popular culture. The reallife popstar playing a popstar is comparable to having Justin Timberlake cameo as a teeniebopper idol and the other reallife popstar who plays the champion progamer is like having LL Cool J star in a dramatic role with special emphasis on the word dramatic. Although I must admit that Kim Jinpyo gave a pretty convincing and successfully comic performance. And I guess it's only fitting that a country as wired as Korea and a popular culture that drives an arcade owner to his death by a combination of starvation and sleep deprivation brought on by a fortnight Starcraft marathon could produce such a feverishly obsessive movie that could just as well have been an elaborate roleplaying computer game.In any case I still enjoyed the film for creatively blurring fantasy and reality. I think the movie opens up an interesting exploration into the eventual merging of cinema video games and music video into a true singleserving multimedia experience. Indeed without the overarching HaloDoomArea51 aura I think the excessive violence and action sequencing would not have been able to escape being accused of being hackneyed and overtly borrowed let alone be stomached. Kill Bill it is not but I liked it and laughed quite heartily at the expense of my peers back in the motherland.".

An expensive failure upon its first release the film has with a couple of repeat viewings on DVD started to grow on me not that I didn't like it in the first place.The narrative has a socially disaffected gamer attempting to make the title game character fall in love with him before she dies while fending off an array of wellarmed oddballs. Eventually though she rebels against the system with a Great Big Gun. There's a tricky blur between real world and game world in this often maddeningly vague film and I'm still not sure I've read all the director's messages correctly or if he even makes them at all but the visuals are so enticing the action so deliberately overblown and the philosophy so seemingly just out of reach it's tough to stop watching and watching again. I suspect that this film will develop a strong cult following in the years to come with even many of those who absolutely hated it reapproaching it from different angles and perhaps finding new meaning in it. Despite it's Korean setting and cast it's probably the least Koreanfeeling Korean film I've yet seen generally eschewing themes of identity and patriotism as well as the maudlin melodramatics so often found in Korean cinema. Somehow I suspect that was all intentional. Unfortunately the Korean DVD of this title had no English subs so most people who've seen it subbed have had to spring for the bootleg.".

Combining such gamewithingame plot with the original idea of the wellknown Danish fairy tale by HC Andersson the director captures fatuous egotism and unreasonable superciliousness of the XGeneration.This time his approach appears much closer to the heart and mind of the contemporary Korean young groups. They have seemed so lost in their real society that they have been consuming time and money in the internet world in order to find the release. It is therefore quite natural that frequent abusiveness pervasive violence sardonic cartoonized characters take up the major part of the movie. The most refreshing point is owed to utilizing the little match girl who is pathetic in the beginning and becomes a revengeful lady in the latter part. Unlike the cult hit The Matrix the obviously obnoxiousness of this movie lies in the lavish minor characters most of whom could not function effectively or contribute to the development of the complicated plot but trivialized and metamorphosed into an enervating mess.Recommend it to those who like Director's previous anarchist work Bad Movie and Lies then put it away if you're a fan of cult classic.".

Combining such gamewithingame plot with the original idea of the wellknown Danish fairy tale by HC Andersson the director captures fatuous egotism and unreasonable superciliousness of the XGeneration.This time his approach appears much closer to the heart and mind of the contemporary Korean young groups. They have seemed so lost in their real society that they have been consuming time and money in the internet world in order to find the release. It is therefore quite natural that frequent abusiveness pervasive violence sardonic cartoonized characters take up the major part of the movie. The most refreshing point is owed to utilizing the little match girl who is pathetic in the beginning and becomes a revengeful lady in the latter part. Unlike the cult hit The Matrix the obviously obnoxiousness of this movie lies in the lavish minor characters most of whom could not function effectively or contribute to the development of the complicated plot but trivialized and metamorphosed into an enervating mess.Recommend it to those who like Director's previous anarchist work Bad Movie and Lies then put it away if you're a fan of cult classic.";

The film that put writerdirector Samuel Fuller on the map to the extent that he was ever there it looks less impressive now but I have a soft spot for it. It is the story of a group of infantrymen many of them social misfits during the Korean War and their heroic efforts in defense of a Buddhist temple during a Communistled attack. The major character in the film is Sgt. Zack played to the hilt by a cigarchewing Gene Evans who never became a star but whose performance here is powerful and charismatic flawless in every detail. I've never seen him in anything else where he's half as good as he is here. Evans carries the film like a superstar and in Steel Helmet for a short time he is one. The others are good too. Steve Brodie is less of a jerk than usual James Edwards is very sharp more assertive than in the previous year's Home Of the Brave which he made with Brodie. As to the film itself its qualities come from being a sort of tabloid journalist's work of art. It is weakest when preachy about race relations strongest when men are arguing shouting and competing with one another as if they had just stepped out of the pages one of those 'adult' comic books they used to have in barbershops. The movie's cheapness gives it a documentary look and for once GI's in a film look dirty and unshaven. The scenes with the giant Buddha that dominates he temple's interior have an otherworldliness about them that seems serendipitous not planned and give the quieter scenes a background of serenity without which the picture might be intolerably violent and bitter.".

	schema:reviewBody "You've got to hand it to Fuller by going to lowbudget Lippert Pictures he got basically the unglamorous result he wanted. In the process however he had to sacrifice certain production values but what he got in return was an unHollywood Gene Evans a stunning statue and an unconventional screenplayall pretty cutting edge for the time. Now toughtalking homelylooking army sergeants were pretty much a staple of the era think James Whitmore in Battleground 1949. However they usually took orders from a handsome leading man like Van Johnson and so were clearly secondary even if important characters. Not so here. Sgt. Zack Evans leads the cast takes orders only reluctantly and deploys the patrol in combat situations like an officer. At best he only tolerates his nominal superior Lt. Driscoll Brodie. I take it that Fuller is being as honest as possible about the often hostile relations between officers and enlisted men especially intense as I understand it during WWII which was Fuller's formative war experience. Driscoll may have the authority to give orders but he has to earn Zack's respect  an inspired use of the steel helmet symbolism.Another major theme is Fuller's concern for racial equality a touchy societal topic also ahead of its time. The concern for mutual help and understanding is obvious in the relationships Zack forms with the Korean boy Chun and the black corporal Edwards. Zack doesn't pander to the black soldier but he does treat him as just that a medic and a soldier no more and no less. Fuller also puts the needed equality in a larger national context when the North Korean major Fong tries to drive a racial wedge between the diverse members of the patrol. In fact communist propaganda was often successful in Third World countries when pointing out the widespread racial discrimination within American democracy. Thus Fuller's implicit message was a bold and timely one for Cold War audiences.It's also important I think to point out that Sgt. Zack is not particularly likable. He's ornery and unfriendly. Initially he tries to get rid of the kid probably because he knows relationships in war can be risky. He doesn't want to get close to anyone. In fact it's because he gets too close to the Korean kid that he makes a big military mistake by shooting the Red major. I like the way Fuller uses that blunder to bring Zack down a few notches. In effect Driscoll expresses the officer's point of view by saying that because of his blunder Zack is too dumb to be an officer. Whether true or not the dressing down prevents Zack's character from being overidealized an important concession from a director clearly on the side of enlisted men like Zack.Nonetheless despite the quality of the story Lippert productions remains a cutrate affair. The outdoor action never gets beyond the telltale scrublands of greater LA while the studio fog machine works overtime disguising the rickety exterior set. Still and all the temple scenes are well mounted and I don't know where they got that massive centerpiece Buddha but it's impressive as allgetout. The frozen smile remains a puzzle throughout the action a fitting cosmic commentary I guess on the passing concerns of mortal men.Speaking of Lippert I felt a twinge of dread when I saw Sid Melton's name in the cast credits. He was responsible for much of that company's customary lowbrow comic relief and I anticipated the worst. My guess is that Fuller okay'ed him for the film but on condition he not be allowed to speak and risk his usual audience associations. After all Pvt. Baldy Monahan is supposed to provide what chuckles there are. It's also surprising to see WWII's favorite sadistic Japanese officer Richard Loo in a sympathetic role for a change. Fortunately it's one that also shows what a fine actor he was. For all the movie's many merits it still remains rooted in the cultural climate of WWII. Made at the outset of the Korean conflict it betrays none of the ambiguities that would later surround America's involvement in that faroff land. The enemy is treated as straightforwardly wicked and in a revealing piece of combat footage mowed down in human waves. As a belated tribute to the dogfaces of WWII Fuller pays his debt of respect and gratitude. However this is a combat movie and what politics there are reflect more about social conditions in the US than in Korea. Actual insight into the character of the Korean war only emerges later in such films as The Bridges of TokoRi 1954 and the much overlooked I Want You 1951. Nonetheless Fuller proves himself here to be a doggedly independent filmmaker. More importantly it also shows he's a filmmaker with something significant to say. And it's that important point on which his cult reputation rests.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where's your C.O. Commanding Officer? Fertilizing a rice paddy with the rest of the patrol....half his head is gone. This is the sort of gritty and realistic dialog that abounds in this groundbreaking Korean War film. Groundbreaking not just because of it's newer and more realistic language complete with lots of racial epithets that would cause the politically correct types out there to have strokes but because this picture managed to be the first Korean War filmbeing made while the war was still in its early days. And to get this film out quickly it was filmed in only 10 daysa shooting schedule typical of Sam Fuller's early films. It was also groundbreaking because the film tackled such topics as the treatment of BlackAmericans and JapaneseAmerican internmenttouchy subjects that were virtually absent in films until years later. This film definitely marked a radical departure from WWII war films. Even excellent and realistic war films as BATTLE CRY and BATTLEGROUND didn't come close to the style in this film. Much of this realism is due to Fuller's own service in the front lines in the infantry in the previous war and the film seems like an ode to these brave men.The only strikes against the film are an over reliance on stock footage towards the endwith some of it appearing to be WWII footage! Plus while I enjoyed the scenes apparently the folks at home weren't particularly pleased with scenes showing a prisoner being killed as well as a medic throwing off his red crosses and manning a machine gun! Realistic perhaps but not quite the same heroic vision of soldiers from previous films.Still overall this is a tense and exciting war filmperhaps the best of those made about the Korean War. Oh and by the way I checked. The tune for Auld Lang Syne really was the national anthem for Korea at one time. Also read up on what IMDb says about the productionespecially the number of extras and where the film was made. That Sam Fuller was a genius at getting the most out of minuscule budgets.PSGene Evans the tough sergeant from this film really had been a sergeant in the army.".

Shot on a shoestring budget with a group of UCLA students over the course of ten days the film was also one of the first films of the Korean War film cycle. Unlike it's successors though Fuller's tone is one of extreme cynicism. Helmet was the first Hollywood film to mention the internment of Japanese Americans in WW2 prison camps and elsewhere Fuller deftly deals with racism by including a North Korean prisoner who baits a black soldier into conversation with accounts of American society's Jim Crow rules.There are other points of interest a young Korean kid dubbed Short Round who prove influential on George Lucas' Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom the film contains an appropriately tense sniper sequence the film was one of the few from its era to deal with shellshock mental fatigue and war crimes and of course Gene Evans who plays Sergeant Zack offers us a wonderful character. He's a gruff bearish man. A seasoned veteran who has only one thing on his mind personal survival. Indeed most of the film's best sequences involve Zack and Short Round interacting. Zack teaches the kid how to survive in the physical whilst Shorty schools Zack in appreciating the spiritual.Unsurprisingly  a nice touch by Fuller  much of the film's violence takes place in a Buddhist temple war in a sanctuary of peace the strategically located temple prostituted as an instrument of pain.The film's politics baffled critics upon release. The right viewed it as being an attack on the Korean war and accused Fuller of being a commie sympathiser whilst the left thought Fuller was a sell out largely due to a last act sequence in which a North Korean soldier breaks the Geneva convention and ruthlessly kills our cute little South Korean kid. Commies are bad see so lets waste those ruthless child killers! In truth the film is simply naive the US shouldn't have been in Korea shouldn't have challenged the populaces wishes for unification and reforms and indeed committed countless huge war crimes and only made things much worse a tone which clashes with the beautiful pessimism of Fuller's writing. His scripts are typically fast paced taut efficient and masculine and we see that here with Helmet. Fuller writes like a pulp journalist his jargon hard a kind of blunt poetry. 810  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rescued by a young South Korean lad the sole survivor of a massacred platoon huddles with other stranded soldiers at an abandoned Buddhist temple behind enemy lines in this powerful Korean War drama directed by Samuel Fuller. The film is gripping right from the opening closeup shots of lead actor Gene Evans cautiously looking over a bunker while 'the enemy' viewed only from the wastedown approaches. Fuller does a great job visualising the film throughout though. Especially notable is how low camera angles are initially used to portray the temple as a mystic place of wonder when Evans and his fellow soldiers first arrive  shots that have an eerie contrast against the daunting high camera angles Fullers later opts for when it is revealed that there is a sniper hiding there. With less dialogue and none of that haunting voiceover 'The Steel Helmet' is less philosophical that Fuller's followup Korean War pic 'Fixed Bayonets!' however the sparse dialogue still amply portrays the mood and unease of the soldiers as they contemplate why they are fighting and dissociate dead bodies from those who were only recently alive. Evans is remarkable in the lead role too initially he seems cynical and hateful towards everyone but as the film progresses we see beneath his thick skin. War truly affects even the more hardened men out there. It is thoughtful stuff and the fact that the majority of the grisly action occurs at a place of worship is a bitter irony if there ever was one. Nothing is sacred in war and there is no sanctuary for those fighting.".

WriterDirector Samuel Fuller smartly depicts the relationship of an American soldier and a Korean boy in a nonstereotypical yet poignant way. Needless to say it is devastating when the boy is killed in the line of fire. There are some loose ends in this picture though that leave the viewer with unanswered questions. For example it may have helped to know more about what led one of the characters a conscientious objector to eventually join the military. Also viewers would probably like to know what it was like for the black medic to get drafted. His lines regarding segregation and sitting on the back of the bus give us a unique window into another culture. He has come upon foreign land with the hope that civil rights are not only valued back home in the U.S. but also in an Asiatic battlefront threatened by the encroachment of communism.".

	schema:reviewBody "Samuel Fuller's first great hardboiled war movie doesn't seem to strike up the same controversy that it apparently did back in the 1950s. Maybe an extra fiftyfive years of the United States becoming more liberal in certain stances such as where black people can sit on a bus or if the Japanese internment camps were such a good idea has changed the film in a certain respect. But what hasn't changed is Fuller's immediate sense of danger and drama of the tough bond between soldiers in combat and what it means to be patriotic in the face of the grittiest odds. I also found it a fascinating feat especially this early in Fuller's career to set up not only a quasiprototype of the Fuller badass that would continue on in many of his films one definitely would see a form or two of this in the Big Red One but criticizing this figure. And meanwhile Fuller pumps up his war film with a staggering showcase of horrific war violence which up until the climax is largely offscreen with only the sound effects of bullets streaming fast meant for emphasis and the camera acting as a real presence in the room during the temple acting as exclamation pointer and a tool for the suspense.The Fuller figure in the film which ends up becoming the central one even amid the ensemble is Sgt. Zack with his scruffy beard hard talk and odd principles best in the infantry Zack says as you either live or die. But of all things Fuller uses a little Korean boy who sings the entire Korean national anthem also Audl Yange Syne and has a deep belief in Buddhist traditions. It's not any kind of little gimmick to garner the audience's sympathies however and by not calling too much attention to it there's strength in Zack's very subtle change by the end of the film. He's still going to be a bit of a brutish guy who may let his emotions get the better of him and charges onward even when thinking he's the only real tough guy in the army. But Fuller seems to not be making him a real trueblue hero in the John Wayne sense he's a lot more of a complicated toughguy protagonist who played by Gene Evans plays him convincingly as a man who's principles of strength on the battlefield get mixed up when his conscience enters into things. He remains one of Fuller's coolest and a benchmark in B war movie characters.What's so strange about the Steel Helmet ends up being how it uses so much on a minuscule budget. Shot in ten days Fuller structured the script mostly as if it was a stage play 23 of the film is set in the temple as the characters stay low get a runin with a North Korean infiltrator try and fix a radio and generally have a lot of talks about what it is to fight in war and whatnot. It's never boring for second even as one might wonder when like in Night of the Living Dead the ominous forces of the outside will come in and break up the monotony of suspense. I loved little moments like when the one soldier thinks his grenade is about to explode right on his belt if he stands up or when Zack describes who he'd let wear his helmet based on an insane DDay story or when the radio operator started growing hair. Even dialog that should be dated when the North Korean asks the black soldier about discrimination in America comes off as interesting. And then suddenly Fuller will whip up the camera and editing into a sharp frenzy when it comes time for battle or make it as something to almost keep the soldiers themselves on their toes. And it's something to admit as fearless to have only a handfull of extras and a handful of special effects to make a battle scene just as great as anything in the Big Red One which are some of the best war battles in film history.A real 'guy' movie that doesn't kid its own nature about men from varying cultures all plopped together in an insane conflict with quick flashes of humor and sudden unexpected violence and a final message on the title card that will resonate long as men carry big guns and wear those helmets.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steel Helmet The 1951  out of 4 Fuller's grim Korean War drama follows Sgt. Zack Gene Evans and other rugged men as they take shelter in an abandoned Buddhist temple where they have time to reflect on what they're going in the war. Filmed in a reported ten days this is one of those rare films that takes place during the war which it is showing. The movie doesn't really take a stance on either side of the line although there's no question that Fuller wants to get his own ideas across. One of the best scenes involves a black man who is asked how he feels about having to fix these men up yet in the real world he wouldn't be able to sit at the same table with them. There's a lot of racial slurs thrown around at various people but this comes off very realistic as does the rest of the dialogue. You can listen to these men and actually feel like you're in the trenches with them as you'd be hearing this type of conversations. Another big plus is that the movie never paints a pretty picture which was the type of thing we were use to seeing in war pictures from Hollywood. It's clear Fuller is doing things his way and he didn't care about criticism which eventually came to the film. Evans delivers a fine and realistic performance as does the rest of the cast. The one negative thing was all the stock footage used at the end but the low budget probably required it. This isn't your typical war film but you can watch it and feel as if you're seeing an original. The influence on movies like FULL METAL JACKET SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and Tarantino's recent are pretty obvious.".

	onyx:emotionText "Steel Helmet The 1951  out of 4 Fuller's grim Korean War drama follows Sgt. Zack Gene Evans and other rugged men as they take shelter in an abandoned Buddhist temple where they have time to reflect on what they're going in the war. Filmed in a reported ten days this is one of those rare films that takes place during the war which it is showing. The movie doesn't really take a stance on either side of the line although there's no question that Fuller wants to get his own ideas across.

A huge and somehow ominous statue of the Buddha appears to play an important role in this movie but I don't know what it is. The one thing I'm sure of is that Fuller's experience as an combat infantryman in the First Division shaped the remainder of his life.

Many of the incidents portrayed in the film would never have occurred in real training especially Malden slugging Widmark in front of the trainees. But I guess the screenplay needed more action at that point. Then too the language was really cleaned up for public viewing. I had to laugh every time Widmark benignly called the recruits young people.What surprises me is the movie's director Richard Brooks. How he got the job of supervising this sort of pablum is a puzzle having built a reputation for highly serious work as a screenwriter Brute Force 1948 Crossfire 1947 et al. Anyway the movie is fairly typical of the sanitized type of military drama of the 1950's before the stark realities of Vietnam sank in. Contrast Basic Training here with it's more starkly realistic counterpart in Full Metal Jacket 1987. All in all Take The High Ground is little more than a bland period curiosity.".

Ryan loathes his seemingly thankless task of running the recruits through uniform issue close order drill and rifle cleaning preferring instead to fight communists in Korea.

The two then proceed to train the cross section of city boys country boys educated boys goofballs idiots and klutzes into fighting machines.Two subplots emerge first the meeting of Julie Mollison Elaine Stewart the exwife of a combat casualty who it is suggested to somehow have brought about the soldier's death by her desertion of their marriage after he deployed. Ryan and Holt nevertheless compete for her affections. Ryan holds her with disdain at the outset but is soon overcome by her seeming helplessness. Holt does not care to judge her at all. He accepts her as she is.

The young recruits suffer exhaustion panic and rage at their Drill Instructors as they master the craft of soldiering. The location of the border town of El Paso provides an interesting twist in the off duty experiences of the recruits where they somehow find the only Anglo woman in the bars of Juarez while the Mexican women populate the background shots with barely any attention at all.One of the stars of the movie is the desert background of El Paso Texas where location filming took place. The end of the movie is somewhat predictable and comes off as a recruiting tool for the U.S. Army but as war buddy movies go this one has sufficient tension to keep most viewers entertained.".

	schema:headline " Basic training during Korean war with a stellar performance by Richard Widmark.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an overlooked military film about basic training during the Korean War. Although it's far less probing and gutwrenching than Full Metal Jacket it's still an enjoyable movie with a stellar performance by Richard Widmark. It's one of his best roles. There are also fine performances by Karl Malden Carleton Carpenter Robert Arthur a very athletic Russ Tamblyn and Elaine Stewart delivers a poignant and tender portrayal as the troubled Julie God she is beautiful here!Most of the scenes were shot at Fort Bliss Texas.

Although it's far less probing and gutwrenching than Full Metal Jacket it's still an enjoyable movie with a stellar performance by Richard Widmark. It's one of his best roles. There are also fine performances by Karl Malden Carleton Carpenter Robert Arthur a very athletic Russ Tamblyn and Elaine Stewart delivers a poignant and tender portrayal as the troubled Julie God she is beautiful here!Most of the scenes were shot at Fort Bliss Texas.

	schema:reviewBody "Take the High Ground! 1953  12 out of 4Two years after becoming a hero in Korea Sgt. Ryan Richard Widmark is back in the United States at Ft. Bliss where he must train a new group of men for battle. His partner Sgt. Holt Karl Malden doesn't agree with his over aggressive manor but soon the two men have another battle a woman Elaine Stewart in town. The toughasnails drill Sergent is a character we've seen from the early silent days to even in more recent films like AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. I think each generation has their own films that deal with these characters and they're all ranging in terms of quality. This one here remains entertaining from start to finish even though it offers nothing new or original outside the Korean issue and each of these films changed that depending on what war the country was in. I think what works best here are the performances by the two leads but you can't help but feel that both were somewhat letdown by the screenplay. The screenplay isn't really bad but at the same time it doesn't try to do anything new with the material. We get the typical lovehate relationship between Widmark and Malden we get the typical bad girl they fall for and even the new recruits are the same type we've seen as far back as Lon Chaney's TELL IT TO THE MARINES. To be fair you can look at this film and certain points seemed to have inspired AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN as well as Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET but those two films took the basic training concept and did a bit more in terms of story and drama. What really caught me off guard was the direction by Brooks because at times it was rather hard to tell if he was going for comedy or drama. I think this was meant to be a drama as Widmark is constantly overbearing on the men but there's really no soul to anything we're seeing. We see Widmark being way too hard on the guys but for a reason. We see Widmark unhappy with the girl but for a reason. We see all of this stuff are told the reason for it yet we never really feel it. Widmark turns in a nice performance but I certainly wouldn't rank it among his best. Malden plays the supporting part like no one else in the history of film could. Stewart isn't overly memorable but she's at least easy to look at. Clocking in at 101minutes we get pretty much everything you'd expect from a movie like this but one can't help but feel it should have been better.".

No sentimentality and schmaltz here just a straightforward and finetuned soldier movie from the boys for the boys.Fuller a war veteran himself takes a nofrills realistic approach. With a tight script that weaves themes of courage and confronting one's fears into superb suspense and action scenes that have stood the test of time admirably Fixed Bayonets does exactly what it says on the cover. The miniature work is decent enough and the studio backlot that passes for the Korean mountains completes the illusion without distractions. It's still a lowbudget bmovie but it's holding well at the seams. The acting is allaround solid with Gene Evans once again stealing the show as the gruffy nononsense Sgt. Rock.Having worked as a journalist for New York newspapers in his younger years Fuller understands the importance of story above all. Sure he's not exactly the epitome of subtle  the inner monologues for example should have been avoided altogether. But I'm willing to ignore that because his movies have a sense of urgency and conviction that is hard to find he's a man with a story to tell he grabs you by the shoulder and says this is how it happened now watch this. And this is not about the politics or dramatization of war but war itself men killing other men in some snowy hills in the middle of nowhere.".

	schema:headline " A typically well made compact tale of war by Sam Fuller";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a small group of soldiers who are given the unenviable task of slowing down the oncoming KoreanChinese army in order to allow the rest of the army to bid a hasty retreat. It is assumed that few if any of these brave men will survive and it's all a matter of digging in and waiting for the inevitable.WriterDirector Sam Fuller was the first to make a Korean War film when he made STEEL HELMET. This film was made with a minuscule budget yet was a terrific war film due to his excellent touchalong with acting of wonderful roguish actors such as Gene Evans. Well only months after creating this film Fuller is back with FIXED BAYONETS! and in many many ways the film is highly reminiscent of the earlier film. Both featured a small group of brave American soldiers who have become separated from the rest of the army. As a result they are forced to make a brave stand against the odds. And like STEEL HELMET you see little bits and pieces about each manoften just before they are killed. Of the two films I definitely preferred STEEL HELMET because it managed to do so much with the tiniest budget and because it seemed more original. FIXED BAYONETS! was almost like a retooling of the original format.FIXED BAYONETS! had a larger budget and cast than the previous film though it still was a very economically made filmmostly due the use of character actors instead of bigname stars. Once again the exceptional Evans was on hand to play what else a battlehardened and wise non commissioned officer. Richard Basehart a wonderful actor played colead with Evans and that was a good thing as he was as capable as any actor in Hollywood but was still relatively unknown i.e. cheap. Look closely and you might spot James Dean in a small role and there are many other exceptional actors that give the film lots of color and gritty realism. Because of all these factors FIXED BAYONETS! is still a very good film and Fuller is really in his element with these war filmsprobably because he lived the life himself during WWII. No major surprisesjust a realistic simple and effective war film.".

Is a great example of how Fuller made the Hollywood system of the time work for him simply because he got films done on time and on budget I think. What would have been either a GungHo movie or a trite rehash of Red Badge of Courage becomes an involving and action packed story of a man becoming a soldier and leader something Fuller had first hand experience of in WWII. If you have heard the expression dogface applied to a soldier and wondered what it meant this picture will provide your answer. Fuller uses the closeup in just the right amount and just the right time here and the closeups put the finishing touch on each of the characters all of whom are distinct and varied.

	schema:reviewBody "FIXED BAYONETS  1951 This is not an antiseptic flag waving propaganda war film. It is a brutal hard hitting piece about fear and courage among men who know they could die at any moment. Director Sam Fuller pulls no punches in this Korean War film from 1951.The US UN and South Korean forces had pushed the North Korean Army back almost to the border with China. They were then caught off guard when Chinese Red Army forces attacked them. This soon forced a massive retreat along the whole front.This film is about a small group of American soldiers left behind to man a rear guard post. They need to make the Chinese believe that they are facing a much larger unit. The US unit needs to delay the Chinese for 48 hours to allow their own troops a chance to fall back and regroup.They chose a narrow pass through the mountains to base their defence on. They mine the approaches and set up a series of machine gun posts. Whenever the Chinese probe the defences the American hit back hard and heavy keeping the Chinese guessing as to the US unit strength.This tactic can only work for so long as there are only 50 or so soldiers. First the LT. in charge Craig Hill is killed then the two senior sergeants Michael O'Shea and Gene Evans bite the bullet. Command of the survivors falls to Richard Basehart. Basehart is a former officer candidate who has a fear of giving orders.Forced to step up and take charge Basehart fights his personal demons and does just that. He holds the post for as long as he can then leads the survivors back to meet with the rest of the division.Except for a couple of scenes the whole production was filmed on a sound stage. This does not distract from the film at all there are plenty of wellstaged battle sequences etc throughout the film. The action is down and dirty with all looking like they have been put through a wringer. This is a gritty wellmade war film.The director Sam Fuller also scored big a little earlier with another Korean War film THE STEEL HELMET. Both these are well worth a look for war film buffs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Fuller the director could sometimes give interviews that were as interesting as his movies. No baloney and his cynicism was up front and cheerful. He'd been a Chicago newspaperman straight out of The Front Page and there is a photo of him leaning back in his chair feet propped on the desk a cigar in his mouth his fedora tilted back with a press card in its band. A kind of caricature of a hardboiled reporter almost a cartoon.That for some reason is how many of his war films strike us today  as cartoons rather than reality  and Fixed Bayonets isn't an exception. I know the story is from a novel but it might as well have been a comic book with stereotyped soldiers uttering sentences short enough to fit into dialog balloons above their heads. Don't know why. Fuller was in the First Infantry Division during the war the Big Red One already in his mid30s and he never got over it. Years later when the war was all over when Fuller was safely back home he could tell interviewers that he couldn't even listen to a noise like this and here he'd rap his knuckles lightly against a wooden surface without leaping to his feet. The guy had been through hell. One of his fellow sufferers was nicknamed Griff and there is a character named Griff sometimes unseen in most of his movies.Fixed Bayonets is the story of a platoon picked to provide a rear guard while the rest of the regiment retreats. Their mission is to engage any communists in pursuit and try to convince them that the entire regiment is present at this last ditch stand.The central figure is a lowly corporal Richard Basehart who is both brave and intelligent but who cannot bring himself to kill another man or to order someone else to do it. Three men are above him in the chain of command. You can guess what happens to them.There's nothing much to be said about the performances. The lines being so rudimentary there is hardly any performance to be given. I'll get you back alive Sarge. Hey! Watch it. That's an open wound! Richard Basehart is at least believable as the unfortunate corporal. He's never been a bravura actor and that slight stiff reticence is precisely what the part calls for. He seems to be thinking and thinking doubtful thoughts while he performs the requisite tasks.I don't mean to suggest that the film stinks in any way. Fuller may use stereotypes but he uses different stereotypes from the ones we expect. It's an inyourface report of a handful of men doing a dangerous job requiring skill. No prattling on about why they're fighting. The enemy are simply gooks. And nobody dreamily describes the main street in Basset Nebraska. Nor does some illiterate from Brooklyn tell the story of the goil me met on the Steeplechase at Cony Island. They're all too busy and too scared for that. There are a lot of close ups too of sweaty smudged bearded determined faces. In a way it's primitive moviemaking in the way that Grandma Moses is a primitive painter. The most memorable feature of the movie is its setbound snowbound pseudolocation. There is no wind to speak of and although everyone's feet are in danger of frostbite nobody's breath steams in the supercold air. And yet the rugged snowy set is claustrophobic and as effective in invoking an atmosphere as anything short of a Lawrence of Arabia epic. On a low budget this is about the best you can do and it's pretty good.".

Nor does some illiterate from Brooklyn tell the story of the goil me met on the Steeplechase at Cony Island. They're all too busy and too scared for that. There are a lot of close ups too of sweaty smudged bearded determined faces. In a way it's primitive moviemaking in the way that Grandma Moses is a primitive painter. The most memorable feature of the movie is its setbound snowbound pseudolocation. There is no wind to speak of and although everyone's feet are in danger of frostbite nobody's breath steams in the supercold air. And yet the rugged snowy set is claustrophobic and as effective in invoking an atmosphere as anything short of a Lawrence of Arabia epic. On a low budget this is about the best you can do and it's pretty good.";

The grittiness and confusion of Korea and the cold snow scenes translates through to the viewer. I began to feel the cold dilemma that this film exposes through it's plot. It was fun to see the fine actor Richard Baseheart in a very early role and see you his acting 'chops' are stretched. I didn't know that James Dean was in an uncredited role in this film. I will try to see the film again to catch his role. This film would have made a fine TV show. Also those people who enjoyed TV's Combat series will find this movie very satisfying.

This has the confused and cautious Chinese hold back their armor tanks in reserve for the big breakout. It's when the Red Chinese sniper teams start to pick off the defending GI's that they realize just how weak and undermanned they really are. It's then that the Chinese Reds start to bring in the armor and heavy artillery and that's when things really start getting deadly serious for the US platoon.With the battle hardened Sgt.

Films like Fixed Bayonets The Steel Helmet and Big Red One have a certain relentless quality. They're fast tough blunt feature urgent camera work and screenplays which whittle away the fat and get right down to the point. There's no macho heroism no flag waving no mourning the dead. Instead Fuller cuts through the crap and gets down to simple truths.Indeed Gene Evans who plays Sgt Rock in Fixed Bayonets! and Sgt Zack in The Steel Helmet seems to himself embody Fuller's style. He's simple bearlike gruff angry world weary cynical yet wise and at times warm. He's the product of a postHemmingway era of pulp journalism and springaction typewriters. Fuller's style itself relies more on punchy dialogue the rhythm of words the staccato patter of syllables and the energy of screenplays to create their power. Visuals were almost secondary. Strange then that Fixed Bayonets plot wise at least is so simple. It deals with a group of US soldiers who attempt to hold a mountain pass while the North Korean army advances. Their aim is to convince the enemy that their small 48 man squad is much larger than it really appears. If they succeed they'd have provided enough of a distraction for a 15000 man US regiment to pull out of the area unharassed.This notion of pretending of being more of a man than you really are is Fuller's chief concern. And so throughout the film characters wrestle over not duty but responsibility. How can one little man step up and take on the responsibility for the lives of other men? The rest of the film plays like a tactical handbook on how to hold a secure location. Fuller shows us how to lay mines sucker the enemy in keep your feet safe from frostbite and take down a tank. There's an almost journalistic sort of attention to detail which of course masks the films politics its refusal to approach the broader ethical questions raised by US actions in Korea at the time. 7.910  Plays like one of those pulpy combat comic books printed in the 40s and 50s.".

There's an almost journalistic sort of attention to detail which of course masks the films politics its refusal to approach the broader ethical questions raised by US actions in Korea at the time. 7.910  Plays like one of those pulpy combat comic books printed in the 40s and 50s.";

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the war movies I have ever seen some very good some good some less good and others simply awful and preachy this one together with all his other companions see The Big Red One is simply what one might expect or better should expect from a war movie. I put quotes around war because in reality Fuller's movies of this genre are all but war movies. If you look deeper you will see that they are actually antiwar movies at their best and absolutely not pontifying a message of peace but rather depicting war and the men involved in it as a total chaos a slaughterhouse and a total misery for those who live it. Fuller's movies do not glorify war but rather show the grittiness the dirt the shadows and the deepest darkness that surrounds and envelopes people who are in its midst. There are just a few others in his league such as Peckinpah and John Irvin who managed to send the message home. Yet sadly there are still people glorifying war as a noble expression of human endeavor. Such people never understood a thing about war or simply never served on active duty in order to judge with their own eyes what war is really all about. Usually such people sit comfortably behind a desk in a wonderfully padded armchair or simply on a luscious couch following Baseball or Football events and allow others to do their dirty work for them. Fixed Bayonets! is a crude raw and unforgiving depiction of what common men are put through in a war situation. The Korean War might be just the excuse to do so since every war past present and yes even future brings inexorably pain and death to those who fight it as well as to those who wait back home for a husband and father today also a wife and mother or for a brother sister son or daughter... Samuel Fuller's intention was always to bring reality into the game but evidently his message never got through to some especially not to those hyperthyroideal muscle men who believe that brawns alone will win you a war... In my book this movie together with all other Sam Fuller's work of this kind should a must see in schools everywhere. This would finally teach children what war is really like. But said this I just remember another movie called All quiet on the Western Front in its two incarnations one in 1930 and the other more recent in 1979 which already dealt with the very same argument and what did those movies affect? Nothing. War is still among us. And so is the misery of our human condition. When will humanity listen to people like Fuller Peckinpah Irvin Remarque and many others who lived through war and survived it? Oh sure they are honored now... now that they are dead and cannot do too much harm to the war and death industry but will there ever be someone who will actually manage to put the word The End to war? I seriously doubt it. In my view this movie is simply a must for those who are seriously interested in studying war as a phenomenon not just as a past time.".

I'm in my late 40's and watched multiple times Men In War and Pork Chop Hill because they were always on the TV as I was growing up I'm a Navy Vet who served on the ground behind the wire in Iraq so that is my background and experiences. I had seen The Steel Helmet before and though this is going to sound sacrilegious I was not that satisfied with it. This is an enjoyable war film I liked it more then the Steel Helmet less then Men In War and Pork Chop Hill. I give it the average rating of 7 I don't think it's a masterpiece or that its horrible and 7 of 10 is a good score for a film. I thought the running drama of Basehart not wanting command was extremely dragged out and unnecessary and a lot of the foot soldiers dialog was on the borderline WW2 film stupid. Also like some of the 1 star reviews stated the extreme cold and them constantly getting wet was hard to take. But my biggest criticisms were where is the air cover or where is the North Korean air assets if we didn't have any and why did they leave this small group there for what seems like days? On the positive side the battle scenes at least at first were shockingly good totally above most war movies made up to that point 1951 the first battle scene comes close to All Quiet On The Western Front quality in my book. So I was satisfied watching this film and recommend it to all war film lovers 7 out of 10.BTW a Medal Of Honor recipient Raymond Harvey was the technical adviser on this film his bio is interesting I wish they would just make films based on their actions alone and leave out the silly melodrama but in 1951 I guess it was still necessary. Also if it has not been mentioned by others supposedly this is James Dean's first movie people have posted the specific part on youtube I watched the whole film and never spotted him even though he has dialog see if you can find him!".

	schema:reviewBody "Fixed Bayonets! 1951 12 out of 4 Well made Korean war film shares some similarities with Fuller's THE STEEL HELMET released the same year. In this film a group of American soldiers get held up along a mountain pass where they must try and stop advancing Korean soldiers. The main goal is to be smart and try to make the Koreans think they have a large group of people when in reality there's only fortyeight. This isn't the greatest war film ever made and I'd put it a few notches behind THE STEEL HELMET but fans of Fuller will still want to check this out as his style is all over this thing. I think the greatest thing about the film is certainly the direction as Fuller really makes a great atmosphere and a very claustrophobic one at that. The men are constantly being shown one on top of the other and the tight cinematography really makes you feel as if you're sitting along side the men and after a while you really begin to feel things getting tighter and tighter as the suspense builds up. One of the best sequences in the film is when a land mine buried in the snow traps one of the men and another soldier must walk to him never knowing when he might step on one of the mines. This entire sequence is full of great suspense and it's doubtful you'll forget it once you see it. The cast includes good performances from Richard Basehart Gene Evans and Michael O'Shea as well as a very brief appearance from an uncredited James Dean. I think the film's one major flaw is that some of the dialogue is extremely weak and many of the dialogue sequences just aren't strong enough to stand up to the action sequences. I think there were way too many short sentences and in the long run the dialogue just wasn't strong enough to carry the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Too much of this Korean war drama is a carryover from standard WWII fare the wise cracks where there should be sweaty fear the platoon made up of humorous ethnic types the rapid shift from bloody death to upbeat banter. That's not to say that maverick film maker Fuller doesn't make an effort at combat realism probably as much as the studio would allow. There's the extra bullets ripping into O'Shea as he lies mortally wounded or the emotional expletives as close to real profanity as censorship would permit or the frostbite circle as an example of the wintry hazards of the Manchurian border. Clearly Fuller's aim is to show as much of combat from the infantryman's point of view as he can.Note also how the focus is almost exclusively on the enlisted men the grunts. That strikes me as pure Fuller. Notice how the lowly rank of corporal is celebrated even more than that of Evan's sergeant or the kid lieutenant who is killed off early. And though the big brass are presented favorably at the beginning it's the dogfaces that have to carry out the perilous mission. In the perpetual conflict between officers and enlisted men Fuller is on the side of the grunts.The studio certainly built an elaborate set for all the action. It's one of the more impressive of the period and allows Fuller a lot of unhampered camera movement to film the continuous action. However this expense likely limited the filmmaker in portraying what might be offputting to an audience about combat after all that extra expense must be retrieved. On the other hand the minefield gauntlet amounts to the movie's suspenseful centerpiece and I remember as a kid holding my breath the entire time. There's some good characterization from Basehart and Evans but Homeier's implausibly learned 20year old comes across as a misguided stab at the offbeat. Note too how these WWII Korean War stock characters give way to entirely different movie types during the Vietnam period. Audiences of a Platoon or a Full Metal jacket would no longer accept the subtle romanticism that underlies films such as Fixed Bayonets. Fear and fatigue two overriding realities of combat had become too tangible to TV news viewers to any longer be softpedaled by combat films. My point here is not to rundown this movie in particular. As war films of the postwar period go it's a pretty good one. Nonetheless for all of Fuller's maverick intentions Fixed Bayonets shows that he could not get beyond the studio TwentiethCentury Fox limitations of the time. And in that important cultural sense the movie shows as much about its time period as it does about war itself.".

	onyx:emotionText "Too much of this Korean war drama is a carryover from standard WWII fare the wise cracks where there should be sweaty fear the platoon made up of humorous ethnic types the rapid shift from bloody death to upbeat banter. That's not to say that maverick film maker Fuller doesn't make an effort at combat realism probably as much as the studio would allow. There's the extra bullets ripping into O'Shea as he lies mortally wounded or the emotional expletives as close to real profanity as censorship would permit or the frostbite circle as an example of the wintry hazards of the Manchurian border. Clearly Fuller's aim is to show as much of combat from the infantryman's point of view as he can.Note also how the focus is almost exclusively on the enlisted men the grunts. That strikes me as pure Fuller. Notice how the lowly rank of corporal is celebrated even more than that of Evan's sergeant or the kid lieutenant who is killed off early. And though the big brass are presented favorably at the beginning it's the dogfaces that have to carry out the perilous mission. In the perpetual conflict between officers and enlisted men Fuller is on the side of the grunts.The studio certainly built an elaborate set for all the action. It's one of the more impressive of the period and allows Fuller a lot of unhampered camera movement to film the continuous action. However this expense likely limited the filmmaker in portraying what might be offputting to an audience about combat after all that extra expense must be retrieved. On the other hand the minefield gauntlet amounts to the movie's suspenseful centerpiece and I remember as a kid holding my breath the entire time. There's some good characterization from Basehart and Evans but Homeier's implausibly learned 20year old comes across as a misguided stab at the offbeat. Note too how these WWII Korean War stock characters give way to entirely different movie types during the Vietnam period. Audiences of a Platoon or a Full Metal jacket would no longer accept the subtle romanticism that underlies films such as Fixed Bayonets. Fear and fatigue two overriding realities of combat had become too tangible to TV news viewers to any longer be softpedaled by combat films. My point here is not to rundown this movie in particular. As war films of the postwar period go it's a pretty good one. Nonetheless for all of Fuller's maverick intentions Fixed Bayonets shows that he could not get beyond the studio TwentiethCentury Fox limitations of the time. And in that important cultural sense the movie shows as much about its time period as it does about war itself.";

If you really want to enjoy this movie please leave all of your expectations somewhere and watch it with a clear mind. You'll see that there is a lot to like in this Korean fantasy flick.To make the picture more clear I have to make some comparisons. First of all this movie is not better than Shadowless Sword in action or swordplay department. There are some nice CGI filled fight scenes but as I said before there is not as much as action as in Shadowless Sword.This movie is mostly a romantic fantasy movie with some swordplay thrown in. The sets are awesome and all the effects costumes everything looks beautiful except two things 1The main hero's hair. I really wanted to enter the screen and give him a more charismatic hairstyle 2Main actress expression. I wonder why she looked so scared like there is a monster or a ghost looking at her. That really ruined most of the film for me.To sum everything up I have to say few things 1There is less fights and action than Shadowless Sword 2There is more romance and sadness than Bichunmoo 3Effects are the best I have ever seen in these kind of Korean movies 4I would recommend you to watch this movie if you liked Shadowless SwordBichunmoo and The Legend of the Evil Lake 5Koreans must make this type of fantasy swordplay movies more often. I really prefer their ones over Chinese fantasy swordplay films".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not gonna be a long and well written review I'm sorry. But i will tell you why I loved it and why you might love it. First of I love these Asian fantasy movies for many reasons. They are mostly set in a world unheard of in other places and the story something very different than any Hollywood movie. Before seeing the movie I actually came across the soundtrack made by Shiro Sagisu. Who also made the music for Casshern. And I came to the conclusion that it was the best soundtrack made by his hands. Then came the chance to see the movie. And i hadn't seen much from it before except a couple of trailers. And with it being in Korean and with no subs i only got the standard plot. Hero loves woman. Woman is in trouble. Evil man makes threats. Hero saves the day?But after 20 minutes I was already gladly surprised of the plot. Something I had not seen before. And I'm not gonna tell you what it was since i think the surprise makes the movie even better. The movie is filled with amazing scenery and visuals that couldn't be much better. It's not over packed with fights. But the fights there do count.There is a bit of flyingfloating martial arts as in almost every classic Kung fu movie. And even though i don't care much for that it did seam to fit the movie. Will it fall in your taste?Have you seen Casshern or Goemon? If so and they pleased you. I don't see why you should not at least enjoy it if not love it as i did. It has very similar elements and feeling to it. still not as dark as Casshern.I would have given this movie a 1010 but went with 910 for two reasons. 1. That given it a max will feel a bit to clich and would make people expect it to be polished with gold. 2. One of the main characters The damsel in distress was kinda annoying at times and looked like she was gonna cry every second. But then again its all about the cruelty and emotion they try to express in these movies. pewww!. . . Sorry it got a bit longer than i had planed. Hope you forgive me for the bad grammar and enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it. Have fun.".

Better yet its really romantic as the notion of I will remember you forever is put to the test. And it raises the question of are we our memories or are they simply the source of all our pain...and joy? There are times when this film just soars with emotion and ideas. Will you love some one forever for real? The film looks great. The world of MidHeaven is lush and magically alive. The action sequences which do rely on CGI and wire work are impressive no matter how you slice them. I particularly liked the battle on the ropes holding up the lanterns which shouldn't work for any number of reasons but manages to actually be something special. Only the final battle to the bad guy a bit too CGI with the vast armies clearly make believe.I really liked this film a great deal. I don't know if its one of the best some of the plotting is unclear or takes an odd turn but for the most part its a solid two hours enjoyment and entertainment.8 out of 10.".

There's also a love story as well which involves multiple characters.Although the story premise was unique the execution and acting left much to be desired. Particular poor was that of the main female role of Sohwa with her intermittent crosseyed facial expression that really distracted from her portrayal of a higher being. On the other hand the male main character was quite pleasant on the eye and aside from some annoying hair style was actually quite goo.The actionfighting sequences were very ordinary compared to HERO and Matrix which are my fantasy movie action standards and the CGI backgrounds used were quite obvious aside from one initial shot of the midheaven temples. Particularly cheesy was the fight in the woods involving various piercing chains that shot out of the antagonist's body... certainly lacking the graceful flight through the woods that one imagined in Crouching Tiger. Towards the end you'll notice quite a resemblance to the LOTR3 and when Frodo approaches Mt Doom. Overall a disappointing movie.".

Thank goodness I got a hold of the MV Wheesung's 'The Cresent Moon' which totally blew my mind but it only made me itch even more for the actual film. So when I finally got my hands on it this past May 18th I almost had an orgasm when I slid the disc into the player. But little did I know that would be the only excitement. So what happened? How did something with a strong plot quasipurgatoryheaven I mean who isn't curious?! stunning special effects strong actors and performersJunho Yeo KwangIl Kim WooSung Jung and awesome soundtrack go awry? Well first of all this should have been at least 165 minutes long instead of compressing everything into 105 minutes. While YiGwak's love for SonHwaYonHwa is understandable the fervordedication portrayed by Jung could have been better conveyed if viewers actually saw more of the lovers before she was executed. Then there's the precious stone SonHwa kept to save Jungcheon while a clearer explanation is not necessary perhaps a longer one would do. Viewers might find themselves wondering in the midst of the Chunyoungdae's hunt for her why they wanted the stone in the first place. Then the ending felt abrupt and mishandled. I don't want to reveal too much but for me it was as though everything was for nothing. I will say however that the visuals in this move are captivating. I will say that most of the cast did a great job. I just wished the movie had made me care more about what would happen to the characters next. Because I didn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie should have had SO much going for it. A top rated if somewhat revisionistic director whose first big effort in the west Elizabeth certainly made me look up and take notice. A pair of strong male leads whose work in films like American Beauty and The Knights Tale certainly wasn't shabby. Superb production values. And some research certainly went into it as shown by the introduction which references Sir Henry Newbolt's famous poem of Victorian and Edwardian youth and manhood going into battle as if they were going to a football match.Then as they say in the Victorian army 'it all went 'orribly wrong'.SOME SPOILERS BELOW The history behind this director's chosen period  the first Gordon relief expedition  certainly has more than enough adventure and drama to it particularly when one considers that not only does Newbolt immortalize it in Vitai Lampada but so does Kipling with his 'Fuzzy Wuzzy' who indeed did nearly break the legendary British squares at the battles of Abu Klea and Tamai.Someone however needs to explain to this director what a SQUARE FORMATION is and what it does. This is more than just a military nerd's nitpicking it is  and one sees this at the party scene toward the start  a KEY ELEMENT in the narrative. The officers of the Royal Cumbrians 'form square' to create a nice little romantic space for the romantic leads but what's never explained  probably because the director doesn't get it  is that a square formation is key against both cavalry as at Waterloo and native warriors as at Ulundi and the Sudan because A SQUARE CANNOT BE FLANKED. You cannot 'get behind' a square and stab the hapless infantryman in the back because another face of the square is guarding the back. As such this formation outdated on European battlefields where longrange rifle fire and more accurate cannons could mangle these squares at range was key for fighting less technologically advanced or cavalry heavy enemies.Now a square is ridiculously vulnerable to fire  logically a shot that hits one guy at one face of the square will hit someone on the opposite face. Infantry cannot stand in square for long as ranged fire will cut them down until there are too few men standing to maintain the formation. Thus the next thing that the director doesn't get comes into play  COMBINED ARMS. A square can stand IF it has artillery  sometimes outside as at Waterloo sometimes at the corners as at Ulundi and the Sudan to shoot up attackers at range. And the British infantry had a wonderful new piece of artillery with them in the Sudan  the Machine Gun. When speaking of the colonial wars one British politico remarked Whatever happens we've got the Maxim gun and they don't.Problem is after referencing the Newbolt poem the director FORGETS the central stanza with its reference to 'The Gatling's Jammed and the Colonel's Dead'. This was one reason why the Brit squares were nearly broken on occasion by the fanatical Dervishes  the machine guns would sometimes jam if fired too fast or if it got too hot or sand got into the mechanism etc.Toward the end of the battle the surviving British officer orders the soldiers to break formation and retreat. This totally ruined it for me. NO British officer in their right mind would be so stupid  sheer logic dictates that one REMAIN in formation as long as possible as a retreat every man for himself would lead to the utter destruction of the unit. Even the surrounded British companys at Isandhlwana fought back to back until they were utterly overwhelmed. By rights the entire regiment should have been eliminated to a man.Well that's the military side of things.The actors are way too politically correct. Like it or not Victorians WERE racist in their attitudes to 'lesser breeds without the law' and no British officer would have hesitated to shoot a man who fired on his troops  the sharpshooter would have been shot down like a dog without a second thought. No explanation is really given for the political situation and one gets the impression that these are transplanted American GI's in Fallujah trying to win hearts and minds rather than British redcoats in the Sudan.The speech of Durrance at the end was ludicrous and long and given the lack of emotion throughout the movie never had a snowball's chance in hell of stirring up emotion for the man on the right or left.The editing was choppy  particularly toward the end when the couple are walking out of the barracks. The soldiers drilling in the background jumpcut all over the place.The film for all the redcoats and 'jolly good old boy' accents NEVER invokes the Victorian era in manners or morals. The director just does NOT get the heart of the film that at this time courage honour and all those things which we consider effete and stupid today were actually cherished  at least until the carnage of WW1 showed them to be idols with feet of clay.SPOILERS END HERE.As a film it's overblown revisionist and Kate Hudson is horribly miscast. There are many fine British and Commonwealth actresses  why Kate? Just because Almost Famous made her flavour of the month? This film was about as Victorian as Shanghai Knights. No Gunga Din Zulu or Man Who Would Be King this one. Spare yourself the agony and expense and watch one of the above three instead of this rotten egg of a picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "The newest rendition of the Four Feathers is a real epic aesthetically beautiful sweeping completely refreshing in terms of emotional presentation and scope for both characters and audience. This is one of the best of this year in terms of mainstream film.The beginning drags and the editing is confusing at times the lighting is dark and it has a rich as in dense atmosphere to it that can make it seem unnecessarily claustrophobic at times yet which helps during certain scenes don't want to give anything away. In fact the first 13 of the movie is a plum bore. But as soon as Harry goes off following some enemy spies the movie flows beautifully. It becomes quite the rousing adventure with lots of fairly disgusting dead bodies and their missing parts all over the place surprising for a PG13 flick and the sole battle scene is one of the better ones I've ever seen because it creates uncliched emotion and it's very effective in creating a seemingly helpless situation with great battle choreography to boot. In a movie that has quite a few flaws it does something really well develops supporting characters other than Wes Bentley. The 4 different comrades of Harry's plus Adu Hounsou's character have faces and lives and are important to the flow of the story though they seem fairly unimportant till it matters again don't want to give anything away when something happens to them you want to know and care about what will become of them. It was refreshing to actually know the fellow soldiers in a war movie for once! And it helps add to the great emotional impact this movie has. The acting is OK. There are no bad performances bad accents to be sure but Heath Ledger ceases to be his heartthrob self and eventually turns into the character somewhere between the chapped lips and matted hair I suppose and provides a steady and trustworthy lead performance. Hudson I think is too big for her role though she and Bentley both provided again well done and steady roles. Djimon Hounsou is really the standout. Other than technical aspects I don't think it'll get any nods except maybe for Hounsou who is exceptional in the film. I think that this is a very good film that boasts great cinematography authentic and realistic costumes and excellent production design and for me a great emotional punch plus a captivating adventure story. It's definitely not a teen flick or chick flick it's too gruesome and historical for either faction. And unlike other better systematically made films I've seen this year it didn't feel canned too unoriginal or overly pretentious it felt fresh. I think this suffered the fate of fairly bad advertising and early press and not living up to the expectation of Elizabeth but I'm glad I saw it because I really did enjoy it a lot. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film had so many things going for it despite the odds. In the end it was the odds that pulled it down. The film was well made and though I wasn't too impressed with Elizabeth I think Shekhar Kapur did an admirable job under very pressurised situations constantly visited by worried producers directing a film whose script isn't finished yet the rigours of the desert as well as the daunting aspect of directing 1000 extras which few films nowadays have with the advent of CGI replicating. The cinematography was wonderful seriously on par with The English Patient though in a different way  in its way. The score  what can I say about it except that I've almost worn out the score soundtrack CD by James Horner due to the unique Qawwali wailings combined with a heartbreaking and tender piano theme. Heath Ledger Kate Hudson and Wes Bentley all nonBrits did an admirable job handling the accents and still managing to come out with dramatic performances. I don't get it  why did nonBrits accuse them of not having perfect accents? I don't know whether they have perfect accents but they certainly sounded British. Some people said they were stiff. I don't see how that could be a complaint for a movie set in Victorian Britain. The script was not bad  nothing negative should be said about it.Now here is where the theatrical release of the film faltered  the editing. The original cut was three hours long a release which apparently Miramax boss approved of. Somehow 911 got in the way due to the anticolonialist stance of the movie. Also studios generally dislike 3hour releases. Kapur was flung back into the editing room to chop it down to 2 hours. Which he did. And many people complained that the movie was incoherent that there were jumps. And this is why. Spoilers till end of paragraph. I think the scene where Ethne's feather was presented to Harry may have been filmed but was cut causing some people to lament the loss of a dramatic moment. Also many people couldn't understand the motives behind Harry's actions first leaving the army then going after his friends. I believe the editing had a lot to do with that.In other words everything about the movie was good right up to before it was to be edited to 2 hours. Some people might complain it was boring  they deserve to watch films like The Matrix and that's it  that's all they deserved. Some people kept saying that the previous versions were better. Maybe that's true for the older folks but for me and I believe for most of the younger generations it is difficult for us to watch films made decades ago due to the different style and pacing of different eras. The older generation may watch films such as Chicago and lament the advent of the MTV generation whereas people like me would watch Casablanca and find it wideopenmouthshocked to be ranked 2nd on the AFI 100 Films. So I believe there is nothing wrong with the remaking of The Four Feathers  it is making a period film using today's kind of epic filmmaking style. You can see how the colours are so rich how the battle scenes are filmed in ways more sophisticated than a 1939 film can.Also poor marketing has failed this movie causing it to earn only 14 of its budget on the domestic market. On the other hand I did noticed that negative critics tend to be American. Some people actually thought of it as swashbuckling adventure. It is not  while Harry may do things that seem impossible realistically it works fine in a film which also aims to make people feel rather than just watch. There is enough realism that it doesn't look stupid. Apparently Americans disagree  one viewer reported laughing in the cinemas ... and it isn't the part where the Englishman is laughing.The DVD version has been released in the US. It is the Special Collectors' Edition but it remains the same 2hour flawed movie. I charge that Miramax release a 3hour Director's Cut edition of the movie in its DVD release overseas. The film deserves at least that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1939 version of The Four Feathers remains one of the best movies ever made even 70 years on from its release. It seems strange that this particular story should see cinematic light once again in 2002  grand colonial adventures of this kind don't seem to get made very often these days. Having said that a director as innovative as Shekhar Kapur of Bandit Queen and Elizabeth should ensure the film has the potential to approach its ofttold story from a few fresh angles. Kapur's slant on the story is visually breathtaking and has by far the most realistic battle sequences of any version made so far. But it also feels excessively studied and serious at times with an occasionally unclear narrative and too many international actors trying only partially successfully to pull off upper class English accents. The end product is still a good film but you can sense that somewhere inside there's an outstanding film trying to get out.Men of the Royal Cumbrian regiment are told that they will be heading off to the Sudan to fight the armies of the Mahdi a selfproclaimed religious leader whose disciples have slaughtered many British soldiers. The men of the regiment seem thrilled at the opportunity to go to war but one soldier named Harry Faversham Heath Ledger finds himself questioning whether or not he feels passionately enough about Queen and country to give his life in their name. On the eve of departure Harry resigns his commission much to the anger of his friends and family. Three of his closest friends  Willoughby Rupert PenryJones Castleton Kris Marshall and Trench Michael Sheen  are so offended that they send him three white feathers as a symbol of his cowardice. A fourth feather is later added by his fiance Ethne Kate Hudson who breaks off her relationship with him. Ironically the person with the greatest right to feel disgust towards Harry  his best friend Jack Durrance Wes Bentley  is the only one who doesn't send a feather of cowardice. Harry soon begins to feel personal shame for his actions so he sails to the Sudan and disguises himself as a Sudanese fighter blending in amongst the Mahdi's army at tremendous personal risk. He performs acts of incredible heroism and saves several of his former friends' lives. In returning the feathers to each of them in turn he restores honour to his name.The book of The Four Feathers is a story which has been continually in print for a hundred years. Books which retain their popularity for that kind of time are invariably good solid stories which somehow strike a chord with audiences and become part of a wider literary heritage. It is to this film's credit that it sticks to the original quite closely fashioning a tale that explores lots of fundamental themes such as personal honour rebuilding broken trust believing in a cause and finding unexpected courage within. Anyone can relate to these ideas and The Four Feathers taps into them effectively and presents us with a story which has us asking ourselves what we would do in Harry's position or indeed in Ethne or Jack's position. While it never really matches the 1939 version  which was cast acted paced and scripted virtually to perfection  Shekhar Kapur's remake remains a worthwhile rerun of the ofttold material.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been a fan of historically inspired epic movies and although I'm not a fan of costume drama's I don't really care about the time period these movies are set in. This one has been set at the end of the 19th century a time period that comes close to the one that I like most in the movies 19141950 but even movies set in medieval Greek and Roman times I can enjoy...As I already said this movie has been set at the end of the 19th century in 1898 to be more precise. When a British officer is about to be sent to Sudan to fight a war he doesn't approve of he is seen as a coward. He has to resign his post right before his regiment ships out to battle the rebels and to make things even worse for him he receives four white feathers from his friends and his fiance. These feathers symbolize how they feel about him they see him as a coward but what they don't know is that he plans to go to Sudan anyway undercover so he can save his friends from a certain death and redeem his honor...The story certainly is interesting and offers an interesting approach to a story that has been told many times before. But what I liked even more than the story was the photography. Everything was portrayed in a very nice way especially when they are in Sudan. I'm not saying that the part of the movie showing England isn't any good but I'm not too much a fan of those Victorian costumes and habits. I prefer the dust and dirt from the desert and the battles in which good manors only come later and the true human nature gets the upper hand.Even though many people seem to hate this movie I can't join them in their opinion. All actors did a nice job and even though it is perhaps true that they could have found a better actress than Kate Hudson to play the role of Ethne it never bothered me in such a way that it spoiled all the rest of my fun. And about the historical accuracy I can be brief as well. It looked good enough to me to be believable. Perhaps there were some minor details that weren't right but since I'm not too familiar with the time period shown in this movie I certainly didn't notice them. Anyway I liked what I saw and even though many people gave it a bad review I certainly liked it for what it was A very decent movie about honor freedom friendship... I know that these words are too often abused in many Hollywood movies but this time it worked for me and that's why I give this movie a 7.510.".

Mason sometimes referred to as the poor man's Rudyard Kipling would rollover in his grave if he saw what a shambles Indianborn as in India director Shekhar Kapur of Elizabeth has made of his classic war novel about camaraderie cowardice and second chances. For the record Hollywood produced The Four Feathers for the first time in 1915 and the second time in 1921. American director Merian C. Cooper of King Kong fame came along and made it the third time in 1929 with Fay Wray and Richard Arlen in 1929 and British director Zoltan Korda did the best known version in color in 1939 the fourth time if you're counting with Ralph Richardson. Weirdly enough Korda remade The Four Feathers under a different title in 1955 called Storm Over the Nile with Anthony Steel James Robertson Justice Ian Carmichael Ronald Lewis Michael Hordern. In 1977 Don Sharp made the fifth version as an NBCTV television movie with Beau Bridges Robert Powell Simon Ward and Jane Seymour. Since then this durable adventure about the imperial British Army in African has emerged as a perennial favorite with filmmakers. So far they have remade it seven times six times on screen and once for television. As the seventh remake Kapur's version of The Four Feathers seems more plucked than profound more improbable than possible and more jingoistically oldfashioned than fashionable. Watch the Charlton Heston blockbuster Khartoum 1966 for an historical frame of reference.Indeed Horse Feathers might have been a title more befitting this sprawling but shallow spectacle about the British Empire in its heyday. Nevertheless The Four Feathers looks pictorially gorgeous on the bigscreen with its grandscale battles and its savage Moroccan scenery. Unfortunately this swashbuckling costumer lacks the guts of its glorious predecessors. Wishywashy characters preposterous plotting and Kapur's uneven storytelling plucks this rendition of The Four Feathers. Essentially The Four Feathers chronicles the rise fall and redemption of VictorianEra British Army officer Harry Faversham Australian heartthrob Heath Ledger of Monster's Ball who resigns his commission when he learns the Queen Mum plans to ship the Royal Cumbrian Regiment off to the Sudan to combat revolting Arab tribesmen. I sometimes wonder Faversham comments in halfhearted protest what a godforsaken desert in the middle of nowhere has to do with her majesty the queen.Not only does Faversham's decision infuriate his dad a proud British Army General Faversham Tim PigottSmith of Gangs of New York who disowns him but it also galls Harry's longtime comradesatarms William Trench Michael Sheen of Blood Diamond Tom Willoughby Rupert PenryJones of Charlotte Gray and Edward Castelton Kris Marshall of Love Actually and his distraught fiance Ethne Kate Hudson of Almost Famous. Each sends him a white feather a symbol of cowardice in English circles. Only Harry's closest friend Jack Durrance Wes Bentley of American Beauty refuses to give him a feather. Anyway the British Army lands in the Sudan while Harry wallows in misery. When he learns his pals have gotten themselves captured our psychic protagonist storms off to save them masquerading as an unconvincing Lone RangerRambo nomad. During his journey of hardship Harry befriends About Fatma scenestealing Djimon Hounsou of Gladiator a destinybound Last of the Mohicans style native mercenary who becomes his guide and sidekick.Scenarist Michael Schiffer of The Peacemaker and Hossein Amimi of Jude have trivialized this timeless tale of testosterone. First they have changed Mason's hero's name from Faversham to Feversham. Second they refuse to explain why our hero chickens out. Is he a coward? Or an idealist? Basically The Four Feathers recycles every clich you have ever seen in a cavalry versus the Indians western with Redcoats replacing bluecoats and Islamics instead of Apaches. Actually the British wore grey coats not redcoats. If you want to see the best version of The Four Feathers catch the 1939 Technicolor version and skip this harmless but halfbaked hokum.".

The audience only sees about 50 percent of the total story in each scene. Had the movie been about 4 hours long it would have my high recommendation.

Should she have not had the fortitude and insight to find a situation with another caring human being albeit this other human was white?

	schema:reviewBody "Imitation of Life The New Universal 1934 directed by John M. Stahl is the first and best screen adaptation to Fannie Hurst's celebrated novel yet underrated and seldom revived. It's a well written and developed character study about two mothers one white the other black who bond a lasting friendship throughout the years while their daughters both friends try to face the facts of life with one in particular having problems with her imitation of life. The story begins with Beatrice Pullman Claudette Colbert a recently widowed mother giving her tottler Jessie played by Baby Jane who became better known later Juanita Quigley a bath while the child is asking for her quack quack a toy duck. After dressing her up Bea comes downstairs to answer the call of the doorbell where Delilah Johnson Louise Beavers a black woman comes to inquire about the location of a street where she hopes for possible employment. After being told that she is on the wrong side of town Delilah seeing that Bea has enough work on her own with her own little girl asks if she could work as her housekeeper. Finding that little Jessie and Delilah's lightskinned daughter Peola Sabie Hendricks would be good companions for one another Bea decides to take Delilah's offer. Later Bea purchases a store on the boardwalk where she decides to open up an diner where she specializes in pancakes with the use Delilah's secret pancake recipe. While the mothers struggle to success eventually moving into a comfortable household their daughters become eduated in private schools and mature to young women. With success comes problems Bea meets and falls in love with Steven Archer Warren William but their relationship is complicated when Bea's 18yearold daughter Rochelle Hudson falls in love with him also and Delilah's grownup daughter Peola Fredi Washington becomes resentful of the world of segregation denying both her heritage and mother while trying to pass as a white girl thus breaking her mother's heart.Overly sentimental drama about mother love to be sure but this version of Imitation of Life succeeds in many ways. Besides Claudette Colbert's sincere performance and a wonderful underscoring by Heinz Roemheld there is Louise Beavers being given a rare opportunity to carry on the entire story in a major motion picture. Sadly the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress hadn't come into effect yet otherwise Beavers would have gotten that honor for at least a nomination. A presentation of such a movie in 1934 was for its time quite a risk but fortunately it didn't go unnoticed. Imitation of Life did get the honor of a Best Picture nomination losing to Colbert's other 1934 release It Happened One Night a comedy.Universal remade Imitation of Life in 1959 starring Lana Turner John Gavin Sandra Dee Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner in the Colbert William Hudson Beavers and Washington roles. Aside from it being a glamorized version produced in lavish Technicolor with the story brought up to date it became one of the highest grossing movie of that year and today ranks one of the most revived tearjerking dramas on television. There were alterations made of course such as changing central character of Bea Pullman a Jewish woman to whatever she wants to be in the name of Lora Meredith the exclusion of the pancake queen business woman to the rise of a Broadway actress and transforming the central character's black business partner into the actress's housekeeper and companion. The subordinate story and sentiment remains the same especially the climax. The only problem with the remake that makes the original appear more honest is the use of Susan Kohner a white actress who gave an fine performance playing a lightskin colored girl instead of the use of an actual lightskinned black actress thus ruining the whole purpose to the story.To see Imitation of Life of 1934 is to accept it for what it really is a 1930s soap opera about mother love. However its revival has become a rarity today possibly because of Louise Beavers being presented on screen as a stereotyped colored mammy but fortunately not to the extreme. But at the same time Colbert's character looks and cares for her as an equal and even becomes very concerned about her when her troubled daughter Peola denies her. Fredi Washington should not go unmentioned in her worthy performance as Peola. Little is known of her except that it's been said that she later became one of the founders of the Negro Actors' Guild in 1937 acting as executive secretary. Also featured in the cast are Ned Sparks as Elmer Smith Alan Hale Marilyn Knowlden Franklin Pangborn appearing briefly as one of Bea's party guests and Marcia Mae Jones recognizable as one of the school students in the early portion of the story. Warren William on loan from Warner Brothers playing Steve Archer gives his usual high standard performance of sophistication. Imitation of Life which runs almost two hours in length was first presented on American Movie Classics for a while from 1990 to 91 and made its Turner Classic Movies premiere October 26 2001. This and the Lana Turner remake are both available to compare in video andor DVD rentals. ".

	onyx:emotionText "Imitation of Life The New Universal 1934 directed by John M. Stahl is the first and best screen adaptation to Fannie Hurst's celebrated novel yet underrated and seldom revived. It's a well written and developed character study about two mothers one white the other black who bond a lasting friendship throughout the years while their daughters both friends try to face the facts of life with one in particular having problems with her imitation of life. The story begins with Beatrice Pullman Claudette Colbert a recently widowed mother giving her tottler Jessie played by Baby Jane who became better known later Juanita Quigley a bath while the child is asking for her quack quack a toy duck. After dressing her up Bea comes downstairs to answer the call of the doorbell where Delilah Johnson Louise Beavers a black woman comes to inquire about the location of a street where she hopes for possible employment. After being told that she is on the wrong side of town Delilah seeing that Bea has enough work on her own with her own little girl asks if she could work as her housekeeper. Finding that little Jessie and Delilah's lightskinned daughter Peola Sabie Hendricks would be good companions for one another Bea decides to take Delilah's offer. Later Bea purchases a store on the boardwalk where she decides to open up an diner where she specializes in pancakes with the use Delilah's secret pancake recipe. While the mothers struggle to success eventually moving into a comfortable household their daughters become eduated in private schools and mature to young women. With success comes problems Bea meets and falls in love with Steven Archer Warren William but their relationship is complicated when Bea's 18yearold daughter Rochelle Hudson falls in love with him also and Delilah's grownup daughter Peola Fredi Washington becomes resentful of the world of segregation denying both her heritage and mother while trying to pass as a white girl thus breaking her mother's heart.Overly sentimental drama about mother love to be sure but this version of Imitation of Life succeeds in many ways. Besides Claudette Colbert's sincere performance and a wonderful underscoring by Heinz Roemheld there is Louise Beavers being given a rare opportunity to carry on the entire story in a major motion picture. Sadly the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress hadn't come into effect yet otherwise Beavers would have gotten that honor for at least a nomination. A presentation of such a movie in 1934 was for its time quite a risk but fortunately it didn't go unnoticed. Imitation of Life did get the honor of a Best Picture nomination losing to Colbert's other 1934 release It Happened One Night a comedy.Universal remade Imitation of Life in 1959 starring Lana Turner John Gavin Sandra Dee Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner in the Colbert William Hudson Beavers and Washington roles. Aside from it being a glamorized version produced in lavish Technicolor with the story brought up to date it became one of the highest grossing movie of that year and today ranks one of the most revived tearjerking dramas on television. There were alterations made of course such as changing central character of Bea Pullman a Jewish woman to whatever she wants to be in the name of Lora Meredith the exclusion of the pancake queen business woman to the rise of a Broadway actress and transforming the central character's black business partner into the actress's housekeeper and companion. The subordinate story and sentiment remains the same especially the climax. The only problem with the remake that makes the original appear more honest is the use of Susan Kohner a white actress who gave an fine performance playing a lightskin colored girl instead of the use of an actual lightskinned black actress thus ruining the whole purpose to the story.To see Imitation of Life of 1934 is to accept it for what it really is a 1930s soap opera about mother love.

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get down to it! Here's Hollywood's best preWWII effort to portray not only whiteblack racism but its subtleties. I doubt many women shared the caring relationship of Bea and Delilah. What offends some I strikes me as honest. For the one or two absurd moments e.g. the faithful mourning Negro servants in the youknowwhat scene many more are deft and moving. The lavish 1959 version cannot compare. Love Lana Turner but she and Juanita Moore are wooden and embarrassing in the remake it's worth seeing for Mahalia Jackson and of course Susan Kohner's scenes at the cocktail party and getting beaten in the back alley. Susan's scenes are so showy that they kill any hope of honesty which was never in the script to begin with!At the beginning of this version do you remember Delilah's response when Bea asks why she hadn't taken the streetcar? Racism is accepted as a given the characters cast their lot from there. Both women have seen tragedy and The Depression looms. In this crucial aspect Bea and Delilah are equals. But to get anywhere with such a touchy gambit the lead performances had better be good. Louise Beavers is mesmerizing. I cannot say she gives the best performance I've seen on the silver screen but it's hard for me to name a more focused one. It is easy to dismiss her lines as demeaning or simpleminded. With each viewing I see a woman whose circumstance and inner strength enables her to look beyond the mortal sorrows of this life. Doesn't she ring a bell especially if you grew up black in the South? She was so many of our mothers aunts and grandmothers. Ms. Beavers nails it.In this plot she's more She is a a mystic whose spirituality not only complements but critiques Bea's getahead pragmatism. Prefeminist themes ricochet in this picture successfully I think.I'm gonna get slammed for my only significant reservation I don't feel Fredi Washington's performance. She's more than adequate but in no league with Louise Beavers or Claudette Colbert. From all that I have read and heard about her I conclude that Ms. Washington let her own good taste get the best of her. She seems to underplay on purpose to evoke a smoldering quality of rage. If I am correct I appreciate her instincts but they cannot work over every scene she has in this potboiler plot.Nothing about this movie is weak. Even the few headslapping moments are so sincere that they come off as camp at worst. Frankly I'm not sure I could otherwise bear Louise Beavers' last scene. Notice that her face is almost immobile a single glycerin tear rolls down her cheek her final wrenching line reading is actually disembodied offcamera a master stroke of direction. This folks is the killer scene for me  not the histrionics at the hearse which grabbed me mainly inasmuch as they showed an unqualified moment of dignity in black America rare for 30's Hollywood. Note the sympathetic white mourners who have a line or two...Claudette Colbert is radiant as previous posters have said. Her performance is less memorable than Ms. Beavers' yet she hits the bull'seye. Bea is warm but just distant enough to put across a real woman of her time a white one who can never hope to understand black folks or the many contradictions of her relationship to them. In her best moments which are without dialogue Colbert conveys this delicate point. Anyway...Bea has her own slutty daughter to worry about right? It was said that Ms. Colbert had the best figure on the Paramount lot  not lost on Universal which dressed her to the nines in scene after scene. It's hard to believe Colbert was barely 30 at the time. She looks no older but acts as if she were going on a hard 50. And what a year for her! She won the Oscar for It Happened One Night and also scored this second huge hit which artistically speaking is hardly chopped liver. She made both movies on loan to other studios after Paramount suspended her! Talk about having the last laugh if only Louise Beavers could have shared it in her own career!I first saw this film on the big screen about 20 years ago at a nowdefunct repertory cinema in Chicago. The matine comprised me and a handful of elderly black women. We applauded as the curtain rang down the clapping had the satisfied quality that follows a parable.".

Single moms and interracial friendships in 1934? Yes it is true that the black woman Delilah is subservient but this is true to the times and she should not be criticized for it. Both these woman want a better life for their daughters and work together to do so. It is a sad but realistic fact that neither daughter is happy with the better life. Delilah's daughter is very lightskinned and wants to pass for white for she knows in this era that the only opportunities are for whites. The later version starring Lana Turner is a poor substitute for this one. Lana tends to over act and the friendship between the two women is severely downplayed.  It is true that in this film the camera seems to pause on the actors' faces over long but this I think is a holdover from the silent film era when acting had to be done by facial expression instead of voice.While this film is flawed it is a good film for young people in that it shows the changes made in our society both for single moms and for blacks.".

	schema:reviewBody "I purchased this movie because of Louise Beavers. I was impressed with her performance in Mr Blandings Build His Dream House where she does more than hold her own in her all too short appearances with stars like Cary Grant Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. And I was not disappointed. She really is the solid center of this movie and its true star. She is like some sort of early method actress with a terrific screen presence and her stile of acting differs remarkably from the more affected ones of her acting colleagues in this movie who come through as real airheads or shall we say designer products? in their imitation of life.Basically I think this is less a movie about race but about Delilah's values  and in this aspect it is an entirely different movie than the remake of 1957. Although beset by a hard and difficult life Delilah is a balanced person of principle. And she has knowledge on philosophical as well as practical ways. She accepts her place in society that is a personal choice mind you and aims to make the best out of it. The world of Big Dreams is not hers. Her meeting another women with the daring and the tenaciousness of a dye hard capitalist is seen in that context a sort of an accident. This other woman discovers and exploits Delilah's knowledge first on a small then on a very large scale. Delilah's values lead to commercial success Delilah's portrait becomes literally a brand incidentally a beautiful Art Deco design not unlike Uncle Ben's. She takes success gracefully although she does not really care about it. And she knows there will always be things money can't buy and they most probably will determine your personal happiness. The daughters of the two single mothers seem to symbolize the mean truth that there are issues that are simply beyond a mother's will and have to be left to godly powers. Delilah's daughter just wants to be an airhead too that is a personal choice mind you. She is most happy blending in with the anonymous general crowd of our modern times selling cigars in a store Fredi Washington's best scene. There's nothing her mother can do about it.MINOR SPOILER AHEAD At the end of the movie Delilah dies probably of a broken heart. The world of airheads was too much for that archaic type of good motherly woman. She leaves a vacuum behind and people wistfully watch her stylized portrait eternally turning over flickering electric pancakes on the huge billboard on a rooftop. This will forever be a truly modern movie.".

There was probably some imitation of life to the movie when it was made no matter how silly or stereotypical it might have been even for its time. If anything this movie at least attempted to show two women in business being rewarded for their efforts and hard work. Yes the 2080 split when the pan cake business went incorporated might seem unfair now but it was better than the 1950's film where Annie just waits on Ms. Lora dolling out wisdom with a spoon full of sugar. I was much more perplexed why Jessie would be interested in a fish scientist who said he was 37 but looked more like 57!".

	schema:reviewBody "The iconic Claudette Colbert was the shining star in John M. Stahl's 1934 film Imitation of Life based on a book by Fannie Hurst of the same title. Colbert along with Louise Beavers Fredi Washington and Rochelle Hudson join together to expose the hardships of women who must enter the workforce in a time when women were only to maintain households. In addition to the struggle of a family who lost their patriarch the audience also experiences through the film the multi faceted race relations that consumed people of color in the 1930's. The two intertwined tales of personal struggle create a window into the world of the 30's social constructs to engage a whole new audience in their complexities.Bea Pullman Claudette Colbert becomes a single mother to her daughter Jessie Rochelle Hudson after the death of her husband. Struggling to maintain both the household and her husband's business Bea is blessed with an angel in the form of housekeeper Delilah Johnson. Louise Beavers Delilah comes to Bea's door with a proposition to work for the Pullman family for only room and board in exchange. Delilah is not alone however she also has a daughter Peola Fredi Washington. Peola and Jessie are about the same age and Bea doesn't have the money to hire a muchneeded housekeeper the arrangement seems like a fit for all parties involved so Bea agrees. The two women become fast friends and eventually spring an idea to market Ms. Delilah's pancake recipe. The idea takes off and the duo becomes incredibly wealthy. No matter how much wealth the two accumulate Delilah requests that she and Peola remain living with Bea and Jessie. The girls grow together as much as they can in a world strained by racism. Jessie being afforded many more opportunities especially in regards to education flourishes into adulthood and takes off for college. Peola however becomes a victim of intolerance and constantly tows the line between her true self and the self she assumes when she passes as a white woman. Peola becomes estranged from her mother due to her deep resentment of Delilah's dark skin. Motherdaughter relationships are difficult enough to navigate Imitation of Life goes to show that this is an ageold difficulty made no easier by also having to deal with death racial tensions and heartache along the way.If you're an old film lover like me this film will you why you are. There is nothing quite like that softly gleaming glow that a great black and white movie puts off. Claudet Colbert is a national treasure and if you haven't seen her acting you shouldtoday. The real power behind this film is its distinct story line. Of course no one denies the existence of the obvious racism that filled the earlier days of this country. This film takes a unique line of that struggle to focus on the problems that lightskinned black people often went through. Peola could pass for white because her father before her was light skinned. In passing as white Peola also had to disown her mother. There is no greater pain for a single mother than to be abandoned by her daughter. In contrast Jessie was afforded much more opportunities due to her skin color and was able to maintain a healthy relationship with her mother. This class distinction was beautifully and painfully illustrated in the image of Bea ascending up the stairs while Delilah descended down the stairs immediately following their discussion of college plans of their daughters. This scene depicted in such a stark way the level of divide between races at the time which were present regardless of income. Delilah had amassed a fortune with Bea due to her pancake recipe yet was still treated as a secondclass citizen with a daughter that resents her. Many films deal with race but the added struggle of both the women being single mothers creates a film that will not be forgotten in Imitation of Life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imitation of Life 1934A beautiful and beautifully felt movie. Claudette Colbert in the same year as her legendary role in It Happened One Night shows the really sincere charm and natural presence on screen even better here. She's a wonder as an actress and her role as a young struggling single mom idealized for sure and her success as a mature woman is terrific stuff. A great movie with a great performance.The director John Stahl who gets maligned in the bio on this site go to Wikipedia for a more balanced and fair view was indeed a man of mixed talents but he pulled off several really first rate movies. This version of Imitation of Life is remarkably clear and forceful and subtle. It's not quite a formula movie even if it has some standard Hollywood tricks of the passing of time of handling the filming and the back projection all very convincingly. And it has a story at its core that is really rather forward thinking for a mainstream movie. There are those I've heard them who find the approach to race too cloying and timid but I say show me a better film that people actually watched about the subject from this year. Just to find a way to deal with the idea of passing which means a black person passing as white in order to avoid prejudice is terrific and necessary for the times. By the way for an insider look on this read the extraordinary 1929 short novel Passing by Nella Larsen. The story for Imitation of Life is written by a white Jewish woman Fanny Hurst and is clearly taking up the broad themes of the depression. Written in 1933 it nailed themes that probably echoed some of the bigotry against Jews of the time as both blacks and Jews were largely assimilating into mainstream America.Inevitably the remake of this movie will come to mind and luckily they are very different movies. I love Douglas Sirk for his stylizing excesses and his willingness to identify clichs and make them the substance of his 1959 movie including the clich known as a tearjerker!. I watched them both together this week back and forth between them and you can check out that review too if you want. Stahl's version closer to the book in time and feeling than Sirk's is in many ways a better movie once you remove pure style from the equation. There is less to love but much more to really like here in the sincerity of the characters the sweeping defiance against a Great Depression that is mostly invisible and in sheer personality. Terrific stuff!".

	schema:headline " Good melodrama but the remake was a little better";
	schema:reviewBody "John M. Stahl's 1934 melodrama Imitation of Life stars Claudette Colbert as Bea Pullman a young widow with a young daughter Jessie who struggles to carry on her husband's syrup sales business after her husband dies. One morning as she is trying to get her two year old ready for day care before setting off for work her doorbell rings and she finds Delilah Johnson Louise Beavers and her young daughter Peola at the door. Delilah has mistaken Bea's household as the one advertising for house help but when she sees Bea struggling she offers to help her out for no wages only room and board for she and her daughter. The two women strike up a friendship and eventually begin a pancake house business with Delilah making her famous pancakes and Bea selling them and her syrup. Throughout the next fifteen years their business becomes a small conglomerate with Delilah continuing to care for Bea and her daughter simply because she wants to despite her now great wealth. Complicating matters is the fact that Peola is very lightskinned and often passes for white which develops hatred within her for her race which manifests itself as contempt and disdain for her mother. Additionally Bea's boyfriend Steve Warren William finds himself the object of the now 18 year old Jessie's affection which causes strife among the three of them.Imitation of Life is simply a great rich story that we so rarely see in cinema today. Certainly an unusual topic in the 1930's the subject of race relations is very prominent throughout the film without being remotely preachy. The acting was good though I did feel like Delilah's role was more of a caricature than a character at times. I also didn't really see the appeal of Steve's character who also has probably one of the most unusual occupations that I've seen in a classic film fish scientist. I of course couldn't help comparing this version to its Douglas Sirk remake from 1959 that starred Lana Turner and Juanita Moore. I think that the high melodrama of the story is much better served in the highly colorful Technicolor and Lana Turner's histrionics. I also felt a little uneasy with the treatment of AfricanAmericans in this version because it was continuously teetering on a racist line just a little more caricature and certain moments would have fully gone over the edge. The film was not disrespectful but it got close to being eyebrowraising. Granted it was a different time but I was expecting a little more from a film that would address the subject in the first place.Having said all that I really did enjoy the film as a whole  I just enjoyed the remake a little bit more. I did find even without Mahalia Jackson singing at the end of the remake that I bawled like a baby at the end of this version almost as much as I do at the end of Sirk's version which is no small amount. I'm not sure what it is about this story or these movies but when I was in film school specifically in my Films of the Fifties class where I first saw Imitation of Life 1959 I remember sitting in the classroom just sobbing and wasn't the only one. It takes a good story regardless of its presentation to have that kind of impact regardless of how many times it is viewed. This version gets a solid 610 from me.Shelly".

Complicating matters is the fact that Peola is very lightskinned and often passes for white which develops hatred within her for her race which manifests itself as contempt and disdain for her mother. Additionally Bea's boyfriend Steve Warren William finds himself the object of the now 18 year old Jessie's affection which causes strife among the three of them.Imitation of Life is simply a great rich story that we so rarely see in cinema today. Certainly an unusual topic in the 1930's the subject of race relations is very prominent throughout the film without being remotely preachy. The acting was good though I did feel like Delilah's role was more of a caricature than a character at times. I also didn't really see the appeal of Steve's character who also has probably one of the most unusual occupations that I've seen in a classic film fish scientist. I of course couldn't help comparing this version to its Douglas Sirk remake from 1959 that starred Lana Turner and Juanita Moore. I think that the high melodrama of the story is much better served in the highly colorful Technicolor and Lana Turner's histrionics. I also felt a little uneasy with the treatment of AfricanAmericans in this version because it was continuously teetering on a racist line just a little more caricature and certain moments would have fully gone over the edge. The film was not disrespectful but it got close to being eyebrowraising. Granted it was a different time but I was expecting a little more from a film that would address the subject in the first place.Having said all that I really did enjoy the film as a whole  I just enjoyed the remake a little bit more. I did find even without Mahalia Jackson singing at the end of the remake that I bawled like a baby at the end of this version almost as much as I do at the end of Sirk's version which is no small amount. I'm not sure what it is about this story or these movies but when I was in film school specifically in my Films of the Fifties class where I first saw Imitation of Life 1959 I remember sitting in the classroom just sobbing and wasn't the only one. It takes a good story regardless of its presentation to have that kind of impact regardless of how many times it is viewed. This version gets a solid 610 from me.Shelly";

	schema:reviewBody "This 1934 filmed version of the story which is well written acted and directed is the one worth watching. The 1959 version which is none of these things has purely historical interest. And the historical interest is this if these films are anything to go by in the 25 years between them race relations and the filmingmaking craft in America both went into reverse. Concentrating on the treatment of race for a moment while the rabbit's foot and the 'will to death' clichs about African Americans have gone out of the story by 1959 opportunities and recognition for their race are seemingly more elusive than before. The Annie character in the earlier film is a business partner albeit an unequal one a '20er' of her white friend in the latter version she is no more than her maid and occasional confidante. In the 1934 version Annie's daughter conforms to the 'tragic mulatto' stereotype but retains personal dignity in the 1959 version she conforms to the 'promiscuous mixedblood' stereotype and ends in the gutter. Both scripts struggle to interconnect the relationship between the ambitious white woman and her daughter and the relationship of the black woman and her daughter in terms of dramatic action thematic content and comparative time on screen. Although the films place both relationships under the one roof they run largely in parallel problems of 'white folks' and problems of 'black folks' are perceived to be so separate. The latter version does worse in this regard. At least the 1934 version tries to bridge the gap by having the Claudette Colbert character go in search of the runaway Sarah Anne. Lana Turner's character just pitches in a few trite comments. This lack of emotional commitment robs the final scene in the 1959 film of any of the power that is present in the earlier version when Colbert goes to comfort Annie's daughter at the hearse. With its undistinguished supporting cast a terrible score and sometimes laughable dialogue the remake would I suspect have disappeared from critical discussion had it not for its 'controversial' subjectmatter and the star pull of an aging Turner. The 1934 version still looks and feels somewhat brave certainly it has a lot more heart and quality. The DVD's quality in sound and image are also good.".

I watched it first and fell completely in love with it. I mainly payed more focus to the warmth of Bea Pullman and Delilahs friendship as it progressed over time. When one was down the other helped build them back up and it stayed that way until Delilah gave her very last breath. Of course some say that back in the 30's you never found blacks and whites to be so close but indeed there were some and Imitation of Life proved that. As far as Fredi Washingtons character as Peopla I found myself keen to her more so than any other character. I understood why she felt the way she did about outwardly appearing caucasian on the outside and being African American by race. It does hurt me to see her turn against and deny her mother as the movie ends but when her mother then dies it's even more sorrowful that Peola never has the chance to tell her Yes I did love you and I should have claimed you as my mother from the start For anyone who loves a warm heartfelt classic you should certainly see Imitation of life The year 1934".

	schema:reviewBody "What an interesting film this was. On the surface you have Colbert in a charming role as a selfmade woman who makes it to the top with pluck ambition and a secret pancake recipe she gets from a maid. But that's not what makes the movie interesting. Colbert's maid is played by Louise Beavers an AfricanAmerican and also a single mother. Her daughter Peola played by Fredi Washington is lightskinned and wants to 'pass' as white. There are several brutal heartwrenching scenes between the two of them  as a child played by Dorothy Black Peola is upset about being called black believing it an insult later in school she has to slink out of an allwhite classroom amidst stares and whispers to see her mother who has shown up unexpectedly and finally as an adult pretending she doesn't even know her at her job where she's also 'passed' and later telling her she wants to disown her entirely. Beavers' character is sweet and strong and bears this suffering to her deathbed.These are the scenes with real emotional impact in the story and it's stunning though not surprising that neither Beavers nor Washington where nominated for an Academy Award. But Colbert was even though she was also nominated in the same year for 'It Happened One Night'. How true this trend was 82 years ago and how true it is today see 'Creed'.Now it is true that the love story in the movie for Colbert with William Warren is captivating and it gets complicated when her daughter falls in love with him as well and despite no wrongdoing on his part creates a dilemma for Colbert. I liked this twist it was unexpected and created a little angst for the white characters who were otherwise in beautiful clothes sipping champagne and dancing the night away. However the resolution of this at the end pales in comparison to the resolution of Beavers' story which precedes it.The movie is a great snapshot of what pushing the boundaries meant in 1934. On the positive side you have a single mother shown balancing family and work and keeping control of her business as it skyrockets. You have Fredi Washington a lightskinned AfricanAmerican actress who in real life disdained 'passing' hired to play the role of Peola when it was much more common to hire whites. You have Colbert's character inviting Beavers into her home and not showing an ounce of racism as she talks to her or concern when by hiring her they'll live together. And you have a movie that showed very sensitive racial subject matter revealing to the audience the real struggle AfricanAmericans go through and in a way that was thoughtful not exploitative.On the other hand you have Beavers' being simpleminded superstitious and wanting to remain subservient to Colbert's even when they've made enough money and it's no longer necessary. While it underscores her big heart it also perpetuates a myth one that is very convenient for Caucasians. Also because the Hays Code had recently gone into effect references to Peola being of mixedrace were avoided because 'passing' itself was already dangerous ground and the concept of racial mixing was a definite nono. Her father is simply referred to as having been 'lightskinned'. Just as importantly a scene in the script depicting a black boy being attacked and nearly lynched for coming up to a white woman was excised conservative America was not willing to admit this shameful truth.All in all though an important film. The Colbert story is cute on its own but I wish the emphasis had been placed more on Beavers that it had been a movie more from her viewpoint with the minor character and subplots belonging to Colbert instead. Fair or unfair I knocked it down a half a star as a result.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a powerful film despite its reflecting the naivety of the times. Like A Star is Born the story of Imitation of Life is inherently moving a white woman befriends a black woman who has a paleskinned daughter that unbeknown to her mother has been passing for white. But there is only so much that loving friendship and motherhood can accomplish.This is the original version more homely than the fifties one. BeaClaudette Colbert is a single mother who fortuitously bumps into goodhearted Delilah Louise Beavers who is willing to forgo a salary in order to simply have a loving home. The two start up a pancake business together which rapidly becomes a success. Delilah's pale daughter Peola teenage version played by Fredi Washington refuses to accept her racial identity and the low social status that Delilah willingly takes.The race question is not explored as deeply in the original because of the constraints of the era in which it was made so unfortunately Fredi Washington does not have enough screen time. She is a strong actress but she seems quite uncomfortable with the character's desire to be white. Some including the actress herself have argued that Peola merely wants the rights of a white woman rather than a black one. Whilst Peola clearly does want those privileges she still does not want to accept her racial identity which is why she becomes so unhappy and lives an imitation of life. Whatever motivation you attribute to Peola Fredi Washington still does a very good job and looks spot on. All that was needed was a bit more focus on the race issue although perhaps it was too sensitive a topic for 1934.The film is all about the women and is a perfect example of a woman's picture. The friendship between Bea and Delilah is the heart of the film although the characterisation of Delilah as a mammy type is a bit too patronising and Bea is on the whole condescending towards Delilah. The bond of motherhood is also a very significant theme Peola's heartbreaking rejection of Delilah is contrasted with the relative lightness of Jessie Bea's daughter crush on her mother's boyfriend Stephen Warren William. Rochelle Hudson's portrayal of Jessie is much better than Sandra Dee's but then the Jessie of this film is written better and is more interesting. Her exchanges with Stephen are particularly comic.Louise Beavers' portrayal of Delilah renamed Annie in the later film is the mammy stereotype but with a soulful edge. She takes the subservient role because of her spiritual beliefs rather than because she believes that black people ought to be inferior. The difference between this and the Douglas Sirk film is that this film is saying that there are differences between black people and white people whereas the latter film isn't. I couldn't say which is a more accurate portrayal of the AfricanAmerican experience in a postcivil rights world many would be inclined to prefer the latter choice. However there is a powerful soulfulness about Delilah that for the most part overcomes the racial stereotypes.This film offers a lot of interesting themes business society's attitude to race friendship motherhood and many others. Do not let the moments of naivety spoil what is a very good woman's picture.".

	schema:headline " The Height of Racial Realism in 1934";
	schema:reviewBody "One can make a case that this film about the African  American racial realities of the New Deal period is the equivalent of House Of Rothschild a contemporary movie regarding Jews and antiSemitism. Both movies are very wellintentioned for their day but are somewhat appalling for the present day. House Of Rothschild had great performances by George Arliss as Nathan Rothschild and Boris Karloff as his German foe the bigoted Baron Ledranz. But it suggested that the key to the emancipation of the Jews and their acceptance by gentile society was tied to economic success and power. This ignored the roots of antiSemitism in economic jealousy by nonJews. In Imitation Of Life we see two poor single mothers one white and one black each with a daughter who form a partnership that enriches them with an Aunt Jemimah baking empire. But in the real world how frequently did white and black people cooperate that closely when millions of dollars were at stake? The ideas however of this film are not easy to reject totally. Forgetting the idea of interracial economic cooperation and money making the idea that a white and a black woman could become close is not totally impossible and the issues of the problems both women have with their daughters are still relevant.Claudette Colbert Bea Pullman and her daughter Rochelle Hudson Jessie find that they become rivals for Warren Williams Steve Archer. The rivalry of the pair for the same man is not uncommon and the sad resolution of the problem seems unfair to Bea. Wisely the script does not settle what the future will prove about this collision of sexual hopes.No such problem faces Louise Beavers Delilah Johnson and Freddie Washington Peola. Beavers is a hard working decent woman who is fully aware of what the average White person expects of a Black person's attitudes in the America or Western World of 1934. Subserviance is the key for survival. Beavers in the story is luckier than most of her people because she has made a large amount of money as Colbert's business partner. But she can only get so far with that advantage  she can't live in a mansion and hobnob with the social elite. But she doesn't really seem to care to. The old and infuriating phrase about knowing her place is acceptable to her. But Peola is light skinned and can pass herself off as white. She desperately wants to do so  to sneak for want of a better term herself into the majority of the population with all the attending economic political and social advantages. And Bea wants Peola to accept her racial difference.Today of course we feel that it is the sin of the society penalizing millions of nonwhites that is the terrible wrong not Peola's desperate attempt to grab at happiness. But in 1934 it was Peola who was found to be wrong. Her selfishness leads to killing the saintly decent Delilah and Peola realizes this at the conclusion  at her mother's funeral.Before leaving this I have to point out that Peola's gamble probably would have been difficult in the long run. In the 1920s New York society was shocked and titillated by the Kip Rhinelander Divorce Scandal. The son of a wealthy old New York family Rhinelander married a very attractive woman. Then their child turned out to be AfricanAmerican. The resulting divorce action was very ugly. If Peola married a white man she would run a similar risk as would all white descendants of the couple due to genetics. Oddly enough this particular situation is not a dated story theme. On an episode of LAW AND ORDER about six years ago the murder of a woman was tied to her trying to regain her son by her exhusband the husband like Peola could pass himself off as white and was a high ranking business executive with a new wife who was white and also a bigot.Among other things to note in this film is the use of the Aunt Jemimah clone in 1934  a key to the long term success of that brand with the American public and one that still exists and the business deal that Ned Sparks and Colbert are negotiation with a clone of General Mills or some other food conglomerate. The funeral of Delilah also is notable for the appearance of members of the Black Middle class in the scenes in particular the men in quasimilitary uniforms who must belong to some mason like club and who give the deceased a goodbye beneath their outstretched military sabers. The appearance of Preston Sturges as one of the screenplay writers suggests some of the touches  Sturges liked to poke fun at well known brand names. In Christmas In July for instance the coffee company is Maxford's like Maxwell House.I find this a well acted and thoughtful movie for 1934 and yes Louise Beavers did give her most tragic performance in this film. But the acceptance of racial inequalities that really are not acceptable anymore although much improvement is still needed does stick in one's craw.".

The rivalry of the pair for the same man is not uncommon and the sad resolution of the problem seems unfair to Bea. Wisely the script does not settle what the future will prove about this collision of sexual hopes.No such problem faces Louise Beavers Delilah Johnson and Freddie Washington Peola. Beavers is a hard working decent woman who is fully aware of what the average White person expects of a Black person's attitudes in the America or Western World of 1934. Subserviance is the key for survival. Beavers in the story is luckier than most of her people because she has made a large amount of money as Colbert's business partner. But she can only get so far with that advantage  she can't live in a mansion and hobnob with the social elite. But she doesn't really seem to care to. The old and infuriating phrase about knowing her place is acceptable to her. But Peola is light skinned and can pass herself off as white. She desperately wants to do so  to sneak for want of a better term herself into the majority of the population with all the attending economic political and social advantages. And Bea wants Peola to accept her racial difference.Today of course we feel that it is the sin of the society penalizing millions of nonwhites that is the terrible wrong not Peola's desperate attempt to grab at happiness. But in 1934 it was Peola who was found to be wrong. Her selfishness leads to killing the saintly decent Delilah and Peola realizes this at the conclusion  at her mother's funeral.Before leaving this I have to point out that Peola's gamble probably would have been difficult in the long run. In the 1920s New York society was shocked and titillated by the Kip Rhinelander Divorce Scandal. The son of a wealthy old New York family Rhinelander married a very attractive woman. Then their child turned out to be AfricanAmerican. The resulting divorce action was very ugly. If Peola married a white man she would run a similar risk as would all white descendants of the couple due to genetics. Oddly enough this particular situation is not a dated story theme. On an episode of LAW AND ORDER about six years ago the murder of a woman was tied to her trying to regain her son by her exhusband the husband like Peola could pass himself off as white and was a high ranking business executive with a new wife who was white and also a bigot.Among other things to note in this film is the use of the Aunt Jemimah clone in 1934  a key to the long term success of that brand with the American public and one that still exists and the business deal that Ned Sparks and Colbert are negotiation with a clone of General Mills or some other food conglomerate. The funeral of Delilah also is notable for the appearance of members of the Black Middle class in the scenes in particular the men in quasimilitary uniforms who must belong to some mason like club and who give the deceased a goodbye beneath their outstretched military sabers. The appearance of Preston Sturges as one of the screenplay writers suggests some of the touches  Sturges liked to poke fun at well known brand names. In Christmas In July for instance the coffee company is Maxford's like Maxwell House.I find this a well acted and thoughtful movie for 1934 and yes Louise Beavers did give her most tragic performance in this film. But the acceptance of racial inequalities that really are not acceptable anymore although much improvement is still needed does stick in one's craw.";

She is also a single mom trying to earn money to raise her daughter Peola played by Fredi Washington. Bea's husband had invented a great maple syrup before passing away and Delilah has a great pancake recipe seemingly resulting in the Aunt Jemimah syrup story. Just how authentic the story is doesn't really matter as it's an all around good story. Delilah's daughter causes her much heartbreak as the events of the times caused Peola to want to live in the easier Caucasian world. Much of the story revolves around the growth of their joint business operation with the conflict between Delilah and her daughter as a coplot. Some sadness here but very powerful scenes. Another subplot is the competition for men between Bea and her daughter. Also watch for appearances by Ned Sparks  Bride Walks Out and Alan Hale Sr the real life father of the Skipper from Gilligan's Island. This movie was remade in 1959 with the story updated for the times. The later version was not as deep or captivating and starred Lana Turner Sandra Dee Troy Donahue and Juanita Moore.".

The story's premise of a white woman feeling pity for and taking in a black woman is credible given that all women especially mothers would find it difficult to turn their back on another woman in need. Yet I feel Hollywood could have made some bold strides and tried to elevate Delilah's character to more than a stepnfetch slave. How hard would it have been for Hollywood to make her an equal partner and decisionmaker in the pancake deal. Interestingly the lightskinned character played by Fredi Washingtonwho really is mixed is vilified in the movie as wanting to pass herself off as white. In real Hollywood life she was told she could make more money if she allowed the studio to promote her as being white. She of course refused and her career ended three years later because she could not be accepted by either race in movies at the time. She was too white for blacks and too black for whites...Shame. I recommend all people to watch this movie and then also watch the remake and appreciate how our society has changed and still has more opportunities to change.".

I once saw a documentary about the man but that's the only time I once saw or heard anything about him. And I guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. Noone knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.The movie tells the story of Ned Kelly's life. The Irish immigrant has lived in northwest Victoria all his life but has never been very welcome by the authorities. The police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family. When Kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men. They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days. All this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are outlawed. Finally they take over a pub in Glenrowan where they have a party with all the visitors waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up. But the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen...It's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false. I guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of Robin Hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief. I really couldn't tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what I can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same.This movie was a nice addition to the documentary I once saw and I really enjoyed the performances of all the actors. Heath Ledger Orlando Bloom Naomi Watts Geoffrey Rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.510".

If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man Ned Kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians Ned Kelly has become a legend. Legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger.So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical Kelly gang I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow Australians watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly. Perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers. Ironically I actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on Ned's story would dwell. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians.This movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market to pay the pills and the legend as it means to Australians perhaps a little of Ned's spirit is in this movie because I think it rebelled against people's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets. Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about Ned and that is why I liked it. Orlando Bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too  he really added something. I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a change.When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered.

	schema:reviewBody "There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan's 'Ned Kelly' film did. Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations and decided to see it for myself. Since then I have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film. It is also wonderful to see something Australian! I appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is a rarity as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films. This film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point. The cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might I add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters. It is interesting to note that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what and how they only said so many lines. However if any criticism is due it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded. In reality these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history. For example on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much much more to the relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film. Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only Aaron Sheritt's efforts alone that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery. Yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. I feel that in this case this is the only limitation. However I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation. It certainly inspired me to look more closely. So watch it and decide for yourself. You might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine. Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience? For me I'd call it a breath of fresh air!".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception. What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attention.Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine a novel about the Kelly legend excels. Rather than attempting to portray a Ned Kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being. Indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. Here Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. No I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. While the Kelly gang were distinctly Irish Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this.Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw. It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not Kelly himself. Orlando Bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow and Geoffrey Rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at Glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. But it is Naomi Watts appearing as Julia Cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kelly's life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. Indeed a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freezedried than explorative. Once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.Unfortunately most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. Ditto for Watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. I can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this. But that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. One scene manages to do the speechmaking thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. If one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that Ned Kelly becomes a wanted man on the sayso of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan. Annoyingly the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.That said aside from some shaky camerawork at times Ned Kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning. For that reason I rated it a seven out of ten. Other critics have not been so kind so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout? then you might be better off looking elsewhere. Especially if you want a more factual account of Ned Kelly's life.".

Along with this I have only seen two other films he has directed which were Two Hands which was unreal to say the least and Buffalo Soldier which was bloody great and Ned Kelly.   When first seeing this I was excited more than I should have been because I was dying to see a new western but I don't know whether you would call this a western as it is not set in the west like other American films this is set in Australia telling the story of legendary outlaw Ned Kelly a young man who never got on the right side of the law who was raised from an Irish family.  To make the film even better it is directed and starring an Australian. Heath Ledger is sporting an Irish accent in the film which is faultless.The supporting cast is just as good with Orlando Bloom playing Kelly's best friend Steve along with Naomi Watt's as Kelly's love interest but I wouldn't even call her that as she's not even in it.   Geoffrey Rush is not used as much as he should have been as the man chasing Kelly.   You feel that Gregor Jordan had the key to the sweet shop in Ned Kelly but didn't take full advantage of it.   Geoffrey Rush was only in key scenes but there wasn't much introduction to who he was and his interest in Kelly like in the end when he asks Kelly if he can keep an item of his and Kelly looks at him thinking Why'.   it would have been an interest to see what he really thought of him he just acts under orders to capture him and that's it. Naomi Watts is the same.  So much there but not taken.  As far as the story goes this is not such based on his biography but a novel written by Robert Drewe Called Our Sunshine which is a famous phrase that Ned Kelly's father called him.    It's a strong story with terrific acting but the script wasn't long enough to make it into the epic it could have been.  Sure enough there is plenty in the film to keep it's audience happy but it doesn't really give you the feel you are hoping for.   It's goes down in the books of films that could have been so much more and even though this is still a very good film it had the opportunity to be a masterpiece but if only the script was up to the task there would be a lot more people talking about this story.".

There have been quite a number of films based on heroic legends. Sadly this one is no different and almost every moment of it is downright predictable.The strength lies in the portrayal of the characters. Kelly and his gang are portrayed as human beings rather than the typical ruthless heroes suffering from affective flattening. On the other hand the screenplay is so fast paced that one wonders whether Jordan really rushed through it as 'Ned Kelly' certainly would have benefited more if the script was better developed e.g. Julia Cook could have used more scenes. As a result the film looks more like a brief summary of Kelly's life. We don't even see the trial and execution of Ned Kelly.In the technical department the cinematography background score and beautiful locations deserve mention as they certainly add to the film's quality. There are some beautiful shots of the Australian landscape and the set design and few songs do give a feel of the time.Heath Ledger is adequate in the title role but it is Orlando Bloom who steals the show. The guy seems to be in complete form unlike his awkward presence in films like 'Kingdom of Heaven' and does full justice to the part. Naomi Watts shines in a small role. Geoffrey Rush deserved a better part but the actor nonetheless stands out. Most of the supporting cast do well. However some of the villainous corrupt cops come across as caricatures.Finally Jordan's 'Ned Kelly' just doesn't do full justice in portraying Kelly's life.

	schema:reviewBody "Ned Kelly is a straightforward retelling of the legendary Australian who has a powerful symbolism as both an outlaw and a revolutionary. It is not based on the awardwinning novel by Peter Carey True History of the Ned Kelly Gang because the rights to that were taken by the Irish Neil Jordan to the consternation of nationalists who rallied around this adaptation of Robert Drewe's Our Sunshine.   But oddly though Drewe is listed as a coproducer this chronological narrative by firsttimer John M. McDonagh flattens out the power of the novella's focus on the final threedays' battle that's as important to Australia as Remember the Alamo! is to Texans. Director Gregor Jordan particularly undercuts the core of Kelly's transformation in the public imagination from petty criminal to charismatic Robin Hood to uprising leader against injustice by barely letting Heath Ledger dictate a few lines of the socalled 'Jerilderie Letter'  perhaps because it is the powerful centerpiece of the voice of the Carey book. Ledger's basso voiceover connectors do resonate. Jordan opts for portends of the key confrontation that will only be caught by those familiar with the legend  Kelly idly looking through an illustrated book about body armor the loading up of the infamous train that will carry the police to the attack and Geoffrey Rush replaying his Inspector Javert but with only implications of a Les Miserables back story. Jordan presides over an excellent recreation of the milieu of the time. There's a strong visual evocation in the art and set direction of time place and geography especially with Oliver Stapleton's beautiful cinematography. The social class differences between descendants of POMmies Prisoners of his Majesty and their British overlords are documented starkly particularly in carrying over the Irish vs. British conflict to another continent though the bland music score misses a real opportunity to illustrate that with only a couple of traditional Celtic songs literally stuck in.NonAussie Orlando Bloom makes quite a dashing Joe Byrne Kelly's best friend attracting Rachel Griffiths in a somewhat silly cameo and many other recognizable Australian actors pass through. Unfortunately Naomi Watts and Ledger can be added to the lengthy list of reallife lovers who evince little reel chemistry  did that only work to our benefit for BogartBacall and TracyHepburn?".

Having now seen this fairly enjoyable movie about his struggle for justice in the outback I am a little bit more clued up but I do have to ask how much fiction has replaced fact in this telling of the legend of Ned Kelly. Was he really so righteous or have facts been changed to make the character more sympathetic and appealing to the audience?Director Gregor Jordan works well with the questionably accurate script getting good performances from his lead Heath Ledger who impresses with his portrayal of a man fighting the system the only way he knows how. Also worthy of mention is Orlando Bloom as Ned's friend Joseph and Geoffrey Rush as top cop Francis Hare. Naomi Watts however is wasted as Ned's piece of posh totty in an unnecessary romantic subplot.Whilst the movie never bores it never really excels either leaving this reviewer feeling rather apathetic towards it hence my justslightlyaboveaverage rating of 610.".

However as a film it is incredably slanted to Ned's point of view he is just way too good. Details of Ned's horse theivery which he admitted to in the Jerilderie letter where changed to make the Victorian police seem at fault. The Victorian police were made into the oppressors of the Kelly family and force Ned to a life as an outlaw in the bush.Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ned Kelly is a fair one he manages to depict Ned's anger at the authories rather well. Orlando Bloom's portrayal of the womanising Joe Byrne and Joel Edgerton's Aaron Sherrit betrayer of the Kelly gang were nowhere near Oscar worthy but still good. Naomi Watt's character was unnecessary and seemed only added to provide a love interest for Ned.Overall Ned Kelly is a generally good film. The acting is good but the storyline leaves a lot to be desired far too black and white for a film based on true events. However the film does have it's moments the final showdown at the Glenrowan Inn was a particulary well crafted scene. An interesting side note is that Dan Kelly's death in not actually shown perhaps this was fuelled by the rumour that he did not perish in the Glenrowan siege but escaped and fled to a new life in Queensland.6 of of 10".

Heath Ledger's almost amateurish performance in the leading role makes it hard for the reader to warm to his character and Orlando Bloom isn't much better. Naomi Watts as a token love interest is even worse.There are flashes of drama and some decent moments not least that climax but too much of the production is given over to ponderous soap opera instead of hardhitting drama.

The film also had comedic moments such as the letter describing the policemen with various colourful adjectives. Pacing in the film was just right there was a balance of the fight scenes and noon fight scenes so that the viewers have a chance to relax.

Gregor Jordan spares no expense in building this film to all of its potential. Orlando Bloom does an amazing job as sidekick Joe Byrne. His suave ways of acting around women really showed Orlando's slicker side in films. Laurence Kinlan and Phil Barantini's portrayals of Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were very powerful especially at the end when they both have to decide what to do when they are trapped in the burning bar trying not to give anything away here! Naomi Watts was astonishingly talented at playing Julia Cook Ned Kelly's secret lover of course the fact that he was actually sleeping with her off set might have helped a little bit. Over all this movie is tremendous and I HIGHLY recommend rentingbuying this film.".

I rented it out of curiosity... the short description on the jacket seemed interesting enough.  I only found out after watching the movie that it was such a big hit in Korea a few years ago. Watching the movie it reminded me of The Rock La Femme NikitaPoint of No Return and Heat.. All these were previously mentioned in other comments and I agree that some of the scenes in Swiri or Shiri weren't very original in that regard.  Still the quality of the movie was surprisingly excellent.  I also agree a lot of the action sequences in this movie weren't perfect but then again so are some of Hollywood's action movies.  Some of the special effects were below par as well the scene where a building blows up wasn't too convincing.  Still I've seen other Korean movies and I must say that Korean films have come a long way.. cinematography plot characterization were all done really well. I watched it twice.. once in Korean audio without subtitles and again with English subtitles.  The subtitles although done very well does leave out some of the subtleties.  I'd say it is a difficult thing translating dialog without losing something somewhere.  Still the acting does fill in the blanks quite well I thought.  I thought the acting was excellent.. Knowing a bit about the NorthSouth Korean history would help understand the movie.  Also knowing a bit about South Korean perception of the North Korea would also help understand the movie better as well. I thought that the love story in the movie although it is a type that is very very often used the tragic type especially in Korean films worked well.  I thought it was far more convincing than the love between Anakin and Amidala in SW2 AOTC.Overall SwiriShiri isn't perfect.  It isn't without holes.  It doesn't compare to Heat an excellent film.  But unlike some of other Hollywood movies that Blockbusters had many more copies of Black Knight Joy Ride Thirteen Ghosts I was glad to have paid 4.09 to rent it for 5 days. That reminds me.  I'd better return my copy since they only had copy.  If you can find a copy at your local Blockbusters or a DVDVideo rental place rent it.".

Special agents Ryu and Lee are assigned to bring down Hee however when the group get hold of a hitech new explosive they hold Seoul to ransom for 10million.  Meanwhile Ryu and Lee realise that there is a mole inside their agency that keeps Hee one step ahead of them.Other reviewers have said that this film is a good addition to the heroic bloodshed' genre of Hong Kong cinema with it's gory bloodshed and bullet ballets.  However I personally feel that this is to do the film a disservice  the film doesn't just lift that style but rather delivers a solid thriller story line with plenty of well directed action.  The plot is a detective story with the added boost of the terrorist attacks.  It has a couple of nice twists along the way that work pretty well.  The downside is that the plot occasionally makes minor jumps that are hard to follow for example an action scene is immediately followed by a scene where the same characters are in a different situation this happens twice and threw me a little.  But these are minor problems.  The political arguments are not too complex  one reviewed said to go and read up on Korean history before seeing Shiri this is far from necessary.  It is quite simple but doesn't get in the way of the bigger thriller story line.The action is not of the slowmo OTT type seen in The Killer or Hard Boiled but is more like the extended gun battles seen in Heat.  Yes they are a bit OTT but they aren't as heavily stylised as in many HK movies.  Instead the tension comes from the excellent direction.  Using a handheld camera really makes the gun battles feel intense and very close to where you're sitting. The action does have some HK clichs but these are still well delivered.The cast are all well Han SukKyu Ryu does well with the action as well as the romance subplot with Kim Yoonjin.  The rest of the cast are good  even the comedy oddball is good value compared to the occasional Hollywood comedy character that can be grating.I haven't seen too many Korean films but this was a particularly good thriller with intense action.  Overall I enjoyed this film and fully expect America to pick up on the fact that it has action AND a workable story and commission a remake pretty soon.  Wouldn't you rather see the original first?".

An extraordinary job for Jong Won turns extremely personal when he finds out his longtime girlfriend MyungHyun Kim Yoon Jin is the mysterious assassin who will kill both country's leaders if Plan A backfires...Any other film would have shown the terrorists as onedimensional stereotypes but this film dives deep into their minds showing they were typically driven by their government and poverty to do their deeds. At core Swiri is more of a romantic drama than a pure action film but people unaware of the NorthSouth Korean situation may not fully see the drama. The romantic department however is amazing to see no matter what not only because of the material it is brought into but the effectiveness of it.

So it was with high hopes I sat down to watch this movie.Perhaps it was a result of the hype but I came away feeling very disappointed in this film. There are some very strong scenes in this film don't get me wrong  the training sequence at the start the suddenness of the assassinations for example  which help add something different to this movie and the technical aspects of Shiri are definitely better than average but in many ways this film falls short.The big issue for me was the disconnect between the 'realistic' political aspect that provided the motivation for the movie and the overthetop gun play in the action sequences. At the very start the training sequence makes the movie look like it will have a more realistic portrayal of violence but this dissipates in a hail of bullets during the shootouts. Apparently the South Korean Special Forces suck because they put thousands of rounds from MP5s in the direction of their heavily outnumbered North Korean adversaries and continually miss while the North Koreans just need hand guns Berettas possibly and one shot to gun down large numbers of armoured opponents.I don't mind cartoonish violence in live action films but it has to be kept consistent. The ability of the North Koreans to avoid large numbers of South Korean bullets exceeded my suspension of disbelief and undermined my acceptance of the political motivation. I can handle the plot holes and the bad science but just can't reconcile the supposed realistic political themes with the absurd action sequences.As for the love story aspect  well it was something a bit different for this genre of movie especially the phone message at the very end of the film  that would have been heartbreaking for the characters involved but not enough to make this film any more than a curiosity for those who want to see what Korean action films are capable of.".

The movie itself is covered end to end in cliches. There's nothing here that hasn't been done before and been done better. The love story was probably the only decent thing in the entire movie. After all how many times do you have to see guys in commando uniforms storming buildings or pursuing criminals? I counted at least 6 separate SWATlike incidents in this movie. In interviews the director claimed Shiri was supposed to overthrow Hollywood's dominance in the South Korean market. If by overthrowing he means to copy and be just like them then he's achieved his purpose.So in summation good movie but definitely not as groundbreaking as everyone seems to think. How can you possibly call this movie better than a standard Hollywood summer event film when it's an exact duplicate of those same summer event films? It doesn't make sense and I question if those who gives this movie such a glowing review isn't doing it because of some bias towards all things Hollywood. For those of you who fits in this category just remember that Citizen Kane and the Godfather came out of Hollywood too so get off your high horse.".

So the action scenes are a tad more brutal than what we might be used to from your usual killeveryoneinsight H'wood outpourings of idiocy and the crosscultural experience itself might be enough to make some people sit up and watch more closely but all in all this movie fails as a whole on account of its incoherent and weak storytelling.

I admit that I only understand very little korean and I saw that one without subtitles and the whole story was translated to me while watching.

Now as well as 2 years ago I still have a bad taste in my mouth after watching it. Despite the overdramatics of spy camp at the beginning the plot was developing very nicely throughout most of the movie. The everyday scenes in and around Korea was very beautiful. Noticed them eating at Marche which I do now in Singapore. But by the big shootout near the end everything crumbles to standard paintbynumbers HK action flik sequences good guys outnumber bad 50to1 or 150to1 but can only manage to hit kitchen appliances the bad guys can't miss killing good guys pistols have 100shot clips where do I get one of those? and personal relationships end tragically sob sob.

After all if Hollywood is so conservative shouldn't nonHollywood and particularly foreign films offer an original alternative? Seems logical.The story has to do with a deadly female assassin from North Korea who had fallen out of circulation for a while in South Korea after being identified. With a bit of help from a rogue North Korean special forces unit she is about to be reactivated. Sound familiar? If the general idea sounds standard actionfilm fare just wait till you get to the details of the laughably clichridden plot and characterisation. These are a few of the numerous clichs that sprang to mind.Major spoilers ahead. Don't read until after seeing the filmIf there is a chase on foot both the baddies and the police should knock over lots of people especially those carrying baskets. They also upset food stalls. If possible they also go the wrong way down escalators. The hero's partner is killed. Bombs always have red LED countdown displays. A superpowerful secret weapon is stolen from a government laboratory. The superpowerful weapon is be hidden in a sports stadium. Baddies frown a lot so you can tell they are bad. Sniper's rifles should be carried in cases with molded foam compartments inside. Bombs should not be deactivated until there is less than .1 second left on the timer If the baddie is a woman she will fall in love with the hero and find herself unable to shoot him when the time comes. The female baddie and the hero will nevertheless find themselves aiming at each other in the last minutes of the movie.When it looks as if the hero is about to be shot one of his colleagues will enter and gun down the baddie just in time. Baddies dress in police or army uniforms at least once during the film. Rooms in which there is an unusual amount of glass are the best place for shootouts. Aquariums stores are obviously first choice. The main baddie cannot be shot until the end of the film no matter how many rounds are discharged in his direction until then.End of spoilersThis aside there really isn't much left to discuss. The acting was suitably standard for this kind of fare I can't take the suggestion seriously that these leads are the Korean equivalents of DeNiro and Pacino. The camera work was lively with plenty of cuts probably intended to give the impression of dynamism but really just covering up for a startling lack of inspiration and originality. The current situation of a divided Korea is mentioned but not in a manner than is informative beyond showing a general dissatisfaction with a divided motherland and the comparison of abundance versus starvation. I really can't recommend this one except to those interested in compiling lists of actionmovie clichs which is about the only joy a viewer will derive from this film. At 2 hours long the director has given himself enough time to pack this film to overflowing with them. It's not even original enough to be a true turkey in the classic mold. It's just boring.

But first Why or what makes them enemies? it is definitely not personal hate eg i hate u because u are an insufferable    but rather the hatred of each other's ....belongingfor the lack of a better word. Come on u're both koreans! y the need to fight each other so? yes i know y. but still... So you see it can be called a tragedy in it's purest form and that alone is enough for a thrilling movie. The notion of two people the same yet so different. however this show gives so much more. THE 'LAST' SCENE Heehyun's last stand I cannot give enough praise as to how well done the last scene is done how simple the filmmakers kept it yet being able to deliver such a emotional punch. Watching the making of the musing of the actors as to while deciding the ending who shall kill heehyun and the character study made by them were excellentheehyun haswantsneeds to die she doesn't want ryu to kill her. Yet to Ryu   if u were to die then i'll rather be the one killing u. it would be too painful for him to watch her being killed by someone else. Not to mention the technical Parametersthe acting and the music! slow mo and the Absolute sadness on each character's face as they pointed their firearms at each other. The music wails on as the confrontation unfolds and the looming of the painful fact that a choice have to be made and either wayS it would not be a happy ending. So many other great scenes the conversation of Park and HeeHyun whereby Park throws her a gun and she willingly 'shoots' herself and the struggle that follows Park 'explaining' his stand on blowing up everyone 'have u ever seen parents eating the dead flesh off their kids' and many more. Finally yes many ppl sees it as just another carbon copy American blockbuster movie yet how can that be when it possess one of the rarest cinematic characteristics? The power to stay in one's mind long after the DVD is kept haunt and cause one to be in a perpetual daze while thinking and pondering about it nonstop have the events play over and over in one's mind philosophizing and dissecting each look word and reaction. Yes this is a true piece of masterwork on every level indeed. on hindsight yes the shooting scenes were pretty unreal. a max 22 bullet mag pistol against fully automatic machine guns? against a FEW fully automatic maybe semi. but still!! maching guns?".

So many other great scenes the conversation of Park and HeeHyun whereby Park throws her a gun and she willingly 'shoots' herself and the struggle that follows Park 'explaining' his stand on blowing up everyone 'have u ever seen parents eating the dead flesh off their kids' and many more. Finally yes many ppl sees it as just another carbon copy American blockbuster movie yet how can that be when it possess one of the rarest cinematic characteristics? The power to stay in one's mind long after the DVD is kept haunt and cause one to be in a perpetual daze while thinking and pondering about it nonstop have the events play over and over in one's mind philosophizing and dissecting each look word and reaction. Yes this is a true piece of masterwork on every level indeed. on hindsight yes the shooting scenes were pretty unreal. a max 22 bullet mag pistol against fully automatic machine guns? against a FEW fully automatic maybe semi. but still!! maching guns?";

There is a good mix of drama and action here. One of the South Korean agents is engaged but she doesn't know what he does for a living. The other is obsessed with finding Hee the assassin. There are some nice running gun fights with handheld camera work that emphasized the chaos. I really would have liked to see at least one decent car chase though. Well acted all around and the direction by Kang Jegyu Tae Guk Gi who also wrote the script was very solid. There is one very sudden twist at the end that really makes you take notice and that really makes the film more than your standard actioner.".

However in South Korea the film that was number one at the box office was Shiri an actionpacked film that would go on to set South Korean box office records and force the Hollywood juggernaut to take notice that films produced in other countries could compete with the likes of Titanic. In the end 17 of South Korea's entire population would go to the theater to watch Shiri and it also received accolades in other Asian countries and helped revitalize the South Korean film industry whose government imposed that South Korean films had to be shown at least 106 days a year so that it could compete with foreign films and it also put on the road to stardom Choi Minsik and Han Sukkyu.Shiri opens with scene after scene of the brutal training endured by those who wish to become members of the 8th Division an elite force of North Korean Commandos. Amongst these individuals is a young woman named Lee Banghee who not only surpasses her male counterparts in fighting skills but who is unmatched in her marksmanship. With her weapon of choice she perfectly severs the spinal cord with one shot and obliterates the heart with the next. Surviving her training Banghee is sent to South Korea and assassinates several important political figures until suddenly disappearing. However one day she returns and seems to be up to her old tricks again. Two special agents are assigned to her case Yu Jongwon and Lee Janggil however she continues to foil them time after time. While searching for Banghee who has recently assassinated an arms dealer and a scientist who were working together under the table Yu and Lee soon learn that the 8th division led by their old nemesis Park Muyoung is plotting to steal a new weapon called CMX which is ten times stronger than an average bomb liquid and virtually undetectable and are unable to stop Park when he successfully does steal the CMX. Park calls the agency and informs them that ten sites in Seoul are set to be destroyed by the 8th Division. If this scenario wasn't bad enough it is taking place right at the same time the leaders of both South and North Korea are planning to attend a soccer match in which the North and the South play each other.Combining action romance and melodrama Shiri is quite an engaging film that can be appreciated on many different levels. Due to its success a number of clones were produced that did not quite live up to the original but they helped revamp the slumping South Korean film industry to show the world that blockbusters do not only originate in Hollywood.".

It is an underrated gem my personal favorite sequel in the Scream franchise series. It is an improvement over the second one. Sidney Prescott is a such a badass you have for the first time in the movie an explosion you see a house been blowed up. The plot and the story is set the first time in Hollywood. I love that it is an original story it does not copy the second or the first film it doesn't mess with the first two movies. It does finish the trilogy and brings an ending conclusion to the franchise. I enjoy this film I love this film to death. Wes Craven did a great direction debut. Ehren Kruger replaced Kevin Williamson thank god and he did much better job to make an original story and make an conclusion to end the trilogy. I love with what happened next with the characters Sidney now is a crisis counselor I liked that. Ghostface returns he has unfinished business with Sidney and he wants her back. Dewey Riley is now working as an film adviser In Hollywood. I love his character this time around David Arquette was better actor in this movie. I love that they did something new with his character he wasn't annoying he wasn't useless he was good. He shot with a hand gun and killed the killer on the end a real hero in this movie. Patrick Dempsey as detective Mark Kincaid was great he was likable and I have enjoyed him. I love his character. I love Jenny McCarthy as Sarah Darling she was believable. The movie was not dull lame or repainting the same story again it had less humor more horror mystery and action it was mixed it had that what the second movie didn't had. The story is set three years after Scream 2 Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell who has gone into selfimposed isolation following the events of the previous two films is drawn to Hollywood yet again she returns again to face the past and find out who is responsible for her mother's death. The new Ghostface begins killing the cast of the film within a film Stab 3 and has a score to stale with Sidney Prescott. Dewey Riley and Gale Waethers are trying to find out who is responsible for the killings. Gale has an unlikely sidekick Parker Posey as Jennifer Jolie. Courtney Cox is excellent as always as Gale Weathers. 1010 I personally enjoy this sequel it is my favorite sequel in the franchise. Lance Henriksen is in this movie too and he is believable. I love the setting the story and I love Sidney she is a badass and I love happy ending I love the trilogy to death and I love this movie to death sue me!".

	schema:headline " The weak link of the series";
	schema:reviewBody "The Scream series became a popular series with critics and audience due to the fact it was a selfaware slasher film that knew the clichs of the genres whilst still working as a slasher film. But the third film of the series is considered the weak link of the franchise.After the events of the Woodsboro and Windsor College a third film is being made in Hollywood to complete a trilogy. But a new killer is stalking has donned the Ghostface mark targeting both the film cast and survivors of the Woodsboro killings leading to Gale Weathers Courteney Cox and her exboyfriend Dewey David Arquette to investigate as Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell is forced out of hiding after she suffers from visions of her deceased mother.The Scream series has always had a selfawaremeta element to it but with Scream 3 its satire is taken a step too far as it takes jabs against Hollywood. The big jokes are about the production include constant rewrites to the film suffers an actress saying she is playing a character that is 14 years younger then her a music video director forced to make Stab 3 as his directional debut before he can make the film he wants actors having to sleep with people to get roles and producers debating violence in films influencing reallife violence. The film just got too meta as an actor and the person she is meant to be playing arguing and talking about the rules of a trilogy. This is a film was much more focused on being a satire on Hollywood as a whole then a spoof of the horror genre.Tonally Scream 3 is lighter then previous films. There was always a comic undercurrent to the series but it becomes much more pronounced in Scream 3 with the characters interactions and the deaths themselves were less gruesome and more overthetop particularly with a house getting blown up which was done in a unrealistic way and there is a sequence when Ghostface throws hi s knife and the handle hits Dewey on the head. There was even an occasional comical musical moments in score and a very overt cameo from the characters Jay and Silent Bob.I found the best bits were when Scream 3 was more serious when we see Sidney living an isolated life in the countryside with tons of security and works as a women's crisis counsellor it felt like a good continuous to her story. But it does not blend well with the more comic tone and the film as a whole was struggling to justify her presence in the film. There are long period where she is not involved in the film she is not involved at all in the first act and forces a reason to be in the film.Much of the problems of the lay at the feet of the new writer Ehren Kruger who replaced Kevin Williamson.

	onyx:emotionText "The Scream series became a popular series with critics and audience due to the fact it was a selfaware slasher film that knew the clichs of the genres whilst still working as a slasher film. But the third film of the series is considered the weak link of the franchise.After the events of the Woodsboro and Windsor College a third film is being made in Hollywood to complete a trilogy. But a new killer is stalking has donned the Ghostface mark targeting both the film cast and survivors of the Woodsboro killings leading to Gale Weathers Courteney Cox and her exboyfriend Dewey David Arquette to investigate as Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell is forced out of hiding after she suffers from visions of her deceased mother.The Scream series has always had a selfawaremeta element to it but with Scream 3 its satire is taken a step too far as it takes jabs against Hollywood. The big jokes are about the production include constant rewrites to the film suffers an actress saying she is playing a character that is 14 years younger then her a music video director forced to make Stab 3 as his directional debut before he can make the film he wants actors having to sleep with people to get roles and producers debating violence in films influencing reallife violence. The film just got too meta as an actor and the person she is meant to be playing arguing and talking about the rules of a trilogy. This is a film was much more focused on being a satire on Hollywood as a whole then a spoof of the horror genre.Tonally Scream 3 is lighter then previous films. There was always a comic undercurrent to the series but it becomes much more pronounced in Scream 3 with the characters interactions and the deaths themselves were less gruesome and more overthetop particularly with a house getting blown up which was done in a unrealistic way and there is a sequence when Ghostface throws hi s knife and the handle hits Dewey on the head. There was even an occasional comical musical moments in score and a very overt cameo from the characters Jay and Silent Bob.I found the best bits were when Scream 3 was more serious when we see Sidney living an isolated life in the countryside with tons of security and works as a women's crisis counsellor it felt like a good continuous to her story. But it does not blend well with the more comic tone and the film as a whole was struggling to justify her presence in the film. There are long period where she is not involved in the film she is not involved at all in the first act and forces a reason to be in the film.Much of the problems of the lay at the feet of the new writer Ehren Kruger who replaced Kevin Williamson. It felt like Kruger was trying to copy Williamson's style and directed Wes Craven wanted to remake New Nightmare. The characters did feel a little compared to the previous movies and the satireselfaware elements of the film was not as sharp to the first two movies.The acting also felt weak with many of the actors either phoning in their performances or shouting and screaming including a scene where the Stab actors end up acting clichd horror victimstargets.Whilst Craven's directing is solid for the most part a big criticism some of the sequences involving Ghostface's attacks looks like there was more then one killer but the conclusion shows there was only one killer.At the time Scream 3 was originally meant to be a conclusion for the series and it was a disappointment due to poor script and overly comic tone.

Written by Ehren Kruger based on characters by Kevin Williamson. Running time 116 minutes. Rated R for strong horror violence and language.By Blake FrenchScream 3 is not as satisfying as the original horror masterpiece Scream but what can we expect from the final chapter in a slasher trilogy? The first film was a superior horror thrillerone of the most loved slasher movies of the past decade. That was a picture with some hard standards to live up to. However Wes Craven director of the trio accomplished another success with the sequel of Scream. Usually this kind of movie would fade into the Hollywood recycle bin by now. But Scream 3 still produces chills thrills and lots of surpriseseven though we have been receiving the same kind of story for the past four years. This film is marginally passable although the most flawed film of its series that fairs as recommendable but not substantial in quality. The film's opening once again provides the audience with a precredit murder sequence that is almost the highlight of the entire production. The Scream 3 writers take advantage of one of the movie's old and important characters to arrange this very effective and scary sequence.The setting is several years after the second film. The small college town of Woodsboro is where we are placed. Neve Campbell again stars as Sidney Prescott a tormented young woman who was the target of the killing sprees in the past. She has attempted to move on with her life with her father and has an anonymous hotline operation that offers assistance to those in need. Also television reporter Gale Weathers Courteney Cox Arquette has experienced a big career jump now working for a network called Total Entertainment. While the wrongly accused murder suspect of Sidney's mother Cotton Weary Liev Schreiber has his own trashy TV talk show.The central presence that connects the events here is the production of Stab 3 Return to Woodsboro a movie the characters are creating that follows a horror trilogy based on the terrors experienced by Sydney. The masked murderer may or may not be found on the set. Besides police Detective Kincaid Patrick Dempsey and the arrogant bodyguard Stone Patrick Warburton concluding the list of suspects there is Dewey Riley David Arquette a former cop who is now an advisor for Stab 3 Roman Bridger Scott Foley the film's director John Milton Lance Henriksen the film's producer as well as acting counterparts Sarah Darling Jenny McCarthy Tom Prinze Matthew Keeslar Angelina Emily Mortimer Gabe Tucker Deon Richmond and Gales's reciprocal Parker Posey.Certain plot points lead our suspicion to believe one of several characters is the killer. We are fooled again however. But does the killer's identity really matter here? As long as we receive a speech on why he or she is responsible we would be satisfied and any of the character's could have been the killer. None of the characters have any shape or construction. We care only about the order that the victims will be picked off at not about who hides behind the ghost mask. The identity is actually pointless when the slasher is finally revealed. Once again a key success in Scream 3 is the scary sequences that build up momentum and thus work well usually where the slasher kills his victims. What makes these scenes so effective is how we know that characters are three dimensional they put up a firm fight for their lives unlike victims in most slasher films. However the plot seems to revolve around the murders instead of the murders branching off from the story. Stab 3 seems to be a central presence to connect the film's somewhat desperate through line. Some of the plot points are fun and revealing. We see a videotape of a past character describing the possibilities of the movie's final outcome. This event programs our imaginations to suspect the unexpected. The plot does desperately attempt to fill in missing pieces of the previous screams however showing some signs of contrived foreshadowing. Each scene moves the story forward though replenishing the plot with freshness and ability around every abrupt corner. Scream 3 is a close call and is given somewhat of a mixed review but I still am giving the movie a marginal recommendation. It contains more startles more surprises and more effective scary material than most slasher movies.  Although I believe it was a wise move to make this film the final installment of its series.Brought to you by Dimension Films.".

So I didn't know what to expect and my expectations might have been higher for SCREAM 3 than the others. After all this is supposed to be the grand finale as advertised.

Sidney Prescott who has gone into hiding is discovered by the killer. She goes to find Dewey for protection. Gale Weathers also returns when she learns of what is going on. Cast members of the Stab 3 movie start to get killed as the killer straight out of Sidney's past closes in on Sidney for the grand finale.I thought this story line was better than in SCREAM 2 because it was not too similar to that of SCREAM which SCREAM 2 was. This movie really had the grand finale feel and I know all about how Kevin Williamson didn't return for SCREAM 3 so if they do make a Scream 4 I don't think it will work and although the plot was similar it seemed to be more of it's own movie than SCREAM 2 was.The acting was just as good as in SCREAM and SCREAM 2. Cambell Arquette and Cox did their usual good jobs. The small part that SCREAM 2's victim Randy Meeks played by Jamie Kennedy did on video was priceless. It was one of my favorite parts of the movie if not my absolute favorite. Scott Foley did an excellent job. The cameolike parts done by Lance Henriksen and Carrie Fisher were cool and Liev Schreiber did an OK job for the small part he had. And of course Roger L. Jackson did great as the phone voice.I was praying throughout the movie that Sidney Dewey and Gale would survive. I am sure and I certainly hope that this is the final SCREAM movie and I really hope that the three of them survived even though Randy said it was possible that they could die. Obviously the character development that was done to them throughout the SCREAM trilogy was welldone.I hope that there are no more SCREAM movies because it really did end on a highnote. I also hope that the SCREAM trilogy will be remembered as one of the greats along with the STAR WARS trilogy and the GODFATHER trilogy because it certainly deserves it. Go see SCREAM 3 in theaters now you'll love it.".

Scream 3 closes the trilogy just fine it's got bags of energy and a glint in its eye now if only I could get a copy of the uncompleted Stab 3 off the internet  and if only there wasn't to be a part 4 further down the line... 710";

Like the first one it was fast scary funny and took some nice satiric jibes.  Even the much debated identity of the killer in the second one made sense as a satiric swipe at horror movies so it didn't bother me.  I didn't know if they'd be able to keep it going for a third movie especially when hearing Kevin Williamson's involvement was going to be minimalhe's a producer and he wrote an outline which eventual writer Ehren Kruger worked from but I liked the first two I was especially pleased to see Scott Foleyfrom FELICITY and Parker Posey in the cast and I was intrigued to see what happened.  In retrospect I probably should have waited for video.Certainly the opening shows a little promise instead of the usual celebrity cameo we have a spoof of that with Cotton WearyLiev Schrieber who's now a Geraldotype talk show host complaining about having to do a cameo in STAB 3the movie within a movie here so we know it's spoofing itself.  The problem of course is we know Cotton's going to get killed but Craven is able to draw suspense throughout the scene.  We also get the stated purpose here during the phone callwhich also a bit clever starts out with a woman's voice before the familiar tone of Roger L. Jackson as THE voice kicks in the killer wants to find Sidney.Sidney of course is living in seclusion under a new name and barely going outside the housewhich of course is under heavy alarm so at first she's almost like an afterthought to the movie.  Instead the center is on Gail Weathers the tabloid reporter now an entertainment reporter who uses her reporter skills to play detective when Cotton is killed and she decides to assist the police specifically Detective KincaidPatrick Dempsey in the case.  Then there's Dewey who's a technical advisor to STAB 3 the movie and they of course worry about what's going to happen.There's all kinds of potential here and it's directed well but it isn't written as well as I think Williamson would have done.  There are scares which still work and while the DeweyGail relationship seems a little old hat the two Arquettes obviously like working with each other and their familiarity with us helps smooth that over.  Also while Campbell is disconnected she's still sympathetic and while she doesn't have the same fun with herself as she did in the first one I understood that.  And there is humor most of it coming from Posey as the actress playing Gail in STAB 3 few actresses can make contempt funny like she can.  There's also the standard satiric bitethe bodyguard who guarded Julia Roberts and Salman Rushdie but ends up toast here.But as I said it isn't written as well and the primary weakness is the killer.  In some senses I guess having the directorFoley be the killer makes sense because he has the technical expertise to handle things.  But it seems to come out of nowhere and perhaps to distract us from that Kruger gives us the idea of him being a longlost relative of Sidney's which is ridiculous.  Perhaps because of that too Foley goes way over the top which is funny at first but then becomes tiresome.  Also Kruger cribs not from other horror movies here but from the first SCREAMthe cloning of the cell phone being a prime example.  And while Williamson's red herrings were pretty clever this one seems not thought out.  Emily Mortimer's charactershe plays the actress who plays Sidney is a perfect example there are two indications she might be the killerthree if you count the woman's voice to Cotton and yet she's killed off almost as an afterthought.  Finally as to compensate for all of this there are a lot more killings to cover up.  Which begs the question if all he wanted was to find Sidneyas stated early on several times why not just take Dewey Gail and Cotton et al hostage?  The first two movies mocked the Idiot Plot Rule this one mostly personifies it.It's a shame because there could have been something made from all thisoh almost forgot Dempsey who I normally don't like is surprisingly good and also unrecognizable here.  But this certainly doesn't break any rules. Even the Jamie Kennedy cameo seems obligatory rather than fresh.  This suggest they should have stopped at the second one.".

I thought the first Scream was funny original scary and witty. after seeing the first one several times I was so excited to see the second. But i came out a little disappointed. There was no way you could've guessed one of the killers. I found that the killers were minor characters as in Scream1 they were not main but have good screen time and was not that scary. But the more i watched the movie the more i liked it. So by the time i heard about the third in the Scream series I was counting down the days till it came out. I ended up seeing it the day after it came out with my best friend. I found that it was scary original and had some really good fight scenes and unforgettable characters PARKER POSEY'S JENNIFER JOLIE. The voice changer this time was really unique and very clever. I also thought the buddyhatredness  between Courteney Cox and Parker Posey was hysterical. Mainly i thought Parker fueled most of the movie with her comedic preformances. I thought the ending at Roman's birthday was truly the best. And i was also surprised to see Jenny McCarthy give such a good performance for just the short time she was in it. David Arquette also gave a good performance along with the rest of the cast.  Neve Campbell was great with her lines like It's your turn to scream hole! and You want me mother come and get me! I found those to be effective if not cliched. So if you are a fan  or not of the Scream series you MUST i repeat MUST see this movie. I will guarantee you will have a good time watching it as i did. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Scream 3 takes us to the Northern California hills where Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell is living in seclusion and immense fear due to the traumatic events that she survived in Woodsboro and at Windsor College. Meanwhile a Hollywood movie studio is producing a film called Stab 3 the third installment in a movie series based on the events that Sidney has survived. But when cast and crew members begin to die off one by one it seems another killer has returned and goes after the fragile Sidney who is having terrifying visions of her dead mother. Sidney teams up with Gale Weathers Courteney Cox and policeman Dewey David Arquette two people who survived the massacres with Sidney and try to uncover the new killers identity which may be linked to Sidney's past.The last installment in a very popular horror series Scream 3 brings this trilogy to end on an entertaining but rather weak note. The script for this film is nowhere near as good as the other two which is unfortunate considering this film was the finale of the series. It would have been nice to end the series with a better film  not that this sequel is unbearably bad but it could have been better. I will admit there are some decent scare moments and a handful of suspenseful scenes but it seems to me that there's almost too much going on in this sequel for it's own good. The script juggles the Sidney character Sidney's past the DeweyGail relationship the cast members of the Stab 3 movie and more and the jumping around hurt the film a little. It didn't seem to have a central point within it and that was a problem for me at least.Besides the problems that it has I still have to say that I enjoyed this movie mostly because of the entertainment factor. The writing wasn't amazing but it did manage to continue to have some nice plot developments and a few good twists plus some decent scares and more slight mocking of the genre and it's rules. The setting is mainly Hollywood so this film has a completely different atmosphere than the second or the first film. I'm not sure if it necessarily hurt the film but it seemed a little too Hollywood for me. The cast is good here with more returning characters and some new ones as well mainly added for body count while the others do develop somewhat during the movie. The twistending which is the revelation of the killer's identity made sense in terms of the story but I found it to be a little unsatisfying.All things considered Scream 3 is an enjoyable but problematic ending to an aboveaverage horror trilogy. You'll be entertained undoubtedly but this movie can't compete with the second or the first films because it just isn't as good. I enjoyed it for the most part and I have trouble overcriticizing it but most people will agree when I say that it can't compare with the original film. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie begins with Cotton Weary driving in L.A. while talking on a cellular phone.  And of course someone clicks in and you can only guess who it isthus begining the traditional Scream opening murder suspense scene. Sidney Prescott has moved down to the Los Angeles area and has basically gone into hiding working out of her house as a crisishotline operator. Gale Weathers is the same as always of course as a bitchy tabloid news anchor.  She has written a new novel though which is what the movie inside Scream 2 STAB is based except Stab 2 has already been released and they are in production of Stab 3.  Dewey is also on the scene as a type of helper on the set.  One by one the cast of the film turn up murdered according to script.  The old hollywood mansion as the final scene makes a great setting as the surprise twistfinal deaths take place.  Definately a satisfactory ending that kinda wraps it all up with some great cameo appearances especially with the video of Randy that was a great touch to keep the 'trilogymovie buff' type of thing in the movie. The movie goes back to its roots and fills in all the little holes of the first one. Of course the movie may have been a little better with Kevin Williamson's touch but overall it was still great.  I went into the movie without having very high expectations at all.  I am a very big fan of the original Scream yet going into Scream 2 I was expecting it to be very good and I was extremely disappointed with the outcome.  So going into Scream 3 I just didn't set myself up for the disappointment.  But I was very very pleased it was AWESOME Go see this movie if you are a fan of the original.I'd give it a 9.5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Scream 3 does not have the same writer of the first two which explains the lack of comedy it had compared to the first two Scream films. It does not have the same great dialogue as the first two nor the witty and playful tone. However saying that Scream 3 is probably still better than 95 of slasher films today. It has suspense and mystery and although it sometimes goes overboard with how the script handled the 'actual' history of Maureen Prescott I think it overall works well. Neve Campbell once again gives it all she has and the supporting characters are actually well rounded especially Parker Posey which gives the film it's much needed humor. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are both solid but I cannot help but question how much their characters or maybe their motivation as actors changed since it really does seem that both feel awkward in a lot of scenes. I suspect it is the writing since a lot of their brilliant dialogue from Scream 2 was missing. Saying that and while it is true that it is the weakest of the trilogy it is still a lot of fun and does have it's clever moments here and there. I do not think there can ever really be a 'bad' Scream film.".

It not only takes the p!ss from other scary movies but also takes the p!ss out of itself and the Scream films. You get a perverse enjoyment out of the actors playing the characters from real life eg Parker Posey doing a Courteney Cox impersonation. It sort of reminds me of that Seinfeld episode where the characters of the pilot episode Jerry interact with the real life Seinfeld characters.There are plenty of brilliant inhouse film buff jokes too eg Jay and Silent Bob making an appearance and a Carrie Fisher lookalike.Anyhows  this is a horror film  and although there are a couple of scares  it doesn't reach the terrifying level of the original. And the film seems pretty tame on the gore front! But if you go in with an open mind ie don't be expecting it to be as good as the first and you might have fun.".

No you did not misunderstand what I said the VERY end of the movie after the killer is revealed to be......Sorry can't spoil it! is a magnificant wrap up. The movie opens with the death of Cotton Weary and his girlfriend Christina Kelly Rujtherford.  We are then transported to the foothills of California where Sidney has taken up a career as a abuse hotline operator. She soon learns of Cotton's death and fears the worst.  The police are down playing the murder as a copycat because Cotton is now a very successful talk show host and one of the  most hated. Soon one by one the cast and people related to the movie are being killed off in the order they are murdered in the script.  But the killer is a true believer ibn Auteur theory of film and tends to make last second rewrites. The death scenes in this movie take a back seat to what the film is realy about.  The wrapping up of the entire franchise.  There is only onbe killer this time around and everything from why Billy and Stu were attempting to kill Sidney to who really killed her mom is reveled.  The climatic end takes us to John Milton's mansion which is kind of a West Coast Studio 54.  The mazes and intensity in the climatic 40 minutes is truely wonderful.  The very end of the film is heart warming and should bring a load of applause from the theater you see it in. So this is the end to the series that made us laugh cringe and gasp in terror.  I for one am glad I was able to witness all three in the theater and take my hat off to everyone involved in making these wonderful films.Grade A".

The heroine beautifully played by Jeanne Balibar travels to meet her dead father's mistress Bulle Ogier who helps her to choose freedom over love and passion. No wonder this film hasfailed to find a distributer in France! Flashbacks are used to good effect usually with a window or mirror as point of entry. He should get an award for 'Best use of Hats' I found the idea of desire passing from one person to another by means of a hat really effective. The film is slow beautiful and quite without the slightest trace of humour.".

Right off the bat this film offers something interesting by having the antagonist as the main character. There's a lot of interesting content here which includes story and character development. The viewer really needs to pay attention to the details in order to understand everything that is going on which creates a thoughtprovoking experience. The pacing script does do a good job of slowly revealing the antihero's personality  which is oddly charismatic. I've never been a fan of Hideaki Ito but even I'll admit that he gives a fantastic performance here. The structure of the film also makes it difficult to predict which students will survive if any. Miike is perhaps at the most assured phase of his entire career as he has become one of the most reliable directors in the world today. Needless to say the direction is solid.Now there may be some controversy regarding the longsustaining finale that uses a certain kind of graphic violence against school kids. Despite the somewhat repetitive nature of the deaths they do have a disturbing essence due to similar reallife events. Most ironically there's also some dry black humor present which could offend some viewers. In any case the finale is deliciously entertaining and exciting.If one adds Lesson of the Evil to Goosebumps The Movie Horror Stories Kotsutsubo and the final installment to the Hellsing Ultimate anime films it looks like 2012 is going to be a strong year for Asian horror.".

Miike's genius is to treat everything so matter offactly the film is almost banal to begin with before letting rip. Although extremely violent this isn't torture porn but a brilliant slowburner than builds to a fairly devastating and disturbing climax. I certainly can't see this playing in parts of America where school shootings have become almost common place. By making the villain someone who in another film. should have been the hero Miike neatly subverts the genre think Dexter.

	schema:reviewBody "LESSON OF THE EVIL is a relentless remorseless look at pure evil. It is so brutally violent it numbs you into submission and you are unsure how you should react to it. There is little joy in watching the film though there is dark black humour throughout but it stands as a unique testament to infant terrible director Takashi Miike's crazy view of the world. The film's first half is almost as restrained as the second is violently eruptive. The setting is an elite private school in Japan where teachers and administrators discuss the prevalent problem of students cheating during exams mostly using their cell phones. Numerous solutions are proposed but the most radical comes from Seiji Hasumi the charming popular English teacher who suggests body searches and signal jammers but who's notions are rejected as being counterproductive to keeping the schools environment healthy. Undeterred Hasumi continues keeping tabs on students and learns of widespread bullying harassment and illicit teacher student relationships. You think he's going to turn into some kind of saviour and the films tone seems to be heading this way but then and there is no fine way to describe it Hasumi goes psycho. He explodes into a violent killing machine during a nightly school function exacting brutal death wielding a shotgun pumping bullets into anything that moves and talking to his demons to leave little doubt he is a complete loony.Knowing a bit about Takashi Miike and the reputation that precedes him this midway shift should not be surprising or even considered a spoiler. His films are almost exclusively violent of that there is no doubt but they revel in tasteless torture porn that is not for the squeamish. LESSON is no different and if anything the overlong period of exposition detailing the tribulation of a small group of students at the school seems overcooked in contrast to the rushed extended finale which is really where Miike displays his skills as filmmaker. Hasumi is molded in the fashion of television's DEXTERa likable serial killer with a wide grin and charismatic looks to match who is also extremely lucky in giving anyone investigating the deaths a slip. But while the last hour is a lot of fun at one point Hasumi off's countless students wearing a rain jacket and swaying to the jazzy tune of MACK THE KNIFE it is indescribable nearly unwatchable and after sometime repetitious to the point of being unbearable. And just when you think there might be some end in sight Miike turns a moment of hope into a Michael Haneke moment of viewer patience testing ala FUNNY GAMES. If that sounds like your cup of tea you know you're in for a good time.".

The story is pretty ridiculous but it manages to be unexpected and thrilling its also gory and pretty funny it had the whole audience laughing.On the other hand it was kind of messy like every other Takashi film but these messy sequences and flashbacks are relieved by other scenes with interesting music choices that fit perfectly into whats going on even adding a little humor to it and some dance moments and funny dialogue by the students at the wrong moment. It felt similar to the first Scream and reminded me in some ways to the ridiculousness in Robert Rodriguez movies.I'd recommend it to people who liked Django Unchained Battle Royale Machete Videodrome A Clockwork Orange or any Takashi Miike film.".

His flamboyant personality however is only a mask that hides his true face which ultimately surfaces when he decides to tackle the issue of bullying  bad behaviour among the student body with his own deranged plan.Written  directed by Takashi Miike Lesson of the Evil has all the bizarre elements that one usually expects from this notorious director but the story is just allout flat vapid  lifeless despite all the gore content it packs in. For the majority of its runtime it's just one segment placed on top of another with no idea of where it's supposed to be headed until it arrives at its extended climax where it redeems itself a little.It's in the last 30 minutes or so where the movie finds its sure footing but it's a long wait to get there. The entire climactic segment has blood smeared through each n every frame and is possibly the only entertaining segment in the story and while it has the ability to shock  upset the newcomers it's also fun in its own wicked manner for those who are pretty much used to this director's works. If only it was like this from the start.On an overall scale Lesson of the Evil is a brutal violent  disturbing nightmare if one only takes the final act into account for the remainder of the story only turns it into a very boring thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "Another high schoolthemed thriller from Japan based around extreme violence and death and directed by maestro Takashi Miike no less. LESSON OF THE EVIL is no BATTLE ROYALE however it's nothing like an entertaining action movie instead more of a suspense thriller along the line of CONFESSIONS. The story sees an idealistic teacher at a school who goes out of the way to see that things with his pupils are running smoothly. God forbid you get in his way however....LESSON OF THE EVIL starts off deceptively slowly although the plotting is never less than engaging. The first hour is a slow burn building up realistic characters surrounded by some extremely dark subplots where bad taste seems to be the order of the day. It's typical Miike in fact difficult to define and freshfeeling throughout. It's towards the climax where things go absolutely crazy with endless jawdropping violence of the variety that would have been instantly banned by British censors back in the 1980s. These day it passes uncut with nary a word...how times have changed eh? And thank God for Miike for his consistently highquality direction and filmmaking skill.".

OK the plot is a bit of a slow burner at the start but soon picks up into an easy to follow story line some might find the subject matter hard to stomach but the acting is superb and the gory violence very believable at times. it is hard to compare another film like this where the acting and dialogue go so well together and the lead actor is a joy to watch perfect casting.in my opinion better than battle royal and probably my fave film due to the acting and crisp and psychotic performance a gem.".

It has a strange construction. It's very slow to start. We're almost halfway through the film before the signature Miike violence kicks in. And then it's very pedestrian. It was very reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's movie 'Elephant' based on the Columbine school shootings. That was a tedious movie so too is this one. The psycho teacher wanders round the school with a high powered rifle wasting his pupils one by one. There is no tension. He just shoots them. When he has shot them all ... the police arrive. Huh? And then to cap it all .... before the credits roll ... we see the caption 'To be continued ...' I really couldn't imagine why anyone would want to see a second installment of this tedium.".

	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike one of Japan's most biggest horror movie guru is finally  back with Lesson of the Evil. Will his absent be too much or will he  come with something extraordinary which will give us shivers up our  spins? Well at the International Film Festival Rotterdam IFFR we had  the chance to see the movie. Mr Hasumi English teacher at a Japanese  secondary school is every teenager's dream. He is handsome friendly  and cool. He is also popular among the other teachers because of his  clever methods of combating cribbing. Mr Hasumi defends his pupils he  efficiently tackles a gym teacher who can't keep his hands off the  kids. His motives are however far from altruistic. That's no surprise.  The viewer knows right from the terrifying start that disaster is  looming. After some more events Hasumi shows his true colors and starts  an rampage within the school.  For the ones expected a real horror kind of movie you will be  disappointed mainly because this isn't one. It is a grim tale about bad  aspects in life and which harmful situations you can come across. But  it is a typical Takashi movie it again is an reflection of things that  are going down in society and all the horrors it can produce. I am not  sure if Takashi wanted to make a statement or just give us another bold  and bloody movie. After the movie develops it gets more in your face by  the minute showing you what harmful products human being are to one and  other.  Visually the movie has some nice shots in it you can see Takashi has  matured on cinematographic things of his movies. Which for me really  started to show in Crows 0 and 13 Assassins. He tries to put down at  least the character Hasumi in different lights and really develops the  character in the first part of the movie. You will feel that the  students really are cannon fodder as the story develops and the  subplots are completely destroyed in the second part of the movie. You  can see this as a good thing or a bad thing for me it was good to see  his main focus was on Hasumi and not all the others. Although 2 hours  was abit on the long side and makes the movie drag a bit from time to  time.  As I mentioned the second part of the movie is where Takashi shines  again in his old ways. You feel the tension rise as Hasumi is changing  into a not so perfect and lovely character. Hasumi comes to school and  starts playing people out to each other at first in an none harmful way  just to set up his master plan. As he does this he gets involved with a  student and tries to extort another teacher for having sex with a  fellow gay student. After his set up he takes his skeet gun and starts  literally shooting the whole class and more! Blood goes everywhere  students getting shot full in the face and Hasumi does it with a laugh.  Let me say it one more time BLOOD goes everywhere no resources are  spared to throw in the blood! You can say it is literally shooting  skeet without remorse all the little subplots of the students are being  shot down. Which was remarkably easily done two loved ones trying to  get back to each other just before they do they both get blown away  with all the visual violence to go with it.  You can say that this is maybe one of Takashi's most straight forward  movies there isn't a deep underlying story to be found here. As  Takashi tries to convince us with some Scandinavian folk story it isn't  enough to persuade us to believe there is more. The movie is in your  face and focuses on the extend of the violence in the shooting. Of  course with all the shootings at school lately this topic isn't for the  faint hearted since it really blows everyone away. This isn't his best  work but it is a signal the master of extreme violence is back and it  makes a mark! Just make sure you get through the beginning.".

The story is about a teacher who appears nice but there is something about him. He is almost too nice and cartoony a real dream teacher. Everything is going great till certain characters begin to look into his past that's when things really start to move. The film is long being over 2 hours if i remember correctly. The film covers topics such as bullying child abuse multiple personality disorder and builds up to one crazy second half which i will not spoil at one point it gets quite surreal and whilst being violent is not very gory. Unfortunately it does the possible sequel thing which i believe likely won't come. The only problem with the film is it may drag if you are in the wrong mood and the music gets a little repetitive the only song it plays is mack the knife the original and the American version. It is very cartoony in the acting style and almost feels like an adaptation of a manga or anime. story 35 acting 45 gore and effects 35".

Secondly there does not exist at time of writing any kind of sequel or continuation of the piece  something it seems to infer will be the case as it closes. Was this a result of the director a certain Takashi Miike holding up his hands and admitting he'd dropped the ball with this project? If one or both of these reasons is the case then it would not be very hard to work out why. Certainly viewing Lesson of Evil half a decade after its production in the wake of various world events such as the forming of the Islamic State of the Iraq and Levant is unpleasant  one critic writing for Variety Magazine cited as to how the film left him cold after having seen it in the wake of the Anders Breivik perpetrated massacre in Norway in 2011. Others have pulled it up for its poor attention to pace wherein the film plods along in its depiction of a mundane highschool relations drama before inexplicably exploding into the sort of exploitationlike shockfest one might expect Miike to lend his name to. Unfortunately for the gorehounds there is some 90 minutes of uninspired backlog to sit through first...To divulge too much on what precisely it is that constitutes said shockfest would be to spoil things which in one sense is the problem a dilemma is faced having seen Lesson of Evil and that is as to whether you view what takes up the bulk of its final reel as the perfect dizzying conclusion to a tautly made film about realistic people going about their lives in which case you are going to reward the film generously or whether you believe it to be gratuitous nonsense in which case you must provide the film with a rating as lowly as possible.Annoyingly I have sat on the fence  I was repulsed and perhaps a little offended but I did not switch the film off in a fit of anger the song over the film's closing credits seems to beg us to ...think about it and I have done and I am still unsure what to make of what I have seen. While perhaps you could say it was similar in tone and content  flashes of raw violence inbetween a lead's regimented existence  the film is not necessarily ABOUT ANYTHING in the way American Psycho was and Miike has certainly not made a film with the flair or zeal of something like Taxi Driver.The setting is an everyday Japanese highschool small groups of kids hang out and muck around turning firstaid classes into a bit of a laugh. Teachers are frustrated at kids for cheating during exams via cellular phones. One particular elderly teacher is singled out by the pupils for their own private game of ridicule because of the way he clears his throat. In amidst all this is Hideaki It who plays English teacher Seiji Hasumi. He seems friendly. He chats to female students without appearing lecherous catches one pupil reading a comic book in class but doesn't go ballistic and takes early morning jogs. Things become a little more complicated around the school when a parent is adamant nobody is doing anything about a bullying problem his daughter is suffering and rumours of an abusive relationship between a gym teacher and a female surface. After this Hasumi himself has to deal with an advance from one of his own female pupils and then.... people begin showing up dead in apparent suicides. Miike has essentially made one long drama set inside of a highschool chock full of all those daytime soap opera clichs but decided to drop into proceedings a series of mysterious deaths which turn out to be the work of a psychopathic serial killer with rooted connections to the school and its personnel. Half of me wants to dismiss the film as gratuitous nonsense which forces us to sit through a truly harrowing passage of film whereby lambs are essentially led to a kind of slaughter under the pretence of safety and security. Filmmaking in the traditional sense appears to go out of the window during these scenes as a bloody freeforall is indulged in to a poppy soundtrack of crooner music and the disturbing interior miseenscene of a kindergarten. Nothing is necessarily under the microscope and if there is anything at all to be said I missed it. The other half wants to commend it for being a tautly made drama which burns and burns before erupting not unlike Carrie into the graduation ball from Hell. It is not without its moments whereby Miike demonstrates his ability as a filmmaker  one particular scene whereby a student is at the mercy of the psychopath and tied up in a darkened classroom at night is shot to a slowly rotating fan inside of an airvent which periodically casts light and shadow on the room thus bringing to our attention the stark nature of the lifedeath situation. Whether you enjoy the film or not will be dependent on two things your threshold to being patient and your threshold to being tolerant of controversy in art. In the modern world tolerance towards prophetMuhammad cartoons the censoring of the nword during daytime broadcasts of The Dam Busters the periodic banning of Grand Theft Auto games in Australia etc. and attention spans are on the fast decline which might infer as to why Lesson of Evil struggled with some critics and most audiences. While I would recommend Lesson of Evil I would do so with caution.".

Nothing is necessarily under the microscope and if there is anything at all to be said I missed it. The other half wants to commend it for being a tautly made drama which burns and burns before erupting not unlike Carrie into the graduation ball from Hell. It is not without its moments whereby Miike demonstrates his ability as a filmmaker  one particular scene whereby a student is at the mercy of the psychopath and tied up in a darkened classroom at night is shot to a slowly rotating fan inside of an airvent which periodically casts light and shadow on the room thus bringing to our attention the stark nature of the lifedeath situation. Whether you enjoy the film or not will be dependent on two things your threshold to being patient and your threshold to being tolerant of controversy in art. In the modern world tolerance towards prophetMuhammad cartoons the censoring of the nword during daytime broadcasts of The Dam Busters the periodic banning of Grand Theft Auto games in Australia etc. and attention spans are on the fast decline which might infer as to why Lesson of Evil struggled with some critics and most audiences. While I would recommend Lesson of Evil I would do so with caution.";

I know the parts between the teachers and students was to build upon what a fake hypocritical manipulative person the teacher is. But it wasn't very well done and the whole thing just dragged on and on. The only somewhat interesting thing between the whole teachers and students dynamics was the whole blackmailing ordeal and how the sociopath try to capitalize on it. I personally think it should have focused in a bit more on the build up of the relationship between the teacher who is a sociopath and his partner in crime in the past. The shootout scenes was just pretty much predictable and straightforward. I am not sure why none of the students jumped the guy but yeah it's just straightforward screaming running hiding and blood. There really wasn't much creativity and there just wasn't enough build up of the characters that would make you want to care. Overall this isn't a terrible movie but there is just way better Takashi Miike films out there.510".

Of course this isn't 100 guaranteed and sadly Lesson of the Evil fails to deliver apart from the last 15 or so minutes.The film is slow. I accept we need to experience the character development of the protagonist here but at times it's like watching some late night oriental drama that has nothing going for it. True by now I know that many Japanese or Korean flicks start off slow and then hit you like a shovel in the face with a barrage of blood and gore but LOTE climaxed with a series of gunshots which was OK but just not that amazing.I expected much more from this movie as it was highly recommended to me and it cost a fair bit of money to buy. But the pay off just didn't do it for me and the way it ended was plain daft too with it looking as if we are getting a sequel. If you can get it cheap on VOD by all means give it a watch but don't pay out any big money for it. You could even skip to the last 15 or 20mins too if you get bored and want to see the good stuff.".

This one confused me at first because of the editing. It almost seemed as if the editors were in the editing room drinking sake all night yards of film accidentally fell on the floor then someone came in behind them and spliced the pieces back into the movie continuity be damned. As a result the film wasn't linear but that's okay. At least the filmmakers are willing to stretch out past the point of predictability a welcome task in any event.Sometimes with Asian horror you just have to swallow the overblown acting as presented. The screaming and crying and shivering and stunned looks can get a little irritating especially when those elements are given too much screen time. I know if someone suddenly bursts into this room shooting off a shotgun I wouldn't stand there open mouthed and flabbergasted while he has a bead on my ribcage. In other words run mothercker run! I actually liked this movie. The shooting special effects stunned even ol' me. They did a good job with that. Some of the scenes were just unrealistic though. I guess it is what it is. And now to the controversial part the ending.This movie could never be made in America. Memories of Columbine would prevent it from being greenlighted. To tell you the truth I'm surprised they allowed a film with such student carnage to be made. And because Miike was at the helm gruesome as hell. The film is daring because it has it all  pedophiles Norse legends an interracial gay relationship serial killer bonding and betrayal etc. Give it to the foreigners for making challenging cinema. They're definitely pushing the boundaries there. I would've given this movie a higher rating but it was flooded with so much clichd caricatures that it only looked like just an ultraviolent anime come to life.".

Looting burning and killing this infamous clan rode through the middle border states setting the pattern for the great outlaw bands which were to follow the James boys the Daltons and the Youngers.The Year 1866 the place is Southern Indiana.Well not quite Indiana exactly as the film was shot on location at Columbia State Historic Park and apparently some Western purists see this as a blip on the movies Western worth! hmm I don't conspire to that at all since what I want from a B Western such as this is a lush Western feel with identifiable good and bad guys. I feel that director Tim Whelan achieves the latter and his cinematographer Ray Rennahan achieves the former. Rage At Dawn does have a sense of seen it all before about it but that's not in detriment to it because it's possibly a picture that has been copied more than it has copied from others before it. It's nice to have a real solid Western using a proper and reliable story to work from. While using top professional actors like Forrest Tucker and J. Carrol Naish to be bad fellas obviously helps the piece as does having the genre legend that is Randolph Scott as your ebullient good guy. Scott fans who haven't seen the picture should be advised tho that he isn't actually in the film for the first third. But as always he's worth the wait and it's clever of Whelan to keep us waiting whilst fully forming the Reno legend.With some nicely staged set pieces the train scenes are well worth our time and a fabulously dark turn of events in the finale that goes against the grain shadow play supreme at work this becomes a genre film well worth taking a peek at. 710Footnote DVDPublic Domain prints of the film are low on quality and do not do justice to the location and costuming. The best print I have seen of this film was on Commercial British TV. Caution is advised on where you source the film from.".

Anyway I thought the movie was excellent and realistic well told the writing was excellent and well acted by everyone involved. What a superlative cast Tucker was excellent as evil as I ever saw him in any movie Buchanan a wonderful actor was his sly self to perfection as usual Mala Powers as beautiful as usual in what I consider an unnecessary part I wonder if this was a true part of the story in 1955 you had to have a love interest to sell movie tickets or they supposed it to be.

	schema:reviewBody "Western about one of the most famous outlaws bandits of them all . The year 1866  the location is southern Indiana  this is the true story about Reno brothers  Frank  Simen  John  Bill  being exception the good Clint  a respected farmer Denver Pyle . It's a retelling of the wild adventures that made the Reno brothers clan legendary among outlaws passing into American folklore . They were the first train robbers in American history and killing and looting . This famous gang rode through the middle border states  setting the model for the future noted bandit bunches as  Doolin  James  Younger Dalton.. Forrest Tucker and J.Carroll Naish are the leaders of the Southwestern outlaws gangs pursued by lawmen . Reno brothers join forces with town authorities  judge and sheriffs Edgar Buchanan and Ray Teal . Film starts with a fateful raid but they have been betrayed and execute a killing  burning to agent Peterson for revenge . Then  a special agent Randolph Scott along with a supporter Kenneth Tobey are assigned in order to get the bad guys  as they carry out a setup  simulating the train robbery . Meanwhile  the protagonist falls in love with gang's sister Mala Powers. The picture is based on facts that had a sad finale . As ten members of the Reno gang were lynched in three separate incidents in 1868 . The first three were taken by vigilantes from a train . Three others were lynched at a later time . They were technically in federal custody when they were lynched. This is believed to be the only time in U.S. history that a federal prisoner had ever been lynched by a mob before a trial. Good Western in which the Reno gang pull off raid banks  treasure offices  trains  and other robberies in postcivil war  Indiana . Stylish  fast paced  solid  meticulous and a violent look with numerous shootouts . Randolph Scott leaving time ago the secondary roles as when he was still playing supporting characters in top films as Jesse James Henry King  Virginia city Michael Curtiz and The spoilers Ray Enright . Scott also played a famed outlaw in Doolins of Oklahoma Gordon Douglas . The support cast makes equally notable performances . The film is shot in California State parks as it is shown on the colorful cinematography by the nice cameraman Ray Rennahan . Storyline by Horace McCoy and Frank Gruber  two usual and important Western screenwriters . The motion picture was splendidly directed by Tim Whelan coauthor Thief of Bagdag . The flick will appeal to Western lovers and Randolph Scott fans".

It's about the gang he's sent to capture the infamous Reno brothers who operated out of Indiana right after the Civil War. Scott in fact does not make an appearance until a quarter of the film is over.After one Reno brother is killed in a failed bank robbery the three remaining outlaw Renos Forrest Tucker J. Carrol Naish and Myron Healey are still very much in business. They kill an informant who was working for the PetersonPinkerton Detective Agency and plan future robberies at the home of their sister Laura who is played by Mala Powers.William Peterson assigns two new men to the job Kenneth Tobey and a former Confederate spy Randolph Scott. The rest of the story is about their capture and the aftermath.With a little research I found the story hardly sticks to the facts. Scott for instance is a totally fictional character though the Pinkertons were very much involved in the apprehension. Mala Powers is portrayed as deploring their crimes but still loyal to her brothers in fact she was quite the wild child in her day and aided and abetted the male Renos in every way. Only two of the Renos were in fact lynched in the end by a mob the character of John Reno who Myron Healey plays died in prison.One thing is true by intimidation and bribery the Renos did have a safe haven in their home county in Indiana. The three county officials who were on the Reno tab are Edgar Buchananjudge Ray Tealsheriff and Howard Petriecounty prosecutor. The three of them are the best thing in Rage At Dawn. I don't blame Randolph Scott for saying that he'd rather go after them than the Reno brothers. Scott is a cynical hero in this one part of his job in the Civil War as a spy was romancing the wives of high placed union officials so he's got no problem courting Mala Powers to get the job done. I doubt the real Laura Reno would have fallen for it. Still Scott turns in a good performance.As does the rest of the cast in this film though I will say Indiana is not the usual setting for a western. Maybe this one should be called a Midwestern.".

What hurts the movie severely and is its major flaw is the setting. Nothing about one single shot of the film looks anything like Southern Indiana or anywhere else in the Midwest and exactly like California where it was actually shot. This lack of authenticity is distracting in some scenes more than others but never completely destroys the fine performances. Like some of the others I would like to know more about the historical Reno Brothers and how closely this film represents their true story I'm sure that it's somewhat closer than Elvis' ''Love Me Tender'' which is about the same topic and came out the next year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in 1866 in Southern Indiana Rage at Dawn is based on the true story of the Reno Brothers purportedly America's first band of train robbers. In the opening sequence the citizens of North Vernon lie in silent wait for the Brothers tipped off to a bank job they intend to foil. Though one brother is killed and left behind the Reno's return to exact revenge on the Peterson Detective Agency contact who placed them at the bank with unique precision.Enter Randolph Scott as Peterson Agent James Barlow his mission along with fellow agent Monk Claxton Kenneth Tobey is to infiltrate the Reno Gang gain their confidence and put an end to the operation. Faking a thirty thousand dollar train holdup Barlow attracts the Reno's attention and gradually gets around to whetting their appetite for a hundred thousand dollar payday.The film boasts a top notch cast of TV and big screen Western veterans including Forrest Tucker J. Carroll Naish and Myron Healey as the Reno Brothers Denver Pyle as the honest Reno and Mala Powers as sister Laura providing a romantic interest for Scott's character. Fans will also recognize Ray Teal as a dishonest sheriff in league with the Reno's and Edgar Buchanan as what else but a greedily smarmy judge who coordinates Barlow's entry in the Reno circle.The story itself proceeds rather smoothly for the Peterson agents for his part Barlow's plan moves along virtually without a hitch. There are no cliffhanger scrapes for him to get out of unless you count the relationship with Laura he uses to get close to her brothers. The shootout with the Reno's does leave his partner Claxton dead chalked up to one of those hazards of the trade. Scott's character gets a chance to exhibit some heroism in the face of a lynch mob but fails to stop the town of Seymour's citizens from hanging the Reno's.I would stop short of hailing this film as a great Western as some other posters have noted. It's a passable film though not as good as some of Randolph Scott's other Westerns including Ride the High Country The Tall T or The Bounty Hunter. Filmed in Technicolor the print I viewed was rather garish at times offering orange colored gunshot bursts and blue hued night time scenes. As a chronicle of the actual story of the Reno Brothers I would have to reserve judgment as I don't know enough of the historical facts to have an opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a verymuch copied western which belongs technically to the category of Randolph Scott westerns this large and interesting body of work itself should be divided I suggest into the 1940s BW series and the 1950s color series this is one of the earlier color efforts an expensivelooking production but with somewhat inconsistent color. In several of his better efforts Scott's role was that of a law officer or detective infiltrating some group of schemers. The storyline here is a fictionalized biography by veteran Frank Gruber with screenplay by Horace McCoy detailing the events of the Reno Brothers' gang and their train robberies performed in rural Indiana c. 1866. Scott's character is Barlow a veteran Southern spy with impressive credentials. When their agent operating with the gang is murdered after the gang is set up for capture the Peterson Detective Agemcy sends for Scott to work with agents Kenneth Tobey and Ralph Moody to infiltrate the gang himself. Their device is a staged train robbery faked by the team and the promise of a 100000 payoff in the future. The ruse works Scott is accepted by the gang including Frank Reno its leader played strongly by Forrest Tucker. But immediately Scott finds he has problems. One of the Reno family Denver Pyle has nothing to do with the crimes and Scott falls in love with Mala Powers his sister who is bitter and unhappy of course when he turns out to be just another bank robber she turns against him despite their obvious attraction and his courtly manners. From this point on Scott helps the others pull an unremunerative robbery and becomes Tucker's rival to be the head of the gang. Between runs to town to report to his partners he also is introduced to the three inside men in the town from which the gang operatesplayed by fine actor Howard Petrie Edgar Buchanan and Bonanza's TV sheriff talented Ray Teal. Despite setbacks the entrapment of the gang works. In a long and welldone shootout several of the gang are killed along with Scott's partner. He is then free to reveal his the role he has been playing all along. Powers tries to shoot him at night but she comes nowhere close and ends up in his arms. Then Pyle comes to warn the detectives that a mob has been formed led by smoothtalking Trevow Bardette and Jimmy Lydon. Scott tries has to ride off to try to save the gang from being lynched. The film's ending is downbeat but historically accurate bringing to the end a memorable adventure tale that might have been made differently but is very lively and wellmade exactly as it is. The other members of the gang are Myron Healey and powerful J. Carroll Naish plus others with George Wallace as the sheriff of Seymour and William Phipps Chubby Johnson and Holly Bane in smaller roles. Director Tim Whelna did a solid if unspectacular job of directing a very difficult film with day night action dialogue interior exterior and battle scenes. The cinematography by Ray Rennahan and the music by Paul Sawtell are very fine and Walter E. Keller's art direction is above average also. I enjoy this Scott western as a transitional work and for its attempts to make a truetolife historical fictionalized biography for the mostlyimpliedlevel idea on which characters interact in this swiftmoving adventure and for the authentic look and feel of the work. A very entertaining film by anyone's standards.".

Considering how many wonderful films he made in the 1950s I certainly wasn't surprised that I liked this one.In a couple ways however this film is a bit unconventional. First Scott doesn't even appear in the film until about 20 minutes into the film! Until then it consisted of showing the exploits of an outlaw gang in Indianaa very hilly and Californialike version of Indiana where n real life I'd heard the highest elevation is reportedly 9 inches above sea level. Second the ending is just plain bizarrenot at all bad but really caught me by surprise and won't be something the average person could predict. I mention this because although the main plot of the film isn't that unusual I've seen many similar to it the thing is handled so well and offers some nice twists that make it well worth seeingin addition to Scott's usual seemingly effortless performance.Scott enters the film when he's recruited to infiltrate an evil gang that isn't exactly in the old west but Southern Indiana I lived just over the boarderbelieve me this is NOT a typical locale for a western. However as you'd expect there is a nice and semiinnocent girl who gets tossed into the mixmaking Scott wonder if it's possible for him to do his job and the girl...I mean get the girl.Overall the film is well acted and directed as well as a lot of fun. Plus it helps that the supporting actors such as Forrest Tucker and J. Carroll Naish are so good. Worth seeingand a mustsee if you love the genre.".

	schema:headline " Shabby account of the Reno Gang";
	schema:reviewBody "I quote from the message on the screen at the beginning of the film This is the true story of the Reno Brothers.....who were the first train robbers in American history. Well the film then begins with the Reno gang being shot up attempting to rob a bank with brother Bill killed. I could find no evidence that this gang ever attempted to rob a bank and no Reno brother was ever shot dead! Sister Laura is presented as a refined young woman who disapproves of her brother's criminal activities but continues to harbor them out of filial loyalty. Well the real Laura Reno was a midteen wild child at this time who supported her brother's activities whatever they might be. But we couldn't have 57 year old Randolph Scott wooing an underaged wild girl! Next thing we know the Pinkertonrenamed Peterson Detective Agency selects Scott's characterJames Barlow an exConfederate spy and notorious ladies man to head a bogus train robbery near the Reno's headquarters to attract their attention. That's right according to the film the PetersonPinkerton Agency staged the first train robbery in US history and the Renos became train robbers only at the urging of Scott's character after he was accepted as one of their gang! According to the film the Reno's one attempt to rob a train was a disaster resulting in the capture of all by PetersonPinkerton agents waiting in the express car and in the surrounding bush.Failed bank robbers and failed train robbers. That is their claim to fame? Actually they staged two successful train robberies before being thwarted by Pinkerton agents in their 3rd attempt more or less as dramatized in the film except that they were not wounded nor captured as shown in the film! Two members of the gang not the whole gang as depicteddid rob the courthouse in Gallatin MO. John Reno was recognized arrested and jailed long term as a result of this raid. Other gang members robbed a number of other courthouses in various upper Midwest states.The undramatic truth is that the other Reno brothers were captured by Pinkerton agents while hiding out in Indianapolis or in Canada.Presumablythe title of this film referes to the rage of the citizens in the regions frequented by the gang provoking them to carry out 3 lynching incidents not just the one shown in the film.As shown in the film 3 Reno brothers met their fate in the last of these 3 lynching incidents although the film got one of the brothers involved wrong. Unlike in the film no one in these large vigilante groups was ever tried or jailed for these lynchings.The Reno brothers and their extended gang were much more versatile and successful in their criminal activities than depicted in this film which portrays them as a poor man's prelude to the JamesYounger gang. Why was this gang so reviled whereas the JamesYoungers were often hailed as heroes by locals and much better remembered today? The James Gang only robbed banks and trains which were mostly owned by Yankee investors and didn't much directly impact the ordinary people mostly southern sympathizers in the regions where the robberies took place. In contrast the Reno brothers had a much more diverse criminal resume. They robbed various private businesses and a number of post offices and courthouses. In addition when they used a certain hotel for their headquarters they fleeced and sometimes murdered the guests which increased the reputation of this region as a dangerous destination for future would be travelers. Also they were assumed responsible for a rash of unexplained fires over a period of years that destroyed homes and businesses. Many of these deeds hurt the locals or local government activities rather than some far off set of investors.During the Civil War  they sometimes received bonuses for volunteering or payment for taking the place of draft dodgers then promptly deserted to repeat the process elsewhere under an assumed name.The film could have illustrated some of these activities instead of a bogus failed bank robbery! It could have also spent some time exploring their childhoods for reasons for their mass criminal personalities. The Renos were hardly poverty stricken. They had substantial agricultural land holdings which actually aided them in their criminal careers. The film does emphasize the intimidation and bribery of local law officials which much extended their criminal careers.In summary this oater should not be regarded as claimed a decent historical portrait of the Reno gang. Rather it should be regarded as just another Scottstarring yarn with an unusually talented set of supporting actors exploiting the Reno gang notoriety as a reference point.Scott plays his southern gentleman persona to the hilt in dealing with the Renos and others especially Laura. I down grade the film for claiming to be much more than what it actually delivered. It does nicely dramatize the point that vigilante justice is sometimes the only practical way to rid a community of a chronic criminal element when the official justice system fails to do so for various reasons.It also dramatizes the importance of the Pinkerton Agency at a time long before the FBI existed. This film is currently available very cheaply as part of a Scott Western Collection DVD package.".

The opening credits proclaim the film's historical accuracy. Actually it's not that accurate  not according to the entry on Wikipedia anyway  but it sticks closely enough to real events. You can tell because an entirely fictional movie would have one climax usually a shoot out. And there IS a shoot out here after undercover agent Randolph Scott arranges for the gang to be ambushed during a trait robbery but it's followed by still another climax five minutes later in which the surviving gang members are lynched.No doubt the Reno brothers were unkempt miscreants. They don't joke laugh or have fun. Their faces are sour masks. They murdered and thieved their way through life beginning in adolescence. But the movie gets a bonus point for giving them at least some allegiance to each other that goes beyond the merely functional. They're like the Clanton gang in John Ford's My Darling Clementine. They're unquestionably bad but they're rather more than incarnate evil.And they lynching scene gives them some additional dignity. They take it the way Saddam Hussein took it. Scott tries to stop the lynching but fails. In actual fact there were not three but ten gang members lynched in three independent groups at different times. There was a national uproar over the mob violence as there should have been.I don't mean to suggest that any of this is handled particularly well by the director. Neat photography and nice location shooting  nowhere near Indiana  but director Tim Whelan just rolls everything along on its formulaic track. The shoot out for instance is confusingly staged and fecklessly done. The characters shoot without aiming  sometimes without even LOOKING in the direction they're shooting. Laura Reno a real figure falls improbably in love with Scott after the exchange of a few pleasantries. But what originality there is is in the script which defines the characters in ways that sometimes very gently nudges our conscience. Longfellow was wrong but he had a point when he wrote If we could read the secret history of our enemies we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.I wish some thought had gone into the title. Rage At Dawn. I mean really couldn't they do any better than that? It's one of those generic titles. One size fits all. Guns of Darkness Another Dawn Trapped. They should have let me have a crack at it. I'd have given them something that would SELL. Agape and Malevolence in the Western Eidos. God they'd come from hundreds of miles around to see a 1950 movie with a title like that. And they'd crawl all the way if they had to  through the snow.".

Forrest Tucker plays the top member of the gang Frank while Mala Powers plays the honest sister of the brothers Laura whom Scott's character decides to romance.There's only one other movie based on the exploits of the Reno Gang which was Elvis' debut film Love Me Tender released the year after Rage at Dawn. Rage is more faithful to the true story although the special agent played by Scott is fictitious and Laura while not part of the gang wasn't squeaky clean as depicted plus she was loyal to her brothers. But the movie's accurate in that Clint Reno Denver Pyle refused to be part of the gang and was called Honest Clint not to mention the notorious ending is faithful to history albeit no one was apprehended for the crime I'm being ambiguous because I don't want to give it away.Scott is at his charismatic best here as he romances a girl that's clearly younger than half his age. Randolph was 56 during filming whereas cutie Mala was 23 ! but this is okay once you understand that Scott's character is supposed to be around 35 even though he looks like he's at least 50. Forrest Tucker is also great as the malevolent Frank Reno.Unfortunately the obvious California locations ruin the movie because the story's set in the Ohio River region of Indiana Missouri and surrounding areas which look nothing like California. Moreover the last act isn't very engaging despite the action it somehow loses the interest attained in the first two acts. Still Rage at Dawn is one of only two movies based on the Reno Gang and it's the more accurate of the two not to mention the principle actors are great.The movie runs 87 minutes and was shot in Columbia Sonora  Chico California.GRADE C".

	schema:reviewBody "The notorious Reno outlaw gang ride into the town of North Vernon in Indiana in 1866 and try to rob the bank but the good citizens have prepared a reception for them and they manage to surprise and kill one of the gang. Forrest Tucker of Sands of Iwo Jima heads up the Reno gang as Frank. His brothers include Sim Reno J. Carrol Naish of Tiger Shark John Reno Myron Healey of Combat Squad and Bill Reno Richard Garland of The Lawless Breed. Bill dies during the abortive bank robbery shot dead on the plank walk outside the bank after the gang had climbed out of a highwalled wagon that they had hidden in during the ride into town.The authorities pursue the gang on horseback to the county line where they have to rein up because the Renos control the law in Jackson County in which they live. Indeed the Jackson County authorities receive a percentage of the proceeds from each Reno gang robbery so they tolerate the brothers. Anyway Frank Reno is furious about Bill's death because he suspected that something just wasn't right when they rode into town. Meanwhile his sister Laura Mala Powers of The Storm Rider isn't overjoyed about it either. She serves as their cook and allows them to live in the house that she inherited from her parents. Laura's relationship with her outlaw brothers ripples with tension. The Renos believe that a spy must have warned the citizens of North Vernon. Initially Sim accuses their psalmsinging brother Clint Denver Pyle of The Dukes of Hazzard of informing on them but they discover that the real rat is Murphy Arthur Space of Target Earth a bartender in town who sends messages to the Chicagobased Peterson Detective Agency. Frank Sim and John beat Murphy up tie his unconscious body to a stall in a horse stable and torch the place. 'Cremated alive' proclaims the press when word of Murphy's death reaches the Windy City. After word reaches the Peterson Agency they hire James Barlow Randolph Scott of Seven Men from Now to lead the investigation. The Detective Agency boss tells one of his seasoned hands that he has recalled from Denver Monk Claxton Kenneth Tobey of The Thing from Another World that he is to follow all of Barlow's orders implicitly. According to the Peterson chief Barlow is worth an army of men. Western novelist and scriptwriter Frank Gruber of Northern Pursuit wrote the story for Rage at Dawn and crime novelist Horace McCoy penned the screenplay. This outdoors melodrama is another one of those movies where the hero stages a holdup to infiltrate a gang but Barlow plans to have the Reno brothers ask for him to join them than the other way around. Barlow is known to be irresistible to the ladies and he helps Laura when he meets her in the store and flashes his cash from the 'supposed' robbery. Meanwhile Prosecuting Attorney Lattimore Howard Petrie of The Tin Star and the sheriff Ray Teal of TV's Bonanza visit the Reno place and question Frank about the robbery. Repeatedly Frank assures them that the Renos did not rob the train but Sim observes that he wished they had waylaid the train and taken the 30thousand dollars. Frank spits in contempt at the prosecutor and the sheriff and Lattimore leave as Laurie returns from his grocery shopping. During her shopping in town she met James Barlow and he helped her carry her goods to her buggy. When two Reno gang henchmen tried to run the unarmed Barlow off he roughed them up and disarmed them. Barlow is posing as a painter. Not surprisingly when Lattimore and the sheriff return to town they have a parley with another member of the local government the judge Edgar Buchanan of Texas who is in on the graft and corruption too. Lattimore is worried because their collusion with the Reno brothers is the worst kept secret in the county. Eventually the corrupt officials get suspicious about James and Monk and drag them in for questioning. Barlow demands to see the judge and he works out a sweet deal with his honor. The corrupt officials send Barlow along with the Renos in their next holdup and Barlow shoots the gun out of a clerk's hand during the robbery. The Renos are angry with Barlow because he forced them to flee too early but Barlow defends his actions. Instead of letting the employees stand up during the robbery Barlow argues that everybody should have been on the floor. Peterson and Barlow arrange for another robbery for 100thousand dollars and Barlow informs the judge. Reluctantly the Renos agree to ride with Barlow and Monk but Sim threatens to kill Barlow once they've robbed the train..Rage at Dawn gets off to a nimble start. Director Tim Whelan introduces us to the nefarious Reno brothers in the opening 20 minutes. After Whelan and McCoy have established the Renos' villainy and the corruption of the Jackson County officials Scott makes his entrance. Before Scott shows up the Peterson Detective Agency president builds him up to Monk and his son as a titan. Previously Whelan had directed Randolph Scott in Badman's Territory 1946. Moreover in 1950 Scott and Tucker costarred in The Nevadan. The Nevadan had a similar plot with Scott going undercover. Ostensibly Rage at Dawn is just another disposable western shoot'em up. Nevertheless Scott Tucker Naish and a veteran cast are a pleasure to watch and Whelan paces the action agreeably enough in this solid if uninspired oater. Most of the DVD versions of this public domain western are fullscreen but you can tell from the pictorial compositions that the screen ratio wasn't 133.1 but was probably either 1.66 or 1.78 because characters are cutoff in the frame. Ray Rennahan's color photography gives this oater an epic quality. Beware of the PMC Corporation DVD version the lips are not synchronized properly with the dialogue.".

James Bond author during his time in the commandos during WWII and really should have been much more of an espionage movie and less of a 'let's all do or die'. The story also really fails to even manage that also as the resultant feeling of the movie when all is said and done is kind of a 'let's barely manage to do and also pretty much all die' story instead.Sure realism is an important point in a war film as those that sugarcoat it too much or simply turn into weird fantasy come of feeling really false think of the apparently druginduced nonsense of Kelly's Heroes but that doesn't mean to say it has to make you feel utterly miserable as many parts of this movie do.With the inclusion of the Danny Dyer character from the stockade and pending courtmartial the training sequence in a bare landscape somewhere in England the parachute drop into enemy territory the maniacal SS squad hunting down the heroes through to the main mission and final escape to freedom there seems to be too much borrowed from many other films The Dirty Dozen Where Eagles Dare etc..There are whole sections of this film that seem to be missing in the final cut which make things a little rushed and not to mention confusing. During the training sequence of the film Dyer's character is punished for being a good marksmen and subsequently told that if he had failed in his training and was being sent back to the stockade. 'Why?' you are left asking as there has seemingly been no cause for to be necessary as we haven't seen Dyer misbehave be rude to anyone or fail any training task he has been given.We also assume that Bean' and the Sgt characters are killed or captured during the final stages of the movie but we just don't know as it isn't part of the film nor is the airdrop into Norway where we lose a character due to a broken neck presumably on landing.My strongest dislike in the movie was the overuse of the 'F' word by pretty much all the squaddies NCOs and officers as it just isn't necessary. One sentence from the Sgt's mouth was around twenty words long and over half of them where the 'F' word and I know from stories told to me by my late Grandfather who was a WWII serving DrillPT instructor in the British Army that bad language was not permitted and quite often meant disciplinary action with the strongest language being permitted being around the 'bloodyhell' mark.Besides all that the movie had the potential to be so much better and fails to deliver on so many levels that I would suggest people avoid it at all costs something I very rarely say about a movie.I give the movie a 2star review as I personally reserve a 1star for the truly awful but also feel obliged to add that if this film's plot cast and editing where a whole 100 better than in the final release I would still not consider giving it more than a 4star vote.Final Words do yourself a favour and watch the classic Where Eagles Dare instead of this movie as it is a truly awesome movie with everything that Age Of Heroes should and could have been and a whole lot more!".

There was one quite harrowing scene where the local villagers were shot by the Nazi Occupying Forces but the ending fell flat. Nonetheless will seek out the sequel in 2012. Recognised a young Guy Burnet as Rileybut he was unable to add little to this movie as far as the script allowed the guy he gifted an OK performance however as atommyfighting for KingCountry.

Good early scenes up in Scotland a good opening scene with Danny  his platoon in northern France heading for Dunkerque and later memories once the film is set in Norway in winter of Heroes of Telemark. There was one quite harrowing scene where the local villagers were shot by the Nazi Occupying Forces but the ending fell flat. Nonetheless will seek out the sequel in 2012. Recognised a young Guy Burnet as Rileybut he was unable to add little to this movie as far as the script allowed the guy he gifted an OK performance however as atommyfighting for KingCountry.

But regardless of those two this movie is so mediocre.Acting is OK  if you won't laugh seeing Sean is waving dagger instead of sword. Shots are alright but don't expect to see 40s London or anything low budget. Effects are... Yes there are some effects in this movie not too many though and mostly 2d.What is totally awkward is the plot. Some strange training and preparations. Then endless shooting evil Nazis doing snuff movies shooting explosions more shooting exploding Nazis. And then finale quick as if they run out of tape long walk to Sweden takes 5 secs. Some characters die obviously but we don't really know or see how. To sum up don't expect great entertainment. This movie is low budget or some kind of financial con. If you like shooting and explosions or exploding Nazis then rent it.".

Jones travels to the Dashwood Military Prison to bring the soldier Brightling Stephen Walters and he brings also the insubordinate Corporal Bob Rains Danny Dyer then the commando heads to Scotland to be trained. When they fly to Norway they are discovered and the plane crashes. Six members of the military unit and the specialist survive to the attack. When they accomplish their assignment the naval pickup is not possible and the survivors without supply and little ammunition need to walk to Switzerland in a dangerous journey through a land occupied by German forces.Age of Heroes is a nonoriginal film of war but a good action film. The story is a combination of several wellknown war movies The Wild Geese Inglorious Bastards The Dirty Dozen The Guns of Navarone and others with a promising beginning and a disappointing conclusion.Sean Bean is among my favorite actors and he has a great performance as usual. The acting indeed is pretty good but the screenplay needed to be improved. I still do not understand why Jones shoots his own man with a precise shot instead of the sadistic officer that is torturing him. My vote is six.Title Brazil Comando de Elite Elite Commando".

Definitely worth taking in this film which never feels like it is dragging on. The screenplay and soundtrack are pretty much on the money. The leader of the German team that are on the heels of the Commandos is particularly convincing as the villain and has an underlying evil appearance and you sense that he will do something horrible at any moment. A decent film in most areas although the ending did seem a little light to me but wasn't out of place if that makes sense.

Guys became commandos in this movie were just a bunch of hothead yoyos who were so easily to cry yell shout... and their physical conditions one of the guy was so skinny to carry out a dubious mission were also very bad and weak absolutely unqualified for a tough and dangerous mission. Went to the severe Scandinavian weather and terrain with poor preparation inappropriate winter gears logistics fighting skills.There was nothing special of their mission because it's so vague not Nazi's underground heavy water or atomic bomb development factories. The storyline was just a very thin straight line so predictable and so boring. The movie just used Sean Bean to fool us to watch it but the weak screenplay simply didn't give him anything to look great or even good. This is a very bad imitation of those great war movies but failed from the very beginning never took off in the air 50 feet high and immediately crashed. Watching it was like chewing the same gum over and over for two hours.".

Guys became commandos in this movie were just a bunch of hothead yoyos who were so easily to cry yell shout... and their physical conditions one of the guy was so skinny to carry out a dubious mission were also very bad and weak absolutely unqualified for a tough and dangerous mission. Went to the severe Scandinavian weather and terrain with poor preparation inappropriate winter gears logistics fighting skills.There was nothing special of their mission because it's so vague not Nazi's underground heavy water or atomic bomb development factories.

	schema:reviewBody "When I heard Danny Dyer say they were trying to recreate an oldschool British war film with Age of Heroes I was sceptical to say the least. Even the title seemed too syrupy.The key to the success of our classic war pictures is their sheer simplicity  films with names like The Cruel Sea and Went the Day Well? drew on simple plots and simple settings. Now with directors able to call on the previously impossible effects of CGI the temptation to go large must be overwhelming and in doing so that magical key might be lost.It rarely gets simpler than my alltime second favourite Ice Cold in Alex where John Mills leads a small party to safety across the Libyan desert with the promise of an icecold Carlsberg as their final reward. That's the plot. And then take Virginia McKenna's understated portrayal of heroic SOE agent Violette Szabo in Carve Her Name with Pride where possibly the biggest expense was the hiring of a warsurplus Lysander aircraft. I'm not saying big is bad but when we do make them big we tend to make them messy and confused. Struggle through the cast of glitzy characters and the175 minutes of A Bridge Too Far and you start to wish the US Airborne will come and rescue you from the cinema. Obviously there are exceptions. The five minute singleshot Dunkirk beach scene in Atonement was breathtaking and told the story better than it has ever been told before.But if the Brits were to make a war film on the scale of Saving Private Ryan we would probably end up with a sickening celebrity fest set in a stately home where everybody has expensive flashbacks to their war gone by.With a limited budget Age of Heroes director Adrian Vitoria had to literally call the shots when he found the cost of blank ammunition too expensive. How can we compete? he asks. The idea for me was we can't really compete as a fullon action movie but maybe we can readdress the idea that the British were involved in the Second World War and because I have a knowledge of that period and British Commando units I thought it would be interesting to portray those units and look at their legacy  which is what we have today in Afghanistan. Danny Dyer who plays the lovable Cockney hardnut Corporal Rains says he loves the film's simplicity. There's no tricks or gimmicks. It's not Hollywood. But he was staggered to see someone counting every blank he fired. I thought we're making a fking war film! But it is what it is and I'm very proud of it.With a modern take on The Dambusters in the making more British directors are likely to seek inspiration from our current austerity and add that authentic underdog feel to the kind of films we make best. These tend to fall into four groups the propaganda films made during the war  Life and Death of Colonel Blimp a prime example to get us knuckling down to the new concept of Total War. Those made immediately postwar were invariably based on officers' bestselling memoirs like Douglas Bader's Reach for the Sky or they turned excellent novels like Elleston Trevor's The Big PickUp into appallingly proEstablishment cornballs like Dunkirk. But in the 1960s the tales of ordinary folk began to filter through and along came simplicity itself in The Long and the Short and the Tall and prime examples of the dogged British character with The Password is Courage . Arguably the worst of the bunch came in the 1970s when everything went Technicolor. But some stand out like the hightension AngloAmerican blockbuster The Eagle has Landed. Director Adrian Vitoria's Age of Heroes passes muster as great British war film. To hold it up against the classics of the past is to ask a lot but it works so well on every level that it slips neatly into my AllTime Top 10.It also bares more than a passing resemblance to another recent lowbudget success. The King's Speech captured a very British sense of time place and decency and so does this new postCrunch take on the British war film. Danny Dyer says the film harks back to a time when ordinary people were called on to do extraordinary things. That's why I like the title Age of Heroes he says. Because that's what it was. It's about spirit and heart. Putting yourself in these situations and having to deal with it.For my AllTime Top 10 British War Films go tohttpcivilwargb.typepad.comalanpearce AlanNPearce".

	schema:reviewBody "In the fall of 2010 I spent a short time on the set of an independent film called The Boarder which was being shot in rural Nebraska. And one thing that I did learn while mingling amongst the technicians and actors was that even in something as aestheticallydriven as a motion picture and with something passionate as a subject matter it is still entirely possible for things to sour up and become impersonal. Moviemaking is not easy and the stress I'm afraid can wear out the artistic drive in some of us especially if it's an early endeavor. That very well may have been the case I'm afraid to say with Adrian Vitoria's Age of Heroes.Again it's hard to imagine a film based on a true story to be passionless and impersonal but that is the case here. Age of Heroes is loosely based on a World War II British commando unit's mission to garner Germany intelligence. The particular mission was drawn up by Ian Fleming who would later go on to write the James Bond novel series. So a story about men who risked and gave their lives even in a shoestring budget film like this is hard to imagine as soulless. But it is.The way this movie is filmed acted scored and executed it's as if the filmmakers simply pulled the story out of a box full of potential stories and decided to roll along with it. Because it was their job not because they particularly wanted to. Filming the battle scenes in this movie must have been very difficult and unfortunately the stress the directors and technicians had on them is apparent. It can be felt and as a result the scenes meant to be whitehot have a sort of staged phony feeling to them.There are worthy actors in the movie headed by Sean Bean but not one of them as a real part to act. What little personality they have is drawn straight out of previous war pictures. The key example is a tough commando sergeant played with zest by William Houston really just a pale imitation of the muchmoreimpressive gunnery sergeant from Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket back in 1987.If the film can be redeemed it is in that it does not appear to aim particularly high. It doesn't have a big goal so it doesn't accomplish much and the failure isn't quite as compounding as it otherwise might have been. And a brisk 94 minutes Age of Heroes was already over by the time I was really starting to grow bored.".

It's set in a medieval like world where people hunt dragons for their vitriol fire juice? that helps run its machines and lamps. CGI dragons boats that run on roads and the usual crappy script. The acting is OK Glover was a little over the top Vinnie Jones was surprisingly OK the story was predictable the pace was slow at times but not too bad. All in all a mediocre movie about dragons. Not as thrilling as Reign of Fire but not as horrible as Dungeons and Dragons. I would say it's slightly worse than Eragon if that's any indication.

They're not biggest actors in the world but they are likable fellows who certainly know how to entertain audience.Reason 2 I like steampunk and fantasy genres and the movie was promising to mix those two.Reason 3 I think that MobyDick is one of those literature classics that is hard to dislike or hard to be unknown for almost anyone even the most uneducated people so it is always interesting when another version of the story occurs on the screens.So I had 3 great reasons to watch the movie. Favorite actors favorite genre and the masterpiece on which the story is based.I don't know how they managed to screw this but EVERYTHING in this movie went wrong right from the start.Actors who knew how to act had nothing to work with. Main character was screaming and begging for overacting and Danny didn't deny him the pleasure. Jones tried to act his biggest mistake but that's not what we love him for so he failed. Other actors weren't actors at all. Maybe they have diplomas but they didn't act. Oh... and the chick... well the chick was hot.The movie is steampunk without steam and it's fantasy only because there are dragons. I can understand how the vagonship thing moved though. It was this vitriom or something that made it move but they never say a thing about it. The screen was absolutely stripped off by fantasy elements as well. The action was almost nonexistent landscape and surroundings were cheap and the world didn't have anything that makes you dig deeper into the particular universe's lore. Well... at least the chick was hot.While the plot was based on MobyDick it was stripped away from most interesting points lowered down to some stupid cheap revengestory and all the weight of explaining the meaning of the book was thrown at Glover's back. The old man just can't carry that much. Well the bright side of this was the fact that the chick was hot.What else can we tell about hour and half of my lost life? That this movie will hardly please anyone except guys who were paid for making it.I was going to give this movie 2 stars instead of one for only reason The chick was hot... BUT... God damn it... We didn't even see her naked...".

It was horrible rank even by SyFy channel's low standards.You don't need a huge budget to make a wonderful Science Fiction movie if you have a good script. The Man From Earth is an outstanding example. A cast of eleven and no special effects yet it was marvelous. This had a comparatively huge budget with costumes sets scenes special effects explosions everything except a decent script.We all know that SyFy loves to inflict bad movies on its audience. Why it only chooses such rank scripts I have no idea. But this one should have been rejected even by them.

Jones tries to summon some gravitas by constantly suckling on this wee pipe of his and it looked ridiculous. The other male actors are underwhelming at best.

Her acting is the worst.The screenplay is just clown shoes. But the real highlight of this thing is the ship. It looks like a carrack without sails but wheels instead. It moves forward by means of ... erm nobody knows. At the very least they should have lampshaded it. But no.This thing is only a 210 because the dragon special effects are somewhat decent. Somewhat.

The whole movie was painful  the only thing that was fair in it was the dragon effects but it disappointed there to i would expect a lot more damage from a 3 stories tall beast.And I think the script was took straight from the book no editing  no nothing. It hurt my brain while I was watching it so spare yourself the pain and don't watch this movie. I hope this year will bring more quality movies from now on because if more movies like this one will be produced I will refuse to watch another movie again...and you should do the same";

	schema:headline " A rather good fantasy movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the very low rating this movie had received here on IMDb I still decided to give it a go. Why? Well because it was a movie with dragons and I do like fantasy movies and dragons as well and also because I have been playing Dungeons  Dragons for some odd 25 years or so by now so anything that just remotely smells like something in that genre does spark an interest in me.I am puzzled at why the movie have scored such a low rating. I found the movie to be rather good. It had a good story and yeah it is basically just a remake of the Moby Dick story. But so what? Hollywood have pumped out remakes of old movies by the dozens these last couple of years so why not also another remake of Moby Dick? One that wasn't as bad as the 2010 Moby Dick movie! In Age of the Dragons you just change the white whale out with a white dragon and set the story into a fantasymedieval setting. I found it interesting enough. And also there was a very great feeling to the environment as they had really managed to capture the essence of what I believe a fantasymedieval setting with dragons would actually be like of course I am leaning much on my Dungeons  Dragons experience here.The effects in Age of the Dragons were great. The dragons looked real and believable as did the wyverns. However one thing did jab a thorn in my side. As an avid roleplayer of the Dungeons  Dragons game I am accustomed to white dragons breathing intense cold not fire. So that was sort of something that didn't sit well with me. But of course I am familiar with the stereotypical mythological approach that all dragons breathe fire so it was alright. Just would have been cooler no pun intended had it been a breath of deadly cold instead.As for the acting in Age of the Dragons well I though people did good jobs and they had managed to put together a rather good ensemble of actors and actresses actually. The role of Ahab was played by Danny Glover and I think he actually pulled this off quite nicely. But also Vinnie Jones playing Stubb Corey Sevier playing Ishmael Sofia Pernas playing Rachel Larry Bagby playing Flask and Kepa Kruse playing Queequeg did great jobs. I especially enjoyed Kepa Kruse's performance and his somewhat odd character that really brought some flavor to the movie.Age of the Dragons was also a movie full of visual treats. The town was nice to look at and it really had that unique touch to it making it believable as if you were there in fantasymedieval times. But the scenery once the group ventured out into the wilderness in search of the great white dragon that was just breathtakingly beautiful. I do love the scenery of snow and snowclad majestic mountains.I was a little bit puzzled by Ahab vessel. A huge metallic boatlike vehicle? Alright sure great enough idea. But just how was the vessel propelled? What forced the wheels to go round there was no sign of any type of engine mechanical or alchemical of any sorts. And also the vessel looked rather small when seen outside but inside it seemed to easily fit the entire crew and then some. So in my opinion there was a matter of questionable reason in the dimensions of this odd vessel.But aside from that then I found Age of the Dragons to be rather interesting and entertaining. And if you do like fantasy movies then I definitely would recommend this movie despite it being a remake of Moby Dick.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to say there are spoilers in this review but that would be a bit like writing a review of Titanic and wondering whether you should mention the ship sinks. In other words...bloody obvious to everyone. So with this latest SyFy I'll never get used to that spelling without giggling at the idiocy of it effort it will come as little surprise to anyone familiar with their movie outings that it is beyond awful.For a start it seemed like it might be a valiant attempt by SyFy to do something worthwhile. Retell Moby Dick with a fantasy setting as a backdrop and make the whale into a dragon. Cast Dany Glover and Vinnie Jones and make it for SyFy at least halfway respectable.However once the novelty of Hermann Melville's classic transposed to fantasy wears off the viewer is left hunting for things that make the effort of sitting and continuing to watch worthwhile. Sadly the only thing that made this possible for me was the presence of Vinnie Jones.Now Vinnie is hardly what you'd call an accomplished actor. With his accent looks and rep he's limited to thuggish hard man roles. At least SyFy didn't try to play him against type and here as in his other similar roles he carries off the role quite well. No awards but his enthusiasm is infectious and it kept me watching.At least right up until his character perished.After that it becomes painfully obvious that the rest of the cast including Glover have about as much chance of carrying the film as a paper bag has of carrying water. And like the metaphorical bag the movie becomes a soggy mess that falls apart very quickly.Beyond dear Vinnie's character's demise the movie quickly becomes stale and dull. It becomes a chore to watch the rest of it. The acting is wooden apart from Glover who mugs atrociously and seems intent on playing Ahab as an Alzheimer's sufferer. But the rest are no better.As for the effects they are about as convincing as you might expect for the SyFy channel which is to say grimaceinducing. Is it only me that yearns for the good old days of stopmotion animation? But even the CGI dragons have more acting talent than some of the cast.All in all not a very good movie. In fact pretty awful. A nice premise ruined by bad acting shoddy effects lack of money and most of all lack of people who care about what they are doing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rambo III the third sequel it is my fourth personal favorite action film of the 80's in the series of the three. I love this film to death It is an badass kickass action film. It is my second favorite action film in the Rambo series. I grew up with this movie. I love all Rambo movies to death there is no bad Rambo movie in my opinion. I love Sylvester Stallone's returning as the legendary John J. Rambo. The first hour has more character development but the second hour has a badass action. It has a fast pacing and goes fast around. Rambo with his Hoyt Archery bow and C4 tip arrows are memorable for me. Rambo fires his explosive C4 tip arrow at the helicopter gunship and destroys the Russian helicopter that is my favorite scene in the film. I think it is the most judged and underrated action movie of the 80's badass kickass action film.Rambo mounts a oneman mission to rescue his friend Colonel Trautman from the clutches of the formidable invading Soviet forces in Afghanistan.Rambo hunts Specnaz commandos in the cave with bow and arrow blue cyalume light. Fires with his bow an arrow an attached blue cyalume light at the Soviets commando in the cave. He hunts Specnaz commandos with C4 tip arrows. Rambo uses M203 grenade launcher with AKM destroying an army truck. Rambo destroys the chopper with soviet heavy machine. This is my childhood movie the movie I grew up with it. Rambo is my favorite comic book hero. It was my first film I saw in the Rambo trilogy. As an action film I love it and I am going to judge as an action movie.They don't make movies like this in the movies anymore. Sylvester Stallone is in his best shave of his life he goes under tanks and drag him self that was really difficult but Stallone was muscle so he made it. Rambo has a new survival knife a modified bowie designed and I love how he uses to cut barbed wire on the base perimeter. I love the fight between Rambo and Kourov Randy Raney and which Rambo uses a fly kick I love that in the film. Rambo climbs the wall without climbing equipment that is memorable and favorite scene of mine.The film was directed by Peter MacDonald and written was by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich who made 4 movies with JeanClaude Van Damme. Jerry Goldsmith return for the music score the last time for the film it was good but I have enjoy in the second film more. Rambo III is a fun action sequel the Deseret scenes in the film were cool. I love that Sylvester Stallone reunited with Richard Crenna who did an excellent performance and Jerry Goldsmith who returned for making a score for this film. Peter MacDonald directed well not bad at all and I love his direction.Rambo III is the most underrated kickass action film I love it. I love Rambo First Blood Part II to death I love love First Blood to death and so damn much ever I love Cobra so much because it was directed by George P. Cosmatos I also love Rambo 2008 to death which is my third favorite film in the series. I enjoy the film it is in my fourth rank in the Rambo series but doesn't make this movie a bad one it makes it really good I love Rambo 3 to death.".

	schema:headline " Not terrible but...";
	schema:reviewBody "With the highest budget of the three movies the movie certainly looks expensive with an epic scope at times. But you never quite get the feeling that the movie settles into a comfortable groove. Though the action sequences have plenty of gunshots and explosions the way they are filmed  and edited  doesn't have the right impact or flow like the action sequences in the second installment. In another comparison to the second installment the story  while as sparse as this one  certainly kept moving. Here there are a number of segments that move very slowly andor don't seem to have much purpose. The movie should have gotten down to business. The uneven flow of the movie also suffers near the end as if the movie all of a sudden decides it needs to wrap things up in a few minutes making the final battle almost come out of nowhere. In fairness to the director it should be pointed out that he was a sudden replacement after original director Russell Mulcahy was fired and had only ONE DAY to prepare to helm the rest of the movie.Like the previous installment there is some dumb dialogue but this time around it's not delivered in a slight tongueincheek manner. If they had been willing to show this time around that they weren't taking things so seriously it would have helped. You might say that the actor playing the Russian commander is not playing things seriously but he goes SO over the top that he's embarrassing.It's watchable but disappointing  they had the chance to make a kickass action movie here.By the way the Afghans that Rambo helps in this movie are NOT the Taliban. People seem to forget that Afghanistan is made up of a number of different tribes. You can tell these particular Afghans are not the Taliban because among other things the women are not completely covered and the men play the traditional Afghan game with horses and a goat's skin forbidden by the Taliban.".

	onyx:emotionText "With the highest budget of the three movies the movie certainly looks expensive with an epic scope at times. But you never quite get the feeling that the movie settles into a comfortable groove. Though the action sequences have plenty of gunshots and explosions the way they are filmed  and edited  doesn't have the right impact or flow like the action sequences in the second installment. In another comparison to the second installment the story  while as sparse as this one  certainly kept moving. Here there are a number of segments that move very slowly andor don't seem to have much purpose. The movie should have gotten down to business. The uneven flow of the movie also suffers near the end as if the movie all of a sudden decides it needs to wrap things up in a few minutes making the final battle almost come out of nowhere. In fairness to the director it should be pointed out that he was a sudden replacement after original director Russell Mulcahy was fired and had only ONE DAY to prepare to helm the rest of the movie.Like the previous installment there is some dumb dialogue but this time around it's not delivered in a slight tongueincheek manner. If they had been willing to show this time around that they weren't taking things so seriously it would have helped. You might say that the actor playing the Russian commander is not playing things seriously but he goes SO over the top that he's embarrassing.It's watchable but disappointing  they had the chance to make a kickass action movie here.By the way the Afghans that Rambo helps in this movie are NOT the Taliban. People seem to forget that Afghanistan is made up of a number of different tribes. You can tell these particular Afghans are not the Taliban because among other things the women are not completely covered and the men play the traditional Afghan game with horses and a goat's skin forbidden by the Taliban.";

John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean thats a bit like having a film where the heros an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didnt Steven Seagal ....Despite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet  Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called  Migratory genocide   a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as  Ethnic cleansing  . Theres other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen  of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone  but as youd expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who cant shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isnt played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship . The previous director was under the impression that the Soviets and Viet Cong use American Hueys Setting the record straight  A lot of people prove how ignorant they are of the Soviet  Afghan war by confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen  Translated  The soldiers of God    and the Taliban  Translated  The students of God   are entirely seperate things . The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s  took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders  None of them called Bin Laden  most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in 199596 . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qaida terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day".

As the cold war ended over night this appeared to hamper this Rambo's already out of date story line box office success. That said paradoxically it has made Rambo more significant and highlights how quickly an alliance can shift which may stick in some viewers throats satirically or not.Richard Crenna once again plays Col.

Again Stallone is in obscene physical shape for this instalment and is 100 committed to his role as Rambo. There's a brief appearance by Kurtwood Smith who gives the usual effective performance. Sasson Gabai and Spiros Focs are part of an effective supporting cast. However the Russians are an array of forgettable extras and Marc de Jonge Colonel Zaysen just can't escape from the stereotype script he's been given.Rambo 3 is very watchable but in retrospect it's fraught at times by diplomatic changes of the time even more so in today's climate and ironically this takes the fun out this instalment.Jerry Goldsmith's score is once again excellent and MacDonald who was handed the directing reigns last minute does his best. There are a few stand out scenes all of which display Stallones refined abilities a stick fight and horse game. Nevertheless Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich screenplay is all comic book dialogue. The film looses memento in the second act and by the third you don't care who lives or dies.

	schema:reviewBody "Third entry directed by Peter MacDonald with lots of frenetic action and plenty of blood and violence . Thrilling and moving Rambo episode in which he goes to Afghanistan to rescue his former Vietnam superior commandant  Colonel Samuel Trautman  Richard Crenna . The famous trilogy was subsequently completed by the recent  John Rambo  a definitive improvement and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand  nevertheless the best considered is the original . Violent movie with Rambo character who started in First Blood and launched Stallone career going on his successful Rambo episodes . Sylvester Stallone as brawny hero Rambo is topnotch  he was a previous Green Beret  now retired and living a pacific existence in a Buddist temple itself was a real temple in Thailand undergoing renovation at the time of filming  also many of the Monk extras were in fact real Monks from that very temple who were paid to appear as extras . We see Rambo's scars from First Blood the scar on his right arm caused by the fall through the trees and Rambo First Blood Part II the small scar right above his left cheek caused by the heated knife scraped by his eye. He has retreated to a easy life in a rural Thai location  taking part a stick fighting match  and in construction site of a Buddhist temple . Here Rambo again has his usual enemies  the Russians  who control a particular sector of Afghanistan battling Afghan rebels  the Mujahideen who are fighting the Soviets in the SovietAfghan War . Rambo goes behind Russiandominated enemy lines too rescue his former colonel from jail  he had been taken while delivering Stingers  the problems that the Russian forces faced with American Stinger missiles as described in this movie were very real and accounted for hundreds of Russian helicopters during the real war . As John Rambo joins a warrior named Masoud Sasson Gabai  whose character is a reference to a reallife leader of the Afghani resistance against the Russian occupation and a kid to venture behind enemy lines where Trautman Richard Crenna was abducted by the ruthless Russian general Marc De Jonge . He then frees the prisoner but the cruel General and his soldiers set off in pursuit and carry out a brutal massacre and Rambo leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares  puts dangerous traps in the desert and mountains . Rambo appears threatening  lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers .From the beginning to the end the comicbook actionpacked and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement  for that reason the picture is pretty amusing  furthermore contains lots of explosions and some of the best action scenes ever made  including an impressive machinegun attack  spectacular scenes with helicopters and impressive ending battle between a tank driven by Rambo and a Mi24 HindA helicopter . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel one army man  however here is no female role in the main cast and few women appear in the film . With its 63m budget this was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release . The outdoors are spectaculars  the landscapes have been filmed on location in Bangkok Chiang Mai  Buddhist Monestary Thailand  Tel Aviv  Eilat Israel Fort Yuma Indian Reservation Yuma Arizona USA . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by the cameraman John Stanier . Splendid and rousing musical score by Jerry Goldsmith  series' usual  though composed by means of synthesizer . This nailbiting film was well played and produced by the great Silvester Stallone along with Carolco  Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna  being professionally realized by Peter Donald who subsequently directed another vehicle for Jean Claude Van Damme  Soldier of fortune . Original director Russell Mulcahy was replaced after two weeks of filming due to creative differences and three cinematographers also succeeded .The motion picture was preceded by the original First blood by Ted Kotcheff with Richard Crenna  David Caruso and Brian Dennehy in which Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully imprisoned and he pulls off the breakout  Rambo II by George Pan Cosmatos with Martin Kove Steven Berkoff and Julia Nickson in which he's forced to go Cambodia in search of American POWs  and this Rambo III with Kurtwood Smith and Spiros Focas  and the ultimate John Rambo directed and starred by Stallone with Julie Benz and Matthew Mardsen . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans . It's a movie for adrenaline lovers and frantic thrillers buffs . Rating  Good entertaining but violent  two thumbs up . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take  this exciting film still has its magnificent moments . This largescale and lavishly produced pic attempts a peculiar atmosphere with acceptable results . well worth seeing .".

Scripted by Sheldon Lettich and Sylvester Stallone himself tells the most dominant part of Rambo franchise. The story the screenplay was really well written and the way it was treated into the cinematic means was just Extreme. All the credit goes to the principal photographic team under John Stanier and the well talented second unit directors Douglas Dean Jeff Jensen and Nikolas Korda. Together they created such a wide canvas that was over the Top in every means.Plus the soul of Rambo formed by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith makes this movie the most memorable one. His theme and action cues really immerse us in the movie. This is one of his best works I like the opening club fighting sequence huh really the score raises my adrenaline and STALLONE HAS MORE DEFINITION THAN THE FAT PIG ARNOLD.A great action movie with the exotic backdrop of Afghanistan with a cutting edge storyline. Stallone really lived in that character especially in those smashing action scenes and in emotional parts. I wish to have such body like him one Day. This is extreme! This is the last type of movie with highquality action spectrums that disappeared with the 1990's. A must see movie for ALL ACTION FILM FANS.I gave this movie 10 thumbs up out of 10 stars !".

In his original uncut version the movie is banned in Germany and this has good reasons. The film is absolutely nothing for kids. In my opinion the Littletonmassacre a few weeks ago was a direct consequence of films like Rambo. If you're old enough watch it !

Had Co Bao lived things may have been different and Rambo may have finally settled down and been cured of his inner demons. Rambo keeps busy by helping and working for the Monks in the Monastery where he is living. The opening sequence where Rambo is fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok subverts the genre by playing on moviegoers misconceptions of the flawed character. Having defeated his opponent and showed mercy despite the crowd baying for blood Rambo pockets the prize money and limps off... he then gives it to the monks. All is not what it seems. Rambo does not go looking for trouble but it seems to follow him. Unwittingly he is drawn into the war in Afghanistan. In what is hardly a fair fight the might of the Russian army is fighting peasants defending their land and homes. Intellectual snobbery and bad press prevented this film from being the classic action drama it rightly deserved highlighting the plight of the Afghanistan people. Ironically two days before the film's release Russia pulled out of Afghanistan.Rambo III was the most expensive film ever made  60000000. Mr. Stallone's combined salary for Rambo III  Rocky V  25000000. The closest competitor was Arnold Schwarzeneger with 10000000. With so many stars now in the 20000000 price bracket it is easy to forget the Stallone phenomenon.".

	schema:headline " A let down when coming from Sylvester Stallone and the Rambo franchise";
	schema:reviewBody "Both First Blood and Rambo II are memorable films for their intense story a masterfully woven action. In both respects Rambo III falls short. Where as in the first two there is an underlying theme off a brave good man repeatedly being let down by his country and the men he tries to protect in the third movie the theme is dropped and replaced with a plot not only dull and typical but also completely senseless. Meanwhile in the action department the film starts off at a terrible pace and we only get to see the Rambo we know and love busting his moves 40 minutes into the film.The whole film is terribly forced. It takes quite a bit of effort to imagine John Rambo throwing away the life of peace he worked so hard for at the drop of a hat. In my opinion the Coronel acts completely out of character considering the events of Rambo II. There is no way I could believe that the character would really approach Rambo once again like a total asshole. On a similar note while Rambo surprised us over and over again with his special ops traps and camouflage tricks when he's suddenly taken out of a dark jungle and placed in a well lit Russian camp in the middle of a desert it's hard to believe he could pull off the same stunts.The action is generally poorly executed and the climatic final battle is ludicrous. Firstly I can't get over how a Russian army composed of helicopters and tanks lost to some dudes on horses with petrol bombs. Secondly the surreal showdown between Rambo and Zayzen where Mr. baddie decides to charge against a tank with a helicopter 5 feet off the ground directly in line with the cannon as opposed to flying up and launching the laser guided anti tank missiles it has from a safe distance. It's obvious at this point they weren't even trying. Suffice it to say that these last 20 minutes are cringe worthy.The ending scene was pointless and showed no signs of effort to give some sort of closure to the film. Also we were continuously introduced to a bunch of lackluster useless characters who do nothing but slow down the action. I also had an issue with the bullet wounds in several instances. At one point Rambo is shot by a helicopter round in the leg. 99 of the time that happens your leg is blown off into little bits. I understand Rambo is the main character so at first I thought it would just break his leg and so he would continue his carnage like a bad ass while limping. To my disbelief a few seconds later he's OK again running like a bloodhound and the giant hole going through the middle of his leg is never mentioned again.In conclusion unlike the other 3 Rambo films yes even John Rambo is better than this film this one left behind nothing of value that you could take home. The story is really forced and unoriginal the script is inferior the action is scarce and usually makes no sense and the majority of the cast is boring and bring nothing to the table.I'm not going to say this film is of the worst action movies of all time but if they do make a list of them Rambo III deserves an honorable mention for ruining a franchise in the laziest way possible.".

Rambo refuses and Trautman goes in alone but is immediately ambushed and captured. When Rambo hears this he throws off his peaceful ways and joins forces with the Mujahedeen rebels to launch a daring rescue mission deep behind enemy lines in Afghanistan.Having seen Rambo's IIII in the last three weeks thanks to BBC3 I feel I have seen the series in the way I would like to have  all at once and as quickly as possible. I didn't think much of part 2 and was prepared for an even more overblown part 3 however credit where credit is due it is better than part 2 even if that is not saying a great deal. The film opens surprisingly well apart from a silly opening fight scene he's a Buddhist right? that is made even funnier by the fact that it has been spoofed by Hot Shots 2 really well. However after this nonsense we get a lot of dialogue that is actually quite good funny 'it's blue' interesting sharp 'where is the glory here?' and quite a balanced look at the situation. Sadly after 30 minutes of this the film starts to realize that people who have come to the cinema to see Rambo 3 have probably not come for the dialogue and hence we get down to a series of big action set pieces where Rambo takes on the world single handed.Needless to say the film becomes a bythenumbers affair from here on in  baddies who can't hit a barn door indestructible Rambo young Afghan orphans in peril cruel Russians big explosions OTT death scenes and so on. If this is all you want then you'll pretty much get what you're after for my money the action was all a bit silly and overblown to be really involving  zero tension and only the spectacle value of the action to keep you watching. As such I found it to be an average film at best but one that I quite enjoyed watching as a dumb action movie. To it's credit it does manage some funny lines during the rest of the movie 'surrounding them is out' but it is apparent to all that the script writer hats were taken off halfway through and replaced by the 'lets blow it all up' hats  when Rambo faces down an entire Soviet army unit you pretty much know that this is not designed to tax your brain or be taken seriously!The cast pretty much match their material. Stallone manages to have completely robbed Rambo of the interesting elements he had in First Blood and the attempts to give him depth by sticking him in a monastery for 10 minutes is just laughably inept! Crenna seems to enjoy himself in an undemanding role that allows him to do more shooting that the other films but that's about his lot. De Jonge is a better Soviet than the ham that was Berkov but he is still a pantomime villain most of the way through. Smith is a well known face but that's amount the limit of his value in this film although local support from Focs there's a carryon joke in there somewhere Gabai and particularly Shoua as well as others are OK considering they are really just background or fodder.Overall this is better than Rambo 2 simply because the writing is better in the first 30 minutes and it has some funny lines during the action however this isn't saying much. The majority of the film is a big dumb action movie of the 'onemantakesontheworld' ilk if that's your thing then you'll love it personally I prefer to be involved in the film and be tense and excited. Despite this I still enjoyed it a bit but only for what it was  lots of things blowing up in stupid and OTT ways. Good for teenage boys of all ages but really not much worth for anyone else.".

It's so clear this one is the coolest entry in the coolest action saga of all the times. Soforget Lethal Weaponman ! Rambo is a legend.Rambo is an icon.We can say RAmbo is historyand no one bad critic can destroy this truth.The first one defined the Actionherowithasoul concept. Thenthe sequels defined an inner spiritual force not understandable foe everyone.The bad critics sew only action moviesbut Rambo is more than a pair of explosion. An amazing trilogy !  FIrst Blood  is the character's damnation phase. I don't wanna explain you the story of this incredible movie.The legend of John Rambo begins in this flickthen it develops in Rambo Fb part 2 Redemptionfinally it arrives to the glorious climax in RAmbo 3 Ascension. All the three movies were hits. Both First Blood and Rambo 3  grossed about 55 millions  Rambo 3 was a real huge success in America thanks to the rental and video charts however 54 millions is a real good gross reported to 1988so they were cleary hits. Rambo Fb part 2  grossed 150 at the domestical boxofficeit can be considered the headlight of the series. But we have to not forgetRAMBO 3 grossed 135145 millions overseas !!! It was the action hit of the late 1988. Togheter the three movies have grossed over 600 millions in the late eighties. NowOVER a BILLION . People loves Rambo.Critics hates Rambo.But nothing can refuse the fact Johnny made history.And not only the movie history. Long life to Johnny from his own greatest fan !!!!!!!!!!!!!".

It's so clear this one is the coolest entry in the coolest action saga of all the times. Soforget Lethal Weaponman ! Rambo is a legend.Rambo is an icon.We can say RAmbo is historyand no one bad critic can destroy this truth.The first one defined the Actionherowithasoul concept. Thenthe sequels defined an inner spiritual force not understandable foe everyone.The bad critics sew only action moviesbut Rambo is more than a pair of explosion. An amazing trilogy !  FIrst Blood  is the character's damnation phase. I don't wanna explain you the story of this incredible movie.The legend of John Rambo begins in this flickthen it develops in Rambo Fb part 2 Redemptionfinally it arrives to the glorious climax in RAmbo 3 Ascension. All the three movies were hits. Both First Blood and Rambo 3  grossed about 55 millions  Rambo 3 was a real huge success in America thanks to the rental and video charts however 54 millions is a real good gross reported to 1988so they were cleary hits. Rambo Fb part 2  grossed 150 at the domestical boxofficeit can be considered the headlight of the series. But we have to not forgetRAMBO 3 grossed 135145 millions overseas !!! It was the action hit of the late 1988. Togheter the three movies have grossed over 600 millions in the late eighties. NowOVER a BILLION . People loves Rambo.Critics hates Rambo.But nothing can refuse the fact Johnny made history.And not only the movie history. Long life to Johnny from his own greatest fan !!!!!!!!!!!!!";

NOT Rambo 3. Unless they changed the titles of the previous 2 films and never told anyone.Anyway now that rant is over lets talk about sex. Well I wish I could but I've got to review this pile of rubbish 1st.We start by catching up with Rambo in Thailand and he's earning some money taking part in Mu Tai Stick Fighting. So he's a hustler. But he never keeps his winnings he gives it to the monks because he's living and helping out at a Buddist temple as an odd job man.He's approached by Colonel Trautman and Curtwood Smith to go on a mission to Afghanistan to help some local rebels fight the Russians. He refuses and Trautman goes alone and gets captured which means Rambo decides to go and rescue him all on his own.The Afghan village is attacked by the Russians in helicopters for seemingly no reason and they decide to leave and one man decides to help Rambo. Also an annoying young boy who is told in no uncertain terms NOT to come with them.Of course he disobeys and gets them and himself injured and Rambo sends his guide and the boy away. Of course he rescues Trautman and some locals also held in the same prison. Steals a helicopter and we're suddenly stealing wholesale from First Blood Part 2. Escaping in a helicopter. Destroying an enemy helicopter and crashing.Then Rambo kills what seems like hundreds of Russian commando's and he and Trautman only have to walk across an empty plain to freedom until half the Russian Army turn up AND an attack helicopter taken again from First Blood Part 2.Of course the Afghans turn up and help Rambo who finally kills the Russian Commander in his helicopter using a tank he captured.Weak film and even weaker ending.".

Stallone has never looked better than in Rambo III. Although I'm a big Sly and Rambo fan I don't hope to see Rambo IV. I think the main reason for the big success of the Rambo flicks was the political situation. In part one there was the dilemma of the soldiers returning from Vietnam in the second installment the cold war between US and USSR such as in the third one. Rambo III did less well at the box office because of the political detention between East and West the cold war headed towards the end. So I don't think Rambo IV should be made. Furthermore Stallone might still be in good shape considering his age 54 but I think meanwhile he has become far too old to portray a fighting machine.".

Rambo and Truatman get conered by the Soviets and Rambo says his famous one liner Fck Them! and starts shoot'n gernades at the soviet army.  With the help of the Afghan Tribesmen Rambo jumps into a burning Soviet tank and squares off against a evil soviet commander in a attack helicopter.  Rambo kills the soviet commander by shooting the tanks machine gun into the helicopter's cockpit and rams the tank into the helicopter blowing it into millions of pieces! and of course Rambo survives.

Standard issue action movie plot but in this offering it's fleshed out even less than normal. For instance it's never exactly clear what the assignment IS that's offered by Rambo's former commander and his sniveling CIA sidekick played with aplomb by Kurtwood Smith who looks very anxious to get his paycheck and get the haole off this movie except that it has something to do with Stinger missiles which are never mentioned again in the picture violating Anton Checkov's plot rule that a gun seen on the wall of the set in act one must be fired in act three. Every time the talented Richard Crenna is on the screen another opportunity is blown for even minimal character developmentthe scriptwriters give him a hackneyed rant to the Russians about you underestimated your enemy sounds like he's talking about Iraq circa 2003 and he spends most of the rest of the film cowering in a cell waiting to be tortured andor for Rambo to show up. As Troutman Crenna never even gets a single line to say how much he misses his wife or how he'd really like a beer or how the sniveling CIA man let him down or something. Yawn.The most shocking thing is that at 63 million this is still very much a Bmovie. You'd think at that price and with exotic shooting locales like Thailand and Israel at the very least it would look like David Lean Meets Rambo. In fact it looks like it was filmed on the same dusty Burbank back lot where innumerable Westerns were made in the 1940s. Even the genuine Thailand locations might as well have been EPCOT Center at Disney World.For my money my favorite part of the film is the ludicrous song played over the end credits which is pure cocktail lounge cornball spiced up with that classic 80s My First Casio synth sound. I hoped against hope when the music credits went by I would see the title of it was Love Theme from Rambo III but alas even this opportunity for a little tongueincheek humor slipped the minds of the filmmakers. But then again it's Stallone who didn't learn to take himself with a grain of salt until the Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot era. Perhaps the addition of Estelle Getty with her .357 Magnum might have saved Rambo III from the utter waste of 102 minutes that it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Act of Love 1953 is a bittersweet love story about the starcrossed relationship between a World War II GI and a young Parisian during the Allied liberation of Paris. KIRK DOUGLAS plays Robert Teller an Army PFC who while stationed in France toward the end of World War II meets and falls in love with a destitute French woman Lise Gudayec DANY ROBIN. When Teller seeks permission to marry Lise his condescending commanding officer GEORGE MATHEWS has Teller transferred because he considers the young woman to be an opportunist. The transfer has tragic consequences. The film's ending is highly emotional when Teller visits the small French Riviera hotel that Lise told him about. At the hotel he has a bitter encounter with his former commanding officer. And it is in one of the hotel rooms that Teller while recalling the descriptive words of Lise fully realizes how truly beautiful was their brief love affair. Get out the hankies for this ending. The film marked the debut of Frenchborn Robin in an Englishspeaking film. Robin who began her career as a ballerina with the Paris Opera made her screen debut in 1946 at the age of 19 in the French film Les Portes de la Nuit Gates of the Night. Filmed in Paris and on the French Riviera Act of Love was one of three films that Douglas made abroad during 1952 and '53. The other two were The Juggler 1953 which was filmed in Israel and Ulysses 1954 which was filmed in Italy. During the threepicture neartwoyear filming schedule Douglas spent a total of just one month in the United States.Act of Love also marked the first appearance in an Englishspeaking film by BRIGITTE BARDOT who would subsequently gain fame with her pouting good looks and curvaceous figure as France's sex kitten. In Act of Love Bardot portrays Mimi a friend of Lise. Act of Love was based on the 1949 novel The Girl on the Via Flaminia by ALFRED HAYES. The film's screenplay was by German writer Joseph KESSEL and American novelistscreenwriter IRWIN SHAW. Shaw's other wellknown film credits included Fire Down Below 1957 and The Young Lions 1958. Kessel also wrote the French dialogue for the version released in France titled Un acte d'amour. For the record Robin retired from filmmaking in 1969 after completing the ALFRED HITCHCOCK spy thriller Topaz. She and her husband British producer MICHAEL SULLIVAN died in a fire in 1995. She was 68. Robin was known for her dislike of journalists even during the height of her career. Because of this journalists in 1953 and '54 presented her with the annual Lemon Prize which is given to the nastiest French actress.".

	schema:reviewBody "I discovered this one on French Television yesterday as the last of a series of Anatole Litvak films. I've probably been overgenerous by giving it a 9 but admit to having some strange criteria for my annotations. It is an American film made on location in the city of Paris  as opposed to being made in a studio . And this is the Paris of the golden romantic age of the 1950's not the ugly one of today  there's no comparison between the two. In addition to this we have lavish helpings of accordion playing Michel Emer's Le Disque Us  Tant qu'il y a la vie il y a de l'espoir .... a beautiful song made famous by Edith Piaf many years ago and indeed difficult to find on CD in an ordinary instrumental version...as they say in French ..quand j'entends cet air je craque ..... ! Another unexpected jewel in the film was a glimpse albeit short of my favourite area of Paris  old Belleville and the Rue Vilin Staircase. Whilst most of the film is made in central Paris with views of the Seine etc at one stage Kirk Douglas is hiding out from the army authorities down a staircase. This is the famous Escalier de la Rue Vilin and there are various views from top and bottom of this staircase. It is exactly the same place as is used in the film 'The Red Balloon Les Jeux Dangereux Casque d'Or  Du Rififi chez Les Hommes  and Le Doulos. I have a book all about this area and apparently another American film was made there called Gigot clochard de Bellville made by Gene Kelly and starring Jackie Gleeson as a mute. As you may imagine there's more chance of an elephant passing through the eye of a needle than of finding that film anywhere in the world. To return to Act of Love this is a sort of French Waterloo Bridge it starts out in Villefranche Sur Mer on the Cte D'Azur and flashes back to Paris in 1945. The same Michel Emer tune is heard both now and then. Kirk Douglas as handsome as ever wishes to stay in one particular room in a hotel and a flashback indicates why. It is the same technique as in Waterloo Bridge with Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh. At the same time he meets another American tourist who seems to recognize him by who he himself does not recognize. The flashback helps us on this one too. At the end of the film all fits into place but you have that same sickening and lugubrious feeling you had at the end of Waterloo Bridge. Plotwise the film is a little slow to get off the ground and the love affair between Kirk Douglas and Dany RObin takes time to gather steal. That is my principal criticism. Also we see Serge Reggiani in a very aggressive role which annoyed me no end ! I didn't like the man at the best of times but in this film he was frankly a pain in the neck ! No doubt the film is unavailable anywhere on DVD  but I am at least glad to have a taped copy and will keep an eye out for any future issue. Missed rendezvous be they in Act of Love Waterloo Bridge or even Charles Boyer's Back Street are very difficult for me to bear whilst watching a film and leave an everlasting and indelible memory within me. The film is definitely to be recommended for nostalgics of old Paris Kirk Douglas fans and rare gems from the 1950's.".

The eighteenyearold Brigitte Bardot is already beautiful but look sharp or you may miss her.The real scenestealer here though is the slinky Barbara Laage who shows herself to be a fine actress in very nearly her only American film. Too bad she breezes out of the picture a third of the way through.The onlocation shots of Paris are also a plus in a film that sometimes flirts dangerously with soap opera.

	schema:reviewBody "Many things about this movie are charming and have a wistful quality that brings you into its story.First of all and I offer my apologies to the absorbing performances to me the most fascinating aspect of this film is the location PARIS.  But not just any Paris.  This is a during and postWWII Paris. Although released an amazing 8 years after the end of the war much of the charm of a Paris which lingers in our hearts is still there.  This is not travelogue picture with dancing Americans to a Rodgers score. There is a very truetolife depiction of what I call the most elegant city in the world. This movie tempts us to fall in love again with Paris.  All politics aside please.  We see a Paris which many a serviceman or woman probably fell in love with during the war.  We see the sights in and around Paris there are some views of Fontainebleau just outside of the city which make me want to go back and suffer the awful Summer heat inside of it again just to see the gorgeous architecture there.Second I liked this story because it ran true.  It has few Hollywood formulas  even to the end it tempts us to see stories like these as they really were.  Some happy some not so. Another reviewer complained about pidgin French  English which was heard throughout the movie.  I must say that whatever it was it did not offend my ears and I have friends who live in Paris and have similar accents when they speak English.  The accents did bother me  and neither did the French without subtitles.  I do remember a time when Americans knew more about the French language and were proud of it.  I still am.Yet all through this we have a love story which develops and then unravels due to bureaucratic entanglements.Finally if you must see this for one reason see it for the story and the deft performances.  Kirk Douglas it seems never made a bad picture  or at least he never gave a bad performance.  Every one was absorbing  brought you in gave you permission to involve yourself with the situations in them. This is not exception.  It is a lowkey performance true.  But it is no less absorbing than anything he ever did.  Of course there was gorgeous Dany Robin as Kirk Douglas's love interest. Her portrayal of a shy innocent French girl was perfect considering she was voted nastiest French actress that same year.  She had a fabulous French career and worked with many famous directors including Litvak who also directed Sorry Wrong Number The Snake Pit and Anastasia.I recommend this to those viewers who still have a little romance in their hearts  but walk with a dose of reality down every turn of their adventures.".

	schema:headline " A historic French American coproduction";
	schema:reviewBody "USAFrench coproductions are a rarity. But this serves its subject matter superbly well  that time when American soldiers in their hundreds of thousands were first fighters then feted liberators on French soil. As does the script  nobody is a stereotype everyone has their own believable character. Perhaps the sense of authenticity came also from the short time just 8 years between the events portrayed and when it was filmed. This was not one author's or one scriptwriter's imagination  it must have been a vivid memory in the minds of tens if not hundreds of thousands of American soldiers. Equally vivid for the French who had seen occupation or collaboration then liberation. There is a certain graciousness and humanity in the treatment of the characters. Later and lesser writers and directors would portray such situations as simply the meeting of drunken animalistic soldiers with faceless whores and thieving tricky locals. There is a dignity and respect to this film which has all but disappeared in subsequent war movies.Star that he is was Kirk Douglas wellcast? I think not. Kirk Douglas portrayed even personified a particular type given to action either outer or inner. Here he plays a far less certain character not driven but drifting. Douglas was always Spartacus even if the Romans couldn't spot him viewers could every time. Perhaps this was a role for Mitchum  a mixture of integrity tempered by a degree of indolence.This is not a film packed with stars it is packed with people American and French  a tribute to the director writers and cast.British viewers might recognise a familiar face  Leslie Dwyer here a quirky cameo Tommy with just 5 teeth later the grumpy childhating children's entertainer in a '80's TV comedy series Hi De Hi!.".

But this serves its subject matter superbly well  that time when American soldiers in their hundreds of thousands were first fighters then feted liberators on French soil. As does the script  nobody is a stereotype everyone has their own believable character. Perhaps the sense of authenticity came also from the short time just 8 years between the events portrayed and when it was filmed. This was not one author's or one scriptwriter's imagination  it must have been a vivid memory in the minds of tens if not hundreds of thousands of American soldiers. Equally vivid for the French who had seen occupation or collaboration then liberation. There is a certain graciousness and humanity in the treatment of the characters. Later and lesser writers and directors would portray such situations as simply the meeting of drunken animalistic soldiers with faceless whores and thieving tricky locals. There is a dignity and respect to this film which has all but disappeared in subsequent war movies.Star that he is was Kirk Douglas wellcast? I think not. Kirk Douglas portrayed even personified a particular type given to action either outer or inner. Here he plays a far less certain character not driven but drifting. Douglas was always Spartacus even if the Romans couldn't spot him viewers could every time. Perhaps this was a role for Mitchum  a mixture of integrity tempered by a degree of indolence.This is not a film packed with stars it is packed with people American and French  a tribute to the director writers and cast.British viewers might recognise a familiar face  Leslie Dwyer here a quirky cameo Tommy with just 5 teeth later the grumpy childhating children's entertainer in a '80's TV comedy series Hi De Hi!.";

In all our wars on foreign shores there is usually a story of American soldiers falling in love with some woman of the native population. Kirk Douglas plays your average American soldier no heroic type by any means who falls in love with a woman who is about two steps away from selling herself just to live.It was that all over Europe after Hitler's War. This same story could and probably has been done in all the occupied countries of Europe East and West in Italy in Austria in Holland and even in Mr. Hitler's Germany. Our army had a no fraternization policy but boys and girls will be boys and girls. And if the real thing did come along you had an incredible amount of bureaucracy to deal with.The whole subject was dealt with a few years later in Sayonara with a racial component attached to it and a much bigger budget. I don't think Kirk Douglas has ever been more romantic on the screen than in Act Of Love. It's an unusual part for him but he carries it off. Anatole Litvak gets good performances out of his cast and the on site location cinematography is a plus.".

Apart from some quibbles one might have with its casting the occasionally stilted dialogue or some melodramatic nonsense here and there it really is an important addition to the Kirk Douglas oeuvre as well as a story about a character very much like those he played later in Paths of Glory and Lonely Are the Brave.Douglas must have had more than a passing hand in choosing roles for himself during his career.  Unlike many of his contemporaries Brando comes to mind he has played characters that require a fine balance between kinetic displays of a true hero and moments of selfeffacing and troubled doubt. It is not so much the quality of the writing at work here as it is his own deliberate and skillful willingness to interpret the role honestly without regard to any supposed preconceptions of what his audience expects of him.I write this with a degree of reservation because I never much cared for his voice or his looks.  The fact that I admire his acting skill is perhaps all the more enhanced by this admission however.  With a profile a little less vivid and a better vocal range and timbre he might have played Shakespeare.His French colleagues in the present effort are more stereotypical than one cares for.  They are made to speak a kind of pidgin English that was generally thought acceptable in 1953 for American audiences.  Subtitles accompanying actual French would be requisite for any remake.Moreover there is that recurrent tinge of sentimentality and bathos. But I still liked it on the whole giving it a solid 7 out of 10.".

	schema:text "    This film adapted from a work of fiction by author Tracy Chevalier tells a story about the events surrounding the creation of the painting Girl With a Pearl Earring by 17th century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. Little is known about the girl in the painting it is speculated that she was a maid who lived in the house of the painter along with his family and other servants though there is no historical evidence. This masterful film attempts to recreate the mysterious girl's life. Griet played by Scarlett Johansson is a maid in the house of painter Johannes Vermeer played by British actor Colin Firth. Vermeer's wealthy patron and sole means of support Van Ruijven commissions him to paint Griet with the intent that he will have her for himself before it is finished. She must somehow secretly pose for the crucial painting without the knowledge of Vermeer's wife avoid Van Ruijven's grasp and protect herself from the cruel gossip of the world of a 17th century servant.";

	schema:headline " A Wonderful Film Not Just about Vermeer but Artistic Motivation";
	schema:reviewBody "Johannes Vermeer was a silent man. Being equipped with immense talent brush and palette there really was no need for words. Such philosophy is greatly dwelt upon in Peter Webber's adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's novel. The film is breathtaking alone in the fact that the production team led by cinematographer Eduardo Serra production designer Ben Van Os and art director Christina Shaeffer manages to capture Vermeer's filling oilbased colors and light into every scene. The story is exemplary as well. We are taken into a brief era in Vermeer's life in 17th century Delft. Much of the film's premise is true Vermeer was a reticent and brilliant painter who attempted to balance his genius and deeprooted innate calling to art and solitude with the often overbearing demands of a bourgeoisie Venetian society as well as the malignant pressures posted by a sadistic commissioner and the pressures of being the head of a massive household when he died in 1675 he left behind his wife and 11 children. In 1665 however he painted a mysterious masterpiece. It's mysterious because much scholarship has since been dedicated to uncovering the identity of the model who posed for it. It has been suggested that the subject is one of his daughters although this theory is met today with much skepticism. And this is where the film spends most of its fictional focus that of creating an imaginary story to help speculate on what we know as factual about Vermeer's life. Enter a young beautiful servant girl Grit Scarlett Johansson who through no fault of her own finds that her classic beauty attracts Vermeer's sensibilitiesas a man and as an artistto such a degree that he has no choice but to capture her on oil and canvas.Vermeer Colin Firth spends a lot of time in this film standing quietly in the shadows and peeking around corners. There's great symbolism in many of these shotshis body is often halfcovered halfexposed representing the dichotomy he must have felt in his lifethat of being in perpetual conflict with his spiritual artistic longings and the more human qualities of a man.Whereas Vermeer' silence is a result of his being reluctant to communicate with the external world mostly due to artistic selfabsorption Griet similarly is cut off from humanity but rather out of innocence naivety beauty and the unfortunate side effect of being at the low end of a rather oppressive Delft caste system where she has little voice outside of the disturbance her beauty stimulates in others. Together the two characters find an unspoken solace a type of kinetic energy that can only be conveyed through Vermeer's art. Indeed one of the film's more touching moments comes when the artist reveals his portrait of her and Griet replies 'You've seen into me.' Another memorable moment if not altogether breathtaking comes when Vermeer is instructing Griet in how to hold her face at the proper angle in order to catch the appropriate reflection of light on her mouth and also when he is instructing her in how to mix his paints and their hands for a split second brush together. It is in such moments that Firth brilliantly conveys the tormenting dissonance present in a man not in whose base desires are overshadowing his artistic being but rather the oppositeas a virtuoso experiencing a rare moment of temporary carnal pleasure. All philosophy aside is the film any good? I'd say it's extraordinary although if you're not one to gravitate toward the biography of an artist this may not be the film for you. However I do believe that the human story element her is valuable entertaining and worthwhile.".

	schema:headline " A cinematic homage to 17th Century Flemish painters not just Vermeer. minor spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Girl with a Pearl Earring is based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier who tells the story of a forbidden love affair pardon the clich between painting master Johannes Vermeer Colin Firth and the only woman who seemed to appreciate his work a timid young maid named Grit Scarlett Johansson.Grit is hired to work in the Vermeer household. Had you not known anything about Vermeer prior to viewing the film it seems as though he is some deformed creature the family wishes to keep secret. The family always linger near the door to Vermeer's studio as though something dangerous was contained within. And as the story goes along you might get the impression that he is a nasty fellow the way everyone approaches the studio so delicately careful not to disturb anything. Says one maid to Grit he doesn't like people bothering him when he is working.In a way Johannes is a real bastard to his wife children and motherinlaw. As a painter they're never sure whether he is going to get the commissions from the arrogant but jolly rich patron Van Ruijven Tom Wilkinson or whether they'll be escaping debtors by fleeing in the middle of the night.Grit is curious and at the same time smitten with Johannes Vermeer probably because of the initial mystery. She gains an interest in Vermeer and in a way also becomes his painting apprentice helping him to mix paints making creative suggestions about the paintings and so forth. Vermeer introduces her to a rather different world that Grit has never known. And the two for a silent bond a love for each other. Johannes appreciate's Grits company as a comfortable contrast to his motherinlaw children and especially his wife he only seem to try to discourage his silly hobbies.But Johannes and Grit cannot act on their feelings for each other at least not aloud. Divorce was highly out of the question for one thing. But second Johanne's was dependent on the arrogant Van Rijn for his commissions and Van Rijn wanted Grit. Disgusted as Johannes may have been and only slightly able to protect her you'll see what I mean in the finale he can't totally reject his financer. Plus there is the barrier of master and maid presenting a rigid social structure. And for Grit she can only play out her affair with Johannes vicariously through her boyfriend the Butcher.Even if the story is not grounded in fact or is based on little fact the story of how Vermeer's painting The Girl With a Pearl Earring came to be is one that presents a little mystery and romance to a painting. You can find something to appreciate it beyond just consideration of the artistic elements of lighting or coloring etc. In fact art is always more fun with an intriguing story behind it consider the controversy behind Whistler's 'Peacock Room'.I thought the movie did a fantastic job of recreating 17th century Netherlands. But what you may not know without having seen many 17 century painting is that nearly every scene in the movie is constructed from 17 th century paintings of Vermeers Frans Halls Van Dyke and many others. The entire movie is as one other viewer coined it a cinematic painting but not just because it is a movie about the beauty of one painting but because it is a movie entirely constructed from paintings. It was really incredible how precise everything is. Lighting placement of figures. The actors would have to walk around a room and then at one point hit their points precisely props and all to capture that one moment reflected in the painting from which it was taken from. This is really a great film for the art direction alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is this an incredibly dull movie about a single painting  or is it a mesmerising and penetrating insight into art and a particular 17th century Dutch artist? It probably depends on your point of view.Griet is a poor young girl who goes to work for the great Vermeer as a humble servant. She is pushed around emotionally by his overwrought and jealous wife mischievous children and allpowerful lustful patron. Yet the biggest force in her life gradually teasing out her own artistic sensibilities is the Master himself. Griet becomes the subject of his most famous painting lured by a mixture of dread and fascination.For Vermeer the artist his work is allconsuming. Every part of his world  the welfare of his family his eccentricities his whole energy and purpose in life is concentrated into his work. That is not to say he lacks morals but simply that his work is his higher calling. To justify such a character we could look to the role of art and its importance. Art can be worshipped for its own sake like some wicked effigy and used to excuse all manner of moral turpitude in its creator or it can be seen as the entrance by which light can enter our soul illuminate thought and our world in a way that cold logic alone would deny us move us beyond the bounds of our immediate impressions and let us see the world about us in a new way inspired and informed.Griet carries this seed to see beauty where others see only common place things and it is a seed that the Master nourishes. There are times when Vermeer protects Griet from the people around her to whom she is so vulnerable but is his concern towards her concern for her welfare secret desire or just a tool an exquisite tool of his trade?Cinema is also being part of this artistic spectrum if we allow it to be affecting us in ways that let the viewer grow rather than just be entertained. Girl With a Pearl Earring certainly has sufficient integrity to do that but if one just wanted to be entertained then it probably falls short. The art direction beautifully recreates Holland of the period and Scarlett Johansson gives a very welltempered performance as young Griet. Costumes music and overall cinematography are accomplished and haunting without loss of subtlety producing a memorable film for lovers of art and cinema but if paintings don't do anything for you this film might not either.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't imagine a lot of people especially anyone under 40 sitting through this extremely slow film....but I thought it was excellent. However I am biased because I love great cinematography and stories about famous painters. Sometimes the cameras stay on subject longer than normal affording the viewer time to really soak it up. If you can stay awake this film offers some of the prettiest images I've ever seen on film. Scene after scene looks like a classic painting come to life. Scarlet Johannson says very little but is fascinating to watch. For the firsttime viewer there a tension that builds throughout the film leaving wondering what bad thing is about to happen. The story is not an upbeat one yet not depressing either.One time I watched this film very early in the morning something I rarely do and with the subtitles on. It wasn't a bad way to watch it  a quiet film in the quiet of the predawn hours . The film offers another demonstration of why doesn't have to shed all their clothes to be erotic. This inspired me to read the book and I enjoyed that too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Behind every picture there lies a story and the film Girl With a Pearl Earring' purports to give us the inside scoop into the making of Vermeer's classic painting of the same name.  In the mid 1600's a young illiterate peasant girl named Griet came to live and work as a servant in the home of the promising yet still financially struggling Dutch master.  Obsessed by her beauty Vermeer insisted on using her as the subject for one of his works much to the horror and chagrin of his jealous and shrewish wife. Despite the domestic havoc it caused the collaboration between artist and subject resulted in one of the genuine masterpieces of the art world.Visually this film could not be more stunning.  Thanks to luminous cinematography art direction and costume design the audience watching this film feels almost as if it has been transported into a Vermeer work. Director Peter Webber recreates every element of that world in loving detail right down to his choice of actress Scarlett Johansson who is a dead ringer for the model in the original portrait.  Alexandre Desplat's score also captures the lyrical haunting tenderness of the subject matter.Girl With a Pearl Earring' is a very fine movie in many respects but it is ultimately unsatisfying because it cannot match in content what it achieves in style.  Despite the exquisite look of the film the characters seem strangely underdeveloped most especially Vermeer himself who remains frustratingly superficial throughout.  Thanks mainly to his taciturn moodiness we never get to know much of what he is thinking or feeling.  The romantic moments between artist and subject are admirably restrained  and thereby all the more erotic in nature  but we do feel as if we would like to know more about him as a person.  Griet is only slightly more fully developed although in her case we can at least ascribe this lack of information to the restrictions placed on her by her station in life and the society of her time.  Unlike Vermeer Griet was conditioned by the world around her to be a passive observer.  But Vermeer needs to be a more dynamic presence in the story.One admires the fact that the filmmakers have remained truthful to the spirit of the enterprise refusing to indulge in cheap melodramatics to make the story more salacious and scandalous than in truth it really was.  Yet in dramatic terms such integrity comes with a price for the film often has the effect of lulling rather than stimulating us of raising our expectations then failing to fully satisfy them.  Perhaps in the case of this particular artwork the storybehindthepicture wasn't really all that interesting to begin with.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Delfti Holland 1665 the poor seventeen years old Griet Scarlett Johansson is hired as a maid in the household of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer Colin Firth to maintain her family. The Vermeer family is supported by the powerful and wealthy commissioner Van Ruijven Tom Wilkinson and is totally dependent on the inspiration of master Johannes Vermeer to keep their high standard of living as if they were rich. When Griet arrives in the breast of Vermeer's family she understands the relation of power among the members of the family and Van Ruijven and meanwhile a platonic love and attraction develop between Johannes and her due to her feelings and perspective relative to his work. Girl With a Pearl Earring is a magnificent contemplative art work and a beautiful dramatic romance based on a famous painting which has this name. It is known that the maid who worked in Vermeer's house was the model and inspiration for such a piece of arts. However the dramatization based on an adaptation of Tracy Chevalliers's novel is a fiction. The reconstitution of Delftt in the Seventeenth Century is amazingly perfect being based on paintings of that time. Watching this film the viewer feels as if he or she were seeing paintings at an exhibition and if he or she pauses the DVD on any scene will have a magnificent painting on the screen of the TV. The intense performance of the cast and direction are overwhelming highlighting the spectacular Scarlett Johansson who is in my opinion one of the best newactress in the cinema industry. Most of the feelings and sensations of the characters are transmitted through the looks and expressions of the actors and actresses. This movie had three Oscar nominations in 2003 cinematography art direction and costume design and two Golden Globe nominations and is highly recommended to any viewer who appreciates arts. I am a positive fan of movies I always try to find the beautiful points or entertainment it can offer instead of looking for destructive parts like most of the professional critics do but Girl With a Pearl Earring has superseded my uppermost expectations. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Moa Com Brinco de Prola Young Woman With Pearl Earring'".

Her patience and care for making sure that all of the vegetables are balanced correctly in shape form and color is only a glimpse of what becomes clearly evident later on in the film this girl has the Eye.She is ushered by her mom to begin her job as maid at the Vermeer's household while at the same time prompting Griet to shut her ears whenever someone is praying in presence. She says her goodbyes to her father who loves her very much and is pained to see her go. It seems that her parents never expected her to assume the position of maid but financial circumstances have forced Griet to make her way to her new master Johannes Vermeer superbly played by Colin Firth.Griet settles in fairly well in her duties as maid and was given the chore to clean Vermeer's studio a room that Vermeer's wife seems to avoid at all costs almost fearful of what happens within its four walls. So right from the beginning we realize that Vermeer's wife is ignorant to her husband's talent work and passion. This is a common theme throughout the movie and eventually culminates in an amazing confrontation toward the end of the movie.It doesn't take long for us to realize that Vermeer and Griet have forged a bond she fetches his colors she grinds and mixes the paints she cleans the windows in the studio so that better light comes in she even moves a chair so that it doesn't appear on the painting Vermeer is working on. When he asks her why she moved the chair she answers simply She looked trapped. referring to the female subject in the painting inspired by Griet herself. And it made perfect sense for her to do that. But it was also bold and only one who feels comfortable in that setting would have dared to do that even for a person in her station a maid.Vermeer is commissioned to do a painting of Griet by a lustful Van Ruijven played by Tom Wilkinson who believes that Vermeer and Griet have fooled around and wants to join in and have a taste for himself. Thankfully he doesn't get his way but he does get the painting which is remarkable in its own right. But not without any hardships. Griet understandably so didn't want to participate in the sitting simply because she would it would anger his wife. Eventually persuaded by both Vermeer and his insipid motherinlaw to have it finished she agrees to pose and get her ears pierced so that she could wear the beautiful pearl earring a piece of jewelry belonging to Vermeer's wife. This leads to a confrontation when she finds out that Griet has worn her pearl earrings and demands to see the painting for herself. Vermeer doesn't want her to see it claiming that she wouldn't understand and inevitably so once she sees it she deems it grotesque clearly showing us that she is ignorant and completely out of her element. This frustrates her and sends Griet packing severing the connection between Vermeer and Griet when he does nothing to stop the dismissal.Every shot in this film looks like it could be a painting itself. It's an absolutely beautifully shot movie. The movie is also incredibly quite and could be considered slow at times. There is not a lot of action in this movie unless you consider Griet's little rendezvous with the butcher's son played by Cillian Murphy. But then again this is not an action movie. It is simply a story of girl who came into the life of a very talented painter and inspired him at the time he needed it most in his life.Even Johansson's performance is quiet. She hardly ever speaks yet her eyes and her face speak volumes. It is by far one of her best performances only rivaled by her rendition of Charlotte in Lost in Translation where incredibly enough she plays the role of a woman who connects with an older man on a very human level and yet no physical consummation is ever present. Very much so like Griet and Vermeer connect in the confines of his studio and yet are worlds apart outside of it.I enjoyed the movie very much but it is clearly not for everyone. It can seem slow at times too quiet in others but it's worth seeing if just for Johansson's performance one which I am sure she will get recognized for.".

She does the back breaking work for the family and deals with the many difficult children and the mistress of the house but then eventually strikes up a friendship with and develops romantic feelings for Vermeer culminating with her posing for the painting.While the story is obviously not true I find the concept of theorizing about the origination of great works of art intriguing so I really enjoyed the book. Unfortunately the film 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' directed by Peter Webber wasn't as enjoyable. The film was admitted beautiful particularly the cinematography. There were some beautifully framed shots that looked like they would have inspired any of Vermeer's Baroque contemporaries. I found the performances to be hollow and boring someone needs to convince me sometime that Scarlett Johansson is anything but vapid and there was absolutely none of the emotion conveyed in the film that was so pervasive and almost tangible in the book. It takes a special film to coast on its merits merely by looking pretty but 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is not one of them. While I encourage the study albeit fictionalized of great artists this is just too boring of a representation. 410 and only for its cinematography and lighting.Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently read the book Girl with a Pearl Earring and I was very impressed by the way Tracy Chevalier gave life and credibility to her portrait of Griet and the Dutch painter Vermeer. Thus it was with high expectations that I bought the film and watched it. I was very disappointed by the film and have given some thought to the reason why it simply does not work. Firstly it seems to me that the film is too dependent on the book. It seems to me that viewers who have not read the book will wonder what it is all about. Since the book has so many inbetweens some sort of explanation about the characters and the plot seems essential. It seems to me that the director relied too much on the facial expressions of the leading actors to convey not only emotions but also crucial events in the plot.This leads me to the second point of the criticism. I think the main problem with the film is exactly the characterisation. Colin Firth and Scarlett Johanson do not strike me as credible characters they do not literally jump from the screen as they did indeed jump from the page.Firths body language is moody and closed and it comes across as if he is sulking all the way through the movie rather than enveloped and passionate about his work. Scarlett Johansen also fails to convey the intelligence and dormant potential of the maid Griet. It is not enough to just open and close your mouth 1000 times when we are given no other clues to what s going on.I do not think however that this is the fault of the actors  it must mean that something is missing in the direction and the script  there seems to be too little material for the actors in which to invest and bring out the characters. Too much material is only suggested and still relies upon the viewer having read the book and being able to fill in the blanks and fill in the emotions in those vacant expressions of Scarlett and Colin.Some of the plot changes also puzzled me. Why does Vermeer pierce both her ears when she did one of them herself in the book. I thought this was a very powerful way of showing Vermeers dedication as well as his passion for the art which is uncomprising as well as a little cruel. An adaptation has to be able to stand alone and this film certainly does not achieve this. 310".

However 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is not a story about a painting as she put it it is the title of a famous masterpiece that has been admired for over three centuries the exquisite work of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. Unfortunately the title Girl with a Pearl Earring was appropriated by Chevalier to serve as the title of what would have been if not for the coopted allure of the famed artist and his well known masterpiece considered a run of the mill garden variety historical romance certainly nothing special. As many art historians fear the transference of Chevalier's fabrication to the silver screen is sure to create misconceptions about the Vermeer legacy in the minds of those who are limited to the confines of contemporary awareness that is most of the population. Chevalier apparently gained an edge in the writer's market by exploiting the fame and creative efforts of an artist who has long been dead and is therefore unable to defend himself or the members of his family against the negative characterizations concocted by this mediocre novelist. Director Peter Webber was quoted as saying Girl with a Pearl Earring was really inspired by the painting of the same name. Inspired? Doesn't he mean that the painting of the same name was practically stolen and painted over for posterity with Chevalier's 21st century glitter glue? The fact that Chevalier and others have made a killing by irresponsibly trashing the memory of Vermeer and the members of his family to create an erotically suggestive tale says a lot about our culture. All marketing and no integrity.What did the Vermeer's family ever do to Chevalier to merit such postmortem character assassination? They were merely related to the famous artist. One wonders how Chevalier would feel if she were likewise negatively depicted by some stranger after her death. Because the Vermeers were real persons who lived at one time it is wrong to villify them in fiction three centuries later. The central characters in Chevalier's novel are notas Chevalier suggests merely spun from scant memories of persons who were known to have lived at one time. Chevalier contradicts or ignores the known facts of Vermeer's life. By all accounts his marriage to Catherina who he did in fact paint several times in contrast to what is suggested in Chevalier's storyline that he never painted her because she did not understand or appreciate his workwas a happy marriage. By the way the Vermeer's had only the one maid Tanneke whom Vermeer also used as a model for some of his work.Chevalier defamed Vermeer's wife and family by crafting very unflattering and rather unimaginative character from their memory Vermeer is the stereotypical brooding artisthis wife a vicious illtemperedmean spirited and jealous bitch. Catherina's demonic portrayal was obviously necessary as a literary device to justify and evoke sympathy for the illicit undertones in the relationship between Vermeer and the fictional Griet. Vermeer's daughter Cornelia was depicted as a child whose behavior is so pathologically antisocial she would probably be judged today as a child at risk for growing up into a serial killer.Come to think of it while Ms.Chevalier's fictional ingnue surfaces as the only noble character in the entire story her fictional renditions of the Vermeer family cast them as the horrid folks from which she must attempt to shield herself. So henceforth as far as popular culture is concerned Vermeer is trapped in a miserable marriage his wife and daughter are cold hearted witches his motherin law the head shrew and his patron the most lecherous man in Delft!The worst thing about the film version of Girl with a Pearl Earring however is that the image that will appear in association with Vermeer's masterwork in the future will be Scarlett Johansson's Griet. Hers is a performance that could only be described as vapid and which consists mainly of Johannson's perpetual look of dumb surprise her mouth hanging open continually which although was probably meant to be seductive looks more a general lack of intelligence or a contrived expression of feigned innocence. She was supposedly demure but appeared more or less bovine. It was a face that I grew so tired of by the end of the film that I dearly wished the wicked and capricious per Chevalier's fictional interpretationCatherina would have given it a good slap when she went all out in her tirade in the final scenes.".

When it gets down to that it's sad but then when they make a movie about it is the lowest tier. That's the case with Girl with a Pearl Earring an insanely overly dramatic version of Tracy Chevalier's supposedly acclaimed novel. The results by this halfbaked script by Olivia Hetreed are unintentionally hilarious. I mean this I was almost rolling on the floor with laughter during this movie.The script here is as I said before laughably bad. Every other shot where there's dialogue which is extremely scarce someone's spewing some sort of pithy quote or another. And they aren't the type that can be used as signatures on message boards they're just blatantly scripted and worthless. Another example of this script's atrocity is when people look at paintings. When Griet Scarlett Johansson sees a painting of her she doesn't say something like It's beautiful. She doesn't even say something like It brings out my eyes. She actually says You saw right through me! I didn't know dialogue could get this bad but obviously it can.Every single character overacts so much they deserve to have their own soap opera. In fact Girl with a Pearl Earring is basically a 90 minute long soap opera set in the 17th century. Actually I wouldn't be surprised if ABC picked it up for next season. Anyway Johansson brilliant in Ghost World The Man Who Wasn't There and Lost in Translation but here she goes for a subtle performance and to tell the truth it's horrible. She is constantly mugging to the camera by not being able to keep her face still for even a seocnd and she can't accurately portray a servant from that time. Colin Firth playing artist Johannes Vermeer seems to understand the time period more but when not yelling for no particular reason just doesn't work. Every other small character in this underdeveloped film goes for the waytooloud method of acting and just had me cracking up.I saw Girl with a Pearl Earring about a week before the Oscars for which it had three nominations. It did in fact have good cinematography but the costumes seemed to be derived from history books and looked pretty cheesy. I'm not very familiar with art direction so I can't comment on that but thankfully it wasn't nominated for anything soundrelated. Whenever people talk offscreen it's obvious that those people are just in a recording booth talking into microphones. Whatever authenticity there was disappeared then. The music score were pretty good albeit repetitive. Because of the mix of cinematography and music GWAPE wasn't torturous to sit through but just because I survived it doesn't make it a good movie.My rating 310Rated PG13 for some sexual content.".

Then I pressed play on my video and half an hour later I was according to my girlfriend sleeping like a baby. Cue the jabs in the ribs that forced me to endure the remainder of this anaemic folly. I must say that I am often a fan of films in which very little of any consequence occurs. The previous night for instance I had loved every minute of The station Agent. This sort of film however can only work if it manages to engage. And in this The Girl with a Pearl Earring for all its beautiful costumes and scenery spectacularly fails. Colin Firth plays the same role we all know by heart and Scarlet Johansson simply fails to bring any sympathy or life to her character. Tom Wilkinson is as good as ever but his character is so one dimensional you wonder whether he has simply been copied and pasted from a comic book of villains. I was left rather annoyed by this pointless work. Firstly because I had been woken up to suffer it and secondly because every time I see the beautiful painting that inspired it I will be left with the painful image of a mute Scarlet Johansson and a mute Colin Firth in a room together with not an ounce of tension between them.".

Then I pressed play on my video and half an hour later I was according to my girlfriend sleeping like a baby. Cue the jabs in the ribs that forced me to endure the remainder of this anaemic folly. I must say that I am often a fan of films in which very little of any consequence occurs. The previous night for instance I had loved every minute of The station Agent. This sort of film however can only work if it manages to engage. And in this The Girl with a Pearl Earring for all its beautiful costumes and scenery spectacularly fails. Colin Firth plays the same role we all know by heart and Scarlet Johansson simply fails to bring any sympathy or life to her character. Tom Wilkinson is as good as ever but his character is so one dimensional you wonder whether he has simply been copied and pasted from a comic book of villains. I was left rather annoyed by this pointless work. Firstly because I had been woken up to suffer it and secondly because every time I see the beautiful painting that inspired it I will be left with the painful image of a mute Scarlet Johansson and a mute Colin Firth in a room together with not an ounce of tension between them.";

	schema:headline " Vermeer his servant and a painting";
	schema:reviewBody "In Holland of 17th century a humble girl named Griet Scarlett Johanson works as a maid in the house of the famous painter Johannes Vermeer Colin Firth and somehow contributes into the creation of a masterpiece.The film just like Tracy Chevalier's book on which is based narrates an imaginary story about who and what inspired Vermeer and led him make the Girl With A Pearl Earring painting. Few things are known about the personal life of Vermeer. He died at 43 after making 35 paintings and having 11 children. More than any other of the Dutch painters he analyzed the effect natural light had on a room and on a face something that influenced visually the film as well. It seems inevitable that the first thing everybody notices about this film is the stunning work done by the director of photography Eduardo Serra ASC AFC. The colors the lightning the surrounding environments create a harmony and every frame of the movie cries out for you to watch it and admire it. According to the cinematographer he didn't want the film look like a collection of Vermeer's paintings because something like that could possibly distract the viewers from the story. Well unfortunately for him but not for our eyes he didn't manage it.Although there are very few dialogues the script achieves to be multileveled. Initially it can be seen as a commentary on artistic inspiration. But there's much more in it. Griet intrudes into Vermeer's universe. She is the catalyst that makes things upside down in the household in a very silent way  much unlike the lead character in Pier Paolo Pasolini's THEOREM 1968. Griet has an inner energy that captivates the painter. She doesn't end up to be just a model for him she becomes something more. The relationship between the artist and his subject becomes deeper and deeper as Vermeer gets obsessed with his servant. Obsession plays a very important role in the story. Let's not forget that Vermeer lived in a household full of women and the only way to concentrate on his art was by having carved out his very personal space in the house. Neither his wife nor his mother in law or his children were qualified to enter there. But Griet manages it and there are many scenes that prove her understanding of Vermeer's art.While most films should have a tighter job in editing this one has the exact opposite problem. Its small duration may make it watchable but the characters seem to suffocate. They could be far more developed but the lost ground is covered by the liaisons created among them. Griet is totally charmed by her master. She admires him as a personality as an artist and of course as a man. But not even a moment does she forget her background and probably she ends up with Peter the butcher's son who from the very first moments showed his feelings about her  a rather perfect match. Vermeer's thoughts are more complexed. He somehow also admires Griet mainly because of her esteem on art. But his obsession with her is not based on erotic or sexual grounds. We can see that he's loyal to his wife but he just does what he has to do in order to serve his art. On the other hand Van Ruijven who is Vermeer's family's patron is presented as a rich and lecherous old man. He knows Vermeer's desperation for money and tries to take advantage of the growing intimacy between the master and the maid that seems obvious to him. Last but not least it must be said that in Vermeer's house light is a character of itself. It becomes brighter and more colorful as Griet evolves from a maid to his model.There is a strange chemistry between the lead actors but not very successful. Firth is undoubtedly a limited actor and although he tries his best it is not enough for such a challenging role. Johanson is surely more talented and her body language and face expressions are captivating. However many times in the film we have the sense that she repeats her performance in LOST IN TRANSLATION especially in scenes where not too much is shown but many are implied. So the room is empty for Judy PArfitt to make another excellent performance and build in a great way her character. Peter Webber is just another director and here he's doing a better job than usually mostly because of the materials he had in his hands. You can't distinct the director's personal touch throughout the film and that's not a good sign. My Grade 6.5 out of 10".

This posting is to encourage such kind of films.I don't know where to start to prize the qualities of this film! This is the most wonderful film which I saw for years.First of all On this board many people complained about the acting. For me the performance of Scarlett Johansson as Griet was just breathtaking. I never saw an actress playing so deeply and true speechless shyness fright uncertainty and submission. But same time she shows intelligence although if she plays an illiterate girl.This film reflects paintings. That means the characters are static and have not to be developed as many are claiming here. The other side of this film in painting style is the symbolic of the scenery An apple in Vermeers paintings is sufficient to evoke for the educated people of this time early baroque era the whole story of Adam and Eve sin and cognition. A lady sitting at a spinet with other words a virginal was a symbol for chastity only because of the second name of this instrument. If you don't understand the iconography of the Netherlands painting school don't watch this film and bother this board with I am so bored! or the pace of this film is so slow! If you never felt tears coming into your ears watching old masters in an art gallery this is not your film either. In this film are plenty of symbolic hints and allusions. The characters static as they are are sufficient to build up slowly an erotic tension between the model and the painter and to the other side jealousy to the family Vermeer.The most moving moment of this film was for me the following scene finally the painter succeeded to convince his model of putting on the pearl earring for the portrait. This earring is a symbol of wealthiness and noblesse which are not due to a maid. The turban was fashion in these times remembering the battles against the Turkish armies. The painter has to pierce a hole. This scene is a symbolic defloration. He pierces she is bleeding and than he is putting the pearl earring in the new hole. We see the face of Griet and a tear drop is running down her cheek. Thank you Scarlett for this great moment! So moving so tender so sad! There are plenty of details you would never see in a historic Hollywood film the weals of Griet her hands are worn up from her daily labour. The marks on her neck after the patron tried to violate her. The dirt on the market on the clothes. The clothes are hand woven handsewed handwashed I bet with everybody here. I never saw such a detailed staging. Vermeer was famous for his genre paintings which is reflected in this film we see the maid washing preparing dinner cleaning the steps of the door merging colours for the master ... One detail again the season is changing from winter to spring. I rarely saw a film where you really see the breath in the cold air from all actors! Nevertheless the whole film is only a fictional story that means a historic fiction how this painting of Vermeer could have been created. But for me very credible and inspiring.Only thing I would expect from a historic film historic music! Unfortunately the film music is modern and romanticising. I am dreaming of a historic film with real dialects of the epoch and film music of the epoch. Is there not enough fascinating music in these times? Contemporary composers from Jan Vermeer 16321675 are for example Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck 15621621 Joachim van den Hove 15671620 Claudio Monteverdi 1567 1643 Heinrich Schtz 15851672 Girolamo Frescobaldi 15831643 Constantijn Huygens 15961687 Carel Hacquart 16401701 Jacob van Eyck 15901657 Jan Baptist Verrijt 16001650 JeanBaptiste Lully 16321687 Dietrich Buxtehude 16371707 David Petersen 16501737 Arcangelo Corelli 16531713 Henry Purcell 16591695.The film music of Alexandre Desplat is not bad I don't want to be mistaken but it is like ketchup on a steamed whitefish. Only two films are coming into my mind where the music is historic both music films  Tous les matins du monde Alain Corneau 1991 and Farinelli Grard Corbiau 1994. About the historic language two films again The Passion of the Christ Mel Gibson 2004  don't know this film but Jesus is said to speaking Aramaic Apocalypto Mel Gibson 2006.

	schema:headline " Exquisitely beautiful adaptation of the novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.One of the things that Tracy Chevalier wanted to do in the novel was to make the relationship between Griet and Johannas Vermeer nonsexual. Olivia Hetreed's script and the direction by Peter Webber adhere to this ideal. In her imaginings of what the girl with the pearl earring was like and what her life was like I believe Chevalier thought it would be romantic in an artistic sense to have Vermeer's interest in her be artistic and not carnal. It is obvious from the exquisite beauty of the painting actual title Girl in a Turban that he very much admired her. It is difficult for me to believe that in that admiration he did not also feel some desire for her.Be that as it mayand I certainly respect Chevalier's interpretation and in fact think it makes for a more interesting story than if there had been some sexual involvementVermeer's wife Catharina sees in the painting beauty that she herself does not possess. She also cannot help but wonder just what it is that her husband and the pretty young girl do during all those hours upstairs. Yet the emphasis is on Catharina's jealousy of Griet's beauty and not on any imagined infidelity. I think this is consistent with Chevalier's interpretation of what the relationship between the maid and the great artist might have been.This movie surprised me in how beautiful it is and how carefully Peter Webber reconstructed 17th century Delft Holland. If you go to the IMDb you will see that there were some goofs and anachronisms such as a person in the background in one scene riding a bicycle. However the Holland of 340 years ago seemed authentic and graphically atmospheric including all the chores Griet had to do and the errands she had to runnote her red and bruised hands. They used lye in soap in those days. Still the open air market could have used a few more flies ha! and the butcher boy Cillian Murphy was entirely too pretty ha! but Vermeer's studio seemed magical and I love the mixing of the colors and the way the light came through the windows. There are at least three Vermeer paintings in which we see the same light from the same window the title painting the painting he was working on without the chair in the foreground that Griet removed called Young Woman with a Water Jug and The Painter's Studio. If I made a list of the most beautiful films I have ever seen Girl with a Pearl Earring would make the list along with e.g. Zhang Yimou's Raise the Red Lantern 1992 and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon 1975 and maybe a dozen more.As for Scarlett Johansson who had the title role I must say she won me over. At first I thought she was a bit too voluptuous for the part. It is interesting to compare the reconstruction of the painting with Johansson with the original shown at the end of the movie. The real girl was a bit more delicate and of course not as sensual as Johansson. Johansson won me over because of the subtly of her interpretation and because of the hard work she obviously put into the part. She is an actress we will see a lot of in the future. If you want to see her in less severe garb catch her in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation 2003 where her sensual beauty is more fully presented.Colin Firth very much caught the intensity of the artist and seemed to do so almost without effort. His eyes beheld Griet and indeed all the world not in a carnal way but in the penetrating way of the artist who wants to see the world as it really is not as our needs demand. We see this in the scene in which he insists that Griet see the real colors in the clouds not just the white that we think we see. Note too continuing Chevalier's theme that it would be inopportune careless and threatening to his artistic career for Vermeer to have an affair with the maid since with his motherinlaw in the house and his wife and some nosy tattling children he would have been caught. Vermeer only completed about 40 paintings in his lifetime. His wife or most especially his motherinlaw was indeed his most important patron. An artist without a patron sleeps in the streets especially in such a mercantile world as a small town in 17th century Holland.Catharina Vermeer Essie Davis in an underappreciated role provided exactly the right counterpoint with her vile snakeinthegardenofartisticeden presence and her purely burgher mentality and her oppressive jealousy and her highhanded treatment of her servants. Without Davis's excruciatingly vivid performance this movie would have flat and lack in tension.As for the ending and for the inevitable comparison with the novel let's say the ending here and the question of Griet's future life with the butcher boy is more open to interpretation than in the book where more is explained. See my review or better yet read the novel. The strength of the book is in how deeply we can go into the mind of Griet and into the artistic intimacy of her relationship with Vermeer whereas in the movie we can more fully appreciate the atmosphere and the beauty of the artist's vision.By the way in the novel it is clear that Griet does indeed desire Vermeer but realizes that his station is too much above hers and his circumstances with five children and a sixth on the way leave no room for her. Also clear in both mediums is the fact that Vermeer's exquisite portrait is in effect his way of making love to her.".

It is obvious from the exquisite beauty of the painting actual title Girl in a Turban that he very much admired her. It is difficult for me to believe that in that admiration he did not also feel some desire for her.Be that as it mayand I certainly respect Chevalier's interpretation and in fact think it makes for a more interesting story than if there had been some sexual involvementVermeer's wife Catharina sees in the painting beauty that she herself does not possess. She also cannot help but wonder just what it is that her husband and the pretty young girl do during all those hours upstairs. Yet the emphasis is on Catharina's jealousy of Griet's beauty and not on any imagined infidelity. I think this is consistent with Chevalier's interpretation of what the relationship between the maid and the great artist might have been.This movie surprised me in how beautiful it is and how carefully Peter Webber reconstructed 17th century Delft Holland. If you go to the IMDb you will see that there were some goofs and anachronisms such as a person in the background in one scene riding a bicycle. However the Holland of 340 years ago seemed authentic and graphically atmospheric including all the chores Griet had to do and the errands she had to runnote her red and bruised hands. They used lye in soap in those days. Still the open air market could have used a few more flies ha! and the butcher boy Cillian Murphy was entirely too pretty ha! but Vermeer's studio seemed magical and I love the mixing of the colors and the way the light came through the windows. There are at least three Vermeer paintings in which we see the same light from the same window the title painting the painting he was working on without the chair in the foreground that Griet removed called Young Woman with a Water Jug and The Painter's Studio. If I made a list of the most beautiful films I have ever seen Girl with a Pearl Earring would make the list along with e.g. Zhang Yimou's Raise the Red Lantern 1992 and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon 1975 and maybe a dozen more.As for Scarlett Johansson who had the title role I must say she won me over. At first I thought she was a bit too voluptuous for the part. It is interesting to compare the reconstruction of the painting with Johansson with the original shown at the end of the movie. The real girl was a bit more delicate and of course not as sensual as Johansson. Johansson won me over because of the subtly of her interpretation and because of the hard work she obviously put into the part. She is an actress we will see a lot of in the future. If you want to see her in less severe garb catch her in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation 2003 where her sensual beauty is more fully presented.Colin Firth very much caught the intensity of the artist and seemed to do so almost without effort. His eyes beheld Griet and indeed all the world not in a carnal way but in the penetrating way of the artist who wants to see the world as it really is not as our needs demand. We see this in the scene in which he insists that Griet see the real colors in the clouds not just the white that we think we see. Note too continuing Chevalier's theme that it would be inopportune careless and threatening to his artistic career for Vermeer to have an affair with the maid since with his motherinlaw in the house and his wife and some nosy tattling children he would have been caught. Vermeer only completed about 40 paintings in his lifetime. His wife or most especially his motherinlaw was indeed his most important patron. An artist without a patron sleeps in the streets especially in such a mercantile world as a small town in 17th century Holland.Catharina Vermeer Essie Davis in an underappreciated role provided exactly the right counterpoint with her vile snakeinthegardenofartisticeden presence and her purely burgher mentality and her oppressive jealousy and her highhanded treatment of her servants. Without Davis's excruciatingly vivid performance this movie would have flat and lack in tension.As for the ending and for the inevitable comparison with the novel let's say the ending here and the question of Griet's future life with the butcher boy is more open to interpretation than in the book where more is explained. See my review or better yet read the novel. The strength of the book is in how deeply we can go into the mind of Griet and into the artistic intimacy of her relationship with Vermeer whereas in the movie we can more fully appreciate the atmosphere and the beauty of the artist's vision.By the way in the novel it is clear that Griet does indeed desire Vermeer but realizes that his station is too much above hers and his circumstances with five children and a sixth on the way leave no room for her. Also clear in both mediums is the fact that Vermeer's exquisite portrait is in effect his way of making love to her.";

But if there is one thing that this film does very well it is creating some very good surreal visuals  and this is not to be understated. Surrealist film lovers should make this a must see.At its core the film is about Lucifer's premonition of the tragedy of mankind as told to Adam and Eve in a dream after they are banned from Eden. The dream starts at Athens where Adam Eve and their son find themselves at the wrong end of the first form of democracy which is an irrational mob rule  they are the royals and when Adam fails to deliver the wishes of the people he is killed.Adam later finds himself in Byzantium as what I can only speculate a Roman soldier. At this point the film kind of becomes confusing to anyone who isn't highly educated in European history. So after this the film is technically very hard to follow but visually it's a kind of surreal experience. It goes to periods in the history of western civilization which are some of the most bloody and repressive. Lucifers plan here in telling these premonitions to Adam and Eve was to try to get them to end their lives because if they did it would prevent all of these future tragedies from happening.There are times where you can tell that the film was probably rushed through post production. But overall it's a miracle that such a film was made in the first place. It's a cast composed entirely of children but they do quite well at taking direction from Jeles. You can tell that their performances were a kind of you stand there kind of thing. While Adam Eve and Lucifer are the only characters with character the supporting cast's mechanical performances create an appropriate contrast and set the mood of the film quite effectively.My biggest problem with the film is the VHS transfer it's terrible. I can only hope that in the future this film is given proper distribution. But it is so obscure I doubt it ever will.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am afraid that nobody will understand this movie unless he or she doesn't know one of the greatest Hungarian dramatic play of the XIXth century The Tragedy of Man written by Imre Madch. The plot after the loss of the garden of Eden Lucifer the demon of Denial shows to Adam and Eve the different ages of mankind to prove them that there is no reason for them to live. In their dream they live for a while in ancient Egypt Greece Rome in medieval Byzantium in the revolutionary Paris etc. This is a romantic and pessimistic vision  with a strange optimistic ending. The director of this movie had a great idea he has chosen not grown up actors and actresses but little boys and girls so the plot is even more complex more poetic and more visionary. A beautiful movie to watch  but if you don't know the drama of Madch perhaps you won't understand everything. Anyway it is worth the time!".

The plot after the loss of the garden of Eden Lucifer the demon of Denial shows to Adam and Eve the different ages of mankind to prove them that there is no reason for them to live. In their dream they live for a while in ancient Egypt Greece Rome in medieval Byzantium in the revolutionary Paris etc. This is a romantic and pessimistic vision  with a strange optimistic ending.

The first time I read the play I was amazed by the breadth and scope of it and actually thought This will never make it to screen  it's too big.For more information on the play see httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiImreMadC3A1ch  warning the Wiki article contains spoilers.I now own a copy of it and enjoy it every time I watch it. The movie adaptation can be a bit daunting for those who have not read the play so in my opinion reading it is defiantly recommended.I only have two issues with the movie1 Only ten of the original fifteen acts are included.2 The entire cast is children. An interesting conceit but not really necessary as the original protagonists were written in standard mode ie kings nuns soldiers etc. were portrayed as adults.Overall a very good movie with terrific locations photography and acting from it's young cast.".

Somewhere between the Creation of Man and his Redemption the viewer is set adrift in a sea of spectral images who' purpose is known only to the director or to Pablo Picasso. Despite some provocative moments such as baring all with a nude Adam and Eve the collage of words and historical settings the film overwhelm the viewer and destroys what little message the director intended to impart.

But it's not a cheesy slapdash blackandwhite improvised exercise in egotism either. Whatever it is it's been constructed with lavish care.Children average age about ten I would guess enact myths and maybe some real historical events from Western history. It begins with part of the familiar text from Genesis  Adam and Eve and Lucifer and the apple.Then it switched from the Bible to something a little tougher an enactment of certain events in Greek history involving a boy named Cimon and somebody named Crispos. I only recognized the name of Miltiades and that only cropped up once in a while.A slow switch to what the title tells us is Byzantium. I'm glad there was such a title otherwise I'd have been utterly lost. Two kids Tancred and Isaura now seem to be in love at least as far as I could make out. In my ignorance I could only associate the boy's name with one of those operas that never get produced.Before I knew it they were dealing with Johannes Kepler the German astronomerastrologistmathematician. I learned two things about him that I hadn't known. He gave political advice based on the stars and his mother was imprisoned for witchcraft. Good. I mean good that I learned something not good that his mother was a witch.Vorkapich to the French Revolution by which time there is little trace left of mythos and a lot more of thencurrent events.That was a bit more than halfway through about as far as I could get.You may get a lot farther depending on your taste for highly stylized enactment of mythical and real events by preadolescent children. The kids don't really have to act. It's as if they'd been given directions to speak softly or whisper to move slowly to assume strange postures and never ever to giggle or look at the camera.Despite the ambitious subject matter we're not talking epic film here. The budget must have been small but there's still a lot of talent behind the camera. The compositions arty though they may be are appealing to the eye. The production designer deserves a medal for making so much out of so little. The very texture of the walls sings. Wardrobe is splendidly done and the make up is even better than anything I've seen in Polk Gulch on Halloween night. That's saying a lot.I'm just not sure I see the point though. Why children? For the Garden of Eden okay  but the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror? How about goats next? And for my benighted mind the agenda was too ambitious. If I KNEW the events already I'd have been able to follow the story. But man if your memory is blank or even hazy you're in serious trouble.Still though the conception might be flawed I give the writer and director bonus points for being willing to take such a major chance and to invest the effort with what was clearly a lot of love.

The visuals are stunning the score plays a significant role in the atmosphere and the use of child actors adds fundamental new meaning to the original stage play. It's a philosophical view on good and evil and tackles the big questions of life via poetry history and surrealism. Though made to look like a dream it touches on profound questions of reality.One scene which was particularly thoughprovoking was the one in which a woman gives birth while standing above an open grave. The cycle of life and death hinted at by the quote from Ecclesiastes right at the beginning is here taken to its visual extreme. This harrowing image is followed by a very serene sequence portraying the eternal peace of the deceased.In all of this the choice for child actors adds extra layers of meaning. Their very age seems to comment on the issues shown death violence injustice and so on. There is a lot of blood and a lot of lust shown on screen but the actors are still playing hide and seek and let's pretend in real life. It's that mixture of playful innocence and adult history adorned with some of the most beautiful literary quotes which gives this film its daring and unique style.One of the themes running through the film is the question of how we look at the world at ourselves and at history. The movie challenges us to open up and accept unusual viewpoints which is what all great art does in my opinion. It's necessary especially when confronted with violence and injustice and forced to look for solutions.I do admit it's trying at times and it was mostly out of curiosity to see this remarkable achievement all the way through that I watched the whole thing. Still it left me with an impression unlike anything else I have seen before. I wonder what the actors think of the film now that they have all grown up and how they look back on their experience in making it. Maybe it felt just like a dream.".

'Spy Hard's' purpose is to create a comical version of James Bond and similar spythemed films. Some of the comedy is very funny but some of it wears thin throughout the film. You'll either enjoy the sense of humour or you will hate it. WD40 is a great name for the secret agent and Mr. T even makes an appearance. There is also a lot of adultthemed humour. By the end of the film I was ready for it to be finished. It's funny but it's not brilliant but I cannot complain because it did let me laugh. If you like Austin Powers you will probably like this even though it is not as popular. It will also take you right back to the early 1990s. Not a perfect film it does have some good humour.".

The Secret Service headquarters is just full of secret crannies where weirdos are hiding. Especially the director's office. You always find something goofy hidden in there. In addition to Nielsen's trademark spotlightstealing sight gags there are many subtle insults including the use of the Disney Animation Studio faade as the establishing exterior shot of the Agency headquarters you can see the Seven Dwarfs in the architecture and the fact that Agent 3.14 in addition to her number being pi speaks with a huge French accent even though she's Russian. I particularly love the character of Coleman. I always laugh when he sees the Rancor tape and utters a Bostonese Gooed Gwad!. The characters are great in this. There is Steele's trusty sidekick Kabul who has a different car in every scene and Andy Griffith is an excellent villain. One of the best parts of this movie is Weird Al Yankovic's opening title song spoofing Thunderball's.For goodness' sakes rent it if you haven't seen it yet. WATCH FOR THOSE CAMEOS!".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSOne of the saddest sights in cinema is when a likable actor produces vastly inferior work as a result of growing old. In Spy Hard we are shown that sadly Leslie Nielsen has befallen this fate. Starting in the 1950's with Ransom! and Forbidden Planet both 1956 Nielsen would eventually become a king of the slapstick comedy. Staring in television's Police Squad 1982 and eventually evolving this idea into the brilliant series of Naked Gun films 1988 1991 and 1994 Nielsen appeared to be on a role. Sadly however only two years after that third outing as Frank Drebin Nielsen produced this amusing but awkward spoof of the Spy film.In Spy Hard Leslie Nielsen plays Dick Steele codename Agent WD40. Coming out of retirement to fight his long term adversary General Rancor Andy Griffith Steele encounters the daughter of his lost love and a beautiful Russian Agent who he slowly falls for.Spy Hard does have the potential to be brilliant. With Weird Al Yankovic providing the Bond copying opening soundtrack it sets off to a nice start. It soon drops off though until it reaches a disappointing finale which grates on the skin.Whilst Yankovic might add to the movie as does Nicolette Sheridan's delectable Russian Agent the flaws with this outing are vast and numerous in comparison to it's positives. The character of Rancor is just irrelevant and dumb the occasional famous cameo Hulk Hogan Mr T Dr Joyce Brothers is stuck in randomly and badly to give the audience an extra moment of happiness whilst the spoof of Miss Moneypenny entitled Miss Cheevus is overwritten and placed as an unexplained traitor. In the end of the day however these points could perhaps of been overlooked if Nielsen had simply been ten years younger.For the leading Spy who is expected to sleep with countless beautiful women to be an obviously aged fifty year old feels almost offensive. This isn't meant to be some sort of ageist comment yes in this world of excessive Political Correctness ageist IS a word it's simply a fact. Nielsen looks slow and knackered and positively farcical in this role. Perhaps just perhaps this is meant to be a spoof of Bond in it's own right implying that when men like Sean Connery can reprise the role at an old age the series looses respect. Ultimately however this does seem unlikely and it seems more predictable that Nielsen simply wanted to play the lead part. If this is the case I'm sorry Leslie but it's time you retire with what little grace and dignity that you have left.In summary Spy Hard could have been good. There are one or two very nice lines in there with some thrown in movie tributes as well ultimately however it collapses on it's face. It's not the worst spoof ever created but with Nielsen leading the way it's not that far off.".

The best thing about this movie the 5 star moment was the opening credits sung by Wierd Al. After that to say it's ok is pushing it. It's bad but not bad enough to be good.

Considering the material which movies they spoofed they could've done better most of the movies spoofedand especially the main theme James Bond movies could've been parodied a lot better. Unless you're a hardcore fan of Leslie Nielsen you probably won't enjoy this film on any more than a casual level as it's nothing special. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they truly can't stand the very thought of there being a spoof movie that they haven't seen.

It was difficult to find anything to laugh at in this film indeed the only bit in the film i laughed at was the fight scene where Agent WD40 is recieving a beating when suddenly who should tag in but Hulk Hogan. Of course not even the Hulkster is tough enough to defeat the goons so in tags...a granny! That had me rolling on the floor laughing. Unfortunately one joke is no reason to watch a film and Spy Hard certainly isn't worth watching. For fans of the Naked GunAirplane style comedy i reccomend Mafia!  that is a great film.

The second thing i noticed is when he is fighting in Natalie's birthday party where there is by the way blackjack and dice games. Way to parent your 15 year old daughter. I wish i could go to a we will frisk you before you can come in party when i was 15. After the fight Francois Molay the henchman manage to say something like That guy is an agent cause he had to learn those moves in the CIA.

	schema:reviewBody "Agent Cody Banks deserves much more attention than it getsPlot Cody Banks Frankie Muniz learns he is a secret agent and he is brought in for training by Ronica Miles Angie Harmon who ends up his sidekick. He meets the CIA Director Keith David and prepares on his first mission while his parents Mrs. Banks Cynthia Stevenson and Mr. Banks Daniel Roebuck along with his younger brother Alex Banks Connor Widdows have no idea what is going on. His mission is to get close to Natalie Connors Hilary Duff in hopes that she will invite him to her birthday party so he can use the opportunity to spy on her dad Dr. Connors Martin Donovan because he is under suspicion for working for ERIS an illegal corporation. Complications arise when Natalie is kidnapped and Cody must rescue her.The Good News Right away the film starts with a big action sequence and it's a very impressive one at that. There is so much to like here it's a wonder that this series has never gotten as much attention as the Spy Kids series even if the second film is lousy. Director Herald Zwart brings a lot of flair to this film as the film is shot beautifully and never looks cheap or boring. The script by Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski is never boring and never loses your interest when nothing is happening. The acting is great long time friends Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff star and Hilary Duff shows the talent that would carry her through the next few years and Frankie Muniz is no slacker in the role of Cody Banks and it's no surprise that he would go on to be a star even if he never got as much fame as Hilary. The best supporting roles go to Keith David as the CIA Director and it's not a wonder that he returned for the sequel and the other one goes to Angie Harmon as Ronica Miles. She is energetic on screen and you fell her presence throughout the film. The plot while nothing new proves you don't have to always have a fresh plot to make the film enjoyable. The film's tag line is one of the best and it sets the tone for the film the running time is 102 minutes but it seems a lot shorter than that and has a high re watchability factor. The action scenes are outstanding and the two that come off as the best are the diner scene and the ending. There are more such as when Cody is at Natalie's birthday party and he's spying on Dr. Connors and the beginning it's really hard to pick a favorite one but the diner scene and the ending come off as the best. I also recorded a few good laughs here and there between the action breaks. One of the biggest laughs is Ronica's first appearance I don't want to ruin it for you as it is the biggest laugh our of the entire film. I'm also not a big fan of the boyfriend and girlfriend situation but here is works well and flows well with the plot. The Bad News I couldn't find anything wrong except a few logical errors which every film hasConclusion If you like action or adventure movies then this film is definitely for you and if you haven't seen it already grab yourself a DVD copy today! RecommededRated PG for action violence mild language and some sensual content".

Me being a teenager myself went to see this movie mainly because I like spy movies and well heh there's Hilary Duff in it. This movie should've been PG  13 because  Attract bigger audience they show a guy get eaten away from the inside Cody's special Xray glasses where you see about two girls backsides lol the action is pretty intense and loud for smaller kids the girls in the movie are pretty mean with the are you in special ed? jokes PG material but ya know young kids can pick up on that wreckless driving for Christ sake please if you see Hilary Duff driving move about 100 miles from where you saw it oh and the same with Frankie little kids when they get older might pick up on this bad driving skills fighting  pretty intense at times especially when you get kicked in the head and the bad guy is really ugly might give kids nightmares he seriously was scarier then ZAO in Die Another Day I think that was his name but the guy with the diamonds in his face.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I laughed at this movie alot more then I thought I was going to comedy scale  7 I really was impressed by the action in this movie as well action scale  8 12 the fighting was cool too fighting scale  6 and the chicks were almost the best part chicks scale  10!!!!

	schema:reviewBody "Normally I dislike and somewhat resent unoriginal movies that are simply an exercise in age regression of an established franchise to target a younger consumer audience Young Indiana Jones Young Sherlock Holmes Muppet Babies et al . This practice ruined Saturday morning for me even moreso than mandatory comicrelief characters Scrappy Doo anyone?. To be honest I went in expecting VERY little from Agent Cody Banks which was obviously a spy genre movie targeted at consumers too old for Spy Kids and too young to get into Bond films.The story concerns a standout from an experimental new government recruiting facility that takes high school kids to a 'summer camp' which is actually a hightech training operation for young CIA operatives. Cody Banks is one of the 'graduates' of this program who is currently simply getting by in his regular routine until his country calls him up to active duty.It seems a nerdy scientist has developed nanobots capable of eating their way through just about anything at the atomic level originally designed to clean up oil spills in offshore disasters. Needless to say the funding for the project is supplied by a shadowy character with plans for world domination and of course he has a menacing henchman Francois  rather ironic considering the US relations with France at the moment who does the physical dirty work on the mastermind's behalf. When the villains seek to kidnap the daughter Duff of the nerdy scientist to gain control over the nanobots Cody Banks Muniz is called into active service and given an array of spy gear that would make Bond envious. The side 'gimmick' is that Cody is shy and cannot talk to girls which makes him 'endearing' juxtaposed to Bond's womanizing talents. In all other respects Cody is a 5' tall 15 year old James Bond.Sounds like a Bond film? It is. Only better than the last three Bond outings believe it or not. I am actually fairly certain the sets and props used at the end of the film are recycled from early Bond films most notably the sub bay and maglev train from Moonraker andor Man With the Golden Gun I cannot remember which film for sure but you'll recognize it when you see it. The plot while COMPLETELY unoriginal is consistent and engaging enough to hold the attention especially if you are too young to have seen the Bondspy movies it borrows from. The gadgets are fairly interesting and again while derivative of earlier franchises are fun to see in the hands of a teenager.The acting is fairly credible such as it is with a few exaggerated and overacted spy film stereotypes. There's no profanity no nudity no drugs though what COULD be alcohol if you wanted to see it as such plenty of action and the requisite actionfilm violence and one fairly gruesome death at the end.This movie is targeted squarely at the 'puberty set' but is still enjoyable by all ages. My 5 year old son  really enjoyed it and nothing in the film was more objectionable than what he watches on broadcast TV perhaps less so to be honest.I recommend this film to anyone that likes spy films and anyone looking for a 'safe' film the entire family can enjoy.".

And it did also work for the Swedish audience with about 360'000 admissions two weeks after its opening in Sweden. Looks like they have just waited for this one. If I got it right then this is the first film out in the trilogy based on the novels by Jan Guillou. So there is a lot to look forward for me.

	schema:headline " Looks good but the acting and plot makes it only average";
	schema:reviewBody "I have not read any of Jan Guillou's Hamilton novels. I have thought about it but as of yet haven't gotten round to it. But from what I've heard about this movie it is very loosely based on the books. Most of the Hamilton books were written from the middle of the 1980s to the middle of 1990s. One could compare it to the movie Casino Royale in the way that it has been modernised to the post 911 world. So what I mean is this movie is completely self standing you won't have to read the books or see any of the previous Hamilton movies.So what did I think of this movie? The short answer it is no more than an average action flick.The look of the movie is outstanding for a Swedish one. I don't mean that in a bad way but it visually has taken a big step towards international standards. Sweden makes good movies but the action ones hasn't been their strongest. The technical aspects of this movie are just so impressive. Both the execution of the action scenes and the overall look of the film makes me think of the Bourne movies. And yes there is some shaky cam in the action. Still it's not a problem it works fine most of the time helping to create this brutal feel that the movie has. And talking of brutal that is something the movie really is. A lot of graphic killing scenes and the characters take down guys with little hesitation. Is it unnecessary much? No I don't think so but don't expect the lean back action blockbuster type of film. Music fits well for the tone of the film but nothing memorable.Those were the strong parts of Hamilton  I nationens intresse. Now on to the weak ones. The by far biggest weakness in it is the complete lack of a interesting story. It is something about private military companies and false flag operations. But half ways in to it one has pretty much lost track of what is really going on but it doesn't matter because the action is the only really entertainment you will find here. When I after the movie were talking to other about what story really was one realises that it is just the usual conspiracy stuff that you neither want nor need to follow. The only part where I saw the tiny glimmer of interest was Carl Hamilton as a character so maybe I should go and read the books. But all this falls completely on the acting oh the acting. It's a long time since I've seen performances as wooden as these. I mean one knows how Mikael Persbrandt acts and it is no difference here. He looks cool and has really trained his body up for the part but he shows less emotion than the Terminator. But I must partly blame the director here because it is not just him. The entire cast are more stiff than statues. And there are many actors here that I know can act having seen them in many other movies. There is absolutely no life beneath the good looking surface. Neither in the story or the characters.To sum up my short review of Hamilton  I nationens intresse. The production is great looks stylish and the action is among the best I have seen in a Swedish film. But the dull plot and some of the worst acting I have seen in a long time makes this fail almost entirely as a whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the latest installment in the Hamilton franchise the first feature film was made in 1989 Tcknamn Coq Rougeat that time Stellan Skarsgrd played Hamilton. Over the years there have been many TVfilm productions about Hamilton made specifically for a Swedish audience.For people who are not familiar with the Hamilton seriesfranchise its basically the Swedish equivalent to James Bond or Jason Bourne. Hamilton is a secret agent with a license to kill has been trained by the US Navy Seals and undergone training at the Swedish special forces.This film series is based on a popular book series written by left wing radical authorjournalist Jan Guillou and therefore offers a more leftist liberal point view in the world of espionage.Hamilton  I nationens intresse 2012is based on one of the novels that was written during the cold war and some storyline details people etc have been changed in order to update the material.The story is pretty simple Hamilton goes undercover with a group of Russian weapons smuggler who are stealing Swedish made rockets. But the smugglers gets attacked by a unknown group of heavily armed soldiers.Hamilton suspects they might have connection to a Private military contractor based in the USA. He starts to investigate but quickly ends in trouble...As I mentioned earlier there have been many adaptations of the books mainly made for Swedish TV. The technical quality have been poor or downright crappy. This film however has a very impressive high production value direction and some nice action sequences rarely seen in Swedish film.Director Kathrine Windfeld seems to be very inspired by the films of Paul Greengrass especially his work on the Bourne franchise.Hamilton in this film is more darker complex character then I've ever seen him before. Mikael Persbrandt brings a lot of personality and depth which is pretty impressive because the books portray him as an cartoon figure superhero who has no flaws.Here he is more human flawed brooding and is haunted by his job the decisions he has to make. And how can he continue having this job and live a normal life? Its nice update by Kathrine Windfeld and screenwriter Stefan Thunberg.Casting overall is pretty good but contains some surprises.Seba Mubarak as Mouna Al Fathar a PLO intelligence officer friend and colleague to Hamilton is well casted. But the problem is that Mouna was more independent in the books and here almost does nothing other looking beautiful next to Hamilton.It isn't Seba Mubarak fault mainly a script flaw and a waste of a talented actress who has nothing do. But I was surprised that they didn't cast some Swedish actors with middleastern background like Nina Zanjani Nour ElRefai etc.Lennart Hjulstrm as Hamiltons closest boss and father figure is excellent and does his job perfect. And he comes close to the original in the books.Jason Flemyng as Rob Hart is good but I felt that this should been played by an American actor someone like Michael Madsen Michael Biehn etc. Rob Hart is one of the bad guys and Flemyng seems to have had a lot of fun with the character.The biggest problem with this film is the script it touches on some very interesting subjects like Swedish weapons export corruption among Swedish politicians private military contractors but unfortunately Stefan Thunberg doesn't manage to fit the pieces together.Too bad because recently a new discussion has blossomed in Sweden over sales of weapons to Saudi arabia. Also and ongoing discussion about certain politicians and their connections to an oil company called Lundin Oil.One of the largest stock holders is Swedish minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt. When two Swedish journalists wanted to investigate Lundin oils affairs in Sudan they were arrested. Bildt has so far done nothing to release them.All the above mentioned is touched upon but never developed throughout the film.So a very flawed film experience but with higher production values then usual. So future viewers who expect this film to be better then Green Zone 2010 Shooter 2007 might be disappointed.But it is worth a rental mainly because of Persbrandts approach to Hamilton.".

Apparently this film is based on a longrunning series of spy novels and I hope to see more of the same given the quality of this movie. HAMILTON plays out as a gutsy realistic thriller set in the world of international arms smuggling in which massacre terrorism and bombings seem to be almost daily occurrences.Films like this thrive on their action scenes and the ones that take place in HAMILTON are superior well shot with none of the shakycam work where you can't see what's going on. The cast give assured performances especially the alwaysentertaining Jason Flemyng who gives one of the best acting jobs I've seen from him. There's not a great deal of fighting in the movie but the suspense remains high throughout especially during the fantastic tensionfilled climax.

In fact the movie does start with quite a shocking moment something one rarely seen in other action movies and later on in the movie there is actually a moment of thought in terms of even agents are under law.

Other than that it is rather entertaining it is funny to see justice the guy kills people in self defense all day long yet it have nothing to do with justice the guy kills someone accidentally and it have nothing to do with justice. Justice is what you make it I think the movie shows the superficial nature of the action hero showing nothing he does as truly meriting existence but the fact that people allow themselves to be a part of the superficial existence where violence is required both the hero and the bad guys allow themselves to be a part of it. This action movie seems to show this intentional as some moral or ethic it does not show the protagonist as some hero instead just guy who has a rather meaningless violent existence conditioned by his meaningless environment to be dangerous as if he were not responsible. A type of helpless violent existence. The movie is both realistic and crude.".

Gustaf Hammarsten as Swedish technical consultant is both believable and nicely played. The role is however small. Seba felt like the filmmakers could not portray fairly. She gave more than enough but they could not capture it fully. Big big disappointment is August Ekborg Hjulstrm and in most scenes Anderson. They come in read their lines and done. Zero intensity. I expected much more from these Swedish giants. The foreign crew how ever did fits into well. They do a good job and feels credible. I would not nominate any actor in this production for any award though.The close combat scenes stinks and there are other scenes when it feels like someone poured syrup in the machinery. There are times when slow tempo adds ... but usually it will just fall flat boring and TTBA Try To Be Artsy.The screenplay is more pretentious than good. I have no high thoughts of Jan Guillou. In my opinion he is probably one of the most speculative writer journalist and media personality in Sweden. That and a nasty selfrighteous attitude shines through in all his productions.Many negative words for a movie I rate 610 but thats the thing. It is never the less entertaining and if one starts to watch one want to see the whole movie.".

I was pretty stoked about this film mainly because of all the hype it received prior to screening. I became particularly interested when I heard that Kathrine Windfeld would direct it. One of the selling points the movie had was that it was directed by a woman something that according to the actors themselves would bring more depth to the characters. Well that didn't happen at all. Mikael Persbrandt is playing himself basically. Boring a trytolookcoolforthecamera guy while delivering his lines like there was a teleprompter in front of him.There is no real development of the characters and the plot just falls flat pretty early in the movie. This movie tries to hard making it just another film in the dozen. Also the English spoken by the Swedish actors is extremely bad it really distracts and completely ruins bits of the experience. On the positive side yes there are some I have to mention the special effects. The team did a solid job on that kudos! Other than that I would not recommend you seeing this. It's worth a rent at the most some people might enjoy seeing a Swedish blockbuster. A big flop unfortunately!".

This will allow the CIA to start a new war which will keep both them and the PMC happily employed for many years. Luckily our Swedish spook who murders his own girlfriend by accident  !!!  because of course all soldiers are killing machines teams up with his buddies in the PLO who are regardless of your opinions on IsraelPalestine still terrorists to stop them. Needless to say this is not how the world works.
