	schema:reviewBody "I finally managed to acquire a copy of this almost forgotten film chiefly because of my interest in John Barrymore. The film has never been shown on TV in Europe and is unavailable on video or DVD so it was a delightful surprise to discover how very good it is.1933 was perhaps John Barrymore's best year in films just before the slide into alcoholism reduced him to infrequent supporting roles. As well as Reunion in Vienna he made Topaze another delightful film Counsellor at Law perhaps his greatest screen performance and Dinner at 8 a close second.If you want proof of Barrymore's sheer star quality and presence take a look at Reunion in Vienna. He dominates the screen in every scene he is in and when he is on screen it is difficult to look at anyone else. His wonderfully mellifluous voice is particularly well recorded in this film and his performance is so full of delightful details and many ad lib physical touches that one can see how superb he must have been on stage.Equally surprising here is the subtle performance by Frank Morgan before his familiar bumbling stammering persona took over almost every performance he gave at MGM. He was a much better actor than remembered today.The supporting cast is a delight although not populated by the many migrs that would shortly arrive from Nazi Europe and become a regular part of Hollywood's scene. Compare this film with THE GREAT WALTZ 1938 to see what I mean.As a result the Hapsburg aristocrats are mostly played by Americans the exception being Eduardo Cianelli who is genuinely touching giving an excellent portrayal of a devoted servant to his old master.The music score is credited to William Axt even though it is really a potpourri of themes by Johann Strauss. The exception is a main theme which is a direct steal from Romberg's NEW MOON then a fairly new work and filmed 2 years before by MGM with Grace Moore and Lawrence Tibbett. Possibly Dr Axt decided to borrow the waltz One Kiss and vary it slightly for this film.As others point out here the art direction is beautiful throughout and Ms Wynyard never looked more radiant.In all a delightful and superbly acted film that should be on DVD. Why isn't it? The print I have looks as if it has never left the vault in 80 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cliff Robertson was a good choice to play Lt. John F. Kennedy new PT boat commander in 1944. He looked a bit like Kennedy and was able to recreate many of his mannerisms. This movie hit the theaters in the USA in June 1963 just after I graduated from high school and only five months before President Kennedy died from a bullet in Dallas Texas. I remember it well it was perfect for the times as it dramatized the events where the boat PT 109 was rammed by a Japanese destroyer and sank but Kennedy was able to lead the survivors to safety in the hostile South Pacific waters.The movie opens in August 1942 the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific the US Navy was using PT boats because they were fast had a shallow draft and carried a good complement of torpedoes. We first see Lt. Kennedy receiving his assignment aboard a destroyer in 1943 or 1944 then landing on the island base. With no active boats available he was offered the PT 109 which had been neglected and was not shipshape. He was given a makeshift crew and one week to get it seaworthy. Which he and his men do and pass the inspection with flying colors. Kennedy is shown as a leader by example working side by side with his men and taking the time to thank them for a job well done.The movie goes on to show the deployment of the 109 into regular service and the incident which resulted in the sinking of the boat and subsequent fight for survival. Even though he was eligible for an assignment stateside Kennedy took another boat and continued the battle. It is well made for a 1963 movie.Kennedy was born in 1917 and was 26 when he enlisted in the Navy after Harvard. When he was 38 he completed his book Profiles In Courage which won a Pulitzer Prize. When he was only 43 in 1960 he defeated Richard Nixon and became President of the USA. In November 1963 he was dead. In spite of his flaws as a man as a leader and as a President he was remarkable and this is a good movie to remind us of that.".

	schema:headline " Surviving A MidOcean Collision";
	schema:reviewBody "I well remember PT 109 coming out in movie theaters during the summer of 1963. It was still playing in the hinterlands when the events of November 22 of that year occurred.Probably Cliff Robertson wisely decided not to try for a Boston accent in his portrayal of the 35th president of the United States during his World War II years. If he had he might have come off as imitating Vaughn Meader imitating John F. Kennedy. As it is the only concession he made to the role was a bit of reddish tint in his hair to suggest the man he was playing. It worked rather well and still works today.Ironically though had their been other U.S. Navy craft near the PT 109 when the Japanese battleship Amagiri sliced it like a loaf of bread in the middle of the night who could have picked up survivors Lieutenant j.g. John F. Kennedy probably would have been facing a court martial for losing his boat that way. It was the only PT boat in World War II lost to the Japanese in that manner.But the story is not about that as it was the survival of all but two of his crew who were killed in the collision. It's about Lieutenant Kennedy towing an injured man while swimming for a deserted Pacific island and keeping his men alive until they could be rescued. The Navy was not about to court martial a hero.Warner Brothers filled out the rest of the cast with some tried and true players some like Ty Hardin and Grant Williams from their television series which was rapidly taking over the Warner Brothers lot. Particularly I liked James Gregory as the career naval officer in charge of the PT squadron and Michael Pate as Australian coast watcher Reg Evans. This is one of the few American made films where Michael Pate plays someone from his own country.I remember on Jack Paar's Friday night variety show he devoted an entire hour to one long commercial for this film. He reunited all of the surviving PT 109 survivors with Australian coast watcher Reg Evans who had a big hand in rescuing them. Evans had met Kennedy of course but had never met the rest of the crew. The whole living crew was there except the skipper who was in the White House and who could know he'd be the next one to die.If JFK had lived and been running for reelection in 1964 what a great piece of election propaganda PT 109 would have been. The story also had a lot to do with his successful campaign in 1960. Kennedy was running under the cloud of his father Joseph P. Kennedy being a supporter of appeasement back in the day. This story and the death of his older brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. in combat in the European theater blunted a lot of the criticism of the actions of his father.PT 109 is a nicely done war film and a great piece of nostalgia for the Kennedy years.".

	onyx:emotionText "I well remember PT 109 coming out in movie theaters during the summer of 1963. It was still playing in the hinterlands when the events of November 22 of that year occurred.Probably Cliff Robertson wisely decided not to try for a Boston accent in his portrayal of the 35th president of the United States during his World War II years. If he had he might have come off as imitating Vaughn Meader imitating John F. Kennedy. As it is the only concession he made to the role was a bit of reddish tint in his hair to suggest the man he was playing. It worked rather well and still works today.Ironically though had their been other U.S. Navy craft near the PT 109 when the Japanese battleship Amagiri sliced it like a loaf of bread in the middle of the night who could have picked up survivors Lieutenant j.g. John F. Kennedy probably would have been facing a court martial for losing his boat that way. It was the only PT boat in World War II lost to the Japanese in that manner.But the story is not about that as it was the survival of all but two of his crew who were killed in the collision. It's about Lieutenant Kennedy towing an injured man while swimming for a deserted Pacific island and keeping his men alive until they could be rescued. The Navy was not about to court martial a hero.Warner Brothers filled out the rest of the cast with some tried and true players some like Ty Hardin and Grant Williams from their television series which was rapidly taking over the Warner Brothers lot.

This story is very well done with minimal obvious Hollywood embellishments. No I've not read the underlying book of the same title but now I'd like to.In the big scheme of World War II the events depicted here would have been forgotten except that the central heroic figure John F. Kennedy would later become U.S. President. For those of us who lived through the Kennedy years this portrait of JFK in his 20's is quite consistent with the JFK we later saw when he became nationally prominent and subsequently president. If Private Ryan deserves a movie then JFK and his shipmates are surely no less entitled.The story begins when JFK arrives in the Pacific and is given command of a PT Patrol Torpedo boat. PT boats were fast wooden craft with a crew of 12 and carried four torpedos and some smallbore guns capable of quickly getting in and out while operating in shallow waters and doing various odd jobs on short notice. Without a lucky torpedo shot any one boat was not going to be noticed by history.PT 109 operated into an area of Pacific waters and small islands mainly controlled by the Japanese. One of Kennedy's first missions was to provide covering fire onto shore and extricate some stranded Americans. The boat remained under enemy fire until the rescue was complete notwithstanding casualties both to crew and those rescued.On PT 109's final mission during darkness and limited visibility radar was not yet on most PT boats a Japanese destroyer perhaps unwittingly slices through PT 109 half of which sinks while the other half capsizes but not before JFK and surviving crew members make an arduous swim to shore taking along their woundedand shoes. Aerial reconnaissance later sights the wreckage and reports no survivors.How the PT 109 crew is finally saved results partly from good luck and partly from daring ingenuity exhausting swims and a refusal to give up. Yes this is also a feelgood movie!The movie also acknowledges the part played and risks taken by coast watchers isolated individuals who infiltrated islands in Japanesecontrolled areas maintained lookouts from high ground and radioed back critical information on enemy movements.".

It compresses Kennedy's time on two PTs into one. PT109 juxtaposes some of the events but it gets the basic story correct. SPOILER His boat was rammed and sunk with the loss of two of his crewmen. Kennedy did tow an injured sailor to a nearby island and did with the help of coastwatchers and natives friendly to the allies' cause get his crew back.The support that the US Navy provided is evident and it is a tale that can be watched by the entire family.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it several times since. This a good movie but at 2 hours and 20 minutes it runs a little long. This could have been made more concise and more adventurous and should have come in at 90 minutes and it would have been a better movie. Director Leslie Martinson only made nine mostly forgettable films in his long directorial career that was mostly in television. This was his best film. He was a much sought after television director and directed some of the most popular television series from the early 50's through the mid 80's. This was the last film in the long career of producer Bryan Foy. Foy was a producer and director from the 1920's and began producing fulltime in the 1930's specializing in mainly Bmovies. A great cinematographer here in Robert Surtees who had photographed Ben Hur Oklahoma quo Vidas and would go on to photograph The Graduate The Summer of 42 The Last Picture Show and The Sting among his many films. A good editor on this film too in Folmar Blangsted who edited Rio Bravo and The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell and would go on to edit The Summer of 42 and ironically Camelot among his many films. This is the story of the naval career of future US President John F. Kennedy as a lieutenant in WWII. This is adapted from the best selling book PT 109 John F. Kennedy in WWII which was inspired by a 1944 article in the New Yorker magazine called Survival by John Hersey. The PT 109 story of the patrol boat in the South Pacific captained by Lt. John F. Kennedy that was cut in half in a collision with a Japanese destroyer was a big part of the Kennedy story. During his 1961 Inagural parade a full size replica float of the boat was featured in the parade route with all of the original crew members on the float as a surprise to the new president. He kept the coconut shell that he had written a message on encased in class in his Oval Office along with a model replica of a PT boat. Warren Beatty apparently was Kennedy's first choice to portray him in this film which would have made sense as when this was filmed in the summer of 1962 in the Florida Keys Beatty was 25 years old exactly the same age as Kennedy was in 1943 when the film's setting takes place. Beatty reportedly turned down the role and Kennedy's second choice was Cliff Robertson who at 36 years old when production was done on this film was a full 10 years older and quite a few pounds heavier than Kennedy was in 1943. Also in the cast are Robert Culp Norman Fell James Gregory Ty Hardin and Robert Blake. Look for future Star Trekker George Takei on the Japaneses destroyer. Character actor Andrew Duggan narrates. This film has more of a look and feel of a madefor television movie but it's definitely worth a watch. I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.".

Cliff Robertson smiles his way through his portrayal of a young JFK without even hinting at any negative attributes of the man. Still with all that said this is a decent enough movie. Very pleasant in its telling of what is essentially a factual tale. Plus it's a blast seeing all of those character actors who would later make their marks in television series Robert Blake Norman Fell Robert Culp George Gaynes and my favorite Barney Miller's James Gregory But at 2 hours 20 minutes this movie does begin to feel longer than Kennedy's tenure.".

When one sees and hears Coff speak one envisions a man who cares more than the law permits.It makes him a natural to play JFK.The rest of the cast is pretty much a semi star studded affair. Gregory who comes across as the Irish cop sort of Barney Miller is great in authority figure roles. Here he has an extra dimension. Hardin is one of the most underrated actors ever. He escapes the super handsome Bronco image to don his bearded thinker image only here he is a bearded jock.The story is riveting and holds your attention. It's a story of adventure but also of guts and of being comrades. It is a sense of helping other humans that has since been lost in Americans. There is no way I would believe an American today would sacrifice as much as JFK did to save human lives. Not from what I've seen. It is what made a greater generation.".

Basically if he said so it would happen. Throughout the film this prophesy prevailed which made you wonder was this retrospective propaganda or actual fact. This dilemma would not be of any consequence in a regular film but when it portrays a sitting President in 1963 a few warning flags should be waved. However now in 2005 following the multiple tragic lives of the Kennedy dynasty this self belief of being right no matter what the conditions if true as portrayed in the film might have proved a genetic flaw that his siblings should well have acknowledged.".

Others mentioned for the JFK role were Warren Beatty and a WB contract player Edd Byrnes who found fame as Kookie on 77 Sunset Strip. Byrnes has written a book about his life which is a good read Likely the reliable Mr. Robertson was more to the liking of the President than Warren Beatty or Edd Byrnes who would have been my choice. Byrnes would have made JFK what he really was A Randy Young Man! This is a good film modest and easy to watch. It is also noted for the appearances of Warner Bros stars Ty Hardin and Grant Williams and also Robert Culp Robert Blake et al who would find their mark as TV stars in the future. As has been noted Jack Warner who ran Warner Bros with an iron fist with great results deemed himself the Producer of this film likely to assuage any doubts of the Kennedy family of this film portraying JFK in anything but a positive light.

	schema:reviewBody "Oh JFK! If it was not for JFK's fathers' very deep pockets do you really think this film semi biography would ever have been made yet alone released widely? Add in top notch stars such as Cliff Robertson who plays Lt. JG John F. Kennedy responsible for PT109 Robert Culp who plays Ensign George 'Barney' Ross James Gregory as Commander C.R. Ritchie and for good measure add in Robert Blake as Gunner's Mate Charles 'Bucky' Harris and Norman Fell as Machinist Edmund Drewitch and you have an all star cast ready to set sail and fight those nasty Japanese in deep waters.The problem I had with this film was that the period war film was released 20 years after the incident but only mere months before the next primary U.S. elections were to take place in 1964 and the then U.S. President John F. Kennedy intended to run for reelection. No coincidence here? But my disdain runs further. After watching the film PT 109 we the audience would be left to believe that the entire PT 109 crew were willing to surrender time and time again to the Japanese rather than swim 3 miles to a remote island and wait for their eventual rescue. Oh yes everyone appeared to want to give up except the great JFK who led the way swimming the entire 3 miles in the ocean AND also towing another injured seaman on his own bad back even carrying him out of the water and to dry land before getting immediately back into the water to assist the rest of his crew before a Japanese boat would otherwise have captured them all. Such a war hero that JFK!That same night JFK swam out back into the middle of the ocean by himself in anticipation of spotting a U.S Naval rescue ship that did not materialize at least not that first night. This movie would have been more appropriately titled JFK a one man war hero. I will admit that JFK had some good qualities as the U.S. President as well as some bad qualities one of which he was a known womanizer who demanded sex from many vulnerable woman including Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe.The 1963 film PT 109 may have put JFK in a light that shone bright as a U.S. naval hero but the 4 million dollars spent on this film was all for naught as on November 22 1963 JFK was assassinated in Dallas Texas for reasons to this day still unknown. I am not a big fan of glory pictures that are released to shine a positive light by very wealthy people who have a specific agenda. In this case PT 109 was released to promote JFK as a tough naval war hero just in time for the next U.S. election for which he was running for reelection as the U.S. President backed by the very wealthy Boston based Kennedy family. I gave the film a 5 out of 10 rating.".

His closest aides are former TV cowboy heroes Ty Hardin Bronco 19581962 as Ensign Leonard Thom and Robert Culp Trackdown 19571959 as Ensign Barney Ross. Hardin was virtually unrecognizable under that beard and mustache I had to check the credits list to see where he fit in. Other cast surprises for this viewer included Grant Williams Robert Blake and Norman Fell.I recall having read the William Doyle book 'PT 109' ages ago and didn't remember the coconut part of the story seeing the scene in the movie makes it seem almost impossible that the crew of the sunken boat could have been saved in that manner. Also my impression of PT boats was that they were somewhat smaller than the way they were depicted in the movie so seeing them in action was informative.

	schema:reviewBody "Leslie H. Martinson served as a contract director for Warner Brothers during the first half of his career and he helmed virtually every Warner Brothers television shows like Cheyenne Sugarfoot Maverick Surfside 6 Bronco and Colt .45. Martinson replaced All Quiet on the Western Front director Lewis Milestone. According to one report Milestone objected to the screenplay but no details about his criticisms have ever aired. PT109 qualifies as much as a thrilling World War II adventure as it does a publicity stunt for JFK. Basically the facts are correct but Warner Brothers tampered with the timeline. When JFK rescued the Marines off the beach PT109 had been sunk and he was skipper of PT59. Clearly the filmmakers put the beach episode before the historic sinking of PT109 to avoid anticlimax. It's true that Kennedy sought to get into the fight and his father pulled strings to get him into the U.S. Navy even though Kennedy had a bad back. The scene aboard the ship at the beginning is correct. No PT109 isn't the best Hollywood movie about the torpedo boats in the South Pacific. That honor goes to John Ford's movie They Were Expendable. Nevertheless this is a very good World War II with Cliff Robertson delivering a robust performance as the future U.S. President. BenHur lenser Robert L. Surtees makes the scenery and the action look is spectacular. Musicians William Lava  David Buttolph delivered a memorable orchestral soundtrack that has never been released. The music is quite catchy. This largely straightforward seafaring saga is entertaining. The film has an authentic look and scenarist Richard Breen doesn't miss a chance to poke friendly fun at Kennedy. Robertson's speech about his character flaw is cool. Although the war took place in the South Pacific Warner Brothers lensed the picture in Key West. If you pay close attention there are no more than three PTboats on camera. Some of the scenes are classic. James Gregory is sympathetic curmudgeon. I saw this movie when it was shown at the theater on the Columbus Air Force Installation when I was in the fourth grade. Future television actors Robert Blake Norman Fell George Takei and Roger Davis have roles.".

We see how JFK Cliff Robertson was sort of unsure what to think of the war initially but knew what to do once he started fighting.So it's clearly a product of America's age of innocence. But still I recommend it just because it shows how Kennedy was actually someone whom we could trust in wartime.

	schema:reviewBody "This Warner Brothers production was personally supervised by Jack Warner. Legend has it that Warren Beatty was Jackie Kennedy's choice to play he husband in the film but Jack decided on Cliff Robertson? Warren Beatty in 1963 was best known for his role in Dobie Gillis on TV  would have been coming from a starring role in All Fall Down in 1962. He would have gone from playing a drifter to laying a young US President. Instead he would be in 1964's Lilith next. Beatty was really just getting going. Robertson in contrast was already an established star. As JFK was actually more of a conservative Democrat the established star would make more sense. This film runs a bit long at 2 hours  20 minutes but I think that has to do with the fact that JFK told them he wanted accuracy in this movie. Think that scared Warners into making it long in order to make a statement about it being accurate. It is not as far off as many times when Hollywood would take liberties with. Robert J Donovan who wrote the book really only has 1 other writing credit. I guess he made enough money on PT109 that he didn't write Cold War until 1998.This a a fairly good film as a young Robert Culp James Gregory Norman Fell  some other folks who would go on to more fame are in this one. I like the way it opens with a junior officer trying to get JFK to go stateside  open brothels with him. Ironically maybe JFK should have taken him up on that but why should he need to run brothels when legend has it he could have almost any woman he wanted for free.This tale states that JFK's back problems were caused when a Japanese Destroyer cut the 109 into 2 halves. The legend of that here is put too film along with some other major materials.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the bland performance of CLIFF ROBERTSON as JFK PT 109 manages to be a wellstaged WWII adventure photographed in handsome Technicolor with some very fine special effects that make all the battle scenes look very realistic.The best performance in the film is delivered by JAMES GREGORY as the hardnosed commander of the PT squadron with a cynical view of the young Kennedy who has had no wartime training until he arrives in the Pacific to put together a crew to work aboard a hastily repaired patrol boat.It's a story of courage and heroism that could have been told in ninety minutes to make the drama more taut. Instead the film is padded out to a twohours and twentyminutes length that makes it feel like another Mr. Roberts especially during the long first hour.All of the squadron members are well played by a cast that includes TY HARDIN GRANT WILLIAMS and ROBERT BLAKE as able seamen who form Kennedy's crew. Touches of wartime humor are present with amusing lines throughout. The skipper would mount a tank on a PT boat if he could find one says a loyal crewman at one point. And when Kennedy is reminded of how idealistic he is when confronting the most unfavorable situations he replies with a grin It must be a character flaw. The only real flaw with the film is its length which robs it of some much needed tension toward the middle. However as a film examining the earlier life of JFK's participation as a lieutenant in WWII it's satisfying enough as a realistic depiction of the events aboard PT 109.Summing up The basic story of Kennedy's efforts to bring his men back safely from a dangerous mission is effectively portrayed and manages to hold the interest despite being overlong. Worth seeing at least once.".

I read the other reviews people actually use the word 'exciting' to describe this utterly boring film and praise Cliff Robertson's wooden acting as 'superb'.Don't get me wrong I think JFK was a great president and the USA was grievously harmed by his assassination at such a critical time in our history. There hasn't been as good a president as he since then!But that's an aside and has nothing to do with the creation of this turkey. Several reviewers correctly pointed out that its WAY TOO LONG at 220 whereas this simple tale could easily be told in 130. The movie spends its entire first hour in meeting the characters who then spend their precious screen time refurbishing this battered old wreck of a boat. How is this in the slightest bit exciting? Nothing in the way of action happens until after an hour of this uninvolving segment has passed and by then the viewer has gone to sleep.Then there is Cliff Robertson as Kennedy. He spends the entire film with one expression that of a sappy everything is okay and I'm always amused smile planted on his face. I have seen the animatronic creations at the 1980's Epcot Center express more emotions than Mr. Robertson. Oh yes he does have pretty blue eyes too.It is interesting however to see some of the other yettobe wellknown actors of the day show their stuff along with various character actors we have seen in so many other films. I did enjoy Robert Culp a great deal much more so than Mr. Robertson. I knew George Takei was somewhere in this film but I never did pick him out though he might have been in deep shadow in the background of a 10second shot of the bridge of the Japanese destroyer. As for suspense there is none! It's obvious from the getgo that Mr. Kennedy survives this ordeal after all he was President when the film came out so he had to have survived. The director should have gone a little further to engineer some false sense of suspense because there is absolutely none otherwise. Nor are there any interesting camera angles to keep the viewer interested.... All are long shots of remote islands or extreme closeups of Mr. Robertson's blue eyes instead.Another disastrous part of this film is the score! For more than half of the film it consists entirely of bright cheery military style martial and marching music always turned up WAY TOO LOUDLY. The score seems to be the 'main character' much of the time and weighs heavily with its overbearing cheeriness. I haven't seen too many movies where the score fails to fade into the background like a good score should yet properly sets the tone and mood. This score does neither. This particular score sounds like it was written for McHale's Navy. I found it to be very very annoying.There is one incredibly laughable scene involving music. As a group of natives paddle their canoe with Mr. Kennedy hidden under grasses inside they ACTUALLY SING ALOUD A Christian RELIGIOUS HYMN to set their paddling rhythm. I have never seen anything more ridiculous than this absurd scene. Quite a bit of realism is entirely lacking mostly after the crash occurs. One crewman Buck while in the water repeatedly says his legs don't work and requires our hero JFK to rescue him. Yet a few hours later when they make landfall he's walking around like nothing ever happened. Another crewman has third degree burns over much of his arms and face according to the dialog but he stoically endures multiple ocean immersions and looks to be suffering nothing worse then a mild sunburn. Several reviewers commented on a spinal or back injury Mr. Kennedy allegedly received these comments are the first I knew of any such injury since Mr. Kennedy performs a 10hour swim never mentions a thing about his 'injury' and continues onward with his silly alliswell grin.The IMDb and other descriptions say that Mr. Kennedy kept his crew alive which is true enough but that he also found them food and shelter! Yet they lay or sat in the open on the beach or in the 'jungle' the entire time eating coconuts which any one of them could have easily found for themselves and did. Where is this alleged shelter? Yes Mr. Kennedy's upbeat morale did evidently go a long way towards saving his crew if the characterizations of the film can be believed.Other reviewers complained or at least pointed out discrepancies between the movie and the true facts that this scene or that were historically in a different order or occurred on different boats than were shown in the film. So what I say? This is obviously done to maintain a level of tension and drama and for basic storytelling purposes as at least one other reviewer points out. This movie is not meant as an historical documentary so these deviations have little bearing on the overall issues this reviewer has with the film the wooden acting overblown score total lack of excitement and unbelievability.Really I couldn't wait for this movie to end so I could get on with something more interesting. I would only recommend this for a mere glimmering of historical interest or for those of you who want to see just how badly a movie can turn out to be.".

As I have grown older and wiser developed an interest in naval and political history and served in the navy myself I have realised the films limitations. On one level it is an exciting war adventure. But it was intended as more than that. The film was intended as a hagiography.

As I have grown older and wiser developed an interest in naval and political history and served in the navy myself I have realised the films limitations. On one level it is an exciting war adventure. But it was intended as more than that. The film was intended as a hagiography.

	schema:reviewBody "In gongfu movie lore it has long been foretold that one day two of the greatest stars of the genre would come together one day on the screen. That day has come in The Forbidden Kingdom which stars two of the latest and greatest stars of the martial arts movie genre  Jackie Chan and Jet Li.Combined both men's careers span over 30 years and over 100 movies in their native China and here in the United States that's a lot of kungpow kicking and punching. They both decided to make their American crossovers around the same time during the 1990s  Chan's first hit in the U.S. was Rumble in the Bronx 1995 and became a megastar due to the Rush Hour movies while Li made his American debut as the lead villain in Lethal Weapon 4 1998 received his first Englishspeaking starring role in Romeo Must Die 2000 and earned critical respectability with Unleashed in 2005.Now we're at The Forbidden Kingdom. I like both stars. My friends and I like many other martial arts movie fans have eagerly awaited this cinematic pairing for some time.Starting in the present  2008  an American teenager named Jason Michael Angarano who has an obsession with gongfu movies is magically transported back in time to ancient China by the longlost staff of the fabled Monkey King Li in one of two roles in the film where he learns he has been chosen to return it to him. 500 years earlier the mischievous martial arts master Monkey King had been imprisoned in stone by the Jade Warlord Collin Chou.On his journey Jason comes across the drunken beggar Lu Yan Chan in one of two roles in the film who teaches him gongfu so that he will be able to take on the Jade Army. They are also aided by The Silent Monk Li in his other role and the orphan assassin Sparrow Yifei Liu. There is one particularly funny sequence where Lu Yan and The Silent Monk fight over how to train Jason to defend himself  with Lu Yan's unorthodox methods and the Monk's more traditional approach.The Forbidden Kingdom is one fastpaced and entertaining martial arts flick that keeps you watching just because of the knowitallseenitall before charisma of the star talent. With nods aplenty toward the martial arts movies of yesteryear chiefly oldschool Shaw Brothers movies as well as plenty of helpings of Taoist philosophy and the Jeet Kune Do teachings of Bruce Lee The Forbidden Kingdom is perhaps what Quentin Tarantino has fantasized about so much during countless cinema grindhouse outings as an impressionable teenager and later as an adult realized on the screen in his Kill Bill films.But Tarantino is nowhere in sight. Behind this production is American screenwriter John Fusco who based the script on the epic story Journey to the West which is cited as one of the four great novels of Chinese literature and American director Rob Minkoff of The Lion King. This production put simply is probably the best combination of AmericanChinese talent since Enter the Dragon way back in 1973. Choreographing the fights with plenty of wirework and CGI pizazz is Wooping Yuen known for his work with both Chan and Li as well as The Matrix 1999 and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2000. It's pretty impressive that although it's fairly obvious that wires are being used in the fight scenes it doesn't really take away from the action like it often tends to in American features but actually enhances their intensity here.I got a lot of enjoyment from watching The Forbidden Kingdom and watching the magnificent grace of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Despite occasional script deficiencies I found this picture working from the opening credits which was a sure sign that what was about to come would surely satisfy the martial arts movie fan inside of me. For many martial arts movie fans The Forbidden Kingdom may perhaps be the movie they've been waiting for since the untimely passing of Bruce Lee 35 years ago.1010".

It is a great graphical movie with fantastic choreography and editing and an acting masterpiece as well as action packed. If you go into the movie theater and take the negative comments with you you will not like it. You need to understand that this is a rare appearance by two masters who will probably never get together again. As for the English don't fret on that. I have a lot of trouble with these kinds of movies. This was the ONLY one where I could understand the English. It's simple. Go to the movie with popcorn and soda in hand and an open mind.

The cinematography is wonderful with stunning views excellent use of CGI without overdoing it and decent acting. Jet Li plays his role marvelously and the continuity of the various plot themes is fantastic. There are subtleties to this movie that will require multiple viewings to catch! Pros include the acting and scenery and the way language is dealt with. The only con is that the viewing I attended was a bit rough around the edges with a couple of minor bobbles in editing and film quality. I'm sure this will be corrected in the final production for the theaters though! Overall this is a good actionfantasy movie. For those who like the chop suey kung fu flicks this will be a blast from the past. Jackie Chan shows off his unique style of martial arts while keeping the laughs rolling. Jet Li is NOT playing the 'baddie' for a change and has a surprisingly entertaining role in this film. There isn't a lot of wire work in this film and what is done on wires is done judiciously.A mustsee film for this summer!".

The cultural conflict from thrusting a boy from Boston into ancient China reflects the conflict between his kungfu masters. His personal growth helps carry the heroes journey through China.

The movie is all about the Chinese epic tale Journey to the West About Sun Wu Kong or better known as Stone Monkey it's one of my favorite Chinese stories.It started out slow and it had me all confused when the main character was an American boy but it turns out that they had their own version of the tale. The boy strangely gets ported back inside the story where he meets the characters whose roles are played by Jet Li and Jackie Chan and they set out in a quest to return a staff owned by the stone monkey who was prophesied to end the tyranny of the Jade warlord an evil general who is the villain in the movie.The action scenes were really good superb even. Jackie chan and Jet Li still had their kungfu in them and it was fun and amusing to watch.The Acting was good especially by Jackie chan and Jet Li. I liked Jet Li's role as stone monkey especially because he really looked like a monkey The storyline though was quite predictable because Jackie chan movies always end in happy endings. but as I always say What you say is just as important as how you say it. Same goes with a movie though the storyline is predictable how the story went and how it was flavored with humor and drama and action made the movie much much better and so worthwhile and entertaining to watch.".

	schema:headline " The Forbidden Kingdom  Great mix of action comedy and a coming of age story.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Forbidden Kingdom starts in a way that is similar to The Karate Kid with Jason Michael Angarano the boy new to his local high school who loves kung fu movies but is helpless to defend himself against the neighborhood bullies. These same bullies force him to help them into a pawn shop whose owner is shot but still passes on a mysterious staff to Jason. The staff turns out to be that of the legendary Monkey King and Jason is transported into ancient China where he journeys to use the staff to free the imprisoned Monkey King. In the end Jason must prove himself as he faces both fantastical and real life foes.Once in China Jason acquires several companions Lu Yan Jackie Chan a wine drinking kung fu master Golden Sparrow Yifei Liu a vengeance driven young women and later a monk Jet Li who protect him and later train him in the art of kung fu. Together they journey to Five Elements Mountain to attempt to free the Monkey King and end the reign of the evil Jade Warlord Collin Chou who sends innumerable troops to stop them.This movie works on many levels none too deep but very satisfying none the less. First of all it is a great action movie with very well done kung fu action scenes involving Jackie Chan and Jet Li two of the greatest kung fu movie stars in the past couple of decades. In the midst of all of this is a great deal of fairly well done comedy sometimes not perfectly executed but generally fun especially during the kung fu training of Jason. Last but not least this is a classic coming of age story in which Jason journeys from being a boy who fantasizes of adventure to a young man who can fight and suffer for what is right.This is a fantasy based movie so expect some magical displays and references to immortal beings but this is not too heavily done so the story is fairly easy to follow. Refreshingly the movie has relatively little in the way of moral ambiguity with villains that are really evil and those who oppose them being flawed humans but still striving to that which is right.In regards to the appropriateness of the movie for varied audiences the violence in this PG13 rated movie is never graphic though possibly disturbing for young children. There is no sexual content with the exception of an implied impending assault by the Jade Warlord we see nothing actually happening here. I saw the movie in a prescreening with mostly college students whose applause and laughs made it clear they enjoyed it but I am quite a bit past college and found it just as enjoyable.One last comment while virtually all of the dialogue between main characters is in English there is a fair amount of Mandarin Chinese being spoken during the movie. In the few instances when knowing the content of this is important there are English subtitles and I did not find the untranslated portions to be an issue.Overall this is a movie that is exciting fun and generally very satisfying to watch.".

I saw the movie in a prescreening with mostly college students whose applause and laughs made it clear they enjoyed it but I am quite a bit past college and found it just as enjoyable.One last comment while virtually all of the dialogue between main characters is in English there is a fair amount of Mandarin Chinese being spoken during the movie. In the few instances when knowing the content of this is important there are English subtitles and I did not find the untranslated portions to be an issue.Overall this is a movie that is exciting fun and generally very satisfying to watch.";

First of all why do we even bother with the scenes in America. Or better yet why does the teenage boy even exist? I feel like this would have been much more successful had it been taken seriously by the American filmmakers who created it. The kid quite frankly cannot act be funny punch or kick...so...why not delete him entirely. Set the film in China or wherever it was supposed to take place. Have Jackie in possession of the staff. Have Jet Li be the Monkey King...except he should probably take on a more sinister role rather than a hoppity little man. And let it roll from there. Wow I should be a director. Cause if I were given two huge stars like Jet and Jackie I would not have made a complete mess of this amazing opportunity. By all means though see it if you want to see aesthetically pleasing fight scenes. This is of course why we go to see these movies. I was just befuddled when the opening scene of Jet Li fighting on the mountain tops quickly switched to some nobody American teen actor who had no right to ruin a perfectly good film.

Although the story reminiscent to early 80's adventure films about an unlikely hero who overcomes great adversity was overly predictable the end result was a visually beautiful and engaging journey through feudal China riddled with the culture's interesting mythology. Jackie Chan and Jet Li as always delivered an action packed performance of balletlike battles that have become popular due to movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Unfortunately this made the fights lack the essence of suspense. They were entertaining yes  but there were no moments of trepidation or concern for what will happen to the characters. At the same time the soft and poetic fight scenes rarely made you feel any intensity in the punches or kicks that were often being thrown. For a PG13 film however there was enough mild violence blood and death that the storyline wasn't overly sugarcoated.The films fast pace only briefly slowing down near the middle as well as the accentuating music breathtaking visuals and a simple but effective storyline was able to create a fun filled adventure film that younger and older audiences can both enjoy. In the end however because the movie lacked wellformed character relationships and any empathy for our group of heroes the adventure film will beg us to wonder if this was the best that Chan and Li could fester up.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're not a 13 yearold boy Forbidden Kingdom was not really made for you. I understand the appeal of Jet Li and Jackie Chan together at last and everyone's hopes for a harmonious combination like peanut butter and chocolate. I shared this hope but was served something more like canned cheese with crackers. It's not that this combination is bad just that their pairing is framed within a feeble pointlessly enthusiastic action film.Forbidden Kingdom follows the story of Jason Michael Angarano a diehard kungfu fan and his concussioninduced journey back in time to a mythical China. Jason must return a golden staff to the Monkey King Jet Li who is imprisoned in stone under the evil gaze of the immortal Jade Warlord Collin Chou. Jason meets a silent monk Jet Li drunken master Lu Yan Jackie Chan and musical assassin Golden Sparrow Yifei Liu who all have a vested interest in the Monkey King or the demise of the Jade Warlord. They accompany Jason on his quest and give him the skills he needs to repel his foes.The characters are interesting but completely shallow. We're introduced to them as stock. There's an assumed level of familiarity with martial arts movies which they're directly inspired by but little more is given than this stereotype. Lu Yan and the Silent Monk profess death threats engage in playful antics and display some unknown kinship sometimes all within the same scene. We like Golden Sparrow because she's beautiful and she's the same age as our protagonist. Beyond an obvious romantic setup a briefly uttered revenge quest and a catfight she's completely pointless. It's interesting that Li and Chan both play secondary characters in this movie and in roles that are not their traditional typecast fare. Jackie Chan is terribly sympathetic but by his own undeniable Jackie Chan charm not on any strength of the movie.My biggest problem with this movie lies in Jason's story. He's sent to mythical China with more stereotypes than skills and through truly excessive use of montage becomes a warrior who can help the Monkey King. I suspend disbelief for fantasy films but the montages are as repetitive and annoying as the whiny Jason. Since we're so interested in Jet Li and Jackie Chan why make them secondary characters and give the focus to a comingofage quest? My rhetorical question is answered for you in the first sentence of the review. But I think this also skirts the issue of trying to give equal screen time and top billing to the two biggest martial arts stars of our age.As repugnant as the writing and editing may be Forbidden Kingdom makes up for this in a good dose of fight scenes. This has some of the best storytoaction ratios of any martial arts movie hearkening back to the heyday of kung fu where the story is minimized to make room for more action. Nothing wrong with that! It's still entertaining as always to watch Chan and Li fight. There is one very long sparring sequence and while it's nothing terribly flashy you do get a sense that the two are very well matched. Some of the editing is sketchy relying heavily on reaction shots rather than allowing us to see maneuvers connect. Some of the fighting is extremely theatrical and extended in true wushu style and beautiful to see.The visuals have that nearly animated quality with emphasis on glow and gold that we've seen so often in fantasy movies lately. Combined with the cutout characters it gives the impression that you're watching more of a video game than a movie. I like video games but this is not necessarily a boon. I'd like to see something more original or maybe something that draws more heavily on Chinese cinema since the movie already borrows so liberally from those films.Forbidden Kingdom has all of the good components of a classic action film but together these elements work against each other in a big way. The narrative is short but not short enough. The general tone is more like a poor comic book movie than a kung fu fantasy. This may appeal to some but dressing up in silks doesn't make this tired thing new again.".

I think a lot of people will go against the idea of having an Aisan lead to play Shakespeare's Hemlet and whatnot. Additionally a kung fu maniac never take his time to learn any martial arts is just not believable in the first place. I'm sure the ending of The Forbidden Kingdom insults some Chinese religious believers. In the last scene where Jason Tripitikas walks up the stairs to return his home it is suggesting Jason's Character trancends among the Chinese God. Is Hollywood trying to imply that even Chinese God have to look up to the Westerners? This film is an insult to the Chinese literature and Chinese religion.

You can't beat the last boss! our young fellow is told by his mates. No worries! That's nothing a twoday intensive training won't fix. Rocky  Eye of the Tiger soundtrack8  Our newly leveled up hero then storms the to the final castle. Strangely he doesn't have to fight anyone but simply rides his horse past guards and meets with the big boss. So much for that 2 day training you may think9  The last fight scene is more or less a big moshpit of kung fu for 10 mins. Bad guys dies no twist everyone is kinda happy.Final Scene  Our hero returns to the present and it turns out the old shopkeep isn't really dead. THE END.Now I did leave out a couple of details but that is essentially the movie in a big nutshell. I'm giving it a 2 and not 1 because it has given me such inspiration to write this review. Anyways next time you're in Boston please be careful in Chinatown you might fall victim of spontaneous time traveling...".

I had only been let down once this horribly from the overall rating before on IMDb and that was with Across the Universe when it got a review of 4 out of 10 when I thought it was a work of art. The Forbidden Kingdom has a terrible story with awful dialogue. Poor visuals Keep an eye out for the background while they are sitting in the cave. Poor acting horrible character development lack luster computer graphics and etc. The main character only knows English but ironically so does everyone he befriends in the Forbidden Kingdom... Those are just a few examples why I disliked this movie. On the bright side the kung fu was very well done and that is the strong point of the movie. I'm boggled at all the positive reviews and ratings this movie has received on IMDb. So the lesson learned is don't believe what you read on IMDb. So disregard this rant and go see it for yourself and be prepared to be disappointed.".

Wooping has worked extensively with Jackie and in this movie has formed a solid relationship with Jet.Li BingBing and Liu Yifei are two young actresses of surpassing beauty. This is only Liu's third movie but she has really come into her own with a very convincing presence and acting ability. She is strongly reminiscent of Zhang Ziyi when she exploded on the scene some 8 years earlier. Li is better known at least in China where she is an established star. Here she is cast against type as an evil villain and she seems totally at home in this role which she carries off with style.Michael Angarano seems to be confined by his role as written which is stereotyped and not too interesting or endearing. Unquestionably he is capable of a fine performance as he shows in Black Irish. Here we see only brief glimpses of his talent. It is too bad and the failure to bring out his potential is the greatest disappointment of The Forbidden Kingdom.Nonetheless this film deserves a high rating primarily on the strength of Jet and Jackie but also the wonderful new Liu. It was worth the long long wait to see Jet and Jackie fighting.".

Those familiar to the story can easily tell that this movie is loosely based on the popular Chinese fairytalemythstory 'Journey to the West' which is one of the most famous and mostbeloved among Chinese literature. However this movie made a mockery and insult of it by totally disregarding important elements of the story and blatantly adding other nonerelevant Chinese elements making the whole movie an absolute farce. In short it is akin to a messy collage made up of tornup pages of several Chinese literature novels and films of old Chinese Kungfu flicks which is thrown into a mixture with a white Chinese Kungfu fanatic teenager's dream to be made into an awfully horrendously tasting cocktail. Yes the movie maybe catered to Western audience who do not posses adequate knowledge regarding simple Chinese literature or culture but the way they made a mockery of it is simply nauseating and unacceptable to those with a slight understanding of it. But still expect the movie to do well in this part of the world because of the producers brilliant plan to rope in 2 of the biggest Chinese stars to star in it for the first time in movie history  which sadly makes the fact that this movie sucked even more appalling. The cinematography comes across as very 'unChinese' even thought it is shot in China. One scene even look like they were straight out from a 'Lord of the Rings' movie. The plot dialog and characters were poorly written although there were a couple of funny moments here and there.Overall if you enjoy mindless 3in1actionfantasycomedy movies are a huge Jet Li or Jackie Chan movie who watches any of their movies no matter how bad they are andor have no clue regarding the basics of Chinese fairy tales literature and films by no means indulge yourself. However if you really love old Chinese Kungfu flicks have been reading Chinese novels throughout your teenage life or are just looking for an intelligent thoughtprovoking movie stay away from it as far as possible.".

Normally I would be willing to disregard any minor idiosyncrasies in a film like this and just kick back and enjoy the asskickery however this particular film is an insult to any moderately educated brain.Point 1 there is a lack of backstory for absolutely every character which leaves you caring even less than you thought possible about the pencil neck geek who was horribly miscast as the lead.Point 2 while at first there is a laughable attempt at comedy no pun intended as the nancy choir boy of a lead fails to communicate with the Chinese speaking villagers things inexplicably become convenient for all as everyone from Jackie Chan to the endless useless henchmen happens to be a fluent scholar of the English language.Point 3 now I knew before seeing this movie that the noodlearmed white guy was going to have a kung fu training montage yet I was still disgusted when I saw it for it featured a truly shameful CG stick twirling episode which would've been completely beyond the ability of anyone after a day or two of training even from JC or Jet Li.Point 4 the lead has a ponytail and I don't care what anyone says that brings your badass meter way down.Point 5 Why is the director relying on the acting prowess of Jackie Chan to deliver deep philosophical and apparently meaningful one liners amidst a movie that features monkey men that can fly and shoot lasers?Point 6 It's evident that the Jade Warlord had some personal issues but how the crap does he find an entire army of equally spiteful jerks who have no issues butchering innocent people?Point 7 That girl who can hit a moving target with a bow from 900 yards away had inconsistent hair length perhaps this was a goof made by the editing department. Unless of course her hair was magical I could accept that.Point 8 When the film finally returns to the Boston setting it's no longer fantasy rules! no matter how good of a teacher he had that twig of a lead would've been snapped by those 5 ruffians simply because he weighs a buck 10 tops and 3 days of kung fu training can only do so much.Finally point 9 the way this film should've ended is this... when the white kid proves he's got some skills and the bullies have run off in terror he is seen standing there flexing like a real tough customer. Instead of making things completely strange by having that girl reappear in the present day simplify things and give us action lovers what we all crave and A have the bullies come back with chains and pipes and beat the kid senseless or B the kid should've just exploded without reason and the word FIN should've been shown in white text on a black background but now i'm just splitting hairs...".

	schema:headline " Why Jet Li and Jackey Chan never get to do a good movie in Hollywood";
	schema:reviewBody "I am Chinese and I have full understanding of the back story of the Monkey King mythology but this film just a waste of time. The back story of the Chinese mythology really exacerbates the complexity and the needs of exposition scenes. This film is so bad that even putting Jet Li and Jackey Chan together is not sufficient to overcome the weakness.The entire cast other than Jet and Jackie is TERRIBLE! In a nutshell the casting directors should never cast another film again! Especially Michael Angarano his acting sucks and he can't fight. If the kid can't act pls get someone who has better martial art background. I am sure there are plenty out there. I understand that the character is not suppose to be a fighter but he has his Kung Fu training throughout the journey and a slight character change he should have develop some good fighting skills. Kenau Reeves also has no Kung Fu background but he can pull it off in Matrix.There is no character change for Jason Tripitikas maybe a weak selfrevelation toward the end where he tries to face the Jade Warlord alone. If a kid is a kung fu maniac he would have attend Martial Art classes in local town or even mimic some moves from the films he watches. The main character has no drive at all. He is being very responsive by having other characters to tell him to carry the staff to the Monkey King. This reminds me of Frodo carrying the Ring to Mount Doom but of course a bad version of it. The worse of all the story tried to pull small romantic scenes between Jason and Golden Sparrow.I am proficient in both Mandarin and English but I cannot stand the mixture of Mandarin and English in this film. It doesn't make any sense when some characters know how to speak English and some don't and that includes minor characters. Why on earth would they want to force a white kid as the lead into an Asia mythology? From an Asian POV it is as funny as watching King Authur or any Old West movies with Asian leads. Obviously if they have casted an Asian kid for this role the entire film could've been in Mandarin. Racial stereotype is really a bottleneck for Hollywood movies in an attempt to pull Asian theme. Everything is Americanized. Take Shutter for example they have to force the white couple into Japanese environment in order to remake the Japanese horror film.I may have high hopes on the fight scenes. I was looking for something new and different when the two greatest action movie stars clash in the same screen. The fight scenes came out to be nothing new at all pretty much the same from old action movies. The scene is just not memorable. I think Yuen Wu Ping did a much better job in Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The fight sequence is more memorable and more stylish. I guess this is part of the director's job as well and Rob Minkoff is just not up to par for Kung Fu adventure films. He should have stick with Disney Little Mermaid or Underdog type of films.In a nutshell the cast is terrible bilingual characters are not credible hero's needs are weak and character is too responsive nothing new or special about the Jet and Jackie's fight. This film wasted the opportunity of converging the best action stars in a single film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now here is a critic who disagrees with thoses critics quite lazily saying that if you enjoy martial arts flick you will in fact enjoy this shameless wannabe. The iconic pairing of master kung fu actor Jet Li and mediocre Kung Fu Master Jackie Chan may just go down in history as one of the biggest letdowns of the century. The Forbidden City is a loud dumb American fight movie and does not deserve the title of a martial arts flick. With clumsy fight sequences little to no subtlety this puts to shame classics such as The Bride with Wight hair Hero or my personal favourite Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.It's the unnatural amount of cheese sprinkled on top of what could have quite easily have been a beautiful movie that makes this so unbearable. Also following along the same path as 300 and 10 00 BC The Forbidden Kingdom manages to be beautiful to look at but after 20 minutes it seems to be inconsistently dull and uninteresting. Never before has a so called iconic pairing been so bad. In fact the only thing The Forbidden Kingdom manages to get right is make films such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers look so much better than they once did. And whilst most critics may stick with their prediction of diehards loving it I can see anybody else apart from 13 year old boys enjoying this.Witch considering its potential the sunning scenery and the two fine leads is a real shame. Though not That I really care considering I still have the masterful Bride with White Hair to fall back on. For this think Dead or Alive mixed with the Karate Kid. Only worse.Legendary martial arts stars Jackie Chan and Jet Li come together on screen for the first time ever in director Rob Minkoff's timetravelling take on the Monkey King fable that finds an American teen transported back to ancient China after wandering into a pawn shop and discovering the king's fighting stick. Once there the adventurous teen joins an army of fierce warriors who have sworn to free their imprisoned king at all costs. In addition to appearing as the mythical Monkey King Li assumes the role of a silent monk and Chan appears in the role of kung fu master Lu Yan. Famed action choreographer Yuen Woo Ping presides over the fight sequences.Opening with its overblown dull premise. The Forbidden Kingdom begins with a slight snigger to Jet Li's career he seems confident in almost taking the p!ss out of his own creations. But out of these two hero's its seems strangely that Jackie Chan shines considerably more you feel for his character. He seems human and tender. With Jet Li he's just an ass. A wasted talent if you ask me.VERDICT An American filmmaker a Chinese story in ruins. The Forbidden kingdom may gleam with special effect but the films heart and soul are almost invisible. Throw in some Shia LaBeouf wanabee only without LaBeouf charm and charisma and you've got a film that only appeals to thirteen year old boys. Clumsy ugly fight sequences make The Forbidden Kingdom a film that really should have been forbidden on release.".

Anyway comparisons to Schindler's List and other movies are inevitable.But I was so intrigued by Solomon Perel's story that I checked the book Europa Europa out of the library and read it for myself. Now having read the book I watched the movie again and I can tell you that many facts and details of Solly's life were changed to make the movie more dramatic and concise. Europa Europa the movie was not in anyway described as a documentary so you can take the dramatic moments with a grain of salt. They rewrote most of it in the process of making the movie. I don't know if these alterations were done with Perel's knowledge or permission. But he is shown at the end of the film so he must have known that the movie was being made. All I can say is the real truth is even more amazing than the fiction. Read the book for yourself and see what I mean!".

	schema:reviewBody "Europa Europa by Agnieszka Holland is a very interesting film. It addresses how far people would go to stay alive. Caught in the hostile warfare a Jewish boy Solomon Perel realizes that the only way he can survive is by pretending to be one of the Nazis. I was very surprised when I found out that this was a true story. For someone to go through such an horrible experience for so many years and stay normal its just something I found very fascinating. This movie made me realize that one can never say I would never do this or that. When you are put in a situation where the only two options you have are survival or death there is no doubt that most of us would do anything to survive. Even that what Solomon did himself. As I watched this film I thought about the war I have experienced. There were so many people that would have done anything to survive. Actually there were many instances where people surrendered and joined the other side just to stay alive or save their family. I know of a girl that got married with a guy her enemy basically just to stay alive. What sets this movie apart is that this a true story and the person that is depicted in this film is still alive. Great movie. Must See.".

	schema:headline " The best Holocaust feature film I have seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "I reckon 'Europa Europa' to be the best Holocaust feature film ever produced. I have been using this film for many years to teach the Holocaust to British 14yearolds. They identify with the central character of Saloman Perel a GermanJewish boy who survives the Holocaust by hiding his identity in ever more difficult circumstances. The film moves at a cracking pace and the music adds to the dramatic tension. A lot of difficult history is made accessible in a very entertaining and often comical way  Nazi and Communist indoctrination of the young Jews and homosexuals as outsiders in the new Reich the NaziSoviet Pact and the events of the Second World War. We have a great sense of the individual being swept along by the most destructive tide that history has yet unleashed.The comic relief is a stark contrast to 'Schindler's List' a copy of which was donated by Spielberg to every British high school.The film is too long slow and dark to appeal to the age group in question and I have not used it since coming across 'Europa Europa'.Julie Delpy plays the female romantic lead as the delectable Leni attractive but flawed a perfect tribute to Nazi teaching methods. On the other hand there is a sympathetic portrayal of Germans who were not Nazis and who were just as much victims as the Jews. The film explores the human complexities which result when an ideology is allowed to mediate personal and social interaction. There is a lot going on in this film at many levels but none of it detracts from the entertainment value.Marco Hofschneider portrays Perel as a vulnerable but resourceful human being a boy who desperately wishes to be normal in abnormal times. The adolescent quest for selfidentity and selfassertion is not an easy option for a Jew on the run. This 'enforced selfdenial' theme is successfully maintained throughout the film by its autobiographical format. The schizophrenic implications of being both German and Jewish during the Nazi period are well illustrated.This film has held the attention of hundreds of 14 yearolds without exception. Although not aimed specifically at this agegroup it strikes a particular chord with adolescents who can identify with the main character. It is a major contribution to making the Holocaust both accessible and entertaining. There should be no conflict of interest here. Just as the recent film 'Downfall' successfully 'humanises' Hitler by displaying the personal charm which he exercised over so many people so 'Europa Europa' humanises the Holocaust by its concentration on the survival of one human being. This is its chief strength. I have never tired of watching this film.'The Pianist' is also concerned with the survival of the individual but is a more 'static' and slightly less entertaining film. Its pace is much slower. 'Escape from Sobibor' is an excellent portrayal of how several hundred slave labourers escaped from this death camp and gives a vivid and unrelenting account of the camp system. It provides balance to the notion of Jews as passive victims. Not to be missed. The American TV series 'Holocaust' is good but long. It successfully turned the Holocaust into a soap opera lasting many hours. To my knowledge it and the 2002 film 'Amen.'contain the only reenactments of how ZyklonB crystals were tipped into the 'showerroom'. 'Holocaust' also shows gas chamber procedures.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a pretty interesting true story about a young man who escaped Jewish persecution by pretending to be a Russian and then being a German. Neither the Germans nor Russians looked too good in here which is understandable since it was the period of the Nazis and the Communists respectively. The film makes no bones pointing out how the Nazis were bent on exterminating all Jews in Europe while the Russians were shown in all their antiGod propaganda. Another issue in this movie was circumcision and no need to explain that.It was also interesting to see Julie Delpy as a 16yearold. She didn't have the mature beauty she had as a fullgrown woman in her 20s but she still was a looker. Marco Hofschneider was very good in the lead as the boyishlooking Solomon Peters aka a bunch of alias.Overall I found it a good movie one worth watching for sure but questionable about adding to my fairlylarge collection of films. However now that it's out on DVD perhaps I'll reconsider.".

The general consensus was that the film was a missed opportunity to tell a fascinating story  Solomon Perel's life is a very interesting one but ludicrous events have been added to the script which at times made the film laughable. To add to the problems of the script the acting is wooden at best Marco Hofschneider seems incapable of expressing emotion and with one or two exceptions the rest of the cast are as bad. One of the group watching is a youngish German girl who informed us that none of the actors involved in the film are in the first rank of German cinema which with hindsight seems obvious. To me the film appeared to have been made on the cheap with too many short cuts and mistakes for example he fires a machine gun at a barn and it bursts into flames  that simply would not happen. And the events added  his brother saving his life at the end for example  are not just not credible but are so obviously added to the script for effect that they invalidate the real incidents in the film. As for the Nazis none appears menacing indeed many appear to be buffoons which doubtless many were but not in a jokey way.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I don't know the story of Sally Perel but even after watching the movie I don't know much more than that he was in the Hitler Youth.This was my 2nd attempt to watch the movie. The first time I turned the movie off in the middle cause it was so unrealistic and boring. Now I forced myself to watch it again because I studied about the Hitler Youth hoping I can get some impressions of it. Pretty disappointed now.How did Sally Perel survive the Holocaust? I really don't know how it happened but it certainly did not take place like in the movie. Someone decided to try to make the story more interesting with adding stories to the plot which are just ridiculous. Instead the producers should have spent effort to make this movie more authentic and alive and some good actors wouldn't hurt too. It was awful! The movie is so awfully flat that I did not feel anything for the main character. It advances very very quickly and it's incredible underdeveloped. I don't remember any scene in which there was any excitement at all. Everything just happens so fast and sticky situations are solved much too easily.I am convinced that the story of Sally Perel is interesting but Hitlerjunge Salomon unfortunately did an ridiculous awful job telling it.I gotta tell I have seen many WW2 movies but this was by far the worst. How someone can produce a totally emotion free WW2 movie plus add absolute absurd side stories is beyond my imagination. Just watching this movie made me feel stupid.Some examples for the ridiculous story line  Salomon who just escaped from a Russian orphanage and many others were captured by the SS. Some SS guys force some guy to pull down the pants to check if he has a circumcision. Then they start talking to Salomon who does not have a passport but Salomon says that he is German and was forced to visit a communist orphanage. The SS guys are not sceptic at all don't want to take a look at his penis not that this would be expected usually but after treating another guy so roughly just seconds before it sounds like utter bs instead they are like bff from the first second. in the same scene Salomon tells the SS of some Russian soldier who is the son of Stalin. Wow okay Stalin had a son and he was captured but why did they pack it here? That would be a massive coincidence if he truly got captured just next to Salomon. Besides that it's bullshit I find it also pretty hard to give Salomon such a negative characteristic. Sneaky sneaky jew! Salomon shoots at a big barn with a machine gun and what happens? The barn instantly bursts in flames. After like 3 seconds the whole roof is already burning. It's bad enough when cars explode all the time in action movies but this is just ridiculous.Salomon tries to hide his circumcision and thus avoids getting naked at any price. Well pretty illogical that he then later has sex with that convinced nazi woman in the train. Also the acting in this scene.. facepalm Gotta read the book .. this movie is just utter garbage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Europa Europa AKA Hitlerjunge Salomon i.e. Hitler Youth Salomon is a very interesting movie. The film should not be confused with the 1991 Lars von Trier film Europa which was initially released as Zentropa in the United States to avoid such a confusion. If you do find yourself as a viewer be glad that you don't live in a world like this anymore. Directed by Agnieszka Holland the movie is loosely based on the 1989 autobiography of Solomon Perel. He's play in the film by Marco Hofschneider. Solomon Perel is a German Jewish boy who is trying to escape the Holocaust by masquerading not only as a nonJew but as an elite Aryan German in Nazi Germany's Poland and a 'communist' student in Soviet Union's Poland. Without spoiling too much there is a lot of disturbing things in this film that might make this movie hard to watch. This film does indeed take massive liberties on this remarkable man's life and who probably is a man of great integrity. I didn't like how much Solomon in the film has such negative characteristic throughout the film. Unfortunately this film biopic loses its own integrity by using far too much artistic license. The symbolism in this movie are really interesting. The title Europa Europa stands for the duo of Europe's political beliefs at the time and trying to fit in. Olivier Olivier Holland's next film deals with a similar plot. For the most part in this film Solomon's circumcised penis functions as the film's chief dramatic device in which the plot is driven. Since he was circumcised at a young age Solomon is going through a degrees of anxiety that is common with young men feeling of loss of control over one's life. It is the one thing he can't change about himself. No matter how hard he tries to change his identity his circumcision is the one thing that can expose Jupp as a Jew. For example a romance with a German girl Leni Julie Delpy who wants to conceive a child for the Fuhrer proves dismal because he can't consummate the relationship due to that fact. You see him break down due to this. This adaptability is conveyed effectively by Marco Hofschneider in a strong example of a great performance from him. Still I felt the true psychological depths of the character were nearly unexplored. Nudity plays a big part of this movie as he always cannot let anyone see him bathing. You would think you wouldn't see nude as much due to this reason but the movie has way too many nude scenes with him. While the graphic nudity didn't hurt the movie too much. It was indeed distracting as there were tons of scenes that he didn't need to nude in. None of them were use as sex appeal but one scene was bit disturbing. Due warning Solek has a scene where string and rubber bands in various painful ways to simulate a foreskin. It's really hard to watch. The violence was also bit graphic but it really show you how brutal it was to live at that time. Add to it was the graphic stock footage of the war. The stock footage was bit overused in my opinion. Don't get me wrong there were some lighter side of this mostly gloomy movie. Much of the humor in the film come with the fact that the Nazis officers have no clue that he is a Jew. It becomes really funny when one of them quote that 'Jupp' looks like a young Adolf Hitler. Another funny moment is when a Nazi expert in racial science' came to the school to teach how to detect Jews and use 'Jup' as a demonstration on how pure Aryan stock he was. After all where else would you see a feuding Joseph Stalin and a Jewish Hitler dancing together? I do find the movie use Deus ex machine plot line way too much in this film. The movies has a lot of great scenes. The whole paintedover windows of trolley crossing the offlimits Lodz Ghetto was just so surreal. I wish the movie focus a little more on life in Soviet Union how hard was it for Solomon to lecture young Communists about the nonexistence of God when he was practicing Jew. The movie moves in a really too quick pace. The music adds to the dramatic tension but is somewhat forgotten. Since the film was made from Europeans. It's hard to find a movie copy has English subtitles. While the movie is now in DVD you wouldn't find a lot of English dubbing version. In my opinion it's better off to find the English subtitles because you would miss the fact that the actor that plays Solomon speaks both great Russian English and German in this. Overall Europa Europa is a gripping tale of one man survivable during World War 2 and the Holocaust. It might seek a bit lacking verisimilitude at times but it's still watchable.".

The movie moves in a really too quick pace. The music adds to the dramatic tension but is somewhat forgotten. Since the film was made from Europeans. It's hard to find a movie copy has English subtitles. While the movie is now in DVD you wouldn't find a lot of English dubbing version. In my opinion it's better off to find the English subtitles because you would miss the fact that the actor that plays Solomon speaks both great Russian English and German in this. Overall Europa Europa is a gripping tale of one man survivable during World War 2 and the Holocaust. It might seek a bit lacking verisimilitude at times but it's still watchable.";

In closing this review I will say that I watched the DVD for the first time just last night noticing as I opened the cellophane wrapper that I have had it in my collection for a very very long time probably 20 years.

Salomon's fascist schooling experience would lead one to believe that the entire German Army had nothing better to do than to impart training on killing Jews. That at a time when they were losing the war! A bit biased. When Salomon tries to surrender to the Russians the entire German Armies attention suddenly turns to him. They are more interested in a defector than in fighting the enemy firing bullets at them. Thats a bit fantastic.

From going to a Hitler Jugend school to being next to German Nazis who would not hesitate to kill him if they found out the tension you get for Solly is unnerving. Yet the movie has a great sense of humor throughout amid the fact that the gloom of death hangs in many of the scenes. Good looking Marco Hofschneider plays the part of Solomon extremely well. His wit and intelligence as well as his beliefs is a force that is stronger then anything the Germans say or do in the holocaust. Truly a magnificent movie. If you have never seen a foreign film start with this one. You will not be disappointed. Keep watching through the very end and you will see the real Solomon Perel!".

That is why most Germans didn't oppose the government. It is not because they were evil.

The Soviet Army rapedtortured and enslaved millions of innocent women as it invaded and occupied Eastern Europe. That small detail is left out by the movie.The happy ending is the main character as an elderly man praying in Isreal. The movie also omitted the detail that Isreal treats their Arab inhabitants in the same way the Nazis treated the Jews. They forced them off their own land into a type of ghetto and shower them with bombs whenever possible. I don't understand why a people who was so persecuted would colonize a foreign land and persecute another race in the same way they were persecuted.This movie was probably not wellreceived in Germany because of the movie's extreme bias. The movie was right to expose the brutality of the Nazi regime but it glorified the Soviet regime which was equally as cruel. It was equally irresponsible to glorify Isreal while ignoring Isreal's shameful history of Arab genocide and ethniccleansing. Europa Europa had the makings of a beautiful movie it is sad that it contained unfair propaganda bolstering cruel regimes.".

The film does not shrink from honing in on what the main character is truly after and ends just a few moments after she succeeds in reaching her goal. It also takes time to show that her parents are helplessly ineffective in containing their reckless daughter and distracting her from her singleminded quest to blossom into a woman before her time.".

	onyx:emotionText "This earlier film from Breillat is a typically truthful look at a foulmouthed teenager's quest to lose her virginity this time the film's restraint in what it shows is understandable because it is dealing with an underaged character but the Lolitaesquire aspects of the story particularly apparent in the girl's lovehate relationship with her older brother's mature friend are still effectively rendered. The film does not shrink from honing in on what the main character is truly after and ends just a few moments after she succeeds in reaching her goal. It also takes time to show that her parents are helplessly ineffective in containing their reckless daughter and distracting her from her singleminded quest to blossom into a woman before her time.";

This really felt in many ways like a warmup for Fat Girl! although I didn't think this was quite as good as that was. It somewhat lacked the extreme dynamics and tension that made that film more riveting. This was actually a bit boring at times especially toward the beginning. Also the cinematography was completely unremarkable again unlike Fat Girl! which used long uncomfortable singletakes to great effect. And there was really too much pointless talking at times. Still I wouldn't say that it is a bad film at all really. It definitely gets better as it goes on. It even began to remind me a little of Palindromes at times especially toward the end. I'd say that Breillat is definitely a good filmmaker but probably not a great one.".

Over the span of the night while engaging in boozing dancing and sexual encounters with this the stranger comes that special moment where she is to lose it but has second thoughts.

Although it's not Brielliat's best this earlier effort from this controversial director is definitely worth it's view where I will re iterate the film does feel a lot like Fat Girl even the familiar settings. True to life these sexual encounters happen where choices to continue or cross the line have resulted in arrests due to girls below the age of consent. A quite beautifully flowing film.

Perhaps how hard women have it in life or how hard men have it in life ... could be either. It was hard to watch all of this girls squirming and tantrums.One thing is that she was well cast as physically she was a beautiful Venus type of girl fullfigured and completely unselfconscious and a force of nature which nothing can control. But she does not seem to be any better at the end of the movie or have undergone anything but a small tear of the hymen in this movie hardly a dramatic transformation.I gave the movie a 4 for its attempt at real life and the guts to show what it did in the way it did but I could not recommend it nor would I want to see it again or would I see it if I knew it was going to be so blah.".

I can't say much for the film really as I found it rather dull. It's pretty much a woman walking around a house in the dark. Once it was obvious that nothing scary was ever going to happen I soon settled down and was just bored. Every time there was something suspicious in the background a sound effectmusical cue would alert me to its presence. The film finally gets a plot in the last few minutes which plays out through the credits in Polaroid form.

	schema:headline " For the most part an effective thrillerhorror";
	schema:reviewBody "This horror film is remarkable for a few reasons. Firstly it's from Uruguay a nation not known for it's film industry. Secondly it's filmed allegedly in one single take giving it a real time effect. Thirdly despite it's apparent low budget it is for the most part an effective horrorthriller.A father and daughter arrive at a remote house which they are set to clean up the following day. As they settle in for some sleep the daughter Laura hears some strange noises coming from upstairs. Eventually she persuades her father to take a look only for something to attack and kill him. From then on Laura creeps from room to room not knowing what or who is with her. With all the outside doors locked she finds a key giving her an escape to the outside world where she encounters the house owner who on seeing Laura covered in blood goes inside to investigate and on return he persuades her to reenter the house. At first they find nothing including the body of her father and then the the attacker strikes again knocking down but not killing the owner Nestor.From here the plot turns it appears that Laura and Nestor had a child who is no longer alive and Laura is exacting her revenge. She kills Nestor and the camera fades to black before we are then presented with a serious of Polaroid photos that suggest an untoward relationship between Laura her father and Nestor.The film is for the first two parts very effective once you get past the in and out of focus camera work outside of the house. Once inside with the house boarded up the only light is via two halogen lamps and a few candles. Once the noises start the darkness becomes unsettling we the viewer constantly scan the to look for clues of what is or isn't there. Much of the camera work stays very close to Laura and the use of mirrors helps give some sense of perspective as she moves from darkened room to darkened room. The strange sounds that fill the darkness add a sense of terror to the proceedings. The are some genuinely unnerving moments during this part of the film and there is some relief as she manages to get outside. The return of the owner Nestor and their return into the house reignites the sense of fear and we get glimpses of what may be the cause and there is a clever use of the flash from the Polaroid camera which literally illuminates an otherwise blacked out space.Then the plot seems to twist and suggests that it is Laura who has killed her father and Nestor the revenge she has taken for the fact her child is dead. It's this plot twist changed my enjoyment of the film. At first I didn't get it but on further thinking it does sort of make sense albeit in a quite clever way that there is the suggestion of untoward events and yet it is merely Laura taking revenge and the sounds are perhaps manifestations of her mind. Yet it still doesn't quite add up how did she manage to get the body into the chair when the camera suggests otherwise? It's details like those that don't make sense. Also the outcome and reason behind her actions are not obviously explained which further confuses me I mean maybe I'm stupid or maybe I missed a vital plot point or maybe in this instance what you see is literally not what you get.The film for some may be riddled with clichs nursery rhyme music the use of mirrors or the don't go upstairs warning and Laura's constant snuffling for some reason reminded me of the dog Muttley from Wacky Races when he laughs. It is however a great accomplishment for reasons stated at the top and for the most part it plays as an effective and tidy piece of horrorthriller.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me be clear with this La Casa Muda was not made in one single shot as it's publicized to be... The ending alone which takes place the next day after the events just eliminated that possibility without taken into account all the times the camera goes to black to hide the cuts. Also the film was shot in 5 days so that also rules out that possibility. Second this was not based on real events. The only part about the film that is based on real events is the fact that two people were found murdered on a house in Uruguay. As much this could be called Inspired by real events but what work of art is not at some extent inspired by things happening to the writer or something the writer took from reality... Is Silence of the Lambs a film BASED on real events just because the character of Buffalo Bill was inspired by Ed Gain? Besides this two points I needed to be clear on the film is not very good. It lacks an interesting story the script is terrible the actors performs some of the most stupid dialogs I have heard on any film Example Would you like to go to Granma's house? she has a canoe that is like a small boat. Do you know what a canoe is?.... YOU JUST FREAKING EXPLAINED WHAT THE FREAKING CANOE IS! Really that like pisses me off so much. Another example  Where is your dad?  I don't know... YES YOU KNOW HE IS DEAD YOU JUST SAY YOU DON'T KNOW BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE NO REASON TO GO BACK TO THE BLOODY HOUSE! The argument is stretched mindlessly just to make this possibly acceptable short film story into a long feature film resulting in like half an hour of a woman walking through a house whining There are stupid jump scares like the scene in which for no good reason the woman goes to investigate what is over the fridge and some birds came flying out from behind some cans into her face a variation on the Scary Jumping Cat scene we all know and hate by knowAnother thing that bothered me was the unnecessary shaky camera. This is not a camera point of view film is not like we need to understand a character is holding a camera like in REC or Blair Witch Project. Here the camera is not supposed to exist but the endless movement makes it impossible not to notice the camera. The camera is always present and that took me away from the story all the running time. The actress did a moderately good job but was not good enough to hold the film by herself and she is almost alone all the time. There are also some conceptual problems that bothered me a lot. In the film one of the main points is the fact that these two old men take young women to have sex into the house and took pictures of those women... Now when you see the pictures of these women... none of them are naked the most you would see is women in their bras. Now tell me why this couple of perverted old dirty men would not take pictures of these young women naked... And is not like they show you just a couple of this photos from a distance so you can think well this is just a sample they show you a lot of pictures in great detail and none of this women takes their bras off. Not suggesting a film to be good need to show tits but is just so off the character of how you are portraying the characters.Good points about the film Very good camera choreography besides the shaky aspects of the camera I found all the placements and composition of the shots to be very good and the most interesting part of the film. A well though and complete soundtrack. Great looking image. It is dark and monotone but it looks pristine. The photographic camera used in this film really marks a great point for independent films with low budget. Other production companies should follow this lead. Some effective scenes worked really well a good example of this was the scene when the woman first gets out of the house and runs into the forest very good scene in an otherwise mediocre film.For all of this I give the film 4 points out of 10".

What it is more remarkable is the fact that the film was produced in Uruguay a small country in South America with a three million population and a growing yet still incipient film industry.However the experiment proved to be a very successful experiment. According to the producer Gustavo Rojo and the director Gustavo Hernandez the film was never meant to reach an international audience. A few weeks after they uploaded the teaser on youtube they received offers from Cannes and USA's film companies. The film has received since then an overwhelming international acclaim and it has been remade in USA. Although critics and reviewers usually point out some inconsistencies in its narrative the film does not pretend to resolve them. If you do bear in mind these details before watching the film you will probably leave the cinema more amazed than scared.".

According to the producer Gustavo Rojo and the director Gustavo Hernandez the film was never meant to reach an international audience. A few weeks after they uploaded the teaser on youtube they received offers from Cannes and USA's film companies. The film has received since then an overwhelming international acclaim and it has been remade in USA. Although critics and reviewers usually point out some inconsistencies in its narrative the film does not pretend to resolve them. If you do bear in mind these details before watching the film you will probably leave the cinema more amazed than scared.";

Unfortunately it is a boring disappointing and predictable film. From the first very first scene I found that something was wrong with Laura but the twist is awfully flawed. In the end of the credits there is a long scene of Laura walking and having a conversation with her daughter Sofi. Last but not the least The Circle 2005 with the cult actress Angela Bettis is a digital movie shot entirely in one take and in real time. My vote is four.Title Brazil A Casa The HouseNote There are many fake reviews promoting this flick.

	schema:reviewBody "Now this film had very good points and very bad points which makes it difficult to decide whether it is a good film or not as a whole. Like every scary film this film could be divided into two halves The 'what's going on' part which builds up tension and suspense and the 'resolution' in which the plot is explained and wraps up. This film has a very effective first part but it's in the second half's explanation that everything good collapses. Good points and bad points for the first half Camera work  Good I usually detest 'shakycam' movies but this one was quite effective for the most part because it wasn't too shaky so that I didn't get motion sickness from it. Also it makes it so that the audience can't see much of what's going on which adds to the suspense. Bad It gives the feel that there's someone else in the room the cameraman which detracts from the main character's plight. Main Female Character  Good I think the actress did a good job portraying the fear of the situation.SPOILER ALERTBad Although the actress did a good job the character itself quickly becomes annoying. I know this film is set in the 40s so the character can't be expected to know what to do in a scary situation like we do from watching so many scary movies but there is a fine line between 'being scared stiff' and 'common sense'. I mean you're in a weird abandoned house you hear creepy noises coming from upstairs your father gets murdered and you decide to wander the house to find out what happened? Soundtrack  Good mysterious and haunting. Bad clichd with the 'nurserytype' music depicting the clash of horror and innocence. It's been done in every film! Dialogue  Bad! the dialogue is hard to hear and extremely and annoyingly repetitive only serving to highlight the character's 'dimwittedness'. I mean how many times does she say 'I don't know'?! Now for the massive spoilers the second half twist ending  it comes out of nowhere and it makes no sense. Now I don't want to give too much away but the main problem is that there is no logic to this twist. If the two men had been bringing girls into this house to have sex including the main character why would they return with her to the scene of the crime and why is the house in such a state of disrepair? Why would they pretend? When her 'father gets killed' why does she pretend she doesn't know what's going on when apparently it was her? If the ghost is her daughter who is that other 'male' ghost? What was the significance of the faceless paintings? If her daughter was killed I assume as a baby from what she says why does she appear as a little girl? And the most important plothole again Why does she act through out the first half like she doesn't know what's going on?! There's no one to pretend to except the audience! It makes no sense! So final thoughts The first half was except for a few silly clichs acceptably and effectively scary. But the second half just left me saying 'what what what' during the last 20 minutes or so. It wasn't scary it wasn't 'righteous vengeance' it wasn't creepy or even sweet it was confusing and absurd. So I'd give the first half a 7 or 8 out of 10 and the conclusion which is in my opinion the most important part of any film a 2 out of 10 for being strange and so completely out of context.Extended Final Thoughts Why is the film called 'The Silent House' or the literal Spanish translation 'The Mute House'? The house and ghosts make a lot of noise throughout the film. That was in fact what started everything. What does that have to do with 2 creepy men taking pictures of halfnaked girls? They weren't killed they weren't gagged or 'silenced'. What's the significance?".

And during the second scene...one moment...There is no second scene! The whole movie was filmed in a long continuous take supposedly something which might be a bit baffling on the beginning. But I could immediately get into the screenplay and that became into an essential factor in order to emphasize the suspense which was achieved by this modest horror film which might not be great but which kept me very interested and entertained.I admire the audacity of making the whole movie in a single take I guess that the new digital cameras make that feat possible without as many tricks as various years ago even though the mention of an editor during the credits makes me to suspect a little bit of that. Something which suffered because of that during the beginning was the audio because it frustrated me a little bit not being able to listen some dialogs from the beginning well fortunately the rest of the film is almost mute so the deficient audio is not such a terrible problem. After all the visual minimalism puts the emphasis on the performances and the direction which are enough competent in order to compensate any technical problem.Talking about the performances Florencia Colucci's excellent work in the leading role is particularly worthy of mention because she can perfectly express complex emotions without the need of words. Instead of using the camera for showing us her point of view director Gustavo Hernndez frequently aimed it to her face making her an empathic guide for the spectator something which is very well complemented by Colucci's performance. As for the twist in the end I found it interesting but there are a few details which make it to feel a bit forced anyway I cannot deny I liked it mainly because I did not see it coming.In conclusion La Casa Muda is a very competent horror film which deserves a recommendation at the same time that it proves that there is no need for many resources or special effects in order to keep us in suspense.".

No...

AH of course now is a good time to say that i am just too stupid to get the ending and that she actually killed everyone. you people are so easy to manipulate if that is so... i don't know how many movies i've watched with the same twist to clean up a bad movie and make you think that you are the idiot and not the people who created the movie. even she killed them her emotions would look a lot different.well back to the movie girl walking around in the house in slow motion having an incredible interest in looking at every piece of equipment. girl's father died and his body is changing rooms many times in the movie. girl walking around in the house in slow motion having an incredible interest in looking at every piece of equipment. girl happily found the key to get outside girl running outside and sees a creepy girl girl happily meets her friend later you know her affair girl can not answer the question of where is your father? and says i don't know later to be revealed to be the brilliant twist of this unworthy movie. girl doesn't want to go back to the house but the guy is eager and doesn't care about the blood on her dress then inside the house the girl is happy to be back in the house and starts to space up looking at house equipment. girl's affair suddenly disappeared girl finds her affair and he pretends to be dead girl is actually starting to talk and we are all happy knowing that the whole thing we saw is just pure fiction of the girl's mind .......endacting just a really stupid idea to give a amateur actress a role where she has to act out her emotions nonstop through a whole movie where she completely failed.screenplay in general just a guy holding a camera and walking behind the girl the whole movie.dialogue senseless and stupid even if you are happy with the great twist.atmosphere sometimes good then again just boringsound actually pretty nice and mild use of music and sounds".

	schema:headline " Where are the cuts....oh there they are";
	schema:reviewBody "A Uruguayan film which claims to be filmed all in one shot and in real time! I was intrigued to see whether the claims were true. As film making has progressed what is to stop anyone from making a film in one long continuous shot? Well here's an attempt from debut film maker Gustavo Hernandez.The plot is based on a true story of an event which happened in the 1940s in Uruguay. A father and daughter are called to a cottagefarmhouse to house sit until it's eventually sale. It doesn't take long to find things are not as quiet and serene as they seem. The daughter Laura the main focal point in the film starts to hear some noise coming from the rooms above. She wakes her father who goes reluctantly to investigate and that's when the film kicks into gear. After a few minutes and the non reappearance of her father Laura decides to find out what has happened to her father.What happens next is a series of what I would call boo moments as the film makers try to catch the viewer off guard by springing up flashes of images and dark shadows in the background to instill so scares. As a veteran horror fan it wasn't too successful. What the film does succeed on though is giving the sense of claustrophobia. Having only one view point can be really unsettling as the camera follows our protagonist from behind and slowly switching views to being in front and occasionally becoming the POV shot there is no cut away or a secondary view point. The film makers have really tried to make the film flow like an uncut one long continuous shot.But is the film really filmed with no cuts? Unforutnately no those of you with an eagle eye will probably be able to spot the seamless cuts between the passing through objects or anything dark. That isn't to say that there isn't a lot of technical achievement on show but the claims of the film are clearly not 100 accurate. There is a lot to say about only having one view point as it can seem really restrictive but in turn it can boost the overall atmosphere and tension. The lack of film score also adds to the sense of dread as every little sound is magnified.The only thing criticism I would level at the film is it's last reveal or final revelation. When you find out what is really happening there's an enormous sense of let down. For all the films technical flair the film is severely hampered but it's silly turn in events. If you have seen the French film Haute Tension then you will understand what I am talking about. It should have kept on going as a haunted house story instead of what it turns out to be.An interesting idea clever uses of light and dark and the generation of tension is admirable. Clearly influences by other low budget horrors like Blair Witch and the video game Silent Hill. A girl walking around a house with only a torch to light the way only conjours up memories of playing the old survivor horror game. Alas I feel I would have more fun playing the game than watching this film. A flawed experiment.".

To dispense with all the hype over the singleshot claim I'll address that first.This film is obviously NOT shot in a single take as the filmmakers claim. There are several at least four times where the camera wanders into a pitch black area holds still or goes out of focus just enough for them to cut on. There's also an interesting scare mechanic at the film's midpoint which is obviously cut together. Also I've read reports that other films have actually done first. Sorry to disappoint you.The plot of Silent House is paper thin and easy ascertainable. I want to spoil the ridiculously simplistic ending but I actually don't have to. You'll figure it out on your own in the first ten minutes.I will say that Silent House makes an achievement in terms of mood and lighting. The movie grabs your attention in a few segments but during the down town the viewer is left checking their watch. Not a whole lot happens. There are blurs in the background creepy music and bumps in the night galore. But all in all Silent House is fairly underwhelming. The scariest part of the movie is also its single most creative moment. You'll wake up from your daze wondering why the whole movie can't be this horrifying.Check it out if you're curious. But if you want real atmosphere scares with depth and a plot that keeps you in the dark at least for half the movie then watch Insidious instead. The house goes silent at 4 out of 10.".

At the end SPOILERS AHEAD it is hinted that there was some sort of previous relationship between the daughter and the landlord and this is supposed to be the surprise twist of the movie that explains everything that went on before. Unfortunately what has happened is never fully explained and is the main reason this movie ends in a very unsatisfying note. Filmed in handheld camera and with very long takes whether all the film is one long take I can't say this is done in a way that doesn't call too much attention to itself and is thus less bothersome than in other movies. Promoted as an innovative horror film made with an almost zero budget it is indeed reasonably well directed. The main problem lies in the very weak script. As a twenty minute student short it would be sort of OK but as a commercially released almost one hour and a half movie it is far less compelling. Also the sound is pretty poor at many instances I couldn't pick up what the characters were saying especially when they were whispering if you see it with subtitles I guess you won't have that problem.".

For a generation of horror fans grown accustomed to the jump cut and the rapid fire edit accompanying generic slaughter the use of the single detached POV employed here reminds us of just how much control and security we've been used to.Whilst the premise of the old dark house has been worn thin over centuries in horror literature and film its creaky interiors and dreaded staircases lend themselves perfectly to the single take gimmick. While you may find yourself tiring a little of the protagonist's rather turgid wondering about the house as she goes from room to room with lamp aloft laboriously recording each artefact and item the jolt that comes after such a protracted period is sublime setting the standard for further atmospheric scares to come.Essentially if you're willing to buy into the idea which much like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity ask from their viewer a little patience and imagination you will certainly reap the rewards on offer here. If the film loses its way in the final act bringing in an unnecessary cross generic twist then we can be consoled by the fact that this is for the most part an effective and at times chilling piece of micro budget horror.".

If you're expecting a supernatural type of movie like that then you will be sorely disappointed but in saying that it's still a pretty creepy  very atmospheric movie.It's also very very cleverly edited to seem like it was filmed in one continuous shot and the illusion works superbly. For me that added to the suspense of the film because there were no obvious cutaway scenes or anything to interrupt the flow of the movie and for a movie that only cost about 6000 to make that makes it even more impressive.The Silent House will not be to everyone's taste but if you enjoy a good creepy thriller and one where you have to use your brain to put things together then you might enjoy this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two points that I need to clear up immediately. This is my first Uruguayan film and I watched the American remake 'Silent House' before this. So whilst acknowledging the above two statements I have to say the original is a landmark in experimental film making. Claiming to be shot in one continuous 82 minute take it showcases the basic ability in crafting a film with just a six thousand dollar budget yet its inventive direction elevates this horror to be in the league of those that have a much higher budget. Does the low budget show? Yes which you could say is the film's detriment. However the fact that it was made with pocket money is part of the allure and charm. The story involves a woman wandering around a house that her family are choosing to sell where she hears strange loud noises which rapidly turns her peaceful night into a hellish torment. The main attraction is the concept of being shot in one take. You immediately start to become entranced by the director's technique quickly thinking to yourself how did they pass the camera through the car? or what if the actress messes up right at the end?. It's a bold statement and one that certainly makes this film memorable. The claustrophobic dark environment increases the tension to its maximum potential. This is a horror that puts all of its energy into building a thrilling atmosphere and it succeeds brilliantly. The short runtime allows for rapid pacing as we journey through the desolate corridors whilst nervously biting our nails. Aside from the above that's all this film has going for it. As always the problem with a low budget is that it's incredibly rough around the edges. There is no finesse. The plot was clearly sidelined because it makes no sense whatsoever. No characterisation no plot development except the last five minutes which were far too convoluted and a few too many plot holes. The scares consisted of loud noises although the polaroid scene was effective. It's not often I say this but I prefer the remake...".

However as the years pass Garrigan cannot help but notice Amin's increasingly erratic behavior that grows beyond a legitimate fear of assassination into a murderous insanity that is driving Uganda into bloody ruin.

	schema:headline " Idi Amin Entertainer";
	schema:reviewBody "Life unlike bad movies is seldom obvious. In life murderous dictators don't appear  especially at first  as mustachetwirling Snidley Whiplash figures cackling madly although Mussolini came close. The scary truth about monsters is that they are threedimensional beings not cardboard cutouts who just kill a lot of people but otherwise put their pants on one leg at a time like you and I and that makes them so much scarier than if they came from another planet.In the best film of the dictator genre Oliver Hirschbiegel's brilliant Downfall Hitler appears as a man who is kind to his dog and his secretary roughly in that order and the impact of the work is all the greater as we witness what a real person is capable of doing. In Luis Puenzo's The Official Story Pinochet's reign of terror is depicted through a single act of violence as a door is slammed on Norma Aleandro's hand the effect is stunning and real. In the hands of a less talented director the story of Idi Amin would be told against mountains of skulls and bones left behind by Uganda's mad ruler in the 1970s. His total toll is estimated at 300000. In Kevin Macdonald's complex intelligent gripping The Last King of Scotland more than half of the twohour film subtly implies hints at the dark forces underneath normalcy while life goes on. And so having established real contact with the audience a jolly and seductive Forest Whitaker then takes our breath away as the mask comes off and his Amin reaches out from the screen for your throat.Macdonald  whose previous works are documentaries including the Oscarwinning One Day in September about the Munich Olympics terrorist incident  looks at Amin through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor James McAvoy a wellmeaning honest humanitarian slowly seduced by the Scotsloving Amin who appoints him his personal doctor and then adviser.The McAvoy character is fictional although Amin did have a Scottish doctor coming from Giles Foden's novel of the same name but just about everything else in the film is based on fact  so much so that some documentary footage is smoothly integrated into the film. And yet what's important and outstanding about Last King is that just as a painting can surpass a photograph in presenting reality this film conveys the seduction and horror of a brutal dictatorship indirectly subtly unexpectedly.Unexpected  and welcome  are the many flashes of humor both Whitaker dictator with personality and McAvoy eager pup of a doctor with overactive hormones making the best of it. The tone is set in the opening sequence as the frustrated suppressed young Dr. Garrigan spins a small globe swearing repeatedly that he will move to the first spot the first! where he points when the globe stops. The first spot turns out to be Canada. McAvoyGarrigan takes one look hesitates... and spins again. And so to Uganda...The linear freelyflowing storytelling is masterful taking us from the small village where Dr. Garrigan comes to do good and ends up doing well through a chance meeting with Amin to Kampala much court intrigue and colorful depravity even as the fate of a nation is at stake and eventually to Entebbe.Fun and games authentic scenery the film was shot in Uganda subtlety psychology a heartpounding scene at Entebbe after the hijacking but before the Israeli rescue nudity sex violence harrowing questions about what would you do and all  Last King is a wonderful compendium of facts and greater truths. Also a hell of a good movie.".

The scary truth about monsters is that they are threedimensional beings not cardboard cutouts who just kill a lot of people but otherwise put their pants on one leg at a time like you and I and that makes them so much scarier than if they came from another planet.In the best film of the dictator genre Oliver Hirschbiegel's brilliant Downfall Hitler appears as a man who is kind to his dog and his secretary roughly in that order and the impact of the work is all the greater as we witness what a real person is capable of doing. In Luis Puenzo's The Official Story Pinochet's reign of terror is depicted through a single act of violence as a door is slammed on Norma Aleandro's hand the effect is stunning and real. In the hands of a less talented director the story of Idi Amin would be told against mountains of skulls and bones left behind by Uganda's mad ruler in the 1970s. His total toll is estimated at 300000. In Kevin Macdonald's complex intelligent gripping The Last King of Scotland more than half of the twohour film subtly implies hints at the dark forces underneath normalcy while life goes on. And so having established real contact with the audience a jolly and seductive Forest Whitaker then takes our breath away as the mask comes off and his Amin reaches out from the screen for your throat.Macdonald  whose previous works are documentaries including the Oscarwinning One Day in September about the Munich Olympics terrorist incident  looks at Amin through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor James McAvoy a wellmeaning honest humanitarian slowly seduced by the Scotsloving Amin who appoints him his personal doctor and then adviser.The McAvoy character is fictional although Amin did have a Scottish doctor coming from Giles Foden's novel of the same name but just about everything else in the film is based on fact  so much so that some documentary footage is smoothly integrated into the film. And yet what's important and outstanding about Last King is that just as a painting can surpass a photograph in presenting reality this film conveys the seduction and horror of a brutal dictatorship indirectly subtly unexpectedly.Unexpected  and welcome  are the many flashes of humor both Whitaker dictator with personality and McAvoy eager pup of a doctor with overactive hormones making the best of it. The tone is set in the opening sequence as the frustrated suppressed young Dr. Garrigan spins a small globe swearing repeatedly that he will move to the first spot the first! where he points when the globe stops. The first spot turns out to be Canada. McAvoyGarrigan takes one look hesitates... and spins again. And so to Uganda...The linear freelyflowing storytelling is masterful taking us from the small village where Dr. Garrigan comes to do good and ends up doing well through a chance meeting with Amin to Kampala much court intrigue and colorful depravity even as the fate of a nation is at stake and eventually to Entebbe.Fun and games authentic scenery the film was shot in Uganda subtlety psychology a heartpounding scene at Entebbe after the hijacking but before the Israeli rescue nudity sex violence harrowing questions about what would you do and all  Last King is a wonderful compendium of facts and greater truths. Also a hell of a good movie.";

	schema:headline " Whitaker's Towering Portrayal of the Mesmerizing Ugandan Dictator Lifts This Historical Fiction";
	schema:reviewBody "Forest Whitaker's ferociously charismatic turn as Idi Amin so dominates this intense historical fiction that it is honestly difficult to pay attention to anything else in this 2006 political thriller. Even though he is definitively the emotional locus he is intriguingly not the protagonist of the story. That role belongs to young James McAvoy who plays Nicholas Garrigan a precocious Scottish doctor who ventures to Uganda to satisfy his need for adventure after graduating medical school. By happenstance Garrigan is called upon to help Amin with a minor sprain after his private car plows into a cow. Impressed by the young man's lack of hesitancy to take action Amin appoints Garrigan to be his personal physician a post that seduces the impressed doctor into the Ugandan dictator's political inner circle and extravagant lifestyle.Scottish director Kevin MacDonald brings his extensive documentary filmmaking skills to the fore here as he creates a most realisticfeeling atmosphere in capturing the oppressive Uganda of the 1970's. Helping considerably with this image are the vibrant color contrasts in Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and the propulsive action induced by Justine Wright's sharp editing. Screenwriters Peter Morgan who also wrote The Queen and Jeremy Brock have developed a sharply delineated character study of Amin who evolves from a magnetic leader giving hope to his people to a scarifying tyrant conducting murders on an imaginable scale at least until the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. It is impossible to overpraise Whitaker's towering performance here. He conveys the dictator's playfulness as well as his unmitigated rage moving from simmering to full boil with a power that is at once bravura and subtle. His relationship with the fictionalized Garrigan turns out to be the plot's essential pivot point although the contrast between the two can be almost too extreme at times.While McAvoy admirably captures the boyish naivet of Garrigan the character is drawn out in rather broad strokes that make his selfdelusion all the more contrived as the story progresses. To intensify the political upheaval portrayed the plot takes a melodramatic turn into an adulterous affair and even folds in the infamous 1976 Entebbe hijacking incident to illustrate Garrigan's increasingly precarious situation. It's all exciting and even downright brutalizing toward the end but it also starts to feel a bit too Hollywood in execution. Kerry Washington shows genuine versatility as Amin's cloistered third wife Kay while Simon McBurney oozes cynical suspicion with ease as a British operative. A convincingly Britaccented Gillian Anderson makes her few scenes count as a weary clinic worker who proves to have better instincts than Garrigan. But see the movie for Whitaker's magnificent work. He is that good.".

Whitaker is not the silent sometimes brooding character you remember in other films he has been in. His accenthis face and his emotions seem to no longer be Whitaker's but Amin's. This movie will scare the viewer because of its realism and how it builds up to a tension that is hard to endure. The visuals are not for the squeamish. Go ahead and hide your eyes during the tough scenes. It is still worth seeing this movie for the fast paced story realistic drama fascinating tale and for the unbelievable acting. By the end of the movie the audience is exhausted but satisfied that they saw a worthy flick.".

Forget all the others this is the best horror film of the year. This movie and his performance in particular grab hold of you and never let go. Whitaker should win an Oscar for best actor I've never seen a better performance in my life. Also notable is the Nicholas Garrigan character who is written and acted very skilfully to draw the nonAfrican spectator into the world of Uganda and Amin. The way his character willingly falls into Amin's web of charisma somehow goes a long way toward mitigating the racist potential of a story about a very troubled African black man. The way the interplay of the two lead character's cultural backgrounds plays out on screen moves the story beyond just their personalities and into the realm of incisive sociopolitical analysis and critique. This movie is quite incredible really.".

Scottish documentarian Kevin Macdonald directs the film with only a few lapses in directness which serve this biopic very well. Watching Amin and the young doctor immerse themselves in the shower of power is both frightening and sickening. Macdonald captures this spirit very well thanks mostly to his willingness to let his two leads do their thing.As Amin laughs and tells Garrigan that You are my closest adviser I couldn't help but compare to Kathy Bates telling James Caan in Misery that I'm your number one fan. The evil and insanity is simply chilling. Whitaker is just amazing as he flips the switch from media darling to cold blooded ruthless murderer ... and then back again. Just a terrific performance and well worth the price of admission  maybe a couple of times! Good for a laugh is the most unique version of Janis Joplin's Me and Bobby McGee that you have ever heard ... guaranteed!

Garrigan enters into a moral crisis as he begins to realize the kind of man Amin is and begins to fear for his own life as events spiral more and more out of his control.Whitaker seizes the chance to play this larger than life character and runs with it  I've never seen Whitaker give so convincing and transforming a performance. However as good as he is McAvoy impressed me more. His performance as Garrigan is not as showy but it's much more textured and subtle and his character has the bigger arc from start to finish. Gillian Anderson also does terrific work in a small role as a fellow doctor who understands things about Amin and the African culture that Garrigan does not.Unlike other recent thrillers set in African nations The Constant Gardener Hotel Rwanda The Last King of Scotland is not greatly concerned with the geopolitical implications of Amin's reign. The atrocities he committed against Ugandans are given only the barest of mentions and the film sticks almost exclusively to Garrigan and the danger he himself faces. Some may think the film is irresponsible for this reason  that the plight of one man pales in comparison to the plight of thousands and I can see where a criticism like that is justified.

His portrayal of the young Scottish doctor who is both naive and brave is fantastic and it is great to watch the young Scotsman grow with every movie hes in.Overall this is a simply astonishing film telling an important story with some great performances. No criticism even worth mentioning for this movie that kept me on the edge of my seat til the very end.".

His portrayal of the young Scottish doctor who is both naive and brave is fantastic and it is great to watch the young Scotsman grow with every movie hes in.Overall this is a simply astonishing film telling an important story with some great performances. No criticism even worth mentioning for this movie that kept me on the edge of my seat til the very end.";

	schema:reviewBody "In this film Kevin Macdonald a Scot directs James McAvoy a Scot as Nicholas Garrigan a brash spirited and foolish young doctor just out of medical school in the early 1970's who overnight becomes a close associate of Idi Amin Forest Whitaker the new dictator of Uganda. Amin had served in the British army and developed an admiration for the Scots. He gave himself the title His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin VC DSO MC King of Scotland Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular. He liked to dress his soldiers in kilts and have them sing Scottish songs.Before this Macdonald made Touching the Void and other documentaries including One Day in September about the Munich Israeli Olympic team massacre. This film which is not a documentary and departs freely from fact at least at certain key points is based on the 1997 novel by Giles Foden which concerns the doctor. But Macdonald's writers including Jeremy Brock who penned Mrs. Brown and Peter Morgan who scripted Frears' The Queen have jazzed up the more bland original character and made him younger and bolder. Garrigan has picked Uganda at random. He is attractive and dashing he's already flirting with the pretty blonde wife of the head of the rural medical clinic he's come to work in when he's grabbed with her to save the paranoid Amin. The newly ascended President for Life has hurt his hand in an accident involving a farmer's cow. Garrigan impresses Amin by not just calmly fixing his sprained hand but also grabbing his presidential pistol and putting the cow out of its misery.When Amin learns Nicholas is a Scot he takes off his military shirt complete with medals and trades it on the spot for a Scotland Tshirt Nicolas is wearing  for his son Campbell. Amin has another son named Macgregor.Almost immediately thereafter Amin persuades the young doctor to leave the clinic and become his personal physician in Kampala the capital where the movie was shot sets him up with a Mercedes and a posh apartment in the presidential compound and makes him a most trusted consultant allowing him to decide on the design for a major building. Observing this exceptional access a cynical British diplomat Simon McBurney approaches Nicholas and cautions him to keep in touch an offer the young man initially rebuffs.Garrigan's seduced as are we initially by Amin's charisma and charm and only gradually does he become skeptical and eventually horrified as he realizes he's the intimate of a ferocious dictator who estimates say killed off 300000 of his citizens as well as expelling all the Asians from the country. What's interesting is how the daring young man as we see him can hardly help being thus seduced how the two men seduce each other. But Nicholas is in a terribly weak position when things go wrong. Whitaker and McAvoy play off each other nicely as they act out this process.Several dramatic events involving Garrigan in the twohour film's latter segment strain credulity including the way the young doctor's escape is intertwined with the Entebbe plane hijacking incident and the kinds of trouble he gets into on the way to that escape.What makes this film whose plot line can scarcely compete with that of the more multileveled and thoughtprovoking The Constant Gardener and which has a grainy newsreel look that's undistinguished is Forest Whitaker's astonishing performance as Idi Amin Dada. Whitaker usually plays soft spoken sensitive types. This time he nails a range from fearful to seductive to terrifying connecting them with a seamlessly explosive energy. One would say Whitaker is this picture except that it's unmistakably also young McAvoy's. Essential to the film is the way McAvoy who's had mostly more minor and more purely physical roles before he was the fawn in Narnia plays off Whitaker beautifully and woos us too with his convincing enthusiasm and dash. This is a very watchable but also disturbing movie which one wishes might have maintained greater verisimilitude. When documentarians embroider the truth sometimes they go off way too far. But this is not unusual a great performance in a lessthangreat movie. We have to take what we can get and in The Last King of Scotland we get a very wild ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree Forest Whitaker was very good as the famous mentallydisturbed leader of Uganda Idi Amin back in the 1970s but despite the Oscar he received as Best Actor I thought the best thing about this film was the involving story. Once the costar of the film James McAvoy as Dr.Nicholas Garrigan became Amin's personal doctor this film like a good book became really difficult to put down. It was a very interesting story which got better and better as it went along. It's also one you won't forget about in a few days. This one stays with you!Make no mistake Whitaker was excellent as Amin but McAvoy was just as good as the young Scot who found himself involved in something a lot bigger and more sinister than ever thought possible. Frankly I couldn't stand his character or anything about him. For a doctor the guy was scumbag hitting on any attractive married woman he could find willing to do abortions was easily led by opulence and flattery and was smug and stupid throughout much of the film with this silly smartass grin on his face. He almost had me rooting for Amin which means he must have done a pretty good job of acting. too. When the good doctor was stupid enough to have sex with one of Amin's wives I thought it would be the end for him. It almost was as we saw in the movie and I didn't feel too sorry for him. If this was a true story the man is unbelievably lucky to escape with his private parts much less his life. He got off scotfree you could say pun intended.Dr. Garrigan was a typical goodheartedbutnaive young Liberal who wouldn't listen to the older guys looking at them in a condescending snotty way. The best part of the film was when he needed those old politicos to help him leave the country and they gave him back a little of his own sarcastic medicine.Nonetheless Amin was a brutal man and much more so than he is portrayed in this film. It's a disgrace he was able to live comfortably in exile until 2003. Whitaker's portrayal of the sociopath doesn't touch the surface of the Amin's evilness but Amin truth be told was also a charmer. It's amazing how a little charm can make even a mass murderer look like a nice guy. In addition to the fine acting performances of Whitaker and McAvoy I thought the camerawork in here was well aboveaverage too. This is a nicelyfilmed movie and credit should go to cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. I don't hear much praise going his way but I really liked the visuals in here.Are there holes in this story? Yes especially in the last 10 minutes but  that's the movies for you. I'm not sure if I'd watch this a number of times but I am glad I saw it and it's two hours of involving entertainment. It's definitely recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like movies based on real people in history. Because of the Oscar buzz surrounding Forest Whitaker now I knew this movie is about Idi Amin. This is of course a familiar name in my childhood asked in General Information contests but I don't really know much about him except that he was a dictator.This film has a documentary feel to it. It is really very realistic even if upon reading background info that the Dr. Garrigan character is fictional. Even though granted that the Idi Amin regime was compressed into a coherent Hollywood storyline it does not feel contrived. The final sequence of events at the Entebbe Airport was very suspenseful indeed.Idi Amin was not really the lead character in this movie. It is actually Dr. Nicholas Garrigan. Being a physician I could not help but be able to identify with his situation and dilemmas. Would you accept to be the personal physician of a country's president upon his personal request? It seems to be an offer and career opportunity you could not refuse.There is sex and violence in this movie. I could not agree though with Dr. Garrigan's rashness regarding his love affairs particularly his morals of hooking up with wives of his supposed friends. But considering that this movie is set in the 1970s that was a totally different world preHIV. The violence what can I say? After watching one violent film after the other you get sort of anesthetized already. That said the scene with hooks at the airport was still something else! The acting is very good. Forest Whitaker has channeled the Idi Amin persona very effectively. I could feel the scary and suffocating craziness whenever he is on screen. There's something about this performance being based on a real character though. I think it would be harder to essay a totally fictional character since you have to create this new character from scratch. And I feel James McAvoy who was actually Mr. Tumnus in Narnia! did so very well as Dr. Garrigan. You dislike him yet you can empathize the stickiness of his situation.Before I end this review I have to mention that I was very happy to see the luminous Ms. Gillian Anderson again. I totally did not know she was in this film and it was a welcome surprise. She handled her few scenes as the wife of a volunteer doctor very well indeed. I hope she gets meatier movie roles in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "It may seem like an unusual name for a movie about the events surrounding the 1970's rise to power of Ugandan military dictator Idi Amin but to see is to understand.The plot based on a novel that in turn was inspired by actual events follows a freshlyminted young Scottish doctor named Nicholas Garrigan. In just a few quick scenes director Kevin Macdonald clearly shows us that this drinking pot smoking free spirit is terrified by his suffocating future of being a family practitioner in business with his overbearing old man. Not nearly as sure of what he wants as what he doesn't want Nick spins a globe and winds up in Uganda just as a coup has taken place. The director again lets us know quickly what this young Scot's about Nick has a hard time keeping his hands off the ladies as he jumps right into the sack with a flirtatious fellow bus traveler before he arrives at the village where he is to assist the resident doctor.A nicely slimmed down and understated Gillian Anderson sporting a decent British accent portrays the doctor's beautiful and underappreciated wife. She picks up Nick from the bus stop and ferries him to his post through an eerie night road scape full of ghostly Ugandans wandering in the truck's headlights.Nick enjoys some aspects of his new gig playing soccer with the kids vaccinating little ones against the diseases that ravage the land and yes eyeing the doctor's wife.His seduction attempt nearly succeeds Anderson smartly portrays a good woman whose need to be bad is only slightly weaker than her desire to be noble. Still in turmoil they attend a rally nearby where Idi Amin is addressing his new constituents. Charismatic and rabblerousing Forest Whitaker convincingly portrays the first of many facets of Amin that will be revealed throughout the course of this film.It would be a disservice to the viewer who has not yet seen this thick affecting film to describe the plot in any more detail but suffice it to say that a fortuitous encounter with the dictator soon leads to Nick away from his boredom good works and untasted forbidden fruit of the countryside village to the inner circle of the charming terrifying and possibly insane bully Amin.The aimlessness of Nick's life begins to come clear for him as he gets deeper and deeper into the moral quagmire of being chief adviser and personal physician to the man who was ultimately responsible for the 300000 deaths of those who opposed him within Uganda.The ending after a buildup nearly as hallucinatory and overwhelming as Apocalypse Now comes down during the Entebbe hijacking and hostage crisis of 1976.Nick's journey is told without a misstep and an epic significant air hangs over this grainy youarethere photography. And the impact of casual violence and its affect on the value of human life has rarely been portrayed with more vividness than in this film. Nothing done by a Freddy or a Jason can match the atrocities visited upon those on the wrong side of Amin's politics paranoia or temper.For the squeamish this is a harrowing ride.The soundtrack throbs with African popular music of the time think Fela Kuti with less improv and more melody and the sense of time and place is utterly convincing.As well made as this film is it is still the cake that the icing of the actors decorates. Forest Whitaker gives what is without a doubt the performance of his career in Idi Amin. And Oscar nomination if not an outright win is a certainty if there is any justice in this world. And James McAvoy's callow Nicholas grows in heft and morality before our eyes. At first he enjoys the opulence and easy living of being among Amin's inner circle but as he continues to dally with the wrong ladies and mock the covert operatives from England that approach him an actual person with inner strength appears. And though his answer to all this is to run away the impediments placed in his path teach him a thing or two about being a human being. MacAvoy deserves plentiful praise for bringing this pleasureseeking young doctor to life then shepherding him through these changes believably before our eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film can be judged from three viewpoints as history as a profile of Amin as a fictional thriller. It fails as history it mentions in passing the coup that threw out Obote the expulsion of the Asians and has the Entebbe hijack as background but not in any chronologically consistent time frame. As a profile of Amin it may have been interesting because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good and if this was a better film he would get an Oscar. He got it  which proves the Oscar voters don't watch the films they vote on. It ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel which observed Amin and the history of Uganda from the point of view of the doctor. It tells instead the fictitious story of the Scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin. But the story told is the one incident that Amin was probably innocent of. As a fictional thriller there is no plot to hold it together. The beginning is taut  it takes cinematic liberties with the novel but sets up the story. The character of the doctor is welldefined but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result.Why the doctor decides to stay in Kampala is badly explained  seduced by power? Why he befriends noone is strange. The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor  a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of Amin close at hand. The Man called Horse bit at the end is risible. Finally in 1971 Uganda drove on the left not right the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers  and where are the Equator tusks?! In short  if you've never heard of Amin you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate Forest Whitaker's acting but the last hour will bore you to confusion. If you know Uganda or have read the book  don't see the film  it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy  he wasn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved including Whittaker who indeed deserves his nomination. It is highly entertaining and . . . taken in the right context as a work of FICTION it is a very good movie. For that I give it the two stars.However rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere I want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth. I stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a complete invention of fiction. Rather it presents this character into a real historical setting and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real and what they are seeing is the truth. I have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction  but to do so in such a dishonest matter is in a word reprehensible.There can be no doubt that Africa along with most Third World Countries is rife with human misery and suffering. Hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film. But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money. The only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the West is to either experience it for yourself or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.But these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much. At the end of the day they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming SEE WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BAD! The seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the DVD after sitting through the movie. Arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of Kay Amin Idi's second wife whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity. In the film we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse arms for legs and viceversa. This is the director making sure you understand that Amin is as the Gungans say Bombad! But watching the documentary we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth which the sitting Minister of Health at the time himself tells us is not true.So . . . what . . . they just MAKE UP these things? Why? Because Hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence that's why! They don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves. Look that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that Amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media  we don't need this Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE inspired imagery to reinforce that! And this is just the tip of the iceberg. What is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character Garrigan is himself fictional. There was no young Scottish doctor taken under Amin's wing. As such Garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb Westerners understand the African world. The producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about Africa unless there is a white face in it. Ironically even the titular character is portrayed by an American black actor! The problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of Amin and his regime but instead an exploitative thriller about a white Westerner coming to Africa for all the wrong reasons making several horrible mistakes and then redeeming himself even at the cost of three other innocent lives. Honestly I have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of Mrs. Amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional Scottish doctor  it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment! I really wish Hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money. I first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative A BEAUTIFUL MIND Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman's sugarysweet adaptation of the life of John Nash which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that America just can't get enough of. The sad truth is that Hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years and viewers who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves buy these fake portraits hook line and sinker.Look I'm certainly not suggesting Amin is being turned into a villain he wasn't. My point is with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man why must Hollywood then go to such fictional lengths? Why must Hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films? Why can they not trust us to think for ourselves!? Can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves? I urge all who continue to watch Hollywood's purportedly true movies to do yourself the favor of ALWAYS investigating for yourself and to NEVER assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth!".

	schema:reviewBody "2007 has already started off with a magnificent bang in my eyes. Last year 2006 started with more the after shock of three decent fantasy epics Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and King Kong. 2006 actually didn't really begin with any redeeming movies at all to be honest however 2007 has got off to a spectacular start. I've so far only seen three movies. Now out of the three The Last King of Scotland is easily the best however by saying this I realise how much of an understatement this is for this movie. You see The Last King of Scotland is not only better than these other two movies combined hell its not only better than most of my favourite movies of last year this movie is easily one of the best movies in absolutely ages! In fact I can only put this on the same level as Pan's Labyrinth as this movie is absolutely spectacular! In fact there has never been an early front runner in my eyes for Film of the Year however this movie looks very likely to prove everyone different! The Last King of Scotland is an interesting movie following the story of a young man called Nicholas as he is propelled into the bizarre world of Ugandan leader Idi Amin. The movie might not be entirely based on reality there's some stuff that never occurred however this movie does still manage to be an absolutely thrilling event and featuring one of the most powerful performances in ages. Forrest Whittaker is absolutely breathtaking as the Ugandan leader Idi Amin. In fact if he does not win the Best Actor Oscar he will have been brutally robbed. The movies also works because it is a nice blend of thriller comedy on the rare occasion and also complete and utter tragedy. Its a movie bound to please the critics and come Awards time will hopefully reap the benefits. A well crafted and a beautifully acted movie that I now absolutely adore.The story of The Last King of Scotland follows medical graduate Nicholas Garrigan. He has just qualified medschool and is already sick and tired of his home country Scotland. So on a spur of the moment thought he decides to go off to the first country his finger lands on when he spins the globe he doesn't like the sound of Canda so when he tries again he lands on a place called Uganda. On arrival in Uganda the recent government has been overthrown by Idi Amin and his soldier. He fights for the people and so everyone is rejoicing that Amin has risen to power and that he promises new opportunities for Uganda. Nicholas first works in a small medical facility helping the sick of Uganda however after a chance meeting with Idi Amin he is soon whisked off to Amin's place and is turned into Amin's personal physician. Amin likes Nicholas' straightforwardness and Nicholas likes Amin's personality. However after a brief period of time as the pair get along fine the cracks in their relationship start to show. Amin is hiding things up and he seems desperate to keep hold of power. Nicholas meanwhile is being asked to become more than a personal physician and becomes more of an adviser than anything else. As time wears on and Nicholas is no longer allowed to leave Uganda he realises that he has to get home by any means possible. So then the performances of this movie obviously they are the movies greatest success. First off is of Forrest Whittaker as Idi Amin. Perhaps what I found most intriguing about the character is the fact that for a large majority of the movie I couldn't help but actually like him. He's such a friendly larger than life character that you can't help but smile at some of the things that he says. And yet when the man changed he really did change scenes where he screams at Nicholas become quickly terrifying as you really do not know whether Amin will hug him or pull out a gun and shoot him in the head. Forrest Whittaker delivers and absolutely amazing performance his seductive fun loving side in the beginning is pulled off superbly. The nice bit of humour is very welcoming yet its his amazingly powerful scenes later when he goes towards the nasty side that really do stick in the mind. He should win an Oscar for this role and this is really one of the best performances in years. The other main cast member and one that really does deserve almost as much praise is James McAvoy. He's better known as Mr Tumnus from Narnia however here he really does become much of a serious actor. Here he is absolutely brilliant of course he is always overshadowed by Amin but in the scenes where he is on his own he really does shine through. At least enough to hopefully earn him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting actor.Overall this movie is absolutely wonderful it gets the highest rating with the slightest of ease but its the impact of this movie that really will last on longest. Its a movie that needs to gets the Oscars it so richly deserves and I really do want to see this again as quickly as possible. An early front runner for Best Movie of 2007!".

He should win an Oscar for this role and this is really one of the best performances in years. The other main cast member and one that really does deserve almost as much praise is James McAvoy. He's better known as Mr Tumnus from Narnia however here he really does become much of a serious actor. Here he is absolutely brilliant of course he is always overshadowed by Amin but in the scenes where he is on his own he really does shine through. At least enough to hopefully earn him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting actor.Overall this movie is absolutely wonderful it gets the highest rating with the slightest of ease but its the impact of this movie that really will last on longest. Its a movie that needs to gets the Oscars it so richly deserves and I really do want to see this again as quickly as possible. An early front runner for Best Movie of 2007!";

In the book however he looks at a far more colourful figure Field Marshall Idi Amin Dada VC DSO MC etc president for life of Uganda from the point of view of a young Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan who is plucked from a remote mission hospital to be Amin's personal physician and adviser.There is some factual basis for this in that Amin did at one time have a Scottish doctor and he also had as a close adviser a former British army officer Bob Astle who Foden interviewed living in retirement in Wimbledon but essentially we are looking at fiction based on the premise what would it have been like to have been a young impressionable rather feckless and sexually adventurous doctor working for Idi Amin.At first being at Amin's court is a pretty heady experience for young Nicholas who as played by the elfin James McAvoy with early 70s long hair seems to be a teenager. Beguiled by Amin's hearty manner and flattered by his attention it's almost too late before Nicholas sees the dark side. He is reckless enough to sleep with one of Amin's wives not realizing that Amins's spooks are onto him. The climax during the Entebbe hostage crisis is bloody and gripping.Forrest Whittaker had a difficult job playing Amin because Amin was given so much air time by the media when he was in power he is a very familiar figure. Yet Forrest gives us the core of the man bluff hearty childlike and hence really scary as Nicholas observes given to rages absolutely ruthless and as time rolls on increasingly paranoid. It's a wonderful performance and has to be a strong Oscar contender though perhaps not the certainty Phillip S Hoffman was for Capote last year. James McAvoy's extremely youthful looks don't help but he manages to develop his character so that the feckless youth does seem to develop into a more thoughtful and responsible person. There were also several good minor performances such as Kay Washington as Kay Amin Abby Mukiibi as Masanga Amin's taciturn security chief and especially Simon McBurney as Stone the British spook who sees Nicholas as a readymade British agent. Unfortunately Nicholas is Scottish and does not take kindly to Stone's superior English manner.Kevin Campbell the director is best known for his documentaries particularly his mountaineering saga Touching the Void. Here he filmed in Uganda which helps authenticity but he has also produced an interesting story. Amin is superficially charming but thrust into power he becomes a monster. Nicholas can't initially resist the charm but comes to realize he's dead if he doesn't. Nicholas is not the nicest of young men but in the end we don't want to see him as a victim.Uganda has had a rocky time since Amin was deposed the old monster died in exile in Saudi Arabia in 2003 but despite AIDS and a nasty insurgency now has some semblance of law and order and modest economic growth. Hopefully it will never have another Amin who came close to destroying his country despite his entertaining manner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forest Whitaker's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck. Historical fiction does not justify changing history. The absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by James McAvoy. To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible lazy and stupid. Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED. The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. It doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny irresponsible arrogant white boy he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops.Let me declare I do not like James McAvoy. I'm not sure what it is about him but I thought his Mr. Tumnus in Narnia was creepy and pervy. I think that Kerry Washington would never look twice at him so I can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like Amin would risk and lose her life for him. I don't believe him as a Doctor and I just don't see the appeal. His character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just...there's that word again...absurd. Think about it you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy.Gillian Anderson looks incredible and sounds more British than most Brits. Whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance and highlighted with his incomprehensible preOscar speeches just how much he was acting. It's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist.".

	schema:reviewBody "The newly qualified Dr Nicholas Garrigan travels to Uganda to take up a post with a village mission. He arrives just after a coup puts Idi Amin in power of the country. During a visit by Amim to the village Garrigan captures the President's attention by tending to a small injury to his hand and showing himself decisive and strongwilled. It is not long before the young Garrigan finds himself appointed as physician to the President and ensconced as one of his closest advisors. However the initial charm shown by Amin gives way to a darker violent streak as Garrigan finds the superficial stability of the country and its leader is nothing of the sort.Famous now for the performance that will deservedly win an Oscar in a few weeks time this film actually doesn't have Amin as the main character despite him being the draw and the title character. Instead we actually spend a lot of time with Garrigan his experiences and his problems. Of course I understand why this was the way because Garrigan is out narrative device  a composite character who acts as our way into the inner circle of Amin and allows the audience to experience him as outsiders as well. This works well in doing this but it does also introduce problems or at least one problem. This is the fact that as the story goes on we find ourselves more and more focused on Garrigan who doesn't actually exist rather than Amin or Uganda who did and does exist respectively. I found this a bit irritating as it got worse because I had come to the film for Amin  as I suspect many will have done.Even with this though the film still works well and makes for an engaging piece. Macdonald's direction is good and his moving camera does give it the air of a documentary while still very much being a drama. Of course the thing that makes the film work is the central performance from Whitaker. The character of Amin allows him to play to his strengths and he delivers a convincingly unhinged turn constantly menacing but also managing to have a childlike sense of fun at times and a terrifying tendency towards ruthlessness and violence. I have said before he was brilliant in The Shield making the whole season his own and he is equally brilliant here. Alongside this it is no surprise that McAvoy is a bit weak by comparison. His character is not so convincing a side effect of being a composite and some of the narrative turns ask a lot of him  he is still good and it is not his fault that he is in Whitaker's shadow. Washington has a small role but was pretty good in it even if her presence made me wonder why they felt they had to cast an American actress likewise Anderson but I assume that they helped get funding so fair enough. McBurney is a bit too slimy and sinister and I wasn't sure what the film was trying to say. Audiences may also recognise Oyelowo from his recent highprofile roles in HBO's Five Days and BBC's controversial Shoot The Messenger.Overall then not a perfect film but a pretty good one. The use of Garrigan is good at getting us into the story but it is a weakness that we stick with him as the focus. The performances are roundly good but of course it is another terrific turn from Whitaker that makes every scene he is in worth seeing.".

The missionary's wife is a blond tressed and quite sumptuous Gillian Anderson  with a bang on British accent and demeanor. Unfortunately for him and fortunately for my fantasy life she hesitatingly demurs. At this point Idi Amin happens to be in the neighborhood and takes a fancy to our young Doctor completely ignoring Gillian which tells us right off the bat that the man's not normal for having the chutzpah to brazenly use Amin's pistol to kill a cow mortally wounded by Amin's limousine.Our young naive hedonist decides to take up Amin's offer to be his personal Doctor and soon finds himself up to his elbows in African Alligators namely your usual Dictatorial musical chairs.The character of the young Scot is pure fiction but in the Uganda of that day a quite likely one. He slowly realizes that his boss is a sociopath but he is also a prisoner knowing that to displease him is a tad risky. Still he is a headstrong youth and continues to confront Amin when he sees fit to. Then he steps over the edge and does something totally suicidal he sleeps with one of Amin's wives.The movie ends with the Entebbe hijacking of an Air France Plane full of Jews coming from Israel. Our hero uses the moment to escape  Uganda and certain death.Whittaker is great. Playing sociopaths is every actors dream as you get to be so mercurially evil and he milks it for all it's worth. But he's never over the top or campy or unbelievable. He plays Amin as the jolly genocidal maniac that he was and thank God keeps away from more than a nod at his being a Muslim. Whittaker will win the Oscar. I also predict that if they ever have a movie about Saddam Hussein that actor will also win an Oscar".

	schema:reviewBody "The twentieth century deserves to be remembered by future historians as the Age of the Dictator but despite the prominent role that dictators played in history they have not been much in evidence in the cinema. There have been many films about dictatorships but these have not always focused on the men who led those regimes. Pol Pot for example does not appear in The Killing Fields nor Galtieri in La Historia Oficial. Even Adolf Hitler is only a partial exception. Although he has been memorably impersonated on screen by a number of actors from Charlie Chaplin to Bruno Ganz films about him are less common than one might expect given that he is the man who has replaced the Devil as our supreme symbol of evil. George C Scott gave a fine impersonation of Mussolini but this was in a TV series not a film.The cinema's lack of interest in dictators is not entirely due to morality Hollywood has always been happy to make films about fictional villains or even reallife ones who did not also hold the position of Head of State. A large part of the reason is that many dictators exemplified what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil. The cold reserved General Franco bore little resemblance to the idea of the dictator as carpetchewing maniac. Augusto Pinochet was once described as having the appearance and demeanour of a suburban bank manager. Leonid Brezhnev ruled the world's largest country for nearly two decades  a period later described as The Age of Stagnation but was rarely seen either in Russia or the West as anything more than a soulless bureaucrat.There was however nothing banal about Idi Amin who fascinated the Western media during his time in power. He was noted for his eccentricities such as awarding himself the Victoria Cross and the media treated him as a licensed buffoon which obscured the horrendous nature of his crimes. It has been estimated that during his time in power some 300000 people were murdered one hundred times the death toll attributed to his contemporary Pinochet who at the time was far more widely reviled.The protagonist of this film I advisedly do not use the word hero is Nicholas Garrigan a young Scottish doctor who inspired more by desire for adventure than by idealism takes a position working in a medical mission in Uganda. The alternative working as a family GP in his father's practice does not appeal to him. A chance meeting with Amin leads to his being offered the post of personal physician to the President. The main reason for Amin's choice seems to be that Garrigan is a Scot the dictator had a fascination for all things Scottish including wearing a kilt and despite his Muslim religion drinking whisky. The title of the film derives from the fact that he even offered his services as King Idi I of Scotland an offer which the Scots for some reason declined.A strange friendship grows up between the doctor and the dictator and Garrigan soon finds that he is being treated as Amin's confidant and adviser as well as physician. As portrayed by James McAvoy Garrigan is in many ways an unattractive character flattered at being singled out for attention by a powerful man blinded by a credulous belief in Amin's good intentions and eager for the luxurious lifestyle which his position bestows upon him he turns a blind eye to the mounting evidence of the atrocities being committed by the regime. His only excuse is that he is young and naive. He is also a casual philanderer in the course of the film he seduces a Ugandan girl he meets on a bus Sarah the neglected wife of the mission director and incredibly Kay one of Amin's three wives. To cuckold one's employer is never a good career move to do it to a man as unpredictable as Amin is a positively bad one as Nicholas soon finds out.Apart from McAvoy there are also good performances from Gillian Anderson as Sarah David Oyewolo as the brave and principled Ugandan doctor Junju the one man in the film who can be described as a hero and from Simon McBurney as the callous and hypocritical British diplomat Nigel Stone. There is an implication which may be justified that the British Government initially supported Amin's seizure of power seeing him as more proWestern than his predecessor Milton Obote and then turned against him not because he was a tyrant but because he proved to be less malleable than they had hoped.The film however is dominated by Forest Whitaker who well deserves his Oscar nomination. I have been an admirer of his ever since The Crying Game a film I did not otherwise much care for and here he is superb as Amin. Whitaker avoids the mistake of trying to make his character purely evil. Amin initially enjoyed considerable support from Ugandans sickened by the corrupt regime of Obote the sort of Socialist who believed in the redistribution of wealth chiefly into his own bank account. The dictator we see in the early scenes is a great bear of a man shrewd jovial and with a good deal of personal charm and a welldeveloped if occasionally childish sense of humour. Whitaker's interpretation leaves open the possibility that Amin was a sincere man corrupted by the temptations of power and that Garrigan's naive trust was not altogether misplaced. It is precisely because Whitaker's Amin initially appears so affable that the raging halfmad figure we see at the end of the film is so frightening. An unpredictable man can be more dangerous than one who is predictably wicked. The film works well as a study of the politics of dictatorship and of the relationship between two very different men. 810".

	schema:headline " SpanishItalian version based on James Fenimore Cooper's The last of the Mohicans and filmed in Paella Western style";
	schema:reviewBody "European rendition based on James Fenimore Cooper's famous novel and  of course shot in Madrid surroundings such as Manzanares Del Real and Colmenar Viejo . This is a SpanishItalian coproduction with a varied cast formed by actors of diverse countries . The classic James Fenimore Cooper's novel is brought to screen in this Western adventure and in SpaghettiTortilla style . The picture takes several liberties and is partially inspired on the notorious novel . XVIII century  French and British army battle themselves to take North American and Canadian territory . There happens Indian wars between Hurons  Mohawk and settlers and army  while the tribes allied fight to each side . The story is about a dying tribe called the Mohicans in which only two are left  Uncas Daniel Martin who starred same role in the version directed by Harald Reinl and his father Chingachgook Jose Marco as well as one white man named Hawkeye Hawkeye's real name in the novel is Natty Bumppo being played by Luis Induni  a fur trader . They are set upon by French soldiers and their cohorts  Huron tribesmen led by the evil Cunning Fox who in original novel is called Magua . On their way they intercept Indians attacking a small regiment in command of captain Duncan Edward Jack Taylor  Jesus Franco's usual actor including the two daughters Sara Lezana as Cora and Barbara Loy as Alice of Colonel Munroe Paul Muller on their rout to fort Henry . The three men lead the survivors to the fort while love stories take place but the War continues . They fight to protect them against the raiding Huron Indians . On rout they are doublecrossed by Cunning Fox Jos Manuel Martn  Spaghetti's customary secondary player . Meantime the fort is besieged by a French Army and Indians allied  commanded by a General Pastor Serrador . There  subsequently takes a place a massacre carried out by traitor Hurons against Fort Henry soldiers .This is an exciting film  plenty action  thrills  fights  love and breathtaking outdoors . Acceptable action sequences in medium budget with rousing attacks and spectacular fights . Charismatic performance for all casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor  Luis Induni is good as Hawkeye and women protagonists  Sara Lezana  Barbara Loy  are wonderful . Special mention to Daniel Martin as honorable Unkas and Jose Manuel Martin as an appropriately villainous in a powerful performance . Look for secondary actors usual of Spaghetti Western as Jose Marco  Rufino Ingles  Jos Riesgo  Lorenzo Robledo  among others . And two Eurotrash actors  Jack Taylor and Paul Muller  both of whom Jesus Franco's habitual . Colorful cinematography by Carlo Carlini however being wornout and necessary a perfect remastering reflecting splendidly the sunny exteriors from Manzanares Del Real and Colmenar Viejo where in the 60s and 70s were shot hundreds SpaghettiChorizo Western . Evocative as well as atmospheric original musical score by Bruno Canfora and Angelo Francesco Lavagnino . The motion picture was professionally directed by Mateo Cano  though with no originality . Rating  5510 . Acceptable and passable . The picture was partially based on historical events . Although the Ft. William Henry massacre actually took place historical fact differs somewhat from historical fiction. A Col. Munro was in command at the fort and did indeed surrender to Montcalm when General Webb could not arrive in time to reinforce him. The attack by the Hurons after the surrender was directed at the colonial militia and its Indian allies. Munro and the British regulars were at the head of the column under the protection of French soldiers and did not know that the column had been attacked until they arrived at Ft. Edward. James Fenimore Cooper based his novel on reports from survivors of the attack. The British used the attack to stir up the colonials to join in the fight against the French. In all versions of the movie except this one Munro survives and is saved by Hawkeye. Munroe survived in real life as well.Other retelling about this classic story The last of the Mohicans are the followings  1922  mute adaptation by Maurice Tourneur and Clarence Brown with Wallace Beery as Magua  the classic 1936 by George B Seitz with Randolph Scott as Hawkeye  Spaghetti rendition 1965 by Harald Reinl with Joachim Fuchsberger  Karin Dor  Daniel Martn  Anthony Steffen  Carl Lange . And TV series titled Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans 1957 by Sam Newfield with John Hart and Lon Chaney along with 1985 TV movie by James L. Conway with Steve Forrest and Ned Romero . Of course  the best rendition was directed by Michael Mann 1992 with Daniel Day Lewis Madeleine Stowe  Jodhi May and Wes Studi as Maua.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just TWO 2 stars as an average rating?? OK I think I know what's going on here. The people who have actually seen this incredibly obscure movie  registered a ratings vote are most likely devotees of the source material and were understandably disappointed. I think I read James Fenimore Cooper's LAST OF THE MOHICANS when I was about 11 and skipped to the action scenes. Which once you get down to it is what the Italians have done here. Gone are any sense of character development exposition plot nuances etc. Of the film's 400 or so lines of dialog maybe 100 of them are directly from Cooper's novel and most of those delivered by Paul Muller as an implacable British commander of a frontier outpost during the French and Indian War. He always gets the good lines because he was an actual actor.But you see an even vaguely faithful adaptation of the book was not the point of this production which is actually an early era Spaghetti Western with guys dressed up as Mohicans or 18th century soldiers instead of cowboys  Pistoleros. It's a potboiler entertainment intended to wile away rainy Saturday afternoons for 10  14 year old boys and their fathers rather than a stirring rendition of classic literature. The costumes and weaponry are likely inaccurate the military traditions on display far from historically adept and yes the Italian and Spanish supporting actors made up with boot polish to portray a Native American fighting force look ridiculous. Bugs Bunny had more credibility when he tunneled into Napoleon's castle and started playing boogiewoogie on the harpsichord while wearing a hoop dress though the French are correctly portrayed as foppishly effete even when firing cannons at people.So fans and history buffs looking for a detailed visage of LAST OF THE MOHICANS and its fascinating events would be well served to look elsewhere which is why Michael Mann made his version in 1992. There you go see ya later. But for students of B grade European genre cinema this will prove a indispensable study in the kitsch entertainment the Italians always seemed to do best. Euro Horror gods Jack Taylor  Paul Muller headline the cast of Redcoats with Barbara Loy and Sara Lezana providing the eye candy women who become the focus of the plot since Italian genre cinema always ends up being about sex. Daniel Martn and Jos Marco ham it up as the local friendly Injun guides who help to escort them through the hostile Spanish wilderness substituting for 18th century New England at least I am assuming the film was made in Spain It looks like Andaluca at any rate under the expert guide of Hawkeye played by familiar genre actor Luis Induni who looks like he wandered onto the set from a cocktail party. And Jos Manuel Martn gets to act appropriately noble  savage as the great Huron Chief Cunning Fox who wears a wristwatch in one scene unless my eyes deceived me.I know that Cunning Fox is a great Huron Chief because the script made a point to mention that a few times to dutifully remind viewers like myself that could care less just who the different players are  what is motivating their actions. To tell the truth the whole LAST OF THE MOHICANS thing is just a series of reference points by which audience members can navigate the film's action which is impressive at times. There are pitched battles galore various people get tied up to trees and threatened while awaiting last minute salvation and of course Jack Taylor is a much better Indian fighter than the Indians themselves. Which makes sense once you think about it because if his character was not a better Indian fighter than the Indians they would have killed him early on and the movie would be over.A special note must be made of the direction by Mateo Cano who's stylistic approach has as much in common with Sergio Leone as an episode of MORK  MINDY does. It's interesting to see an Italian genre film made before the style factor which made Spaghetti Westerns so distinctive. The direction and camera work are artlessly straightforward and the musical score by Bruno Canfora and the usually brilliant Angelo Francesco Lavagnino is more evocative of a 1960s Italian horror film  which is indeed the case as some of Lavagnino's themes from CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD are replayed albeit at a different tempo. They even reused the fort set from Amando de Ossorio's Three From Colorado and probably the same mishmash Injun brave costumes previously seen in Jose Elorietta's FURY OF THE APACHES Both films made at about the same time as this one and just as adorably square once you get down to it. I love it when they play this stuff straight it sort of heightens the absurdity of the proceedings.After 1966 Italian made Westerns became selfconsciously arty filled with the glib humor hip asides and hypnotic atmospherics that made the derivative plotting wooden acting familiar landscapes  identical architecture less of an issue. This one earns points for being novel as far as Spaghetti Cinema though it's service to Mr. Cooper's novel is minimal. After watching it I'm not really any more compelled to read the book again though I could sure go for another Spaghetti Western.510 since the film is immune to conventional criticism. Look for a gloriously widescreened Greek subtitled version the color is magnificent even if the aspect ratio isn't quite right.".

The direction and camera work are artlessly straightforward and the musical score by Bruno Canfora and the usually brilliant Angelo Francesco Lavagnino is more evocative of a 1960s Italian horror film  which is indeed the case as some of Lavagnino's themes from CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD are replayed albeit at a different tempo. They even reused the fort set from Amando de Ossorio's Three From Colorado and probably the same mishmash Injun brave costumes previously seen in Jose Elorietta's FURY OF THE APACHES Both films made at about the same time as this one and just as adorably square once you get down to it. I love it when they play this stuff straight it sort of heightens the absurdity of the proceedings.After 1966 Italian made Westerns became selfconsciously arty filled with the glib humor hip asides and hypnotic atmospherics that made the derivative plotting wooden acting familiar landscapes  identical architecture less of an issue. This one earns points for being novel as far as Spaghetti Cinema though it's service to Mr. Cooper's novel is minimal. After watching it I'm not really any more compelled to read the book again though I could sure go for another Spaghetti Western.510 since the film is immune to conventional criticism. Look for a gloriously widescreened Greek subtitled version the color is magnificent even if the aspect ratio isn't quite right.";

The production values are nonexistent the corny dubbing is in that Italian horror movie vein from the 1960's whereby some ridiculous 'dubbers' overexaggerate and ruin any sense of tension or urgency in the script.The direction is routinely pedestrian and no impression of any type of artistry is even attempted. What you have is nothing more than a dull production without life.

One of the women complains about the cold and then they are swimming in water and the whole time it looks like a hot summer day!The Fort is a miniature model filmed from the front from far away with a cannon shooting at it to emphasize that it is real size but it is so obviously small.The Hurons and other Northeast American Indian Tribes are portrayed by skinny ugly Spaniards and they are dressed in what seems to me Southwest Indian garb. Even the settlers use 1840 wagon trains and have forts that are Midwest in feel. The Northeast American Indian Tribes have tepees and are just plainly misrepresented.To speak of any type of acting is to speak of a falsification since most of the people in here are horrible in their interaction.

One example is a group of French troops attacking Fort William and then they retreat complete with white head dress for wounds. It seems they had time to put them on in front of the heavy gunfire from the Fort.There's also some weak scenes of the canoes and American Indian Tribes paddling in the water trying their best to catch up with the escaping English who are only a few feet away.Some might find the hilarity of such a production or the comical aspects of it others will want to stick their head in a bucket of cold ice water.I would have liked to have seen the producers watching the finished product to catch their reaction did they really think they had a decent film?

For his violent actions the night before the school board offers him to be principal at Brandel High School. The other board members just cringe at the name.  Rick doesn't take the offer lightly but he has no choice.  Once he gets to the school he discovers that the school seems more like a prison than a school.  He quickly learns that Brandel is actually the end of the line for kids who have been kicked out of all the other good schools in the district.  Rick is p at the condition of the school and calls an assembly.  At the assembly Rick announces that he will enforce a new and painfully simple rule of No More. Rick saysThis means no more skipping class dealing drugs or whatever the hell it is you've been majoring in here No More! He is able to enforce this rule by forming a mediocre security team with the help of a janitor Louis Gossett Jr. to help bring back order to the school.  However this does not look good in the eyes of Victor a drug dealer who has set up in the school.  He begins making threats to Rick telling to get out of the school while he still has a chance.James Belushi is what makes this movie worth watching.  He's made this movie what it is.  He cracks a few occasional jokes and does this well.  I think The Principal started the whole teacher vs. inner city school generation of films.  Similar films like Dangerous Minds 1995 The Substitute 1996 187 1997 and High School High 1996 but The Principal I think is the one that started it all.

But with only Security guard Jake Phillips Louis Gossett Jr as an ally and the thuggish school kingpin Victor Duncan Michael Wright after his blood Latimer will do well to just survive the first week.The formula of such movies like The Principal is now seen as old hat post the release of Christopher Cain's movie you can trace a line from Lean On Me in 1989 to The Substitute 1996 and on to One Eight Seven the following year. Prior to The Principal the topic is a bit more thin on the ground we can probably laud the excellent Blackboard Jungle from 1955 while 1984 saw Mark L. Lester tap into the video nasty zeitgeist of the early 80s with his trashy Classs Of 1984. So plenty of film's and similar types like Stand And Deliver from which to choose should you require a night in with a teacher intent on straightening out those ruffians whilst ensuring the good kids get the education they deserve. So why choose The Principal then?Well James Belushi's fans don't need much convincing here an always likable star who knows the limits of his talents the film gives him the chance to mix serious drama with his comedy bent. This played out with immeasurable cool too. Latimer is one bad ass teacher he drinks hard plays hard whirls his baseball bat and rides a motorcycle. He's no Dolph Lungdren Detention or a Tom Berrenger The Substitute but Belushi can carry off the tough side of Latimer whilst showing his fallibility's via little comedy moments as he wonders just what the hell he is doing here. Belushi is admirably supported by Gossett Jr a believable tough security guard if ever there was one while a lot of the film's strength is drawn from the developing relationship between the two men. Of the rest of the cast it's Michael Wright who stands out as head thug Victor. Already at the time of release a cult actor thanks to his turn in The Wanderers Wright is supremely cool and terrifying into the bargain. When he shouts I expel you you start to pack your bags that is unless you are Principal Latimer of course.As ever with a film of this type there are complaints that it's full of stereotypes but were they in 1987? Director Cain is for sure not addressing the then fledgling problems of education and crime amongst AfricanAmerican and Latino school kids. But he is not shying away from the issue either. That the most unsavoury point in the film sees a white youth perpetrate crime on a black teacher tends to get over looked by snarky PC critics. Make no bones about it tho this is more macho than the rest again this is something that has upset many a critic who prefers the reach out to the kids approach in something like Morgan Freeman's excellent but tonally different Lean On Me. Oh yes sir this is taking a different tack but I for one appreciate having a different angle from which to view such subject matter. Some hooligans can be saved by reaching out to them but lets not kid ourselves that some of them don't need more than just a telling off from The Principal. Yes the film is also very 80s none more so than with the soundtrack where we get a mix of the bad some American Heartbeat sounding fluffer and the great Strafe's pulse rocking Set It Off. Not setting out to win awards or moralise about an ongoing problem The Principal goes for a tough and gritty approach for this semester. Amen to that sir. 810".

Despite having lost some of its shock value over time the movie has retained its suspense. The style is unmistakably Eighties I think in an endearing way and James Belushi's charisma and drama chops carry the story which occasionally gets silly also endearingly. The plot is delivered in a compelling way and evenly divides it focus between character development and the central conflict. By today's standards the exaggeration and melodrama would probably lead most to dismiss The Principal as stupid. Although I partially appreciate it in the way it was intended a lot of what makes the movie entertaining is how easily it can be laughed at.".

Also of course Cheryl Ladd did well as Grace Kelly. Some stars have been so one of a kind though that one would be hard pressed to imagine  who would be up to the task. John Wayne is one such figure. While James Belushi may not quite have the physical stature of the Duke his performance in The Principal comes the closest in my impression to reminding me of the cut the crap individualism of the screen legend. Public schools  could probably learn a lot from this feature.Of the many comedians of early Saturday Night Live who have gone on to movies Belushi appears to be the one who has most successfully transcended the comedian stereotype. While Bill Murrey may do well as a comic role being serious the few pictures I've seen James Belushi in suggest that he's more like a serious actor who's also funny.Good feature for those of us who are tired of irresponsible youth getting a free pass.".

Echo and it seems to drive the line between those who want to try and those who want to hurt.This movie is not a typical 80's but is a drama in away and a action flick in a way but it keeps you watching. The Principal may be a bit beyond what goes on in inner city or ghetto schools but most movies do that in other situations too. It showed how a principal who is a true leader can enlist others who also care to stand up to bullies and inspire his student body to work towards an education. It also portrayed others whom one might think were troublemakers because of the environment forced on them to be good kids. This is definitely one of Jim Belushi's best performances in his filmography history.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

Nasty Rrated fighting and violence are sprinkled throughout and the whole thing is engrossing even with Belushi's Captain Kirk beer gut often getting in the way. One incredible and truly exhilarating sequence has Belushi riding his chopper into the school in pursuit of a thug about to rape the delectable Rae Dawn Chong. Another terrific sequence has Belushi trapping some thugs in the school library eventually sending one of them sailing through a second story window to the school grounds below. The big finale set in a darkened locker room is suspenseful and not your ordinary finish. It would appear this cheese lovers' delight influenced the one and only THE SUBSTITUTE which came out about five years later. It will help if you are a Belushi fan to truly enjoy THE PRINCIPAL.

After beating the hell out of the mans' car with a baseball bat his superiors decide to reward him with a principal gig. The catch is that the gig is at the city's most crime ridden inner city high school. Now Latimer may have his faults but being a more or less good guy he's incensed at what he sees and decides that he's going to clean up the school no matter what. Offering some assistance is the schools' head of security Jake Phillips Louis Gossett Jr.. Rick takes special interest in students such as young mother Treena Kelly Jo Minter and the sincere Arturo Jacob Vargas who's only now learning to read. Meanwhile the biggest piece of criminal scum at the place Victor Duncan Michael Wright tries to scare off Rick but Rick won't have any of it and the stage will be set for a final showdown at some point. The Principal does score high marks for good intentions even as it recalls earlier films such as The Blackboard Jungle and Class of 1984 other films in this genre of course include Stand and Deliver Lean On Me and Dangerous Minds. It's reasonably absorbing and tells a decent story which was written by Frank Deese a real life teacher who also plays a small role in the movie. What makes it work as well as it does are the variety of entertaining characters both likable and unlikable. Belushi is in fine form and does seem to be improvising at some points. Gossett Jr. is solid as a rock and the sexy Rae Dawn Chong has the role of impassioned teacher Hilary Orozco. Wright is completely convincing as the antagonist largely because he mostly underplays the part. Playing other students are Esai Morales as the poetic Raymi Rojas J.J. Cohen as scuzzy white creep White Zac and the engaging Troy Winbush as Baby Emile the gang member who has a change of heart. Director Christopher Cain also creates some very effective suspense in the ultimate confrontation between principal and criminal. Best of all while there is some serious subject matter in the material Cain and company never get heavy handed in the attempt to create some sort of message movie and mix the exploitative ingredients with the serious ones to make an entertaining package in general. By the end you can't help but cheer the principal on. Seven out of 10.".

Many people have probably not seen this movie but it brings a satisfactory chemistry between both Belushi and Gossett Jr. in which they fight off punk teen gangs at their school. The concept is pretty different from any other movies involving the main character as a principal. It really isn't a comedy which you normally see from James Belushi but that doesn't make it bad.

Many people have probably not seen this movie but it brings a satisfactory chemistry between both Belushi and Gossett Jr. in which they fight off punk teen gangs at their school. The concept is pretty different from any other movies involving the main character as a principal. It really isn't a comedy which you normally see from James Belushi but that doesn't make it bad. Give it a try you might like it.710";

I even wanted to behave like Rick or Jake! I also wanted to speak like in the ghetto you know. Now seriously this is a fairly entertaining BFlick. The plot is simple easy to follow and overall interesting. James Belushi is hired to straighten some lower class trash students. Most of them insult threaten and even kick the hell out of the principal. But he won't give up with his badass attitude. He fights against the most dangerous gang from high school and teaches them the basics to respect. James Belushi delivers a kickass performance as Rick Latimer. The man is hardcore. But Louis Gossett Jr. steals the show as the tough Jake Phillips the janitor and overall school vigilante. I love the scene where he says that he won't fight against Victor because when that day comes one of them will die! Rae Dawn Chong also is fine in her role and looks very sexy. I didn't like the scene where one of the gang members tries to rape her. She seemed very uncomfortable with that scene. Michael Wright is truly one creepy tough guy. He's mean imposes fear and kicks some serious asses.Watch The Principal a quality Bmovie from the 80's. It has the elements to make you enjoy it if you are into fighting sequences and badass characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "The basic story was told and much more effectively I might add  perhaps because it was based on real people and events a couple of years later in Lean On Me. This movie is a fictional account of roughly the same chain of events  a teacher gets assigned as principal to an inner city school that's become a haven for gangs and drugdealing and he sets himself to the task of cleaning it up. Perhaps because it's not based in reality at times The Principal comes across as a bit too extreme and at times it even seems a bit silly to be honest. Some of the characters  especially Miss Orozco Rae Dawn Chong also seem to be a bit of a puzzle. I'll explain my confusion over her later.I will say that James Belushi did well with this part. He played Rick Latimer  the down and out teacher who gets assigned to Brandel High School because there's no one else to go there and basically the Board of Education is throwing him away. That's the reality of Branden. Neither the students nor the teachers have anywhere to go. That by the way is my confusion over Miss Orozco. Why was she there? She seemed to be a pretty good young teacher who clearly as the movie finally points out does have options. Her character seemed out of place because she didn't belong in that school the attack on her seemed out of place because it really didn't serve to push forward the main story her budding friendship romance  it wasn't really clear with Latimer seemed out of place. That's an aside mind you. Again  Belushi did well as Latimer. For a down and out teacher it seemed a bit strange that he would set himself to the hard work of trying to clean up the school but the characters in this admittedly aren't that believable.The story works though. It's a good story. It inevitably draws you in and gets you rooting for Latimer. It's all pretty clearcut in terms of good guys and bad guys. There are no real moral dilemmas to confront you because everything is so clearcut. You just watch and you stay interested. You know there has to be a final confrontation coming between Latimer and Victor the drugdealing student who ruled the school until Latimer arrived and you basically wait for the final confrontation between the two. That final confrontation is for part of the time suspenseful but in the end it also turns rather silly. Latimer's my turn after Victor gives him a pretty good beating made me chuckle a bit.It's not a bad movie. It's too simple and straightforward and it has some extraneous material and some extraneous characters but it's not bad. Even enjoyable for the most part. 710".

But Latimer doesn't cave in and soon finds an ally in janitor Jake Phillips a tough performance by Lou Gossett Jr. The formulaic story which at times can get preachy seems to be fuelled by such topics as crime racism and talent untapped in what Belushi's strongminded character transforms as he might be in over his head however his got nothing to lose. He takes it on the chin and tries to build upon the foundation than letting it slide despite the scoffing and violence targeted at him. Director Christopher Cain does a polished job with his forward handling but never letting it loose focus on the raw and brutal side of things. Crisp but explosively high octane. Surprisingly it was more intense and actionoriented than I was expecting. The encounters involving Latimer and Victor coming to blows in what was a power tussle for control and dominance was always gripping in the scheme of things. Performances are wellguided with some other familiar faces in Rae Dawn Chong Esai Morales and Jacob Vargas. Also throughout we get some drowning 80s tunes spliced throughout to evoke spirit and grit.".

Indeed what seems so appealing about La Boum is its honesty about a girl who is trying to grow up in the 80s Paris her budding first love her relationship with friends and dealing with her parents' troubled marriage. Everyone wished they had grandmothers like Poupette!This was also a classic for us in my high school we would demand to see this film year after year. It's one of the fondest memories we have of our French class  both entertaining and educational what a great way to learn French!  and wellliked by both genders unlike the 80s teenage girl movies made in the U.S. There is something about this movie that compels one to watch it over and over again. 910.".

The first half of the movie is about Vic trying to convince her parents to let her attend her first boum home party with the help of her hilarious grandgrand mother. Of course Vic falls in love at the party and the second half of the movie focuses on the relationship.La Boum is a beautiful movie about adolescence with great comedy moments and fabulous actors. Any teenage girl or anyone who's into the 80s culture should see it. It also has a very parisian touch that I love. We see so many movies taking place in american high schools kids driving to school playing fields cheerleaders etc etc... La Boum shows the life in Paris as it really is for a change. This was the first role of Sophie Marceau later to be a James Bond villain.".

There was one slow song that kept playing throughout the entire film but at the moment I cannot recall the name of it. I give it a ten out of ten because it was funny shocking and even a smidge sad at points. Nowadays it would most definitely be rated PG13 at least because it does contain profanity and some sexual references. All of the foreign films shown to us in class were loved by all such as Jean De Florette and Manon De la Source which are both equally fabulous movies. I must say that I greatly enjoyed the lead female character's haircut. It really looked good on her.".

There are isolated scenes with crude doublemeaning crassly unsuitable for children. Viewing by preteens should be at parent's discretion! Otherwise this is a thoroughly enjoyable feel good movie.The love theme Reality by Richard Sanderson a 1 World Hit at the time is a beautiful song popping up throughout the story adding to the magic.

The scene of the parents huddling around the pay phone each not wanting to be the one to embarrass their child by showing up first is great.

The scene socializing a MacDonalds the fait un American dance the UCLA sweatshirt... I doubt they have much place in today's climate of freedome fries and economic technogoober globalization. You can watch this film thinking VicMathew is dreamy Boum  fun but I suggest after you're done rewind the tape and watch it again looking for the second layer of social observation that abound.

It became a bit of an injoke among a number of my classmates that would cause us to laugh a bit when recalling the theme song. It is essentially a teen comedy about a young girl's daily life and her first relationship. The movie also has a subplot about the main character's parents marriage falling apart but there is never addressed with serious depth. It seems to be tossed in there at the last minute to fill the time. An interesting minor character is the girl's Grandmother who encourages her romantic relations and is kind of a kindred spirit to her while her parents are having difficulties. It isn't a great movie by any means but it is fun and I think for many teenagers it is something to relate to. A girl is finding independence by attending to slightly more adult parties having a boyfriend and all of the emotions that go with it and dealing with parents. I think most recall the film with a touch of nostalgic fondness if it is first seen when one is a teenager. Definitely fluff but amusing French fluff.".

	schema:reviewBody "La boum is a French movie from 1980 so it will have its 40th anniversary soon already and it is a mix of all kinds of genres music comedy drama romance but most of all it is a comingofage movie. But we will get to the details of this 110minute film soon. First I would like to say that I really really appreciate the fact that films like this one or also the probably even more famous Belle de jour are shown again in theaters so many decades after their original release. It would be amazing if more classics could return to the big screen also especially for the big cinemas that usually only offer the new stuff. I guess the quantity of viewers there to watch this one here as well as Bdj show the demand is there.Now back to this one It is the story of a teenage girl who discovers love attraction and also sexuality and we get to be a part of it. Sadly things on the home front aren't looking too brilliant either for her as daddy cheats on mommy and these are more than busy taking care of themselves and their struggles. What's it she got? 13 years of age. Nice quote there. And I generally liked the film's approach in terms of realism. It never tries to fool us into thinking this was about true love even if the main character believes so. The final sceneshot is the perfect example. Yes the film does go over the top frequently like in terms of the old lady bringing sexual talk and comedy or the perhaps too frequent use of a certain song but it is always likable in doing so which makes it easier to look past that. Maybe the drama is not always working like the flight part or the way too big coincidence of him turning up in her hotel room but yeah well there is a certain charm to this movie that makes it easy to ignore the weaker moments. It did really feel what growing up in 1970's or 1980's France could have looked like in my opinion and I write this as somebody who wasn't even born when this film was written and directed by the late Claude Pinoteau probably his most known work. He also returned for the sequel two years later which shows you that this original film was quite a success here. Maybe I will check out the second film at some point too preferably at the very big screen as well. As for this one hear it reminded me a bit of a harmless version of the Lemon Popsicle at times from the girls' perspective obviously and harmless because the characters here are younger for sure. Only the cinema dick grabbing scene was probably on par with the famous Israeli film series. Overall I give The Party a thumbsup. It is worth seeing alone for the young Sophie Marceau in her very first performance already and looking at that one it is not surprising at all that she is still enjoying a successful and prolific career these days at the age of 50. Check her out. Her performance and the film and comedy feel pretty modern at times the story could also be from the 2010s. A good watch and I give it a thumbsup.".

The morals of this story are awful the storyline is at times erratic at others it just doesn't make any sense but overall I wanted to turn off the TV about 20 times before it finally ended. Marriage survives all difficulties men can fool around women can do something out of spite but they always come back to their man .I agree with vyto34 on IMDb that Brasseur is a most unfortunate choice for the dentist ... in that he looks more like a gangster than a dentist  family man and so on. Brigitte Fossey is miscast as the wife of Brasseur she's just too beautiful and intelligent for a man who seems to have no ability for anything. Pnlope's sister precocious little blonde Samanta fancying Franois Beretton is just one of the very stupid choices this film has. One of the few lovable characters is Denise Grey' Poupette the avantgarde harp playing greatgrandma ?? who has all the answers she is just stereotyped. Bernard Giraudeau is Lehman stud German lyce teacher does what he can with the cardboard plot he's given. He did the extremely funny Viens chez moi... with M. Blanc which proves he can star a brilliant comedy and also took part in Ridicule with Fanny Ardant. I mean some of the actors have done great movies in spite of this one . By the way in one of the most unbelievable scenes of this illogical movie he who is young and fit is being held up by 2 men until out of nowhere Mr. Beretton sends the 2 thieves away and later hits the teacher on his face without resistance. Another of the silliest scenes is the comeuppance of Mme. Beretton and her husband's lover and then Poupette finishes it. No sight of the police of course. Worse of all she did nothing her beloved husband didn't agree with. But those are the bourgeoise morals the harlot has to suffer financial loss but the pater familias is always welcome. The ending is particurarly devoid of meaning but maybe it wants to show how teenagers change of love like a tshirt.I found this film umbearable but have to accept it's very popular. Particularly with Americans who took French somewhere in their education. The electrical piano version of Dreams... slow music is particularly jarring veering on mental idiocy specially after being hammered on all through the film. Paris is nice thou but I guess no director can harm it !Watching a former Bond villain like Marceau as an early teenager with blossoming sexuality is not entirely a happy experience. Teen language and high school are interesting but the film doesn't let us focus even on those moderately interesting topics. Instead it forces us to watch the stupid parent's fights and predictable redemption of the male figure. The only funny scene was perhaps the botched sex scene with Mr. Beretton and his last lover. Maybe it's just outdated.Overall... avoid it.".

When her father goes to do some research but when a storm strikes the island he doesn't come back she gets worried and frightened. She then emails Alex Rover hoping that he will come but what she doesn't know is that Alex Rover is a woman who is agoraphobic and germaphobic. But her creation comes to life and eggs her to go. Unfortunately she has never gone anywhere before and is denied her necessities like her sanitary gel by the customs officer at the airport.

Most of the characters aren't well developed some are unnecessary and would have been better left out. While there are many plot holes there are some unnecessary and irritating especially the sequences with the caricature bad guy visitors in the island subplots. The entire film revolves around Nim being stranded on the island all by herself as her father is lost somewhere at sea and a 'borderline' agoraphobic Alexandra travelling to the island to rescue her. The climax is very disappointing. When one sees Nim and Alexandra meet for the first time something big is expected but nothing like that happens. I would have much preferred that the film focus on Nim and Alexandra's adventure in the island and their attempt to rescue Jack but there's nothing like that. Moreover the look of the film isn't that appealing. There are some nice glimpses of the island but the CGI is poor and use of green screen copy pasting is too obvious due to poor lighting. I liked the animal characters but only the adorable sea lion looked realistic. Abigail Breslin and Gerard Butler are okay but they are mostly let down by the shoddy screenplay. However Jodie Foster was amusing to watch. It's great to see her in a comedic performance and she carries off the eccentric Alex's 'borderline' agoraphobia and determination to save Nim with comic flair. It is her scenes that save 'Nim's Island' from being a total disaster. The film ends on a note that there might be a sequel. If there is well I hope it has much more to offer.".

Dad's main area of study is microorganisms so this is a perfect venue for his work in addition to being a kingdom where only the two of them rule. As Nim's mother died in an accident on the waters it is also a good place for them to shut out the rest of the world and heal their spirits. Nim's only close friends are her beloved animals a seal a seabird and a lizard. One day father wants to make a boat trek nearby to look for a new protozoa and for once Nim convinces him to let her remain alone on the island. It turns out to be a bad decision as father gets caught in a storm and can not return home at the appointed time. Nim appeals to an adventure writer named Alex Rover to come to the island and help look for her father the island does have computer technology! But unknown to Nim Alex is really Alexandra Jodie Foster and she is a shy agoraphobic who resides in San Francisco. Nevertheless due to the gravity of the situation Alex boards a plane and begins a journey to the island. Will she get there in time to save Nim and her father from destruction? On paper this is a certain winner for the basic premise of the movie is quite good and the undiscovered island setting is the stuff of dreams. Throw in the great threesome of Foster Breslin and Butler and one could hardly ask for more right? Unfortunately this is not the case and it is difficult to say why for the principal actors are quite good and the scenery is lovely. Also there is some sly humor as in the scene where a hula dancer is stopped in midwave to escape an exploding volcano! Perhaps it is the story's inconsistencies and the slapdash direction that are at fault for the scenes seem put together in a mozaic that doesn't quite fit. Then too Butler takes on two roles one as the father and one as the fictional alterego Alex Rover of Foster's books with mixed results. To sum it up the movie probably tries to do too many things and ends up lacking a real focus. However it is absolutely an acceptable film for families with enough adventure to please most age groups and a setting that is exotic and lovely beyond belief. Anyone searching for something new in the childfriendly category would find this one a good watch but not a great one alas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silly? Yes. Predictable? Yes. For Kids? Yes. Entertaining? Yes.....even for adults IF you don't take anything seriously and expect something a little dumb but charming.nonetheless. Picture yourself as a kid watching a movie and you'll enjoy it a lot more because it's definitely a children's film. It also has an involving story. Once it starts you have to stick around and see how it winds up. With some movies I could care less but this one I cared.For those who have kids age 512 this is highly recommended. For adults well it's not bad. If you're looking for clean entertainment you found it. It's not goodygoody either and it's not always a smart family movie a father leaving his kid all alone for several days? but it's a nice movie has funny animal characters a lead kid who is not a brat nice island scenery one bigname actress Jodie Foster and is a diversion for an hourandahalf.The little dragon Fred is the best of the nonhumans. I don't know if that's the real noise that lizard makes but it's fun to hear. Seals are always entertaining too. The one in this film is very talented. As for the humans Abigail Breslin as Nim Rusoe is a cute likable kid. Gerard Butler plays both male leads and does them well enough that you forget he's doing two characters. Seeing Foster do slapstick while being a female Mr. Monk was a little odd but I'm not going to knock her for trying.As another reviewer said here put yourself in a little kid's shoes and enjoy the film.".

Picture yourself as a kid watching a movie and you'll enjoy it a lot more because it's definitely a children's film. It also has an involving story. Once it starts you have to stick around and see how it winds up. With some movies I could care less but this one I cared.For those who have kids age 512 this is highly recommended. For adults well it's not bad. If you're looking for clean entertainment you found it.

	schema:reviewBody "Nim's Island is a tale about a young girl named Nim imagine that who lives with her single father on a remote island in the middle of the South Pacific. Because she has no friends or neighbors she spends her time playing with animals and indulging in the fantastic fantasies of her Alex Rover adventure novels. The stories of the Alex Rover novels are assumedly based on the adventures of the author Alexandra Rover. The reality is that Alexandra is an introvert hermit who spends her days writing her stories in her San Francisco apartment and talking aloud to the imaginary Alex Rover character. Alexandra and Nim come into contact through email and Nim reveals that her father who is a scientist is lost at sea. After much debating Alexandra gets up enough courage to finally leave her apartment and travel to visit Nim. Once on the island the girls quickly develop a special bond. With the help of the imaginary story hero Alex Rover they step into a world of fun and adventure where the line separating fantasy and real life vanishes and dreams become realities I know that last line was really corny but whatever.The predominant aspect that enticed me to see the film was the awesome cast. You have academy award winner Jodie Foster as Alexandra Rover Abegail Breslinwho you may remember from Little Miss Sunshineplaying Nim and the star of 300 Gerard Butler playing dual roles as the father and as the imaginary Alex Rover. And yes ladies he does have his shirt off in this film.Despite the big names the cast seemed to lack the necessary chemistry. I thought Butler did an awesome job with both of his roles but his relationship with his daughter is far from believable. And Jodie Foster who happens to be one of my favorite actresses just seems really out of place in this film. Kind of like Subway's Jared eating at Quiznos. Breslin was fine as Nim but she spends half the movie talking to lizards and a giant seal. That might seem cute to some viewers but in my opinion she probably needs a psychiatrist or possibly an exorcist. I would also like to add that someone needs to teach that girl proper running form. Many scenes feature Nim running through the woods or down the beach and every time I watched her run I just started to laugh. With her arms flailing about she looked like Pinocchio running around high on amphetamines or something.I did really enjoy all the fantasy elements of the film but I think a movie that mixes fantasy with reality works best when the fantasy aspects provide a sharp contrast to reality. In Nim's Island the normal lives they live are unrealistic which causes the fantasy elements to lose their effect. I mean who in the right mind moves to a remote island with a ten year old? And how in the world did they get wireless internet service? I can't even get service in my own basement and they have perfect connection on an island in the middle of no where.Maybe my expectations are too high. Maybe I am too old to appreciate a children's film. Nim's Island is after all a kid's movie in the purest sense. There are plenty of corny jokes cute animals and moments that will probably touch your soul unless of course you are Satan. I had high hopes for this film because I honestly enjoy quite a few kids' movies. Who here doesn't like Hook? Or The Sandlot? Or Angels in the Outfield? Nim's Island unfortunately did not measure up. Sure I laughed a few times and smiled innocently at some of the scenes but about half way through the movie Iwellto be perfectly honest I fell sound asleep. I think I dreamt about unicorns but I don't really remember.".

Honestly Nim's Island is a good family film decent enough for a watch but I'm a little disappointed with what I was expecting. Just I think the ideas are a little beyond out there and I don't think this is the type of film that is going to keep a lot of kid's attention. It's just not memorable it has it's cute moments here and there now Abigail Breslin pulls in a decent enough performance to make the film watchable but again like her last film Definitely Maybe it seems like she's getting the star's bug which worries me because she has so much potential and her performances she doesn't seem to care too much since her Oscar nomination. But it's Jodie Foster's performance that majorly disappointed me it was too forced and made the story more ridicules that what it already was.Nim is a little girl who lives on an island with her dad who is an adventurer. Now they have not told anyone where they are and their living place good idea if they need help right? Well her dad goes on a research assignment and gets hit by a nasty storm stranding him in the middle of no where. When Nim gets an EMail from famous author Alex Rover who she thinks is a real life hero Alex wants answers about volcano's for her next book but Nim wants help since she's alone on the island and her dad hasn't returned. Alex has one problem she's agoraphobic but gets the strength to go on an adventure and help Nim out with the help of her famous character Alex Rover to get through this Indiana Jones ordeal.Nim's Island is a cute movie I would never ever say in a million years that this is a bad movie because it is worth a look. Just I would recommend that you wait for the rental this is not the Horton Hears a Who of the year it's a movie that is forgettable unfortunately it just needed more help with the script and the actors needed to bring it a little more down to Earth since the story is supposed to be fairy tale like you'll see what I mean if you see this movie. But like I said wait for the rental it's a nice family film but isn't the best movie of Spring 2008.510".

The story was totally predictable woman writer overcomes her agoraphobia and rescues the little girl in distress single father becomes enamored with the lady at the end there is the obligatory collection of animals and one fart joke for the child audience the father finds exactly the plankton he has been looking for the pouty little girl has a change of heart and helps out the lady at the end and so on. It looked as if the story was intended to be humorous but it wasn't especially the treadmill scene which by unfortunate coincidence was the same gag used in an animated trailer before this movie began which destroyed the novelty. The acting was horribly unrealistic everywhere the overly enthusiastic kid the overly wonderful father the overly phobic writer. The intro and ending scenes with the cheap cardboard cutouts with CGI scenery were ugly weird and perplexing that all comes across as a moneysaving device looking like the filmmakers were too cheap to film a real woman on a real boat to tell the background history. Too much of the film was so farfetched that through all the girl's falls her pet lizard would never get squashed that nobody would wonder how lizards could fly fifty feet through the air to land on the beach how a volcano could start erupting but then conveniently stop in time for the family gettogether at the end why an antenna underwater would be accompanied by gurgling audio sounds why the sailor father would not realize a storm was hitting as soon as it started to rain why they wouldn't have storm shutters on their house that a woman in modern times would be swallowed by a whale that a pelican could carry an entire loaded tool belt for miles across the ocean and so on. The CGI turtle underwater looked fake as did the three CGI circling sharks. The excessive political correctness most people won't notice where this occurred and I'm not going to enlighten you was appalling to me as well. And what's with the girl eating a plate of live worms? An island like that would have plentiful fish within easy reach so that intentional grossout meal was ridiculously unrealistic especially that the worms were uncooked and still squirming. And why didn't the filmmakers take the trouble to do a ghostly fadeout of the presence of the adventurer who kept talking to the author in her imagination instead of having him swim off in order to get him out of the scene? That seemed to show additional laziness or cheapness on the filmmakers' part. I was annoyed with this film from the very start I kept wondering why I wasn't enjoying it and I kept telling myself it had to get better or more interesting but it never did.What makes this all so surprising is that all the backgrounds and themes should have been great the wonderful setting on a tropical island a paradisiacal hideaway on the island the oceanographer mother and father the perfect childhood with several exotic pets and no school pirates nice decor with coral and hanging shells and so on. To take such an appealing foundation and still ruin the movie takes some real skill. Awful!".

A modern child wouldn't say coming mother it'd be more like an angry snap coming moooom! And the animal scenes were also somewhat cheesy but looking past that  Aside from that it was a lovely inspiring movie as I am also an agoraphobic writer. Not quote as bad as Jodie Foster's character though I have other obstacles. My characters also talk to me  So the scenes between Alex the author and Alex the character were funny and delightful to watch.I see quite a few have trashed this movie saying a 10 year old girl would not be so strong insightful and intelligent. This usually would be the case but here Nim has been brought up on fresh food grown or caught on the Island so it's all organic No junk food microwave dinners preservative laden chemical crap which affects the brains of children and adults so it stands to reason that Nim's brain and muscles would be more active than an average child her age as she has not been poisoned on over processed rubbish food and sugars and not brainwashed by the subliminal programming of television now does she sit all day at the TV or playing computer games. A bit of time on the net yes but not hours and hours on end.It was a delight to see a child so insightful and intelligent but also a child needing someone to be there for her when things went awry.Jodie Foster's character was also awesome in the trip she made from being boxed up in her home with bottles and bottles of hand sanitizers and tins of processed tomato soup to brave swimming in the ocean and eating live island food. And in the end it didn't matter her whole life turned around for the better. Alex the writer came alive and when the Alex character left her a real man came into her life  Who looked just like her sexy dashing hero and somewhat of an adventurer himself  I'm guessing life on the island just got a little more interesting. All three characters went through challenges and came out wiser and stronger in the end. Life is all about learning adjusting growing and breaking free.This movie is about all four.Sail to Nim's Island. Of course you'll have to do it in your mind and as it is a metaphor for growing and breaking free from whatever holds you back in your own life and sail the seas of your own subconscious and be amazed at the wisdom you find there. The ocean is a metaphor for the unconscious mind. Think about that ".

	schema:reviewBody "Did you ever see those annoying popup online ads about looking up old highschool friends? Did you ever stop to think that this movie is probably responsible? Really there could be no other impetus for people to want to revisit the horrors of young adulthood then this sterling advertisement for reaching back and reclaiming the best of your past.Ben Stiller is a sadeyed magazine writer named Ted who never got over the girl of his high school dreams Mary who vanished from his life after a single date in which getting horizontal meant being carted away in an ambulance. Ted has seedy detective Pat Healy Matt Dillon investigate a lead in Miami. Healy finds her and reports back that she's a walrus in a wheelchair. Ted thinks maybe he should check up on her anyway to see if he can be helpful to her but Healy explains she's now en route to Japan as a mailorder bride.Ted What are they desperate! She's a whale.Healy It's a sumo culture. They pay by the pound.Actually Healy is not being entirely truthful. Mary is single ambulatory and quite the fox in the form of Cameron Diaz. By the time Ted learns the truth Healy's already putting on the moves on Mary with the help of a fake identity and a pair of gargantuan dentures. To counter this without himself being exposed as a stalker' Ted has to reintroduce himself under similarly false pretenses. Will Mary go for this old nearflame? And what will happen when she learns the truth?A winning romantic comedy with gutbusting boundarybreaking bathroom humor and a sly sense of what makes people tick There's Something About Mary' is impossibly optimistic and reassuring even as it buries your head in the gutter for cheap laughs. That's probably what redeems it and makes it such a joy to watch over and over again the fact that this protoAmerican Pie' has a real heart. The makers of the film Peter and Bobby Farrelly reveal in their DVD commentary that Ted's reaction to Healy's news of Mary's condition is the key to making the film work and they are right.Frankly I could live in a world without American Pie' and so many other stupid raunchfests of its ilk but Mary' is pure gold all the way through. Not only is the comedy saved by virtue of its brilliance I never heard a theater laugh so hard all the way through as I did seeing this in a stuffy Greenwich CT cinema it's also a very cleverly puttogether film with a lot of plot twists that hold up as well as the humor during repeat viewings. It's interesting to read people's comments and see them say that it would have been a good film if they had held off on the badtaste stuff. That was kind of what put it on the map in the first place the hair gel' scene and Magda's breasts and Ted's zipper problems but I see what they mean. You almost could make this film into a Hallmark romantic film with minimal comedy of any kind and it would still be interesting. I don't think I'd watch it 23 times like I have this version however. The film never stops upping the ante on the ickmeter a large part of what makes it brilliant.Diaz and Stiller blend very well together with special kudos to Diaz for being so utterly wonderful and charming in the title role. You understand what the title means without ever having it explained. Also terrific are the supporting players major ones like Matt Dillon and Chris Elliott as well as Harland Williams as the sixminute abs guy and of course Puffy the dog. Jonathan Richman and his drummer are especially valuable in their cameo bits that bookend the various acts in the movie with songs that manage to be as funny and affecting as the show they are built around. And the end credit sequence is the alltime best. I still smile when I hear Build Me Up Buttercup' on the radio don't you?".

Really there could be no other impetus for people to want to revisit the horrors of young adulthood then this sterling advertisement for reaching back and reclaiming the best of your past.Ben Stiller is a sadeyed magazine writer named Ted who never got over the girl of his high school dreams Mary who vanished from his life after a single date in which getting horizontal meant being carted away in an ambulance. Ted has seedy detective Pat Healy Matt Dillon investigate a lead in Miami. Healy finds her and reports back that she's a walrus in a wheelchair. Ted thinks maybe he should check up on her anyway to see if he can be helpful to her but Healy explains she's now en route to Japan as a mailorder bride.Ted What are they desperate! She's a whale.Healy It's a sumo culture. They pay by the pound.Actually Healy is not being entirely truthful. Mary is single ambulatory and quite the fox in the form of Cameron Diaz. By the time Ted learns the truth Healy's already putting on the moves on Mary with the help of a fake identity and a pair of gargantuan dentures. To counter this without himself being exposed as a stalker' Ted has to reintroduce himself under similarly false pretenses. Will Mary go for this old nearflame? And what will happen when she learns the truth?A winning romantic comedy with gutbusting boundarybreaking bathroom humor and a sly sense of what makes people tick There's Something About Mary' is impossibly optimistic and reassuring even as it buries your head in the gutter for cheap laughs. That's probably what redeems it and makes it such a joy to watch over and over again the fact that this protoAmerican Pie' has a real heart. The makers of the film Peter and Bobby Farrelly reveal in their DVD commentary that Ted's reaction to Healy's news of Mary's condition is the key to making the film work and they are right.Frankly I could live in a world without American Pie' and so many other stupid raunchfests of its ilk but Mary' is pure gold all the way through. Not only is the comedy saved by virtue of its brilliance I never heard a theater laugh so hard all the way through as I did seeing this in a stuffy Greenwich CT cinema it's also a very cleverly puttogether film with a lot of plot twists that hold up as well as the humor during repeat viewings. It's interesting to read people's comments and see them say that it would have been a good film if they had held off on the badtaste stuff. That was kind of what put it on the map in the first place the hair gel' scene and Magda's breasts and Ted's zipper problems but I see what they mean. You almost could make this film into a Hallmark romantic film with minimal comedy of any kind and it would still be interesting. I don't think I'd watch it 23 times like I have this version however. The film never stops upping the ante on the ickmeter a large part of what makes it brilliant.Diaz and Stiller blend very well together with special kudos to Diaz for being so utterly wonderful and charming in the title role. You understand what the title means without ever having it explained. Also terrific are the supporting players major ones like Matt Dillon and Chris Elliott as well as Harland Williams as the sixminute abs guy and of course Puffy the dog. Jonathan Richman and his drummer are especially valuable in their cameo bits that bookend the various acts in the movie with songs that manage to be as funny and affecting as the show they are built around. And the end credit sequence is the alltime best. I still smile when I hear Build Me Up Buttercup' on the radio don't you?";

First the movie is funny with its many gags that just keeps on coming a Farrelly Bros. tradition. They might not be in everyone's taste but at least they aren't forced or out of place. Second the people seem real enough to be in the situations they brought themselves into kudos for the great acting though it could be better. Third Cameron Diaz is adorable beautiful and a marvel to look at. Plus she got the job carrying the whole movie and she accomplished that ever so gracefully. You just can't help but fall in love with her too along with every guy in the film.This is a very good romantic comedy by the Farrelly Bros.. Just like in Dumb and Dumber or King Pin the brothers have made a comedy that has just the right amount of everything. Excellent job!!".

It set the new standards for comedy and also became a much imitated movie. Movies however very rarely reached the level of this movie ever again including all of the Farrelly brothers own later work.It's the sort of raunchy comedy that makes some completely inappropriate jokes and makes for instance fun of both psychically and mentally handicapped people among many other things. This is the foremost reason why some people can't really stand this movie but luckily most others are able to see the talent and effort that were put into making this movie and why the movie works out so well.As strange as it sounds it's actually a real subtle done comedy. It's not predictable in any way and the build up and execution of it is spot on. It even makes all of the moments that usually seem like something totally lame and forced work out as something hilarious.It also has a great yet very simple premise of a bunch of guys all falling for the same girl. It's the sort of story that provides the movie with plenty of silly comical moments in which the characters lie and constantly are backstabbing each other all to get the girl in the end.Cameron Diaz forms the perfect centerpiece for this movie and the movie is filled with plenty of comical characters all played by some capable genre actors. This movie is still from the time when it was cool to like Ben Stiller and yes he also really is perfect in his role. But basically everyone is perfectly cast in this which is obviously also a reason why the movie and all of its comedy works out so well.Comedies like this only seem to come once every 10 years or so.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This is by far the best of all their movies. There are three kinds of comedy. Comedies that make you smile Sixteen Candles comedies that make you laugh Airplane and comedies that cause you to nearly asphyxiate yourself from laughing so hard. This is one of those rare third category movies. With the friends I watched it with the laughs sounded like nuclear bombs going off in my room. It's that funny.Thirteen years ago Ted Ben Stiller landed a prom date with the most popular and beautiful girl in school Mary Cameron Diaz. Unfortunately the date wasn't meant to be for Ted has his manhood damaged right in front of Mary and ends up in the hospital instead of the prom.Thirteen years later Ted decides to track Mary down and have a second chance with his dream girl. He hires sleazy private eye Pat Matt Dillonto find her for him. Pat finds her and she's grown up beautiful. Pat decides he wants to date her. He stalks her finds out everything she wants in a man and poses as just that. Meanwhile Ted has been led to believe that Mary has become fat white trash in a wheelchair. Pat and Mary start dating.Well by the end of the movie every man who is involved in the story has tried to make a move on Mary. We all know how it ends but it's one funny ride. One thing about this movie that's commendable is how the mentally retarded character is treated. He is treated in a way that isn't rude or offensive. Mary sticks up for him and he's really innocent. The funniest gag in the movie involves a NEW brand of HAIR GEL compliments of Ted and tested by Mary. I won't tell you what's really being mistaken for hair gel but when you find out you'll laugh so hard you gag. This movie knows what a comedy of this type should be like. Each gag goes somewhere and is really big. They're usually extended scenes with punchlines. Me Myself and Irene goes for the cheapest laughs you can find but There's Something About Mary takes it's time carefully planning each gag in order to make it gutbustingly hilarious. That's just what this movie is. 1010.It is rated R for Strong Comic Sexual Content and Language. Sex 810 Violence 310 Swearing 910 Drugs 210".

	schema:reviewBody "There's Something About Mary is an apt title for there is something about this movie that is quite endearing particularly if you are a grossout fan. Even if you are not a real fan of grossouts as is the case with me you can still enjoy this film. This is because I find it to be funnier and more enjoyable than most other grossout comedies and that includes Team America. As a romantic comedy it is also enjoyable and that is saying something as romantic comedy is to me a bastardised version of real comedy often with a weak romance and diluted laughs. This is certainly not the case here. Having said that it is not perfect The Farrelly Brothers use a retard for cheap laughs once too often which I did not like the disabled guy wasn't that funny and the plot is a bit clichd and predictable but I expected that. The story is about a man named Ted who we see meet a beautiful girl Mary during his teenage years. However their budding romance falls away when Ted gets his dick caught in his zipper. By the way this scene is absolutely hilarious and so is the aftermath after the police officer tells him to 'pull it out' next minute he is being carted off in an ambulance never to see Mary again...or so we think for a minute.Until of course he finds himself fantasising about Mary years later. He hires a private investigator Pat Healy to do some snooping on her. This takes a turn for the worse as the investigator falls in love with Mary and lies to Ted. Ted finds out about his deceiving ways thanks to Woogy and goes to see Mary himself.This movie is hilarious at times funny at others occasionally it falls flat. There are too many hilarious and funny scenes to mention here so I'll mention the best ones the 'dick zipper' one the 'fishing line' one and the one where the retard goes psycho and hits Pat Healy in the face. To be impartial I will say that I have already mentioned some of the imperfect bits above. The acting is quite good too. Ben Stiller does a good job as the nervy fantasising sensible Ted while Matt Dillon is good as the 'sleazy investigator'. Cameron Diaz in the days when she was still hot is OK but not much more than your typical love interest. The rest of the cast is nothing more than OK including W. Earl Brown the guy who plays the retard as anyone could play his role.I'll finish by saying that this is one of the best grossoutromantic comedies I've ever seen and is definitely worth a Friday night or a DVD rental. There is a good chance that you'll be laughing like I did throughout the movie. To clinch this review I will say thatThere's Something About Mary!45 stars".

There is no doubt that the humour in this film is of the lowest possible calibre but it really works think Dumb  Dumber but only quite good.

Instead it gets just a few laughs. The film relies too much on the 5 main set piece gags and the time between them is wasted on dull jokes and not very amusing physical comedy. It looks bright enough with the usual colourful framing but it leaves you wanting more.The actors try very hard to dish out the humour but it leads them nowhere. And lee evans is just so cringeworthy doing an american accent so bad you just wanna turn it off right there and then. But yes the set pieces are funny rib ticklingly funny. It's just a shame there is so much dead air in this one.".

You have to put up with some padding here and there I don't recommend the longer version unless you are already love the movie. And you have to turn a blind eye to political correctness it has none though not like Borat which feeds off it more just incidentally.Ben Stiller is great in his own way lovable and dull at the same time which is the idea. The other supporting male actors are comic regulars and not my favorites but they do what this kind of movie needs them to do. Even Bret Favre is as stiff on camera and as beefy as a quarterback is supposed to be.But there is naturally something about Cameron Diaz that clicks with audiencesher cute perky charm most of all. That fact that all these guys like her for her looks is not the most enlightened approach to love is it? But then this isn't a high brow movie or one with scruples in particular. It's a pretty clumsy movie in many ways just a series of gags that sometimes are just too funny for words. Sometimes being more often than a lot of other comedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not having seen There's Something About Mary since its theatrical release I sat down to watch the DVD version fearing that as often happens in the second viewing of romanticscrewball comedies it would not be as funny as I remembered and that I would be sadly disappointed. Happily it was and I wasn't. Although it lacks the satirical bite and philosophical reach of Harold and Maude the cult '70s romantic comedy to which There's Something About Mary traces its roots and pays repeated homage this Farrelly brothers effort shares the earlier film's genrebending spirit shockingly iconoclastic images and sharply written dialog  not to mention its sidesplitting hilarity.At least a half dozen scenes in There's Something About Mary still rank among the funniest I've ever encountered on film and set me off once again into uncontrollable laugh convulsions even minus the stimulus of a roaring theater audience around me. The list must naturally begin with the prom night frank and beans in the zipper scene. Even more than the outrageousness of the central physical source of humor what makes the scene work so spectacularly well is its pacing and the facial reactions of the various characters who enter the bathroom to observe Ted's embarrassed agony. One thing I had forgotten about the scene or didn't notice the first time around was how much it owes to the classic Marx Brothers' stateroom scene in A Night at the Opera. In fact I was rather surprised while listening to the Farrelly brothers' alternate soundtrack commentary that they did not mention a Marx Brothers influence either specifically on this scene or on their brand of comedy in general.The film's other humorous highpoints if that's the right word certainly include the three dog sequences Puffy in a sedative comaPuffy on speedPuffy in a body cast the hitchhiker sequence and its followup interrogation at police headquarters the infamous hair gel scene and old flame Woogie's sexual assault on Mary's closet. That these are not the sorts of subjects we feel entirely comfortable having jokes based on is precisely what makes them work so well  when they work for us at all that is. Operating on the edges of moral and social taboo the Farrelly brothers deliberately risk offense and invite charges of bad taste. Not surprisingly therefore almost everyone will respond to some attempts at humor in There's Something About Mary with more discomfort than elation. In addition some comic bits in the film don't work simply because they were ill conceived or poorly acted the leaden entry and presence of Brett Favre in the film's final scene being one such instance in my view and the whole pizza delivery boy character being another.For the most part though things click together in There's Something About Mary with a magical charm that few American screwball comedies have ever achieved. Much of the credit for that success must be attributed not only to the clever script but to the wonderful castingacting of Ben Stiller as the lovable schlemiel Ted Stroehmann Cameron Diaz as the luminous dream girl Mary and Matt Dillon as the goofy gumshoe and romantic rival Pat Healy. Chris Elliott as the stressed out fetishiststalker Woogie and Lin Shave as Mary's Maudelike neighbor Magda also add greatly to the film's comic chemistry  as does the film's musical score which cleverly uses the Mel Brooks device of giving background musicians an on screen presence and concludes with a full cast encore lipsyncing to Build Me Up Buttercup as the end credits roll and outtakes flash by. A unique comic gem.".

No it was just plain UNFUNNY and so bad that I truly question what modern comedymaking has come to. Look at Scary Movie as well.....yet another modern movie that's supposed to be funny but is one of the worst alleged 'comedies' I have ever seen.If you wanna see a good example of a comedy that manages to actually use sexual jokes and crudity on a TRULY FUNNY level go see Ford Fairlane.If you wanna see good examples of movies that can be BOTH 'gross' and actually can be called gross AND funny  go see Dead Alive Army of Darkness or Evil Dead III am embarrassed on behalf of the people who made this movie and I will from now on stay away from anything they make.

	schema:reviewBody "Through 'Mahanagar' the great Satyajit Ray tells a story of an ordinary traditional family living in the modern big city hence the title. However the breadwinner of the family does not earn enough money to support the whole family. The wife decides to support him by working herself. Fortunately she finds a job and befriends a modern AngloIndian coworker who does influence her by applying lipstick and giving her a pair of sunglasses. The father of the family is a retired teacher and he does not accept the fact that his daughterinlaw is working. Gradually the rest of the family disapprove her working. The retired teacher visits his former student and 'asks' for financial help.Through this wonderful family drama Ray tells us a story of the clash between modern and traditional values in a middleclass family struggling to make a living in the big city. Furthermore Ray examines the 'urban' relationships as is reflected between the employer and employee the husband and wife the coworkers the working mother and her child and so on. It is no surprise that Ray is THE most accomplished director of Indian cinema. This film like pretty much everything else he did only reminds us why.The performances are topnotch. Again this is no surprise as Ray manages to extract the best from his actors. Madhabi Mukherjee is breathtaking as we see her transform from a naive housewife to a determined and excited employee to a strong courageous woman who stands up for her friend. Anil Chatterjee is excellent as the struggling husband who tries to make ends meet silently accepts his wife's working but secretly resenting it. Vicky Redwood adds freshness with a strong presence and a likable performance. Haradhan Bannerjee is very good as the prejudiced but sympathetic boss. Jaya Bhadhuri delivers a very natural performance. The rest of the cast are all just as competent.The ending isn't the traditional happy ending one witnesses in the numerous Indian films but it's one of optimism and hope that beautifully 'seals' the film. 'Mahanagar' is a fantastic example of the best of Indian cinema. A classic gem it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arati is a young middleclass housewife. The household includes Arati her husband Subrata who works as a bank clerk their children and his elderly parents. Subrata is unable to support the entire family with his salary and after a great deal of indecision the couple decide that Arati must find a job. And she does so much to the displeasure of his parents who react with shame and anger when they find out that their daughter inlaw has turned from a housewife into a working woman against tradition.The story follows Arati's acclimation with her job as a sales woman her growing independence and her new relationships with people from different social and financial classes one example being a young AngloIndian colleague named Edith whom she befriends. The real conflict however does not happen when Arati's inlaws start a silent cold war but when her husband himself loses his own job and Arati becomes the sole breadwinner of the family. Subrata loses selfrespect and is filled with negative feelings of inferiority and shame.This is the story of Satyajit Ray's extraordinary classic 'Mahanagar' a poignant quiet and moving picture which depicts a whole world of conflicts resulting from modernisation and changing social and generational norms. Ray's portrayal of the urban India its lifestyle and people is brilliantly done. Everything about the film is as expected very authentic very real and very easily identifiable with Ray's style of filmmaking. He makes the proceedings and the characters very interesting and very easy to relate to.The film deals with the struggle of middleclass families to survive in the big city through their everyday hardships but in the process shows the gender role conflicts and criticises the hypocrisy of traditional conservativeness. One such instance is shown when Arati's fatherinlaw a retired teacher who had complained that he was in need of a new pair of spectacles now prefers going and begging from his former student rather than accepting money from his working daughterinlaw who 'breaks tradition'.The relationships in Mahanagar are perfectly portrayed whether it's Arati's relationship with her husband with her kid with her inlaws with her employer. But the best thing about it is the portrayal of Arati's acquaintance with her new self. Her job provides her with confidence and selfbelief as she grows increasingly independent both socially and economically. Mainly due to her friendship with the AngloIndian Edith who she would later stand up for Arati learns to use lipsticks wear dark fashionable glasses speak more assertively and stand up against injustice while still maintaining her individuality as a simple unselfish woman. Madhabi Mukherjee is astonishing as Arati. She is a natural beauty and acts with grace and dignity. She convincingly transforms from a simple housewife into a modern and smart woman of substance always letting the viewer sense her struggle confusion and pain. Anil Chatterjee is great as the slightly embittered yet loving husband. Jaya Bhaduri is completely lovable and charming in her debut role. Prasenjit Sarkar is cute as a button as Pintu. Vicky Redwood is quite nice though her line delivery is often weak. Haradhan Bannerjee is very sympathetic as Arati's boss though his character is slightly prejudiced.Mahanagar is another example of Ray's indelible craftsmanship of his superb storytelling and his exceptional ability to tell a universal story which is both moving and educative in a simple yet very effective way. The film's pace may be a bit slow but it is steady enough and the picture remains thoroughly and consistently engaging and captivating. The ending is bittersweet  sad yet optimistic satisfying and inspiring. Mahanagar is overall a beautiful social drama a classic and fascinating piece which is highly recommended.".

The movie shows the emotional crisis of a family caught between family tradition and increasing expenses. The husbandwife relationship starts unraveling under the stress of brand new corporate identity and financial comfort the wife discovers. Its interesting how the other family members come to terms and make peace with the changed dynamics when they see their own gratification with the higher salary. Ray has done an exceptional job in uplifting the role of the Indian wife and depicting an almost perfect superwoman character  rising to the occasion and being the pillar of support at home and at work. Throughout these changes in lifestyle she continues to rely upon her husband for moral support. The ending is well scripted  in their current dire situation the couple finds mutual confidence and solace to continue the struggle and dream.".

Or perhaps the two films can corule as they compliment each other so nicely. Pather Panchali is the simple straightforward masterpiece and Mahanagar is the more ambitious and complex work. The first is Ray's La Strada and the second his La Dolce Vita.The Big City is a subtle flowing work about a young housewife Madhabi Mukherjee who would also star in Ray's Charulata in a middleclass family who finds a job when her fatherinlaw needs a new pair of spectacles. The family is very conservative and this upsets everyone. Her husband's manhood is somewhat insulted her father and motherinlaw who both live with the married couple in a rather small apartment feel that it's just not right and her son thinks he's been forgotten. The only one who supports her is her younger sisterinlaw she sees her as a role model. The husband Anil Chatterjee tries to get her to quit but when he loses his own job he changes his mind quickly. Now she becomes the breadwinner and he is effectively castrated.This could have been a little humble film like many of Ray's works. But here he decides to examine a huge portion of his own culture setting up many opposites and studying them closely. We have the husband and wife man and woman oldworld conservatism and newworld progression young and old employer and employee. The list goes on. The depth of this film is nearly endless and I'm sure it would hold up to any number of repeated viewings. The only flaw that I can see is a somewhat contrived climax  Ray had this problem in a few of his films.I do have to give special praise to the two leads. Mukherjee and Chatterjee are just brilliant in the film. The supporting cast is also uniformly excellent.".

Mahanagar is a fascinating dramatic case study of the collision of modernism and traditionalism that produced a sociocultural dualitydichotomy in twentiethcentury India's urban landscapes.We see all sorts of manifestations of duality in Mahanagar. The tensioncumrivalry of Arati and Subrata is of course the most obvious manifestation. However we also have the duality of the new generation AratiSubrata and the oldgeneration SarojiniPriyogopal Subrata's mother and father and Arati who wears traditional clothing and speaks Bengali versus Edith the Englishspeaking AngloIndian in Western dress. These instances of duality speak directly to the moment in which things began to make a 180degree shift in India when women became the breadwinners of the household and traditional gender norms became subsumed by sexual liberation.With a leading lady as precise as Mukherjee Ray was able wrap these complex coterminous processes up in a relatively tidy package. Mahanagar is essential viewing.".

My first Ray film was Charulata which was once screened in our college film club. It too had Madhabi Mukherjee playing the title character 'The lonely wife'.After having finished watching Mahanagar I felt that the lonely house wife I had seen earlier had achieved a sense of fulfillment..a sense of completion.The entire film is a microcosm of an typical urbane family of the 1960's Calcutta. The legendary city of Calcutta in the 1960's has been impressionistically captured with all its charm as well as confusion.We can see some of the best wellscripted realistic emotional sequences. An young Jayabhaduri too appears as the little sister of Mr. MazumdarThe main character's husband. Madhabi Mukherjee again dons a intense character and proves her brilliance in acting.Now I have become impatient enough to watch Ray's Calcutta Trilogy and other films too.It is very difficult to get good prints of most of them. Ray had based this film on Abataranika a Bengali short story. All the actors have been handpickedespecially Anil Chatterjee and Haren Chatterjeewho played the role of Mr. Mazumdar and his father.The film was wellreceived at the 14th Berlin Festival and Ray won a Silver Bear for direction. Even though it was rejected at the Oscars it received an All India merit certificate at the National awards that year.".

The position of women the biased views of the older generation helpless conditions of banks and offices find a perfect blend in the movie. Bhombal supports his parents sister wife and children and works a clerk in a bank. Wife Arati understands their present day situation and decides employ herself as a sales girl. No one in the family her in laws her father Bhombal and even her son liked her position though they had to completely rely on her after Bhombal lost his job. In her work she met an EuroIndian girl Edith with whom she made friends. Eventually Edith got sacked from her job due to false charges and Arati who protested against it resigned. The films ends with a wonderful scene Bhombal and Arati walking amongst thousands of people in the streets of Kolkata searching for a job. I personally liked a lot the last dialog of the movie Bhombal said 'You did nothing wrong resigning you protested against corruption.. who dare does such a thing in such circumstances? Don't lose hope Arati won't any one of us find a job in such a vast city?.....' Personally I liked very much the screenplay of Anil Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee. The movie is overall a dedicated sophisticated work of Satyajit Ray.".

No one seems to be acting  and nearly 40 years after it was made the way Ray has gone about women's issues in this movie is sure to keep researchers and academicians busy for quite some time to come.In an era when working women in Calcutta and perhaps many other places in the world sometimes invited snide implications of inadequate income against their husbands a very naive and unsure Arati grapples with her first job but is also excited by it. Her inlaws living in the same cramped house however look askance at their son her husband for letting her work and try to scorn him by starting a silently emotional and undeclared cold war. Though the husband attempts to obtain an additional parttime job and convinces Arati to resign he suddenly loses his main job and manages to contact his wife just in time to stop her from submitting the resignation letter.There follows the inevitable feeling of worthlessness and depression for him  a man living off his wife's income but Subrata the husband goes through it all with dignity despite the occasional sarcasm and testiness.It is difficult to say who has performed the best  the husband the wife their children the husband's parents or the boss at the office. The tenderness and sensitivity portrayed amidst all the tension brings out the eternal humanist in Ray. Even the smug authoritarian boss who is gracious to Arati but is prejudiced against her colleague Edith warms up to Arati's recently unemployed husband reveals a weakness for their common home town and attempts to find him a job. Edith  who herself is struggling to make ends meet quietly strikes a friendship with small gestures towards Arati who later stands up for her friend against the boss with grave personal consequences. In spite of the movie having anything but a happy end the unmistakable and wonderful optimism that somehow breaks through at the end is infectious.This film brought forth a spontaneous standing ovation from a full house of 525 at the National Gallery of Art and considering the fact that to more than 70 per cent of the audience this was a foreign movie accessible only through the subtitles the universal appeal of this film was very obvious.".

Unlike Ray's earlier works which were centered either on the very poor or the very affluent The Big City deals with the life of an ordinary middle class Bengali family and spotlights the changing role of women in India during the 1960s. Based on a short story by Narendranath Mitra and set in Calcutta Subrata Mazumdar Anil Chatterjee is the sole breadwinner in his family but does not make enough to support his extended family that includes his wife Arati Madhabi Mukherjee their young son Pintu Prasenjit Sarkat sister Jaya Bhaduri father Haren Chatterjee and mother Sefalike Devi.Subrata's father is a retired school teacher whose pupils have gone on to considerable success as doctors lawyers and businessmen while he has slid further into poverty. When the aging patriarch is in need of new eyeglasses he turns to one of his former pupils to help him out. After Subrata casually mentions that a friend's wife has gone to work Arati gets the idea of supplementing the family's meager income by getting a job herself but this idea is looked on with disdain by the traditionallyminded family. A cold war prevails in the household as Arati takes a job selling sewing machines in affluent neighborhoods enrolling the woman of the house who is always at home.After several abortive attempts in which she backs off after hearing the sound of a guard dog Arati settles into her job and begins to thrive gaining increased selfconfidence and inner strength. Even young Pintu is mollified when his mother brings him home some toys after getting paid. Influenced by coworker Edith Vicky Redwood an AngloIndian Arati begins to wear lipstick and sunglasses and is more assertive with her boss Haradhan Bannerjee but her husband is resentful and complains that he doesn't know her anymore. Although Edith persuades her boss to grant the workers a commission on sales he seems to resent her Westernized manner and feels more comfortable with Arati whom he offers a promotion.Due to a run on the bank in which he is an employee Subrata is laid off and this causes additional stresses and strains in the family but their love for each other transcends economics and allows Arati to stand up to her boss on a matter of principle. The Big City is not as sweeping in scope or as indepth a character study as some of Ray's more wellknown films but it is an honest and compelling portrait of a young woman's discovery of herself with strong performances by Mr. Chatterjee and especially Ms. Mukherjee who would go on to star in one of Ray's most acclaimed films Charulata.".

MAHANAGAR is instantly notable for the beautiful cinematography and for remarkable performances from all  from start to finish the film has a flowing hypnotic gracefulness which compliments the story of a woman overcoming her and her family's apprehensions as she takes a job out of financial necessity only to discover her independence and emerge with a newfound sense of confidence. While perhaps intended as an examination of the changing role of women at least middle class women in Indian society after independence it's observations also have a global resonance  Ray's talent for highlighting specific pieces of Indian culture and society and using them to make great human insights that anyone would get is at it's peak here and this film prefigures a number of other similarly themed films to emerge globally through the 60s. I'm biased towards Ray but this is a flawless film very highly recommended.".

While perhaps intended as an examination of the changing role of women at least middle class women in Indian society after independence it's observations also have a global resonance  Ray's talent for highlighting specific pieces of Indian culture and society and using them to make great human insights that anyone would get is at it's peak here and this film prefigures a number of other similarly themed films to emerge globally through the 60s. I'm biased towards Ray but this is a flawless film very highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "How does Satyajit Ray manage to evoke such a set of complex emotions with such simplicity? Madhabi Mukherjee delivers a amazingly nuanced sensitive performance in this tale of personal empowerment. In an odd way the story of personal triumph reminds me a bit of American films in the 1930s when the hero struggled against odds and won this time its 1960's India at a time when women began to assert themselves simply because men failed to move with the times. I can just imagine a modern Hollywood remake of this film with sex situations aplenty lots of screaming and perhaps a stabbing or two! This worthy film about a struggling family attempting to maintain tradition in the face of modernity is subtle and if you stick with it involving. That said this two different DVD versions I could find were hard to stick with the subtitles often did not match the picture were often poorly translated and the print itself like so many Satyajit Ray films available in the U.S. looks like an old television print grainy and too often dark missing the subtle shades that typify his work. Whoever is in charge of this important film legacy needs to get on the stick and provide the clarity Ray deserves. Invest in the future of this important world filmmaker!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I discuss the merits of this film I must make a comment about the captioning on the English language version DVD. It's pretty bad. Occasionally conversations are entirely omitted from the captions. Other times the grammar is atrocious. And some of the English language conversation in India it's not usual to mix English and Hindi or Bengali was tough to follow due to the accents. I would REALLY love to see this film recaptionedand since it's considered a classic it's way overdue.Satyajit Ray wrote and directed Mahanagar The Big Citya story about how a changing social structure is affecting one particular family. It seems that the husband just isn't making enough money at his bank job to take care of all the bills. Plus like most Indian households his parents also live with them. So his wife offers to go to workeven though traditionally women stay home and keep house. And as expected this causes problemsthough the family really has no choice. Despite the reality of the situation her inlaws make it tough for her and she has some difficulty balancing her home life with her job. But on the positive side her job is going greatshe is a great employee and she loves her job. But because of the pressure the husband's parents put on him the husband then pressures his wife to quit her job. That is until he loses his job. At this point he cannot ask her to quitthough it kills his sense of manhood having her working to support the family. Can all this be worked out or will the family be headed for a major crisis? Looking at this film as an American I really am not sure of the exact pressures on this family. I can only guess as a woman working out of the home in the mid1960s in the US was unusual and surely would have created some tension. But I liked that it seemed to give a window into their world workingclass worldsomething you rarely see in movies. The only ones I can think of like this off the top of my head are the films of Majid Majidi such as Children of Heaven and The Color of Paradise and the Neorealist films of Vittorio De Sica such as The Children Are Watching Us and Umberto Dfilms where the lives of ordinary people are explored and even celebrated. I personally love these sort of films as I like the nonpolished and nonHollywood look to the acting and stories themselves. And as a result of such a good quality film I am sure to try other films by Ray though they are indeed hard to find here in the States. Particularly good aspects of The Big City are the personal interactionsparticularly in the final scene with the husband and wifethis is great cinema.By the way one of the side stories I found particularly interesting. The attitudes of the boss towards his AngloIndian employee was a bit surprising to mea form of reverseracism following the British abandoning rule over India. I'd like to know more about thiswas this common and does it continue today? UPDATE I had a very nice email from PrinceBansal1982 explaining that the boss' actions towards the AngloIndian lady was for reasons I hadn't even realized. It was less about race but more about the lady's revealing clothing and aggressive manners that created this conflict between her and her traditional boss. Interesting....".

	schema:headline " Change takes place due to necessity !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Mahanagar' or 'The Big City' was perhaps one of the first occasions where Satyajit Ray explored contemporary society and his beloved Calcutta. His earlier films were mainly period pieces which involved themes of the transition from traditions to modernism like The Apu Trilogy or The Music Room. Interestingly even though 'The Big City' was a contemporary film it still has this aforementioned theme running through it in a different context and in a different time and place. The story based on a novel by Narendranath Mitra explores a family belonging to the lowermiddle class of the income divide in early 1960s Calcutta. The financial constraints that the family goes through renders the money earned by the sole breadwinner Subrata insufficient for survival and this financial inadequacy makes it necessary for Arati Subrata's wife to start a new life as a working woman to help out her family which subsequently leads to complications within the family. This film is extremely layered and complex but the characteristic gentle and graceful style of Ray's filmmaking adds an incomparable humanism to the film and makes the viewer helplessly feel for the characters and fall in love with the film as a whole.There is a whole array of themes being explored here but due to the beauty of the screenplay and the dialogues written by Ray everything flows effortlessly. Arati certainly can be used as a symbol of feminism but the way Ray uses this character is different from some other big feminist characters like the two leads in 'Thelma  Louise'or Nana in 'Vivre Sa Vie'. Arati is not working to show the men in her life that she is equally capable if not better than them. Satyajit Ray's film is in no way adversarial. Arati's reasons for working are completely rooted in the financial needs of her family but I think at a deeper level she also wants to eliminate all her shame and inhibitions for not receiving good education and prove to her own self that she is good enough. I think this is established in a beautiful scene set in the bathroom of her office when she stands in front of the mirror and looks at herself and her salary notes.Although this is majorly Arati's journey in her transition from being a housewife to a working woman but the film won't be complete without the other characters. The husband Subrata is not evil. We never see any dramatic and loud arguments between him and Arati. He does get engulfed gradually by a feeling of jealousy towards his wife and her success but under the circumstances that he finds himself in such a reaction is very understandable. He never shows anger the only signs of his light disapproval comes in the form of faint sarcasm and subtle taunts. But these reactions are attracted due to his own mental struggles as a result of his father's attitude towards him which makes him feel like a failure as a son and a provider. Aratis's inlaws are people who are products of their times. The motherinlaw remains subservient and accepts things without saying much. The fatherinlaw who used to be teacher is a lot more adversarial. He finds it difficult to adjust his beliefs and opinions with the changing society and considers himself to be a victim of social injustice as someone who remains poor while his students achieve success and he feels neglected by his son. But Ray still refuses to judge him and treats him with respect by understanding his helpless condition.Ray's screenplay beautifully juggles the prospects the telling the story and showcasing the emotional struggles of Arati and her family as well as making a social commentary on the financial status of the city in general. Ray explores the income gap existing within the city's population. This family is one of the innumerable families that have to deal with similar financial deficiencies in Calcutta and there are many Aratis and Subratas in the city which gets underlined by the last shot of the film. Conservatism and racism with its roots in conservative ideas and the friction caused when these ideas confront the new and fresh ideas of the changing social scene of India and Calcutta also gets explored deftly by Ray. This film is also a beautiful account of how the nature of a marriage changes with the changes in society. The chemistry between Subrata and Arati is brilliant. The love that they have for each other is undeniable. They go through a lot of struggles due to surrounding circumstancesbut in the end we see them reconcile in the most heartwrenching manner possible and the lost shot of the film underlines the feminist ideas which Ray explores in the film. Subrata wholeheatedly accepts Arati as a working woman and they walk together side by side on the Calcutta streets.There are plenty of beautiful subtleties in the film which are very expressive. The camera work and cinematic style is also remarkable. The first half of the film like Arati is majorly shot indoors. But once Arati gets her job we get beautiful shots of the Calcutta streets in the style of Cinma vrit.Madhabi Mukherjee as Arati puts in a spellbinding performance. She is compelling and graceful and flawlessly portrays every emotion and makes the character a real person. Anil Chatterjee is almost equally brilliant as Subrata. He also plays the character with subtlety and makes him believable.'The Big City' is one of many masterpieces which fill Satyajit Ray's filmography. It is one of those transcendental pieces of cinema that makes you love art as well as the artistes. It is very personal as well as completely universal. Its themes which ring true even today make it a must watch for every cinephile.".

Funny that I should use the word appear since appearances are one of the key motifs in the film. You don't pay attention to appearances says the husband Subrata somewhat chidingly to Arati and very soon after that the ironies of fate or should we say of reality kick in Arati has to find a job and the job she applies for seeks in the job advertisement in the paper an attractive looking woman and the truly tragic irony shows its face when Arati actually does begin to pay more attention to the way she looks the lipstick and sunglasses become in the hands of the master filmmaker containers of such jealousy that their handling in the film equals the handkerchief in Othello. And whereas Arati is a source of multifaceted jealousy to her husband her stunning beauty her wellpaying job his unemployment her social standing within the work community another motif of the film aside from appearances is in the act of seeing properly. In the beginning of the film there are several characters with glasses Subrata his sister Bani and Subrata's father Priyagopal has lost his and pouring over crosswords at night is wellnigh destroying all that is left of his eyesight. This is all physical but there is the figurative sense too Subrata during the film fails to see the solution that Arati go to work and earn money he fails to see the dire straits the bank he works in is in then he is blinded by jealousy and does not realize the stroke of luck Arati is for the family. His father is no different in his own way unable to fully realize that his son and daughterinlaw are in great financial difficulties partly because of him and his wife he wants to use money to gamble on crosswords he fails to see his son's worth and goes on to disgrace Subrata to Priyagopal's former students. Even Mr. Mukerjee is painted as someone who does not see further than his own nose and it is ultimately Arati who wakes him up assuming he does wake up Ray doesn't show. Arati is painted as impulsive by Mr. Mukerjee written without the 'h' in the Criterion booklet but at the same time she is the one who sees clearer than the rest and acts on that impulsively or not. He has the same surname as Madhabi Mukherjee by the way I think this is a marvellous construction on Ray's part and the way he weaves even cosmic importance from the everyday life is magical. But it wouldn't work if the characters weren't so rooted in their reality and interact so truly with each other. For example the banter between Arati and Subrata is not only hilarious it's real and so the characters become real people to us and thus we enter the film on a whole new level. My favourite moment is the phone conversation between Arati and Subrata where she asks what kind of questions they might as in the job interview. The expressions on both their faces especially on Arati's give such a simple joke a meaning that goes beyond what we see in the film. Their relationship reaches beyond the film and it really feels like they've always been married and we look into their lives for these two hours only after which they'll continue living on. Ray's films always exhibit the highest level of acting. No matter what the role the actors and actresses not only give their all but their performances are sculpted into poems by Ray. Madhabi Mukherjee is among the most inspiring actresses of the twentieth century and a legend on her own right. There are other fabled directoractress combinations in European cinema but the films they made together Ray and Mukherjee turned into art and art into magic. She lights up the screen whenever she's inframe and one thinks of her whenever she's not there. I hardly think anyone could ever ask for or achieve more than that.".

Ray's films always exhibit the highest level of acting. No matter what the role the actors and actresses not only give their all but their performances are sculpted into poems by Ray. Madhabi Mukherjee is among the most inspiring actresses of the twentieth century and a legend on her own right. There are other fabled directoractress combinations in European cinema but the films they made together Ray and Mukherjee turned into art and art into magic. She lights up the screen whenever she's inframe and one thinks of her whenever she's not there. I hardly think anyone could ever ask for or achieve more than that.";

With very few exceptions I have found the great Indian films to be a let down and the modern Bollywood film is just unbearable. This was however a treat and a great exploration of culture. The idea of women working and how that affects the esteem of their husbands is not unique to India but there are certain themes  the reaction of her fatherinlaw!  that are unlike what you might see in an American film.".

Still they can barely make ends meet so Arati decides to looking for a job with the hesitant acquiescence of Subrata. In the traditional and patriarchal universe no husband is willing to let his beautiful wife dabble into a business world unless it is absolutely necessary certainly Subrata's parents are strongly against the idea but under the circumstances it seems to be the only makeshift plan.Never been worked before Arati is thrusted into an eyeopening horizonwidening new world although his boss Himangshu Bannerjee is a smoothtalking businessman Arati discreetly brings about decorum in her daily canvassing work her targets are mainly uppermiddle class housewives and makes a good fist of it. Also she strikes a rapport with fellow salesgirls especially the AngloIndian Edith Redwood whose modern lifestyle begins to influence her things such as lipsticks and sunglasses are duly entering Arati's quotidian life.At home the domestic tension has never dissipated Subrata's ailing father Haren Chatterjee protests with silence treatment as a former teacher who now has no income he even abases himself to cadge for largesse from his welltodo former pupils the doctor and lawyer sort which is bartered with his own dignity a scathing commotion of pathos is achieved without ever sensationalising the subject.Things aggravate in a dramatic slope when Subrata loses his job on the same day when Arati is supposedly to hand in her resignation out of her own will on the grounds that Subrata will procure a sideline from his friend. All out of a sudden Arati inadvertently becomes the only source of income for the family she makes no dithering to demand an immediate raise from Himangshu an outofleftfield bid one might not expect from her reserved nature. Her subtle transformation from a compliant housewife to a liberated woman who can competently take on a more independent role in the society is the main arc of this patiently and nonintrusively limned narrative a rare fruition considering the movie's time and place taking the paragraph where Arati has to keep up appearances by inventing a tall tale with Subrata's presence which is unbeknownst to her in front of a potential buyer it potently testifies that the film safeguards a coolheaded spin not to bring its heroine to perfection she lies out of vanity or to save her and her husband's faces it is foibles like this make her a fleshedout persona making progress in the real world borne out of a plain fiction Ray is a crack storyteller who is incredibly wellversed in human nature and refuses to go on board with stilted emotional manipulation in his pinpoint methodology.Also Ray adroitly projects his dissent concerning the social maladies onto his prudently shaped characters the nonexistent pensions for the elderly the fraudulent nature of banking business and the injustice prevails in workplace the case of builtin racism here. In the final battle Arati has to fight for her sense of justice in an impulsive way and she is ever so vulnerable and doubtful after that then propelled by a promised job opportunity Subrata who although has been constantly fretted by a mixed bag of frustration anxiety jealousy and low selfesteem which in the lesser hands would in no time unleash himself into a hysterical breakdown pouring scorn on those nearby however arrives when he is most needed and sensibly does the right thing and sends an auspicious message in the end.

This documentary certainly fulfills that expectation.  In addition it is the sad tragic story of how a great artist was hounded and dehumanized by the Nazis.  Finally it is the incredible story of how the Nazis coerced Kurt Gerron to direct one of its most outrageous propaganda films to try to show the world that the Terezin Concentration Camp was a paradise for Jews sent to live in the east. The reality was that Terezin was a squalid overcrowded transit camp  where many died from disease  and tens of thousands were transported to Auschwitz and other camps to be murdered.  In the end Gerron was coerced to face the ethical dilemna that the Nazis posed to all their prisoners As long as you help us we have a reason to keep you alive  so ... How soon do you want to die?Did Gerron make the film because he was selfishly trying to save himself and his family?  If so ... so what?  Wouldn't you have done that?  On the other hand it is even more tragic to think that Gerron probably knew that the Nazis would never let him live  and that this was his last chance to work  to be creative  to be a macher  to have a modicum of control over his life.  Like all great artists he did not want to produce anything less than his best.  Certainly many of the actors in the film were forced to pretend to be happy.  On the other hand when you see children eating bread and butter joyfully  and you know that they would not have such food were it not for this film  you can imagine that perhaps they were not pretending to enjoy the food.  Similarly the chorale group the children's musical and the symphony performing Study for Strings written by Pavel Haas while he was incarcerated in Terezin were not pretending.  They were enthusiastically displaying their love for their art and their pride of accomplishment.  The Nazis should be vilified for their treatment of these artists.  But the artists have nothing to be ashamed of.The film raises more questions than it answers.  And some of the answers it suggests may not be convincing.  But that is another reason why this film is deeply moving and valuable.This is an extremely wellmade documentary  excellently preserving much archival film footage.  Ian Holm is an outstanding narrator.  And the moments we see Gerron's acting and hear his singing are likely to encourage you to want to rent several of his films.  Nominated for the 2003 Oscar  amongst Spellbound Winged Migration and Bowling for Columbine  this film is further evidence that today's documentary film makers are among the best creative artists in the cinema.".

	schema:headline " Like No Other Holocaust Documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "Prisoner of Paradise is like no other Holocaust documentary that I've ever seen.  It is an amazing true story.SPOILERS AHEADThis movie is really a film about a film.  The film is Theresienstadt the 1944 Nazi Propaganda film directed by German Jew Kurt Gerron.  Gerron was a German comedic actor who lost everything due to Nazi persecution and he eventually ended up in Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic.  The Nazis asked him to make a movie showing how Theresienstadt was a utopia built by Hitler for the Jews.  The central question of this movie is  Should Gerron have said No or Yes to the Nazis?  Surely if he had said No it would have meant a ride to Auschwitz on the next transport.  But by saying Yes he would be a tool of the Nazis and making the film in no way would guarantee his survival.  What should he do?  Gerron makes Theresienstadt for the Nazis.  As soon as Gerron finishes making the film for the Nazis almost all of the cast is sent to Auschwitz and gassed on 11 consecutive transports.  Gerron is put on the 11th transport and murdered with gas on the day he arrives in Auschwitz.Gerron receives equal parts condemnation and praise for making Theresienstadt.  Condemnation for selling out to the murderers of his own people.  Praise for trying to survive the Nazis by any means necessary.  But I think that maybe Gerron knew they were all doomed and he knew this might be the only record of his fellow Jewish inmates before their end.  So he films laughing teenaged girls young men playing soccer inmates putting on a play and everybody was having fun smiling in this utopia Hitler built for the Jews.  Of course you never see the SS guards with machine guns.In the end Gerron beat the Nazis at their own game.  Gerron shows the HUMANITY of Hitler's Jewish captives the humanity Hitler sought to deny. How young so many of them were.  How much they really wanted to live!  But everyone of them is forced to wear the yellow star which is their death sentence.  It makes the horror of the Holocaust clearer than any stacks of dead emaciated corpses because this film show What Might Have Been. Everyone of these teenaged girls could have become a doctor homemaker anything... and they were all murdered or most of them for the sake of a crazy ideology.Prisoner of Paradise is a very haunting film.  It ranks with Claude Lanzmann's 9 12 hour Shoah as a landmark Holocaust film.  It made me realize that it's not just the injustice of genocide that's so terrible it's the human potential that is lost.  So many young people who could have done something with their lives and they never got the chance.  This film will make you think.".

	schema:headline " Traditional Holocaustrelated doc should be strong Oscar contender";
	schema:reviewBody "On a recent weekend getaway to Toronto I availed myself of the opportunity to see the only public screening in North America of one of the contenders for this year's best documentary Oscar . the joint AmericanCanadian production PRISONER OF PARADISE.   It's not the best documentary I've seen this year but it's solid deals with an interesting topic and I strongly suspect that it's going to take home this year's prize.  More on this later.Narrated by Ian Holm the film opens with scenes of a utopian community lovingly described as being comprised completely of likeminded individuals.'  The grounds look wellkept the people especially the children look happy and in good health the arts flourish and sporting activities are regularly enjoyed by all.  But suddenly Holm informs us that this seeminglysuccessful communal experiment is all . a huge lie.The community' is actually the Nazi concentration camp of Theresienstadt where prominent Jews who would be missed were congregated into a sprawling and photogenic from the outside old fortress whose barricades to external forces proved equally efficient at keeping prisoners contained.  And the footage is from a particularly notorious piece of Nazi propaganda  The Fuhrer Gives a City to the Jews' 1944 a film produced to dispel rampant rumors about the wholesale mistreatment and extermination of Jews by the Germans.   The film then shifts the focus to the director of the film  Jewish inmate Kurt Gerron a onetime hugely successful character actor cabaret performer and movie director in preNazi Germany.If by chance you're a student of early cinema who's seen Josef Von Sternberg's classic THE BLUE ANGEL you've already seen a Gerron performance . he's the magician who uses the broken Emil Jannings as a stage prop late in the film.  He also played the doctor in the Georg Pabstdirected Louise Brooks movie DIARY OF A LOST GIRL.  On stage he was the first performer to ever sing Mack the Knife' appearing in the original 1926 production of Bertolt Brecht's THE THREEPENNY OPERA.  And besides being a success as a performer he also directed some box office hits starring major German stars in the years immediately preceding the Nazi takeover. In terms of appearance familiarity to audiences and show biz success he was something of a German amalgam of Danny DeVito and Jackie Gleason.The first half of the film follows Gerron's odyssey to this final directing job  from the beginning of his success as a performer . to his showbiz heyday . to his flight to France and then to Holland following the Nazi clampdown on Jews . to his capture following the German occupation of Holland . and finally to his arrival at Theresienstadt.  A journey that included two missed opportunities to join friends like Marlene Dietrich and Peter Lorre who'd successfully relocated to Hollywood.  The second half of the film deals with the situation at Theresienstadt and features many interviews with survivors.In terms of documentary technique the film is pretty much by the book topheavy with archival footage and talking heads.  There are also two recreation scenes  clearly labeled as such thus averting a major documentary nono that has cost Errol Morris dearly in the past.  But I never found my interest wandering at any time during the 97minute running time.  The survivors make it known that the prisoners resented Gerron's collaboration but the filmmakers claim that Gerron consulted with Jewish elders before making it and received their permission to engage in an activity that would delay the word all detainees feared . transport' which meant delivery to a death camp.In terms of topicality there's an interesting side story dealing with an evil regime successfully thwarting international inspection  what emboldened the Nazis to make the propaganda film in the first place was their unqualified success in convincing a visiting Red Cross inspector that everything was fine at the camp via a carefully orchestrated tour of the facilities.  This aspect coupled with four additional factors should make it a very strong contender1. Its one of our own' main character remember SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE beating out SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for best picture a few years back?2. Its Holocaustrelated theme a traditional favorite in the documentary category  INTO THE ARMS OF STRANGERS ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED HOTEL TERMINUS etc.3. Its traditional documentary techniques . Hollywood frowns on creativity and visual panache in this category4. The desperation among Hollywood pragmatists to prevent Michael Moore from taking the podium in front of a world audience in these timesYou make think that it's impossible for a film with such little exposure to trump the recordsetting success of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE but for an MPAA voter to be eligible to vote for best documentary he or she HAS to see ALL of the films in nomination at a theatrical screening and certify the date and place in writing.  And one of the nominees WINGED MIGRATION is withholding the film from screenings so only a tiny handful of voters are going to be voting in this category this year.If any of the eligible documentaries is going to galvanize antiMoore sentiment among the aged and far less liberal as a whole than you might suspect MPAA members who ARE eligible to vote this is the one.  If it wasn't for the fact that he'd actually have to admit to SEEING Michael Moore's movie in order to be eligible to vote I'd bet the FARM that PRISONER would be Charlton Heston's choice.".

And while much of the film is about this the actual focus is on one particular resident of this bizarre 'model camp'Kurt Gerron. Gerron was a movie star and director who was perhaps the most famous man in the camp. How he came to be there as well as a summation of his career makes up the first portion of the film. I liked this since I didn't know who he was and seeing and hearing about his amazing career was very interesting and set the stage for the second half of the filminside the camp and the Nazi demand that HE document camp life on film to make it look like a paradise. This part of the documentary was a bit surrealwith the Nazis creating a 'nice' camp in order to prove to international authorities how well the Nazis were caring for the Jews!! But there was also an odd niceness about the camp in some ways that made it bearableto a point.Overall the film is naturally depressingafter all it was the Holocaust and Gerron did not eventually survive. But its quality is hard to denywith lots of interviews archival footage photos and paintings. It just screamed QUALITY throughout. Too bad then that although nominated for the Oscar for Best Documentary that it did not win.Now I am sure I'll ruffle a few feathers in saying this but I don't think the Michael Moore film Bowling for Columbine should have even been nominated as I wouldn't consider it a documentary due to its attempt not so much to report facts but change and distort things to make his point. Now I am NOT criticizing thisand perhaps it should have been nominated for Best Picture. But there were many who also felt its style and lack of any objectivity made it anything but a documentary. I am not saying Prisoner of Paradise should have won perhaps one of the other nominees was better but it should have been beaten by a film that was entered in the proper category.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drivein theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  It shows up on screen in every single frame.  Each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch.  As Atticus Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. He never talks down to them but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  Yet he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  When called upon to do his duty he does so despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem Scout and Dill Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task.  So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  For Jem he chose Philip Alford for Scout Mary Badham and for Dill John Megna.  Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced. It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess allowing them to play on the set and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  It paid off in every way imaginable.  None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  Because he dared to care about a white girl he now faces almost certain death if convicted and perhaps even if not convicted.  It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  Just as Jem and Scout came of age and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred so did I.Equally significant is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her but like Atticus we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.  She is a product of not only the times in which she lives but even more so of her wretched upbringing.  Mayella is what she is but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her.  To Mayella being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.In his screen debut as Boo Radley Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem Dill and Scout so much. Though on the screen for a short length of time without uttering a word Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty mistreatment and the gossip and whispers of neighbors.  He is a man who wants only to live in his own way yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant.  They are the childhood he had never really known.  Just as Tom Robinson he has never brought harm to anyone yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert.  They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play. Elmer Bernstein's score is never boisterous but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.There have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about To Kill A Mockingbird. Many of the words are far better than those that I have written.  Then again maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that To Kill A Mockingbird is.  It will be forever remembered long after you and I have departed from this world.  It is at this point that I usually grade a film. I will skip that here simply because there is no grade that I can give that could possibly do justice for To Kill A Mockingbird.".

	schema:reviewBody "To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout Jem and their father Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town.  It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hardhitting drama as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman.  This review is not an easy one to write despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times.  The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal Top Five of All Time'.  I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again.  Of course the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons.  Among them the date that the film was released  1962 on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's.  It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters.  But most of all this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch a true hero.  At the risk of sounding histrionic my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man and is so inherently good.  No matter how many times I have seen this film I smile when I see his interaction with his children and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character.  No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings. I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered  mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible.  The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength.  Atticus Finch fights evil as well but with his strong moral fiber and his mind.  To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education.  If you have not read it do so.  If you have not seen the film do so and share it with others.  It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists.  Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch a pillar of nobility social conscience and rare for 1930's Americana a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from nonprofessional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous 6 and a half feet big legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an AfricanAmerican man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in without a doubt one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused negro on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement implores the jury to vote justice. An allmale allwhite jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death an unlikely hero and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hardboiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film an art form itself. It is important it is enlightening and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING 9 of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film and the book it was based on I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book but I'm considering it just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be some call it the most accurate booktofilm conversion ever. The plot is very good it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good apart from The Godfatherthe first one and one or two other exceptions this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective is the fact that the children are likable credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them believe me normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying loud and egotistical. But with this film I couldn't for one second muster up any tiny amount of aggression or even annoyance. They come off as so likable charming and most importantly real. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotypeclich of a brat who does nothing but destroy things around him or the exact opposite a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first either. In this film the children are completely real. They are naive innocent they disobey what their father tells them but ultimately they obviously love and respect their father and they never do anything anything at all with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world or rather their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent once again it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are wellwritten credible and wellcasted. The dialog was wellwritten. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old or it being black and white it's an excellent film and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 1010".

Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly considering the ages of the children who played them and they as with everything else in the production are true to the book's spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise especially for the climatic scene and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast and it's interesting to ponder how much this film at the time would've shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor much of the book's counterbalancing humour was left out certain characters are omitted Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes this is a magical film and a mustsee as a companion piece to the classic novel. 910".

The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping I s'pose it's in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney.To Kill a Mockingbird rises to the top of the pile easily.Yes the courtroom proceedings are nailbitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goingson even more compelling.The writing here is so beautiful so lyric so poetic. The Harper Leebased screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely realwhere big brothers could solve the universe's problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.To Kill a Mockingbird also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessedthere's not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing Ponette a movie I would highly recommend the kids in Mockingbird received my best child performance ever awards. Ponette has ratcheted them down one notch but that doesn't diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.Peck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters too is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.If you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen Mockingbird I pity you. You've passed on one of Hollywood's most unforgettable experiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "Horton Foote's Oscarwinning screenplay is so good it really supplants the 1960 Harper Lee book. I've recently reread the novel and it seemed weighed down and paced with backwoods vernacular and situations right out of the 1930s that are shockingly removed from the 21st century. My goodness. I hope it doesn't strike others so because the book is a gem too. It's just in need of ...updating perhaps which is what the 1962 movie excels at it translates the Depression Era for us. The characters played eg by Gregory Peck and Brock Peters in their signature roles seem so much betterdepicted on screen than merely in my own imagination from having read the book!Only Arthur'Boo' Radley a peroxided Robert Duvall seems at first a jarring casting choice to me but in the end all seem terrific.Now THESE child actors Mary Badham 'Scout' Philip Alford 'Jem' and John Megna as 'Dill' should've won Oscars. I'm sure they're all better than Haley Joel Osment who strikes me as 'studied'. These kids are just natural completely oblivious of the camera. Unbelievable. Actually I wonder what genius DID do the casting because the film gives no casting credit. I guess in 1962 the CSA didn't exist yet... That casting director deserves an Oscar too.This is what great filmmaking is all about when several areas of perfection are jointly present a film that reaches into your heart and yanks you up and down. Those were real acting jobs not the cretinous drivel passing for 'work' these days. The reason we don't see too many better movies than Das Experiment is because postmodernism has long encamped in Hollywood it set up a Starbuck's years ago.The first scene instantly captures Scout's world. She's learning fast at the shoulder of her loving widower lawyer father that she shouldn't embarrass people who are even poorer than they are and Jem is tantrumming up a tree because he can't brag about his dad's nonexistent cool to his friends. Jem demands Atticus play football! for the Mets or more uproariously as Scout tells it for the Methodists' hahahaha. Can we picture Methodists in a sackrace? How many Methodists does it take to change a lightbulb?The Boo Radley story arc is much better paced in the movie than the book but because I want to focus on the racerelations arc I will only make passing comment on Boo he is gently painted in both the book and movie as another previously dismissed but highly virtuous person who deserves to be analogized with the fragile hopeful beauty of the mockingbird.The harrowing exploration of entrenched injustice through various acts of racist violence are adult themes that really couldn't be explored well in a book constrained by the first person narrative of a 7yrold little girl. The movie is able to show the Tom Robinson court case much more objectively. Robert Mulligan's direction quickly telegraphs Bob Ewell's shifty creepiness with the scene of his slovenly leering at Atticus' children in the car. Collin Wilcox is also heartrending as Mayella the ignorant uneducated and abused daughter of Bob Ewell. Inexplicably Gregory Peck's crossexamination scene is not quite as sensitive as Atticus is in the book Peck never reveals that flash of pain at having to destroy Mayella's false testimony.Little Scout's key scene where she embarrasses the lynch mob collectively no better than Tom Ewell alone just with her amiable child's chatter is EVERY BIT as powerful and stressful as in the book. Probably more because body language is a much better form of expression for a scene like this.Brock Peters' Tom Robinson is the archetypal decent black man who YES felt sorry for a brutalized white woman as we all ought to. Don't bother debating what if he was guilty' because TKAM is not a whodunnit it's an expose of what used to happen WHEN a black man was innocent. The heartbreaking destruction of Tom Robinson's proverbial mockingbird is our collective shame even now because similar dismissive laziness still happens. It's every person's character that matters not whether they're Methodists'.We do construct our identities as part of various groups. But no group membership or belief about it makes any person categorically virtuous. That still hinges on a person's strengths and crucially their weaknesses. A person's bad character will overwhelm whatever beliefs they hold their good character will enhance them. We are all free to act better or worse than our beliefs we're NOT powerless over them so noone should ever die over a belief. Cooler thinking than mere violence must rule or else objective justice will never materialize. And it's only justice if the judgement is accurate but accuracy requires the abolition of the sort of intellectualsocietal laziness that regularly befalls the weakest subgroups of society. Well we all saw the intellectual rigour of that lynch mob. Would you trust them to tell the time? You might not feel happy trusting even the sheriff Frank Overton testifying in court but no better than a hick himself Oh I guess that would make it her LEFT'. Those powerful imbeciles stood in judgement over some societally fragile people like Tom and yes like Mayella.It's still powerful how Tom's hammering as sarcastic legal argument by the prosecutor William Windom served to bring home Tom's societal fragility and we're humbled at the quiet dignity of the entire black population who soberingly stood in the rafters to honor Atticus' failed attempt. The movie was made in 1961 some 7 years before the martyrdom of Martin Luther King Jr yet in the light of recent gangrelated violence it's clear there are still many who think their group belonging excusesmasks their brutality as people. It does not. And the brutality came first.This movie needs to be seen by the young to open their hearts to humanity and their standards for their own personal character for the rest of their lives. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Our Greatest Film Hero";
	schema:reviewBody "When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.Gregory Peck for the most part played decent honorable thinking men in his films. A few films like Duel in the Sun and The Boys from Brazil have him as a villain but the public never accepted him really in those parts.Few of us in our lives can be Horatio Hornblower or spike the Guns of Navarone or command a submarine as in On the Beach. But Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird is well within our grasp. He's a small town lawyer raising his children as a single parent and most of all trying to lead them by example. The performances of Mary Badham and Philip Alford show the kids have learned it very well as does the uncredited narration of Kim Stanley as the grownup Scout.Atticus Finch is a very attainable ideal. It is I believe the secret of the popularity of both the book and the film. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Atticus Finch and his family during the Thirties in rural Alabama. The action takes place over several months of a given year. The most important part of the film deals with Finch defending a black man for allegedly raping a white woman. It's a thankless task and Finch knows it because he knows the attitudes of the people there those who would make up an all white jury. Still he proceeds with courage and determination. His summation to the jury is a film classic and Peck's innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by William Windom's prosecutor who smirks through out the trial knowing he just has to play the race card to win.Other outstanding performances are Brock Peters as the man Peck is defending James Anderson as the father of the girl he's accused of violating and Frank Overton as the county sheriff.This film was the debut of Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley who plays the autistic neighbor of the Finches. No dialog at all for Duvall who conveys great and pained emotion with a series of expressions that are unforgettable. Duvall played a similar role in another Peck film Captain Newman MD.Gregory Peck got the Best Actor Award for 1962. He was up against some very stiff competition that year. Peck beat out Jack Lemmon for Days of Wine and Roses Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian style. No doubt sentiment did play a part in the final award. Lemmon and Lancaster had already gotten Oscars and O'Toole and Mastroianni were relative newcomers. But I sure think the Academy selection that year has stood the test of time.This film has sure stood the same test.".

	schema:reviewBody "About ten years ago a year or so after I was married I became quite ill and was bedridden for almost two weeks. I was in so much pain I could not sit on the sofa and look at television my eyes hurt so badly from my fever that I couldn't even lie in bed and read. It was Christmas season and my husband working in retail worked extra long hours. With no way to entertain myself or even to sleep the long hours spent alone were almost unbearable. Then I had an idea I had seen that our public library had books on tape. I asked my husband if he would find something interesting for me not having any idea what sort of books they might have. He chose To Kill a Mockingbird.I had of course always heard of the book but apparently it was not on our required reading list in high school. Remembering how I had loathed so many of the books I was forced to read in school I had mixed feelings when he brought it to me. Still I welcomed ANY distraction to help pass the time. What an absolutely wonderful book it turned out to be. If my memory is correct it was read by Meryl Streep. What a beautiful job she did of it! Looking back at it now I'm glad I got so sick that winter or I might not have had the opportunity to read it. What a comfort it was to me during a painful difficult time.A few years later I ran across the movie on television. I was so very pleased to see how well they translated it to film. No film ever captures EVERY facet of a book or we'd have an awful lot of eight hour films out there! but the book was definitely given justice. Having grown up in the deep south myself even having myself attended segregated school and seen INTENSE prejudice amongst the privileged white upperclass I applaud the book's writer and the film's producer all the more for producing such works during a time of indescribable social struggle and upheaval.To Kill a Mockingbird is a strong quiet film of great dignity... qualities that are sadly lacking in almost every film made in this country today. To me though having first come across the book in the isolation of of sickness listening to it hour after hour in the dim light of my bedroom watching the grey winter clouds pass by the window as I listened it will alway be my own special personal film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Generally I prefer to review movies I dislike because I am better able to quantify negative opinions than positive ones but To Kill a Mockingbird deserves a review as few other movies I have ever seen.  I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.  I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful innocent prose.Every time I watch I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He too is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.  Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful and the script is perfectly balancednot too sparse but also not dialogue heavy.The best thing about To Kill a Mockingbird is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance loving families and the beauty of life through a child's eyes.  Everyone who watches movies ought to see it.".

I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.  I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful innocent prose.Every time I watch I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He too is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.  Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful and the script is perfectly balancednot too sparse but also not dialogue heavy.The best thing about To Kill a Mockingbird is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance loving families and the beauty of life through a child's eyes.  Everyone who watches movies ought to see it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Undoubtedly a classic hallmark in cinema To Kill a Mockingbird dealt with social issues when social issues were still very much an issue in society much more so than today although some of the same basic feelings are still present. Being younger than the film itself I can only imagine the impact it had on people when it first came out. And seeing how the film has not been forgotten after the decades since it's release I think it's safe to say that it had quite an effect as it continues to do so. Having read the book in high school the film seems fairly accurate to the story except for a few very minor things that are mostly the result of a book being condensed into a much shorter journey.Gregory Peck is perfect in his role as Atticus Finch and apparently I'm not alone in that opinion as he won an Oscar for the role. All three children in the movie are also quite impressive and entirely convincing. I particularly enjoyed seeing Robert Duvall in his first film appearance as the ambiguous Boo Radley. It's very difficult to give reviews for older films particularly ones that were made prior to my existence mostly due to the inevitable fact that like everything else films also age sometimes weakening the original potency. But to be honest the only thing that I can see that has noticeably aged is the music which is entirely understandable and is to be expected. And given the fact that it's over four decades old that is quite a statement. It all boils down to a very important film about a very important and popular book in which social issues were dealt with and still holds relevance today. Like many classics it's not just a movie but a film with a message. A heart warming classic and an essential notch in the belt of film history.".

It seems to deeply move everyone who watches it. I own this movie and bawl my eyes out every time I see it. But it's a good cry. To Kill a Mockingbird TKAM I'll call it both breaks my heart and inspires me because it reminds me of human beings' capacity for decency and bravery.Has there ever been a more touching character than Atticus Finch???? Not a perfect man not a God but just a person who respected the rights of other people and tried to do the right thing he was a decent man. He tried to live his life according to the saying do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Such quiet dignity! I can see why Atticus Finch was recently named the 1 movie Hero of all time by the American Film Institute. Just thinking about this movie brings tears to my eyes. The only other film to affect me in such a deep way has been The Shawshank Redemption.Gregory Peck would be forever known as Atticus Finch and he expressed how honored he felt to be associated with such a character. I saw an interesting documentary about Peck's life and in it he was doing oneman shows around the country. These shows were questionandanswer sessions with the audience and the majority of questions and comments were related to TKAM and how portraying Atticus Finch had impacted Peck's life. It was so interesting and touching to hear people talk about how the film and that character affected them. I remember one man standing up and saying that TKAM inspired him to become a lawyer and that he named his son Atticus. I've read here and there about the favorite movies of various celebrities and have been amazed that of all the movies out there in the world there's one title that pops up frequently as a favorite  and that's TKAM. And it's the favorite of all kinds of people both young and old. I almost fell off my chair when I read that it was Madonna's favorite movie. Didn't think she has such good taste! Anyway how extraordinary it must have been for G. Peck Robert Duvall and all the other people who were part of TKAM to realize that they created something really truly impacted people  and could inspire people to try to be better human beings. Wow.

	schema:reviewBody "To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This movie shows some of the problems between blacks and whites. These differences between two races make this story so special. The characters adaptation was very interesting starting with Atticus Finch and his children. Also I love how this story was told through the eyes of one child.In this movie were many things that make it interesting such as the characters the theme plot and mysterious elements. First the main actors had a very good representation on their characters for instance Atticus Finch Scout and Jem. The theme of this story was based in prejudice and was showing the differences between blacks and whites. Also the plot was very detailed and exciting because Boo was scary and mysterious. Finally Tom Robinson also brings to the plot the essentials of the movie.Although the movie To Kill a Mockingbird is very exciting some things do not show the truth of the story. One of these things is when Mr. Radley cemented the tree's knothole and the children get down without knowing the cause. Also something needing to change may be the Ewell family because they are an evil family without any feeling toward other people. The trial of Tom Robinson is conspicuous and sad because the movie itself makes him an important character. But knowing all these things this movie is still great.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great movie where you can find one of the most recognized actors of all time Gregory Peck. Mr. Peck stands out in all his qualities that are made by his values. One of the foremost qualities of Gregory Peck is his courage to confront the goals of his work and his personal life. Atticus Finch and Gregory Peck have a different life and feelings but they are both moral men. Finally both conduct themselves with dignity.In conclusion To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful movie that I will like to recommend to everybody to watch. In this movie one learns about the social class the good and evil. One thing that I really liked was to know about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Also I felt empathy with many situations in the movie that reminded me of similar times in my life.".

	schema:reviewBody "After fortythree years To Kill a Mockingbird TKAM remains one of the most effective testimonials to the ravages of ignorance and prejudice ever recorded on film. Asking myself why this gracefully paced narrative has left such an indelible impression on so many I've concluded it's because the film isn't about what most of its supporters and detractors claim it's about. Not about race or prejudice? . . . No. At its core TKAM is about neighbors and community which concept forms the basis for the gravity of its message in the matter of Tom Robinson.Other films have followed on the familiar theme of racial bigotry and its welldocumented devastations. These films have been consistently less effective because we are not asked to think so much or to connect the history depicted with the histories of our own lives and our own communities.I've performed in two stage versions of TKAM neither of which benefited from the brilliant input of screenwriter Horton Foote. Both plays focus almost exclusively on the racial element of the story. They like so many films of later years come off as heavyhanded or inyourface regarding this element. Well . . . If you think this way  you're bad. End of story. In TKAM the film we see a community of poor unique and apparently respectable people helping one another through a Depression. In stark contrast and beautifully prepared by the film's creators the injustices meted out to Tom Robinson and his family represent a dramatic anachronism of unthinkable proportions. And it's as routine in this gentle Southern community as a child's fear of a mysterious neighbor or a shy but happy exchange of hickory nuts for legal services rendered. Memorable? Most emphatically. Think about it. It's what director Mulligan wants us to do.".

After watching the DVD I still cannot remember whether I've seen the film before. The above scene I might have seen in a trailer but I do have some vague recollection of the scary' visits to the strange house. The strongest themes that come out of the movie would undoubtedly be racial injustice and the law enforcement system purportedly originated from Camelot. The film does not stoop to poetic justice on both counts which puts it one notch above your usual courtroom thrillers. Do not forget though the title of the film. The mockingbird alludes not to the wronged black defendant but a mentally disturbed young man who appears only at the very end. Most ironically the injustice is vindicated not by the machinery of the legal system but rather by a crime' committed by this mentally disturbed youth. This is the most thought provoking aspect of the film.Gregory Peck won his Oscar in this film. Recently we have witnessed more and more cases where an Oscar is won by bawling and howling on the screen augmented by helps from the general political atmosphere best exemplified by the year 2001. Peck won his in 1962 purely on the merit of his performance.The moving spirit of Mockingbird is in the trio of kids brother and sister at about 12 and 6 plus a little guy of 7 in neighbourhood who appears at the commencement of every summer holiday. While both guys are excellent it's Mary Badham who stole the show playing the little girl. Of all the child stars that I have ever seen she is the only one that does not suffer in comparison with Haley Joel Osment Six sense' etc. I would love to see this pair together on screen except that they are in real life almost 40 years apart. A wild and crazy thought could she have been his mother? One delightful final surprise noticed only when I checked into IMDB is that Boo the mentally disturbed young man was played by none other than Robert Duvall !".

Not just these two were great we have Jon Voight as well. But what really got me is the acting from other characters as Seth Green Barry Pepper Jake Busey and even Jack Black. These people are great especially Black who is really acting here! Black should have realised that comedy is not his thing if suspense and drama are as he is great here.Overall we get great acting a fine plot and fast character development and fast and intense action as well.

From my list of favorites I'd also say it has aspects of Marathon Man The Fugitive and The Firm. Will Smith whose work does not thrill me 100 of the time is terrific and Gene Hackman could not have been better. They also receive support from some great character actors many of them UNCREDITED a fact which blew me away. My enjoyment was enhanced by being familiar with Hackman's The Conversation in which he plays Harry Caul one of the world's greatest audio surveillance men. His hideoutoffice in Enemy is reminiscent of Caul's digs and the photograph which the bad guys have on file for him is of his character from The Conversation. I sort of wish they'd named the new character Caul giving longterm continuity to the story. I'm running off at the fingers here so I won't elaborate on the location direction etcetera but will end with SEE THIS FILM!".

I was not disappointed. This is by far better than any of Will Smith's movies so far.Robert Clayton Dean Will Smith seems to have an average American life. He has a pretty wife and a fine young son as well as his own house and a successful job as a lawyer. But when he accidentally finds himself with evidence of politician Thomas Brian Reynolds Jon Voight killing somebody his entire life is in jeopardy. His job destroyed his reputation tarnished and his life in danger by Renolds and a gang of military soldiers and hackers he turns to a friend Rachel Banks Lisa Bonet. She leads him to Brill Gene Hackman a paranoid informant who is also on the run from the government to help him.The acting in this movie is great. Will Smith is at his absolute best in this movie but the spotlight does probably belong to Gene Hackman for his part as Brill. Seth Green also does a great job as what started as a cameo and became a vital part of the movie. Jon Voight is superb as the evil politician Lisa Bonet does well as Smith's exgirlfriend and Regina King does a fair job as Smith's wife. All of the characters are cool and interesting especially those of Smith Hackman Voight and Green.The action is this movie is terrific. There are some very entertaining chases both car and foot as well as gunfights and explosions. The ending is also pretty cool. The realism is a little far fetched especially when Will Smith goes into a lingerie shop and there are tons of good looking girls modeling it all over the store but it is believable enough for the viewer to have fun.I really enjoyed this movie and will buy it first chance I get. Go out and rent it and enjoy you'll probably feel the same way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sucessful lawyer Robert Dean is passed information by an old friend without noticing. Seconds later that friend is killed and Dean is targeted by a group within the Government who wish to cover up a conspiracy involving the murder of a congressman. With the Government's full weight of surveillance equipment brought to bear Dean turns to exNSA agent Brill to help protect him find the information and get it out into the open.This is much better than the ususal summer crash bang wallop stuff we usually get fed. It's greatly helped by the sense of paranonia that runs through the whole story from the Government's power and corruption at some levels. The film starts well with 'everyman' Dean being drawn into a game of cat and mouse framed for a crime he didn't commit and forced to go on the run from Government agents. Will Smith carries the film only so far but it realy gets interesting when Hackman turns up as Brill. He casts light on the ability of the government and is almost able to play them at their own game. Brill makes an appearance when the film starts to become too much of a staight chase movie.To me the use of Hackman as Brill is the best bit of casting ever and makes this film stand out as being clever. In the 70's Hackman played a surveillance expert in Copolla's The Conversation. The film ends with Hackman being monitored himself with him ripping his house apart looking for the bugs. What makes his casting as Brill so good is that Brill is where Hackman's The Conversation character would be 20 years on  it feels like it's the same character again. The director also deserves a lot of praise  he manages to keep the pace up throughout the film whether it be scenes of chasing action or technological pursuit. The script helps as well  the conspiracy and the paranoia is strong throughout.Smith is good in the lead but he isn't quite as good an everyman as classic actors as Cary Grant or James Stewart were. Smith also struggles to carry the whole movie and the chases do get a bit samey after a while. Fortunately Hackman is brilliant as Brill he is a classy actor and brings a lot of weight to the film just as Smith begins to feel the strain. Jon Voight is also good as the villian of the piece. The supporting cast is deep! There were so many famous faces in small roles that I really felt this was an allstar cast despite the fact that it's a Smith vehicle. Gabriel Byrne makes a fleeting appearance Ian Hart is there Jake Busey son of Gary shows up Jason Lee actor in many Kevin Smith films witnesses the murder a gorgeous Lisa Bonet has a small part James Le Gros Regina King etc etc. The cast is well packed with famous faces  they don't all get the chance to put on a show but it adds quality at all levels.Overall this is a fancy chase movie but good direction a strong and deep cast and a fantastic Hackman all make this film much better than it could have been. The last scene of the film is a little too upbeat but other than that it's pretty good stuff.".

	schema:headline " One of my favorite actionfilms ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "Enemy Of The State is one of the few movies I went out of my way to see in the theater  I'm a videorental guy and it's indeed a grand actionmovie. The big surplus is of course the great messages behind the film. It entails a fear that we all have in some degree the loss of our privacy. Of course all the Hollywoodelements are present the returning catchphrases and jokes the overdramatic scenes etc. but Scott never goes too far. The pacing is great and the film's over before you know it even though it has a relatively long runtime for an actionmovie of 120 min. Will Smith is solid but Gene Hackman is the one who steals the show. It's the first movie I saw that starred him I was only 10 when the movie came out and I've been a big fan ever since.Tony Scott's new movie Deja Vu really is a lot like EOTS in many ways but I still deem EOTS to be superior. Deja Vu is great of course but I guess I add some sentimental value to EOTS. It's really a mustsee for actionthriller fans and I do not say this lightly.EOTS fully deserves it's 8".

The big surplus is of course the great messages behind the film. It entails a fear that we all have in some degree the loss of our privacy. Of course all the Hollywoodelements are present the returning catchphrases and jokes the overdramatic scenes etc. but Scott never goes too far. The pacing is great and the film's over before you know it even though it has a relatively long runtime for an actionmovie of 120 min.

	schema:reviewBody "Conspiracy theorists who enjoy films like JFK and Conspiracy Theory will have a lot to enjoy with Enemy of the State. For a film that came out almost 10 years ago it seems just slightly ahead its time. I don't remember everything about 1998 but I do know that things like DVD was in it's nascent stages and although the internet has been part of our vernacular for almost 20 years now the technology prevalent back in 98 as opposed to now is light years apart. And in the post 911 days having the idea of our privacy abolished is pretty much upon us. Maybe not to the extent perpetuated in this film but we are pretty much under Big Brother's watchful eye all the time. When you walk into a bank a restaurant a convenience store or any public place you are photographed and recorded and your image can be recalled with a simple enough click of a button. Even today when you call places like phone company's or pizza parlours you hear a recorded message that says this call may be recorded for quality purposes. We are being watched and kept tabs on everywhere we go and in everything we do. In this vein Enemy of the State is a marvel. It is a film way ahead of it's time. No one could foresee the tragedy of 911 but now that it is part of our history books films like The Siege and this one are that much more clairvoyant.Will Smith plays a Washington attorney whose life is turned inside out when he is given a disc that has a political murder on it. He doesn't know that it does and when an unsanctioned government spook squad comes after him he is confused and out of his element. Gene Hackman plays Brill who might as well be an older version of Harry Cauld his character from Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation. He is a communications expert that has basically gone mercenary and no longer does the dirty work for the CIA and other seedy government factions. Smith needs his help attempting to understand what it all means and how he got entangled in this imbroglio. While Smith is the star of the film it is clearly Hackman that steals the show with his vernacular and expertise on the subject.The film is also blessed with so many bit players that are now either famous or semi famous that it's like watching a Robert Altman film such as The Player. There are that many famous faces in here. Barry Pepper Jake Busey Jack Black Jaime Kennedy Jason Lee Gabriele Byrne Tom Sizemore and Jason Robards all show up in the film in supporting roles. Add to that the incomparable Jon Voight and you have one hell of a cast.Enemy of the State moves at a break neck pace. It is directed with a kinetic urgency and Tony Scott shows us why he is one of the best in the business with his style. I can't imagine many haven't seen this but for those that haven't it is definitely one of Jerry Bruckheimer's best. And that is saying something.910".

	schema:headline " The smartest thriller ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1998 I was only about seven years old and therefore I couldn't see it in the theaters because of the rating but my guess is the entire world got a wakeup call to the horrifying truth about their government. And the thing is everything that happened in Enemy of the State is very very possible of happening. But that's just me thinking 'cause it was over 11 years ago and and I couldn't remember if I tried. Did this movie do the same thing to the government as Jaws did to the beaches? Perhaps.The movie is about a highly accomplished lawyer named Robert Clayton Dean played by Will Smith in the performance of his career and makes an extremely believable character and expresses his emotions of anger and paranoia just perfectly. Dean accidentally gets a videotape of a coveredup political murder and in most of the movie he doesn't realize it. But he's aware that the people NSA agents chasing him are watching him for sinister purposes. Robert Dean is also one of the smartest characters in the history of films as he is able to outsmart a corrupt agency who have practically everything on him such as satellites tracers and cameras.Gene Hackman also stands out as the gruff foulmouthed former conspirer and government agent named Brill who has had experience in surveillance technology and assists Dean in getting away from these dirty agents. However Hackman doesn't show up until after the first hour but that demonstrates his character who has spent most of his life hiding and it shows the secretiveness of Brill. Although the role is somewhat smaller Hackman makes the best of it.And as for the NSA agents played by Jon Voight Barry Pepper Seth Green and Jack Black.....all of these guys are DIRTY and I mean that in the truest meaning possible. These guys are ruining an innocent man's life screwing up his credit cards and even wrecking his marriage just so they can get away with what they did. Believe me you are gonna find yourself HATING these guys and I mean it. And as movie villains go....you're supposed to hate them sometimes in other movies you might be amused or not feel anything at all but Enemy of the State does what it's supposed to do. Also they're very realistic 'cause they aren't stupid and they know what they're doing with all the technology they have.Most of the film's thrills comes from the suspense rather than the action as much of Tony Scott's films are like. The chase scenes such as the beginning when the NSA guys are going after Zavitz and when they're chasing Dean in the hotel and on the streets are terrificly shot and edited. Also later on the action comes in after Dean and Brill run from the agents is also a highlight and it's pretty hilarious after Dean asks Brill why he blew up the building and he reacts by saying Because you made a phone call! which demonstrates how careful he is. And of course the ending standff between the agents and the Italian mob is absolutely bad in the true sense of the word.I absolutely love Enemy of the State and support its position as one of the best thrillers of all time because its very smart and doesn't treat the audience like they're a bunch of idiots. Buy it rent it or borrow it from a friend and watch the movie that happens to be the smartest thriller ever made....".

	schema:reviewBody "This was an excellent well thought out intelligent masterpiece of a thriller! It's the best film I've seen since FugitiveThe Movie It is well done in so many ways that I don't know where to begin so I'll just mention the high points that come to mind immediately. First of all Will Smith Gene Hackman and Jon Voight are so well cast in their characters that it is scary.Jon Voight is so good in his character as the sophisticated cold hearted fiendishly clever villain that it seems the part was made for him and only him. What a bad guy! You had to hate him like Ernest Borgnine as the mean stockade Sergeant in From Here to Eternity. His character was so cold calculating and uncaring about humans other than himself that it was a pleasure to watch and try to understand his take on the events that took placeand how he justified his views.Gene Hackman as Brill was such an integral part of this fast moving thought provoking film that without him as the perfectly cast exCIA Agent the story would not have worked and with him it worked so very well. Hackman was a pleasure to watch and his character was so fascinating and he played him so well that Smith at times just shook his head when I doubt that it was in the script.Will Smith's character needed him so desperately that it would have taken three or more very good actors to fill in all the missing pieces that Brill did alone and was such an interesting character to watch every second that he was on the screen. The whole privacy issue part of the plot was dealt with so well that one had to give it serious thought after the film  the pace of the action didn't allow for discussion type deep thought during the film. As the plot unfolded Brill explained to us the viewers much of what was going on through his conversations with and schooling of Smith's character. A technique that I enjoy because we learned as he learned  as much as they wanted us to know at any given point in time in the story.Smith's character was beautifully cast in the typical Alfred Hitchcock formula of placing a somewhat ordinary person in an extraordinary situation and then we watch to see how he uses his wits to cope while we subconsciously place ourselves in his situation and think at each step what we ourselves would do in such a scenario. Beautiful.".

This does not sit well with this overbloated megalomaniac. So the mobster threatens Smith. On and on this goes and gets more interesting. Will Smith does fantastic work in this out of control thrillrider. Enter Gene Hackman a retired former 'spook' for the agency who worked in Iran before the 'fall' of that country.

He takes and makes the interesting even more so by the way he lays it out. The story takes on a pace that moves fast and kind of makes your heart go to your throat inasmuch as feeling as though you are trying to escape the long reaching arm of a very secret agency who's job is watching everything possible out there.Hackman Smith Byrne Bonet and Voight are well a 'sturdy' force playing out there respective characters putting it together in this 'mix' and blending a winning thrillchase of an enthralling story!I recommend this work of dramatic excitement highly.

It is hard to imagine that the silly kid Will Smith Robert Dean played on TV to become the capable actor he has become on film. Enemy of the State certainly documents that.I also agree that the film was made way before its time and certainly cannot be dated. It also documents how innocent people become embroiled in very complicated and dangerous situations with having done nothing to cause it. Big Brother is all too relevant in this film and one can imagine it's much worse now since the Patriot Act is in fullswing.As all users mention many actorsactresses cast at that time have become major stars. However it IS the oldschool guys who make the film believable......Gene Hackman  Brill and Jon Voight Reynolds do stellar actingjobs with the help of countless smaller roles.This is one chase and shoot'emup film which did not bore me and I could truly relate to. I've watched it three times this week so you can see that I enjoyed Tony Scott's directing and THE STORY David Marconi put on the screen. Regina King Rachel Banks definitely added to the suspense of Enemy of the State  a good family film.SO Guys  be careful what you do in today's world  don't take it for granted that everything is rosy and safe. Bravo !".

In fact it's his most impressive performance since Six Degrees Of Separation. As fun as he was in Bad Boys Independence Day and Men In Black Mike Lowrey Captain Steven Hilliard and Agent J are all basically the same person just an exaggerated form of the Will Smith public persona. Here he is at his most effective a true case is less is more. But as good as Will Smith is and he is totally believable as the family man lawyer who does not have a clue what is happening to him it's Gene Hackman who dominates and steals every scene he is in. I love him anyway but he is brilliant here. Jon Voight is always great I'm a fan of his. Regina King is good as is Lisa Bonet an actress I had a huge crush on growing up. There are small roles for Jason Lee Jack Black Seth Green Phillip Baker Hall Jason Robards James Le Gros and Tom Sizemore. Gabriel Byrne also has a blink and you'll miss him part too.Overall it's a tense well directed and well acted movie with a good sense of paranoia and tension. One of Will Smiths best for me. I find him to be much better when he is actually acting instead of playing versions of him self.Enemy Of The State grossed 111 million at the domestic box office to end 1998 the 15th highest grossing movie of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must disagree with other assessments of Jarman's Wittgenstein. While the film is clearly not for Wittgenstein initiates a bit of reading about the man is probably helpful before viewing I can't class it as the rather boring trivial exercise in biography others seem to feel it is. Jarman's films are always so contentiously receivedwhich is a good thing so all I can do is offer my own reception of it. First while biographical details are somewhat slight I think there are enough to frame at least a gist of the man Wittgenstein and second I must disagree that the exploration of Wittgenstein's sexuality is trivial or inconsequential. Biographically Wittgenstein's sexuality troubled him greatly. Cinematically I don't think it's irrelevant to follow a scene of Wittgenstein vainly attempting to explain his philosophy to students and colleagues an effort which leaves him visibly upset and isolated his back to the camera and his audience with a scene of him at the movies breaking his icy rigid posture and his earlierexpressed desire that his companion and student Johnny not spoil the plot of the movie by distracting him with questions to deliberately end his isolation and grasp Johnny's hand. Yes Jarman's portrait of Wittgenstein is not of an attractive or really likable man and Wittgenstein doesn't seem to have actually been one so his abrasiveness in the film is not disagreeable for me much as the abrasiveness of Gauguin in Lust for Life isn't. As for Jarman's allegedly undaring cinematography I'm no cinematographer but Jarman seems to have favored dark backgrounds long scenes and theatrical stagings in other films and sometimes manages to produce interesting and subtle arrangements thereby. Perhaps his work on Wittgenstein was impacted by his encroaching blindness though I wouldn't suggest writing off the high or low points of the film as the result of his visual impairment. Finally Wittgenstein seems to me like a film deserving of a second viewing. Perhaps it's rather pretentious perhaps it's a little harsh. Perhaps though it's also attempting to make some subtle and notsosubtle commentary on what's important in a life how that ought to be presented and from what perspectives.".

Wittgenstein would be appalled I think to have his great projects and discipline so debased. In fact he seemed to have repressed guilt about everything he could conceive and among these homosexuality was a lesser driver because the environment was so accepting even encouraging.

	schema:headline " A flawed experiment in combining elements of theatre performance art and cinema with the life of the esteemed academic";
	schema:reviewBody "Although there is no accounting for the audacious and experimental style in which artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman has put together this offbeat biography of the famed philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein one can't help feeling a little disappointed by the slight and unimaginative focus the film gives to the real life concerns of this great and forward thinking individual. As the previous reviewer points out if you much like myself know little to nothing about the philosophical or biographical background of Wittgenstein the man then this film really offers very little in the way of enlightenment never giving the audience the chance to gain real insight into the character or the events of his life save perhaps for a few brief scenes included to prove a point. This lack of information and development is a serious problem that mars the film greatly and is a problem that can only be attributed to Jarman and the writers.Much like his similarly themed offkilter biography of the artist Caravaggio 1986 Jarman here ignores the facts and instead opts for more of a personal deconstruction. As much admiration as I have for the director to break away from the usually rigid confines of biographical pictures that seem to force feed the audience an entire life in a neat and digestible twohour course I do not admire his way of frequently shifting focus from any real artistic or intellectual talent onto what seem like very trivial melodramatic examinations of sexuality. Interspersed between serious scenes of Wittgenstein trying in vain to explain his theories to the masses or amazing sequences where reality is broken down and all sorts of bizarre images are allowed to overflow from the screen there are irrelevant and silly sequences where Wittgenstein and his lover cuddle in a cinema or have insignificant arguments that recall a homosexual take on a Hollywood romcom.What we get from the film is simply Wittgenstein as a contemptuous arrogant petty loner who wasn't against berating the children who couldn't decipher his highly intelligent philosophies and wasn't happy unless he was dispelling all around him. Now this may only be a halftruth but since we never learn the full fact of the matter this cloddish rendition is the only conclusion we can make which for a real and important historical figure is far below standard. There is however a saving grace here and as ever with Jarman it is in the visual presentation of the film. Never overly flamboyant and never getting in the way of the story the design of the film still bold innovative and highly impressive. Faced with a miniscule budget the limitations of British television and a shooting schedule of just over fifteen days most filmmakers would have produced a film with no visual imagination whatsoever.

	onyx:emotionText "Although there is no accounting for the audacious and experimental style in which artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman has put together this offbeat biography of the famed philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein one can't help feeling a little disappointed by the slight and unimaginative focus the film gives to the real life concerns of this great and forward thinking individual. As the previous reviewer points out if you much like myself know little to nothing about the philosophical or biographical background of Wittgenstein the man then this film really offers very little in the way of enlightenment never giving the audience the chance to gain real insight into the character or the events of his life save perhaps for a few brief scenes included to prove a point. This lack of information and development is a serious problem that mars the film greatly and is a problem that can only be attributed to Jarman and the writers.Much like his similarly themed offkilter biography of the artist Caravaggio 1986 Jarman here ignores the facts and instead opts for more of a personal deconstruction. As much admiration as I have for the director to break away from the usually rigid confines of biographical pictures that seem to force feed the audience an entire life in a neat and digestible twohour course I do not admire his way of frequently shifting focus from any real artistic or intellectual talent onto what seem like very trivial melodramatic examinations of sexuality. Interspersed between serious scenes of Wittgenstein trying in vain to explain his theories to the masses or amazing sequences where reality is broken down and all sorts of bizarre images are allowed to overflow from the screen there are irrelevant and silly sequences where Wittgenstein and his lover cuddle in a cinema or have insignificant arguments that recall a homosexual take on a Hollywood romcom.What we get from the film is simply Wittgenstein as a contemptuous arrogant petty loner who wasn't against berating the children who couldn't decipher his highly intelligent philosophies and wasn't happy unless he was dispelling all around him. Now this may only be a halftruth but since we never learn the full fact of the matter this cloddish rendition is the only conclusion we can make which for a real and important historical figure is far below standard. There is however a saving grace here and as ever with Jarman it is in the visual presentation of the film. Never overly flamboyant and never getting in the way of the story the design of the film still bold innovative and highly impressive. Faced with a miniscule budget the limitations of British television and a shooting schedule of just over fifteen days most filmmakers would have produced a film with no visual imagination whatsoever. Jarman however took that challenge and created one of the most surprising visual experiences ever filmed and all within the confines of a London warehouse.Of course many will balk at the idea of using a little imagination when watching the film  having been weaned on a combination of highconcept and MTV I myself found it a struggle to look past the minimalism of the set design or the disconcerting contrast between picture and sound  but if you look a little deeper the effect of Jarman's theatrical framework gives way to a wealth of hidden details.

All done by the same maker Rossellini they featured more or less adequate exposition of thought against sober tapestries of history. By contrast here we have bare snippets of the thought no scenery and only a vague history the man in soldier's costume alone enacting a WWI trench etc. It's called surreal more apt to simply call it unusual eccentric. What was missing from that series I felt was an inclusion of someone more recent and preferably from our own century. Fittingly the only one I found was on Wittgenstein who would have been my own choice as well. Incidentally Wittgenstein fits better than any other with what was delineated in the other project starting with Socrates drawing limits to reason as what can be reasonably said embodying what's on the other side.His disdain for philosophical noodling seen in the desire for a concrete logic refusal to bother with an academic knowledge of Aristotle and view that philosophy only creates muddles of thought in all these he can be seen to be in line with Socrates right down to the quest for a rigorous moral life.His algebraic formulations of logic have disappeared along with that whole school that depended on them for a mechanics of truth what still seduces is this the notion that we can strive to speak clearly about the things we can and more deeply something on the other side of that 'of which we must remain silent' opens itself to us. His project was perhaps obscure in details a bore but so amazingly attractive in its large span.And he does deserve a better film than this not because this one is eccentric by convention rather because the craft is too simple. It's not the fact that homosexuality is so central as many users complain either it is but the filmmaker resists implying this wholly explains the man it softens him if anything as someone who seeks his lover's hand in a dark theater but it's not said to be the real cause of tension that remains the quest for a life of clarity. We do get only a rough sketch of the thought but I urge you to bother with the film on Descartes I mention above three times the length and full of lengthy dissertation and you'll see no more than a sketch there either. It's after all the sketch of Wittgenstein's thought that seduces it's a clear picture. So it's not that either.No for me the real issue is that the cinematic medium offers a richer language the richest one we know next to personal experience to lightly sketch the air of those things of which logic can remain silent love doubt being all this wonderful ambiguity that opens to us. The man's project is the ideal opportunity for such examination.In other words it's not a fault for me that we learn too little about the real Wittgenstein to be able to explain him or too little of his words to know the thought and only barely enough Wittgenstein would probably balk at the thought that knowing more would explain a real him. But that we miss the richly layered picture that constitutes any life.The film ends with a powerful deathbed admission about exactly this the world that our modern mind logical obsessed with knowing attempts to freeze into sparkling ice but take a step onto the ice and you land on your back there's no friction no the real world where you can go places must be embraced with all its ambiguous friction.".

Wittgenstein came from Vienna born into an aristocracy that produced many geniuses in various mediums. Although his great mind would have no doubt seen him become prodigious in whatever he chose to do his real love was philosophy the only subject that gave him any true satisfaction. Through his publications and teachings at Cambridge he amassed an almost disciplelike following of those who understood his radical musings. Plagued with a psychological affliction that saw three of his brothers commit suicide he was often ashamed with his privilege and sought refuge in the working man who he romanticised through the literature of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.Most of that knowledge I gained from internet research after watching the film as Derek Jarman opts for a more interpretive approach  less of a timeline biopic and more of a quasiabstract work of art. Jarman strips back all conventional cinematic methods and employs a plain black background with the only presence on screen being the actors and few minimalistic props. He also ignores period detail having the characters dress in costumes from various periods often in bright outlandish colours using objects that had yet to be invented similar to his excellent Caravaggio 1986. This is successful in attempting to portray Wittgenstein's obviously haphazard look at the world almost like being trapped between his deep ideas and reality something that is observed by Maynard Keynes John Quentin later in the film but this also makes the film so visually unappealing that it can be rather dull like watching a small drama group enact a live play.Yet although the film is rather uninspirational in terms of cinematic techniques Wittgenstein is undoubtedly intriguing putting a fresh outlook on the tired subgenre of the biopic. Welsh actor Karl Johnson is fine in the role of Wittgenstein embodying the disconnection his character feels with the world. There is also fine support from Michael Gough Jarman's muse Tilda Swinton and Clancy Chassay playing the narrating young Wittgenstein. His life was rich and full of incident and Jarman's failure to really grasp the enormity of Wittgenstein makes the film ultimately a disappointment focusing mainly on his relationship with a young philosopher called Johnny Kevin Collins  as though Wittgenstein's torment could have been the result of sexual repression  and only the skimming the surface of his time fighting in World War II and the physical abuse he inflicted on his young pupils during his time as a schoolteacher. So Wittgenstein will remain somewhat an uncelebrated mystery even though he is remembered as one of the greatest in his fields by his peers.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Philosophy is by definition not impressionistic since it has to be logical and perfectly well organized in a rational way. Yet Derek Jarman dares to make a film on a philosopher and actually more on philosophy because the man himself seems to be in a way made secondary.Wittgenstein was obsessed with language but not as a tool to express some thoughts or concepts that was able to build itself and its own architecture along with the mind and the mind's architecture that carried language both through the very use of language and the mind themselves. Language is not seen as selfmade and selfmaking expressive tool used by discourse to enable human thought to emerge to build itself by expressing itself in communication. Language for him is a limitation. He considers logic is the acme of human intelligence not language and language does not contain the whole logic of the human mind even if it can express it. In fact he is a visual mind and he tries to express with words a logic he can represent in his mind's eye visually. He does not see that without language logic would never have been constituted. He ignores the fact that time space and logic are human inventions for the cosmic duration distance and orientation and dependent origination as the Buddhist would say for the last dimension and are nothing but models of what the human brain and mind can observe in the outside world. Wuttgenstein was a friend of Bertrand Russell but apparently he did not integrate Russell's lectures on logic delivered in the USA in the 1920s. Russell spent a tremendous amount of energy to demonstrate that what we get from the outside world is nothing but sensations and that these sensations are nothing if they are not interpreted in a way or another by the brainmind into perceptions. Russell could not know how the brain and mind did it but he knew that these perceptions in their turn should not be considered as the outside world. They were only humanly interpreted representations of the outside world and all our mental work is using these representations and not the real world. This means that these representations are models and models are nothing but metaphors they are or are behaving like the outside world more or less never entirely. And this is only possible because we have words and syntax and sentences and discourse to express these models that could not have been built or abstracted from the magma of our sensations without words sentences syntax and discourse. He sees that a dog is what a certain culture calls a dog more or less I will add. But he misses the other side of the word dog. It is a concept that is produced by man's power to conceptualize that is developing with age and training and that is deposited in our mind itself developing from brain work as some kind of virtual abstract complex totally human conceptualizing machine.But in Wittgenstein's vision language becomes a cage a prison in a way and our mind is like a parrot in a cage itself inside the cage in which we are imprisoned. Derek Jarman is quite right when he reduces Wittgenstein's thought to this image metaphor set of metaphors. And it is cruelly but realistically reducing Wittgenstein's thought to nothing but a set of words repeated without them being understood by the repeater. That is very sad.Hence Wittgenstein reduced intelligence to logic and then life to direct experience of the dirt dust and mud of the path. There is no way to articulate the real world onto the conceptualizing power of the brain mind. Then logic is not in anyway helping us to understand man's intelligence or man's consciousness. Logic becomes an escape from real dirty and muddy life and a straight jacket an escape into the straightjacket of what is socially acceptable and nothing else with a very limited lee way for those who are philosophers supposedly over and higher than normal simple ordinary people.He missed Russell's basic principle that life is life the evidence of the pudding is in me being able to eat it and logic is a conceptualized abstraction of a model from what we capture of the world through our senses for that to be interpreted and architecturally modelized by the brainmind.Descartes was seeing our existence in the fact that we were able to think. Wittgenstein went further in a way in identifying language but he did not see that we are not our language. Our language is produced by us in a social context and it may appear as a limitation grammar is fascist as is well known since 1968 though it is a tremendous power the power of abstraction and conceptualization that makes man the only being on earth able to create models of the outside reality that give him some power over this reality. The mind is not the parrot in a cage itself in a cage in which man is imprisoned and reduced to repeating words he has learned by heart. There is no parrot. There is no first cage. There is no second cage. There is selfcreating mind in each man whose experience determines what his mind is going to be or rather to become forever because its becoming will never stop just like the linguistic tool it uses.A beautiful attempt at making a film on such a subject but it remains dry and rather cold.

In Bamako also known as The Court Sisako has staged a mock trial of the IMF the World Bank and the other international financial institutions run by the rich countries that have perhaps contributed to the impoverishment and demographic ravaging of contemporary Africa more than they have helped the continent. This event takes place in the middle of a big busy square in a section of the capital of Mali Bamako. There is a whole panoply of characters  a beautiful queen bee an example of the grace and poise of African women Mel Aissa Maiga and her husband Chaka Tiecoura Traore. Mel's a popular singer whose marriage is disintegrating and two of her spirited songs are integrated into the film. People watch TV and the director ironically injects into his film a western set in Timbukto in which incongruous white men as well as Palestinian director Elia Suleiman and Bamako's producer Danny Glover shoot each other. The effect is grotesque but that's the point why should Africans be watching TV westerns? Elsewhere on the earthy set of the film there's a young man also beautiful who lies dying inside a nearby building with no medical care. There are many children some playing about some being breastfed. A couple marry and the festivities interrupt the trial. There's a flinty gatekeeper who decides who can come in and who can't. There's a traditional griot who's one of the witnesses and who ends the proceedings with a hypnotic chant not translated but strangely stirring and stunning. There's another witness  a former schoolteacher  so hopelessly demoralized he refuses to utter a word a sound recordist a video photographer who says he prefers to take pictures of the dead because they're more real and many authenticlooking extras including a variety of driedup tough youngold or ageless stickmen all of them coming and going. You get a vivid sense from all this which is rhythmically intercut with the trial itself of the harmonious seeming chaos of African village life the color the beauty and dignity of the people. You get above all a sense that life goes on. There are two white men on the stage of the trial one an advocate for the international organizations Roland Rappoport and the other William Bourdon eloquently speaking for the African people and for socialism who concludes that the first world should be sentenced to community service forever. Eloquent though he is a Malian woman lawyer who speaks after him Aissata Tall Sall is more touching. Like An Inconvenient Truth Bamako's trial presents facts and arguments of enormous present day importance  this time surrounding not global warming and the disintegration of the earth's ecosystem but another set of the planet's major problems the social imbalances the domination of the many by the few poverty and disease terrorism used to excuse world domination the richest nations' doing harm while seeming to do good the ravages of globalization the privatization of natural resources down to land and water perhaps ultimately to air the national debts of poor nations collected by the economic organizations of the rich ones and thereby preventing the poor ones from gaining any ground against the ravages of poverty and underdevelopment. . This is powerful stuff. Sisako is in theory presenting both sides of the story though it is obviously which side he is on and which side is in the majority on screen. This is polemic. The international organizations obviously aren't overtly setting out to destroy Africa  are they? It is preaching but it is done in a rich and colorful and dramatically moving way. The film picked up a US distributor during the New York Film Festival. It's not clear whether the way the print was presented was accurate. This seemed to be a projection of a digital copy that lost the surface beauty of the original. The colors of Jacques Besse's photography were beautiful but dimmed.

The movie is highly symbolic and we have to understand that the director is not trying to be realistic or straightforward. The trial that is taking place in a regular house yard is surrounded by the everyday lives of the people of Bamako. The result is moving beautiful and awakening experience.

	schema:reviewBody "Mauritanian director and writer Abderrahmane Sissako's Bamako will not be for everyone and by everyone I mean the majority of both mainstream American as well as European filmgoers. The film is of the kind that borders on documentary in its approach and general feel people talk for long periods about topics that a lot of us will have perhaps read about here and there in whatever news coverage it's been given in a respective country but few unless you're an avid follower of African politics and the financial state in Africa will have had as much exposure to the subject as you get in this film. In general there are long and detailed monologues on the subject of Africa's as a continent financial and general situation. It is a piece of work that teeters between documentation and a sheer out and out neorealist piece set amidst the locals going about their business.The title 'Bamako' is loud and proclaimed. The word is a proper noun  it is the capital city of Mali an African country and that is the tone for the film focusing on a courtroom based discussion regarding the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank a corporation set up to help fund developing or underfunded nations. The topic is straight forward the reason the state of many African nations are in the state they are. You can imagine it being a very personal subject to manyan African director but Sissako handles it very well and it resonates the film is not about one nation despite having the capital of a certain nation as its title but rather the state of a continent as a whole and the director doesn't focus on individual nations but gives everybody a voice.The courtroom of the title it has been released as here and there is really nothing more than a patch of sandy land in the middle of an urban area. The officials are all dressed smartly and each of them are both French and Caucasian. It's here I think Sissako places the audience into the bodies of these officials those that are of a 'Western' origin more than anything and those that must stand and listen to the African villagers state their cases to do with living conditions as well as both quality and amount of facilities they have available to them. It's here we feel as naive as the court officials perhaps as humbled as they are when people give their statements and accounts  some are loud and angry with a woman peeling off all these facts and figures for our benefit whereas others are quieter and more humbling but one such individual cannot say anything at all and this may be the most upsetting for most viewers.Perhaps there is a certain irony behind the most effective 'statement' being one delivered by someone who doesn't say anything at all given how the film likes its extended dialogue sequences. But I think that's down to good direction and good writing if anything the timing of the silence within the piece. Through the statements we find that the mere area is unhealthy and lacking medicine and places to earn a living something that should rebound on us when thinking of the bigger picture and how this is one area in Mali we're dealing with despite the hearing's overall link to the continent.One cannot talk about the film without mentioning the bizarre manner in which it veers off out of the world it's taken so much time in establishing and into something else. About half way through the film from memory we begin watching a film within a film  a daft looking Western starring Danny Glover which I suppose acts as the film's anchor around which the theme revolves. The western film is entitled 'Death in Timbuktu' a scathing reminder that 'death' is indeed happening all the time in Timbuktu a town in Mali more down to the malnutrition than trigger happy cowboys. It sees American and French actorscharacters struggling to deal with their surroundings which is a wired hybrid of the Old West and a typical African village with sandy terrain huts and everything else. The pitstop could be seen as a metaphor for Americans the French and Western economic powers in general struggling to deal with a 'problem' in Africa as lots of really unnecessary deaths keep happening  again in real life it's not death by a bullet as much as it is poor quality conditions.What I like about Bamako more than for instance 'Waking Life' is its approach. We're not being talked down to here and we're not following some daft trippy sequence of events that shows off what the latest computers are capable of. Instead we have a real situation being presented to us and arguments established before events developed. This isn't a lecture or a 'talking down to' of the audience this is reality made by someone who's been there and is producing a film that doubles as a statement. It won't be a film for everyone but the loose narrative to do with a breakup between two people offers us a fitting conclusion an individual reduced to tears as the emotion floods to the surface as they realise not only their life but the verdict surrounding the hearing is in a purgatory and the only outcomes are two extremes either way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bamako is a deeply personal docudrama that illuminates the destitute conditions of African people living in Mali. The story revolves around a village mock trial where African citizens are privileged to voice their political frustrations against a jury of bipartisan judges. Many of these frustrations deal with major social epidemics that Mali suffocates from including healthcare education poverty national debt privatization and disease. In this sense the story is simple in its structure yet the issues discussed by the citizens are vastly complex.It was rewarding to hear the testimonies of the citizens transcend the illiterate stereotype of Africans.

It requires a lot of mental exertion and contemporary socioeconomic knowledge to really understand what these people are talking about. With all of this heavy didactic conversation and exchange of intonated words the issues talked about would seem completely arbitrary to someone who was not educated. In fact the conversation would seem alienlike a jumbling mess of chaotic noises and sounds. The man who sings his testimony also appears alien to those who listen. He is merely personifying the chaos of political jargon he hears through an artistic expression of music. He too is plagued by a lack of education his song enters his listener's hearts on a level that is both metaphysical and political.Overall the citizens of Mali hide no pretense from where their problems arise but link much of their pauperization to corporate corruption in the West. Western ideals and social reforms that are inevitably forced upon their economy make Malians rightfully jaded towards the World Bank WTO G8 and other Western influences. The richer countries around the world feed like parasites upon the African economy pushing them deep into debt refusing to give financial aid until they conform to the Western ideal of privatization and ultimately drowning them in a sea of tyranny.I think the filmmakers choose to shoot this film like a documentary because it adds an objective lens to the reality of what these people actually suffer from. These issues are not fabricated to glamorize some type of Hollywood agenda but are reallife situations involving reallife people and they deserve the respect to be listened to in a real court of law. Sadly however they are not privileged with such a luxury. With filmmakers who care about their situation they are able to fabricate the form of a courthouse yet the content that is exchanged inside is painfully true.The film intercuts several narrative sketches throughout the mock trial giving examples of the types of lives the Malians live. One story focuses on the tension created between a father's temptation to leave his wife and child in order to pursue financial stability elsewhere while another focuses on the overall idle state of the citizens who hopelessly sit around listening to politics through a speaker. The sense of despair in both stories comes in direct consequence of Africa's relationship to the corrupting West. The reason why Africa hurts as much as she does is because of the neglect and maltreatment that larger dominating countries have subjected her to.One particular scene that demonstrates Africa's illfeelings towards the West is shown through the film Death at Timbuktu. The film shows cowboys come into a foreign town and essentially rape murder and pillage the people of their goods. Why?because they have the power to do so. This film seemed to suggest the brutality of Western Capitalism. How large domineering and privatized corporations come into small submissive and frail countries like Africa and essentially do exactly what the cowboys in the film didexploit and corrupt.Both filmsBamako and the film inside Bamako Death at Timbuktuseem to have a slight sense of propaganda behind them in order to awaken the injustices done to Africans and call for equal treatment opportunity and overall justice.".

	onyx:emotionText "Bamako is a deeply personal docudrama that illuminates the destitute conditions of African people living in Mali. The story revolves around a village mock trial where African citizens are privileged to voice their political frustrations against a jury of bipartisan judges. Many of these frustrations deal with major social epidemics that Mali suffocates from including healthcare education poverty national debt privatization and disease. In this sense the story is simple in its structure yet the issues discussed by the citizens are vastly complex.It was rewarding to hear the testimonies of the citizens transcend the illiterate stereotype of Africans. Though the majority of them use powerful rhetoric to emphasize and provide solutions to the problems their country faces there were two testimonies in particular that really stood out as powerful demonstrations of their impoverishment.

	schema:reviewBody "Dusk. A robed man walks into town leading us into the story. From here if you haven't read a review or a synopsis you will be quite baffled.Bamako is a courtroom drama shot mostly in the director's old family courtyard with a cast of judges 'witnesses' including professional lawyers actors and nonprofessional locals. Sissako says that he filmed the trial in which the World bank and the IMF are in the dock as he would a documentary. Scenes could not be interrupted even when a wedding party passes through the yard all four cameras and the sound man were on camera. There was even a 'cameraman' Falai who makes videos for the police and for weddings. This forms the main body of the film as witnesses stand up and make their accusations of neocolonialism including the rousing impassioned and eloquent speech made by a lawyer William Bourdon against the economic policies of the international financial agencies one witness who once on the stand finds himself unable to put his feelings into words and the elder who sings his evidence with a timeless voice the living antecedent of the blues and the call of the muezzin. Sissako gave his witnesses some of whom had been victims of the 'structural adjustments' of the World Bank and the IMF a lot of freedom in testifying accusing or defending so they were able to put all their genuine feelings into their 'testimonies'.In parallel to the courtroom lives are being lived outside even before we get to court a local singer the goddess Mele Aissa Maiga sings to camera but just as the band kicks in there is a cut to a sick child in bed her mother unable to afford medicine. Then there are women dying cloth a plot with a gun the wedding Mele's marriage to Chaka Tiecoura Traore getting shaky a little boy born too late sadly watching the goddess doing her hair and kids watching TV where there is a B western Death in Timbuktu. All these subplots were intended to be parables but the western looks most like one  the cowboys shooting down innocents until one of them Danny Glover turns on his fellows one played by Palestinian film director Elia Suleiman. With the multiethnic cowboy sequence Sissako says he wanted to point out that the 'West' isn't solely to blame for Africa's troubles.The tale is rounded off with another visit to the nightclub where Mele is allowed an entire song tearfully at first but triumphant in the end. It doesn't wind up in neat Hollywood style though even during the final song the camera cuts away to the sober 'reality' of life outside followed by a piece of drama that seems to sum up both the courtroom J'accuse polemics and the little parables. Being the wordy film that it is although its sentiments are right on it felt at least as long as it was. Perhaps a second look would feel better such a mixture of justified anger and fragrant warmth is rare. CLIFF HANLEY".

	schema:headline " An important Issue That Deserves a Much Better Forum";
	schema:reviewBody "This film has it's heart in the right place but unfortunately it isn't much of a film. It is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically a newspaper oped piece put on celluloid. However your average wellresearched oped piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of African life in particular the country of Mali due to the unethical practices of the IMF G8 and World Bank by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned. There is an extra 10 minutes dispersed throughout the film that makes a halfhearted attempt at a narrative plot and a bizarre Hollywood Westernstyle shootout scene where the director seems quite pleased with his own cleverness hence the frequent Godard comparisons.Of course as the film begins what and who is on trial is never explained but as we know by now the French refuse to spoonfeed their audience.There are many impassioned arguments made but they are often longwinded delivered in a shrill monotone one that becomes quite easy to tune out after awhile and very light on specifics. The last point is the most frustrating of all since there is a very wellreasoned specific case to be made against the institutions on trial here. Unfortunately all we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and G8 are evil oppressors and should forgive 3rdWorld debt. We are given no more than the occasional hint to the specific reasons why the organizations on trial are guilty but never a clear case. The mocktrial arguments and the footage of the surrounding village makes the suffering of these African residents clear but one wonders why we must sit through 2 hours of it when a far more precise picture could be painted in a 20minute Newsweek article or Bill Moyers episode. In the end there is something very important to be said on this issue it simply isn't presented very well or very clearly in this pretentious indulgent piece.".

	schema:headline " the most stylish and and politically charged film since Godard's Tout Va Bien";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Bamako acts as a stylish docudrama covering the issue of the African debt along with other political turmoil and daily Mali life in a quite brilliant marriage of the two in a storyline of a failing marriage coming to a close as a heated trial takes place in the courtyard outside of their home.Watching the film we witness a debate between parties over the accumulated debt owed to the World Bank IMF and other foreign aid and the subjugating and antiprogressive cycle in which they are now stuck taking place in a courtyard of Bamako Mali. The people of the court consist of both actors and actual activists a style of mixed filmmaking innovated by Werner Herzog and continually popularized by Harmony Korine. The trial performed in the traditionally Western means of democracy takes place in the midst of surviving African tradition and culture. Director Sissako further implements with increased power his argument against the discussed globalization with this reconciliation and at times even presents the hilarity of their coexistence i.e.  the fact this is in a courtyard and not a courtroom the elderly man who expects to be heard in his culture without permission to speak by a judge the toddler's squeaking shoes sounding off throughout eloquent speeches.One of the most interesting creative decisions of the filmmaking was the stylish inclusion of a film within the film an ironic western starring Danny Glover also a producer of the film and Palestinian director Elia Suleiman. Here again Sissako makes multiple uses of an item here with paralleling metaphors of pillaging bad guys as well as humorous parody of nonAmerican westerns popularized in Cambodia and Thailand see Tears of the Black Tiger a homage to Thai westerns in the 1950s though I am unsure if this is truly a popular genre of Mali. Sissako has also admitted that he chose a multiethnic cast for the western in illustrating that it was not solely the West to be blamed for the troubles of Africa. I also see that many of the other users' comments show that they missed the intent of this scene possibly because they don't expect such leveled humor from primitive Africa racists!.As a film geek I could continue to shower the film in technical praise the documentary style of filming adding a greater objectivity to the story the beautiful shots like the man reclining beneath the rusty amplifier sounding the song of the old man in court the silent testimony of the schoolteacher etc. However I will stay objective in discussion of the film's politics. The film's points are clear. The foreign solution to poverty increased Mali's poverty due to privatization and lost government jobs. The foreign solution to its economic growth has hindered such growth by creating a structure dependent on exports and suffocating it with the accumulating interest of the debt. The sad excuse for a reduction of the debt is laughable as a solution. In other words the cowboys were shooting aimlessly at nothing.".

	schema:headline " Death in Timbuktu";
	schema:reviewBody "Abderrahmane Sissako directs Bamako a film whose title refers to the capital city of Mali. Beginning at dawn Bamako is an allegory in which the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are put on trial for destroying Mali and by extension continental Africa. Here lawyers civilians and civil leaders all act as either prosecutors or defence attorneys.The film eventually becomes a damning indictment of both the IMF and the World Bank. Fingers are pointed at the World Trade Organization the G8 and the pay or die mentality of the West all of which have helped lock Africa into a vicious circle of debt. 40 percent of the continent's annual budget we learn now goes toward repayments. These repayments are themselves endless as interest rates are forever escalating.To make matters worse borrowed aid money comes attached to all manners of stipulation. End result aid is used not for the creation of jobs for locals but for the betterment of multinational companies who simply do and seize what they wish. Meanwhile all the continent's public institutions and social services are being sold off to the highest bidders who then go on to charge illiterate locals for basic amnesties food water education healthcare etc. This new form of Colonialism the film shows breeds debt forces aid conditionalities and always results in economic restructuring and widespread privatisation.Before it ends the film touches upon the threats the IMF and World Bank have become adept and dishing out. Such threats ensure that the world is open for the free movement of certain people but not Africans who are swiftly sent back home should they try to emigrate. Likewise the film touches upon the way the World Bank threatens to withdraw financial support should its demands not be met and the various sanctions and crippling free trade laws routinely forced upon the continent.The film was shot on a low budget but it's paced well and its dialogue manages to grip. Unlike say 12 Angry Men the film occasionally breaks away from its claustrophobic court setting to meditate upon Africa's gentle beauty. Though at times poetic the film is also didactic too polemical and preaches to its own choir. It was a big hit in France.7.910  Worth one viewing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Abderrahmane Sissako directs Bamako a film whose title refers to the capital city of Mali. Beginning at dawn Bamako is an allegory in which the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are put on trial for destroying Mali and by extension continental Africa. Here lawyers civilians and civil leaders all act as either prosecutors or defence attorneys.The film eventually becomes a damning indictment of both the IMF and the World Bank. Fingers are pointed at the World Trade Organization the G8 and the pay or die mentality of the West all of which have helped lock Africa into a vicious circle of debt. 40 percent of the continent's annual budget we learn now goes toward repayments. These repayments are themselves endless as interest rates are forever escalating.To make matters worse borrowed aid money comes attached to all manners of stipulation. End result aid is used not for the creation of jobs for locals but for the betterment of multinational companies who simply do and seize what they wish. Meanwhile all the continent's public institutions and social services are being sold off to the highest bidders who then go on to charge illiterate locals for basic amnesties food water education healthcare etc. This new form of Colonialism the film shows breeds debt forces aid conditionalities and always results in economic restructuring and widespread privatisation.Before it ends the film touches upon the threats the IMF and World Bank have become adept and dishing out. Such threats ensure that the world is open for the free movement of certain people but not Africans who are swiftly sent back home should they try to emigrate. Likewise the film touches upon the way the World Bank threatens to withdraw financial support should its demands not be met and the various sanctions and crippling free trade laws routinely forced upon the continent.The film was shot on a low budget but it's paced well and its dialogue manages to grip. Unlike say 12 Angry Men the film occasionally breaks away from its claustrophobic court setting to meditate upon Africa's gentle beauty. Though at times poetic the film is also didactic too polemical and preaches to its own choir. It was a big hit in France.7.910  Worth one viewing.";

A trial is taking place on the one side those representing the ordinary people of Africa on the other those representing the organisations they hold responsible for the national debts that keep the people impoverished. While the trial progresses we meet various characters some are witnesses others are ordinary people going about their lives.This is an interesting film even though we know such a trial would never take place and if it did it wouldn't be in a public courtyard... that isn't really a problem though. The case raises some important issues about how African nations are treated however it does feel too polemic at times this is especially the case when a French lawyer rails against the World Bank the IMF and the west in general towards the end... the earlier more personal testimonies from affected Africans felt far more relevant. I liked the little details away from the details of the trail a policeman has his gun stolen while he had a nap a singer plans to move to Senegal and locals watch 'Death in Timbuktu' a pseudospaghetti western starring Danny Glover... this section was particularly inventive as we switch to watching this film within the film for several minutes. Overall I'd say this was fairly interesting but I felt it would have been more interesting if we'd seen more of people's ordinary lives and a little less of the trial.".

In reality they are the ones responsible for many of these countries and they should be spearheading and organizing efforts to help them develop to a decent standard of living. The US as the country which benefited the most from the pillage of Africa and still does should contribute the most of course. It is understood it was unknown what was going to happen after decolonization and there were a lot of bad feelings at the time the cold war and so on. But now 50 years later it should be obvious to everyone that those countries need help and that Reaganomics make no sense in countries which don't a strong economy and a strong judicial to begin with. It's about time the Western countries start repairing the damage. Erasing the debt doesn't begin to cover it. They also have to build schools hospitals provide medications train administrators subsidize local entrepreneurs and everything else these countries need until they have an economy which can sustain itself. Make no mistake. After the Africans also overthrow their corrupted leaders like the Arabs did they will be asking for these things and they won't be fooled by a few good words from a black US president or a French socialist at the IMF. The West needs to get its act together. Someone please get Sarkozy and Obama to watch this movie.".

It was also more ridiculous than any spaghettiWestern I've ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a Caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever. Perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it is unintentionally killing Africans.And one last technical parting shot the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselves.I've already summarized the movie for you.

Also moving is the old man the griot chanting his accusations which as noted by another viewer are not translated. The director explained this by saying that the griot is speaking a southern dialect that the people in the city don't understand. But the photojournalist who says he prefers to film funerals because the dead speak the truth is more enigmatic.

Just a note on the Black  White photography. Pity that better care wasn't given to the film stocks used for the release prints. They seem to have blue tint to them so you don't get the full dark blacks and bright whites of true BW film stock.

	schema:headline " An interesting biopic about the pin up girl Bettie Page and shows how far we have come in terms of sexuality in America.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Notorious Bettie Page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U.S Senate investigation in the 1950s.Walking out of the film all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s. You can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in The Notorious Bettie Page seems almost childlike and innocent. Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals. I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography it was very tastefully done.To be honest I was pretty impressed with The Notorious Bettie Page I found the film to be very well done and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance. I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s.My only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been. I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival. Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the film left off. Those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially Gretchen and the writing was good.Mary Harron who directed American Psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of The Notorious Bettie Page. I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like Psycho Bettie Page is a character study and a fine one at that. Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters.

It's a very interesting story that shows how far America as well as the world has come in terms of pornography. The film also provides a fine performance by Gretchen Mol who literally nails the role of Bettie Page on the head. And top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands. Sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but I think it's worth checking out.MovieManMenzel's final rating for The Notorious Bettie Page is a 810. It's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Notorious Bettie Page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U.S Senate investigation in the 1950s.Walking out of the film all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s. You can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in The Notorious Bettie Page seems almost childlike and innocent. Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals. I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography it was very tastefully done.To be honest I was pretty impressed with The Notorious Bettie Page I found the film to be very well done and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance. I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s.My only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been. I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival. Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the film left off. Those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially Gretchen and the writing was good.Mary Harron who directed American Psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of The Notorious Bettie Page. I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like Psycho Bettie Page is a character study and a fine one at that. Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director who I hope will be around for many years to come.Bottom Line The Notorious Bettie Page is definitely worth a look. It's a very interesting story that shows how far America as well as the world has come in terms of pornography.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by HBO to be shown on their cable network sometime this year. This movie presents Page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and BD stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50's pinup icon. This film is supposedly based on the book The Real Bettie Page by Richard Foster. It's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel. I have the book called Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of Page and I must say that this movie reproduces on film with Gretchen Mol as Page many of those famous photo's very accurately. Mol herself with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does she have the Bettie Page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect. And her body is as close to a replica of Page's as possible. Terrific casting. The story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better. But this is a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it a 7.0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it's viewing when it comes on TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With The Notorious Bettie Page she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her cowriter Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie's life were all the film was concerned about then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III she accomplishes this goal admirably holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own enlightened 21st Century attitudes towards socalled pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism this is a film needed more than ever.".

The movie cowritten and directed by American Psycho's Mary Harron fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough. A southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in New York City where she gets into modeling and from there a lot more. Soon she becomes the underground pinup sensation with bondage the obvious and notorious of the title trait attributed to her. The actress Gretchen Moll portrays her and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could which is really a lot of the success of the film. She's not a simplistic character even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable well Adam and Eve were naked weren't they? she comments a couple of times. Apparently the filmmakers leave out the later years of Page's life and leave off with her in a kind of redemptive period leaving behind the photo shoots for Jesus.In all the Notrious Bettie Page is not much more than a kind of usual biopic presented by HBO films albeit this time with the stamina for a featurefilm release. The best scenes that Harron captures are Page in her questionable positions getting photos of her in overthetop poses and starring in ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms. This adds a much needed comic relief to the film's otherwise usual nature. It's not that the story behind it is uninteresting which involves the government's investigation into the 'smut' that came out of such photos and underground magazines. But there isn't much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at with Page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties. It's all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if Harron was progressing some of the black and white photos to be tinted more as it went along. It's a watchable view if you're not too knowledgeable of Bette Page and probably for fans too.".

Here as the famous pinup queen Bettie Page Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star on the rise.Bettie Page was Tennessee born raised as a Godfearing and family oriented proper girl who seemed to find herself the unwarranted object of lust and affection as she grew older. A gangrape that is flashbacked is wisely not graphically depicted nor is the subtle showing of her own father having less thandecent designs for his own kin which is important to understand how Page managed to escape the possible nightmarish life for a career as an actress by heading to New York City in the 1950s when in fact that was the time and place to be to catch lighting in a bottle. What Page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived.A beautiful raven haired sweetheart with a divine figure Page is spotted on Coney Island one summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photograph which leads to her posing in his basement and eventually to the studios of Irving Klaw Bauer and his sister Paula Taylor who cater their kitschy but considered pornographic stills to a unique clientele fetish types.Although Page is rather nave she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control  or at least abides in what is offered her as work in that it is not indecent and she is having fun in her increasingly lessclothed portraits  until a Congressional witchhunt seeks out a few scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. Talented filmmaker Mary Harron and her screen writing partner Guinevere Turner An American Psycho and I Shot Andy Warhol streamline the biopic trappings rather neatly and maybe a bit too hasty in getting at who really was Bettie Page although they do justice in depicting an era of uptightness at its zenith. Large thanks to gifted cinematographer Mott Hopfel for his languorously gorgeous black and white images and also the sprinkled color segments that recall Douglas Sirk films of the era for its melodramatic kindlings. Part feminist treaty and part American dream fulfilled the story chugs along nicely with fine performances by its ensemble including the comical Bauer and Taylor as siblings in smut and Harris having a field day as a fellow fotog with a taste for wine and chatter. It's amusing to see Strathairn in a bit of stunt casting as a senator on a campaign for righteousness after portraying news bulldog Edward R.

Mol is perfect and uncannily resembles her portrait's subject down to her knowingteasing smile. The real Bettie Page was reportedly not involved with the project but apparently gave her blessing and continues to live a somewhat secluded life that is alluded to in the final moments as to having found Jesus and shirking her 'notorious' image once and for all. A shame since this film oddly embraces the resounding decency imbued within its subject radiating for all to see in its naked splendor.".

Ms. Harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion. Along with V for Vendetta it is a movie about another time for our times.Few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in Notorious through transcription of the very words uttered in closed Senate committee hearings is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now. While Ms. Harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film her faithfulness to the facts and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them synchronizes Notorious with the present day. The very acts that Notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the Communications Decency Act recently brought to the Supreme Court as a First Amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the Bush administration. In other words the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in Notorious is indictable today by Federal prosecutors in whatever hostile jurisdiction they choose. Of course there were no hearings in the Senate or elsewhere on this matter when the CDA was passed. Of course you know nothing about it because you don't want people in Peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at likewise people in Peoria probably don't want me telling them what they're allowed to view. Of course Notorious will never be indicted. It's Hollywood. It's lawyered up. Countless Klaws will however continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic moral or biological composition much in 50 years.In addition Notorious posts no 18 USC 2257 compliance statement which is mandated by the unnoticed earmark recently voted into law. If any media contains images of sadomasochistic restraint it is required to make available ex warrant records of age and circumstance of all performers. Notorious fails in this regard also.In addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an nearly accurate historical document Notorious will be the litmus against which the Bush Justice Department is itself judged with respect to the 14th Equal Protection Amendment and on perhaps several other Constitutional grounds. In this regard alone a debt of gratitude is owed Mary Harron. You'll be grateful in any case Constitutional or otherwise if you see this film.".

In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse domestic violence and a gang rape but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again. You get the impression that Harron and Guinevere Turner cowriter wanted to gloss over anything that wasn't glamorous and flattering. You go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots.All in all the film really frustrates you as you watch desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself. How did she balance her religion with her job? What made this young Tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography. The film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever she's told but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation this was after all the 50s.It seems to me that Harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today's standards Page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous And although this is true she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others. Today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience. This woman was a central part of a Senate hearing on Juvenile Delinquency but no one is ever really shown as shocked.Basically I left this film just thinking how tame it was. Harron and Turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer. They come across as two lifelong fans of Miss Page and are desperate to make sure that nothing absolutely nothing could possibly put a bad light on their heroine and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was. Before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems And all that's left is the string of events that made up her career without any substance whatsoever behind it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've known about Bettie Page for many a year now. The softcore porn images of her from the 1950's have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today. The Bettie Page look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then. So I watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with. The result did not disappoint.Among other things it was hugely entertaining to see the movie's recreation of actual figures like Irving Klaw John Willie and Bunny Yeager  all consider trailblazers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950's America along with a sexuality that by today's standards was innocent in the extreme. I particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate Bettie found herself in.I think that Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of Bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naivet. Bettie loved to look pretty loved the attention saw nothing wrong with nudity and enjoyed dressing up in silly outfits for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her. To this day she still doesn't understand what all the fuss was about when it comes to her pictures or the SM content of them.This isn't to say she's uneducated or too simple to understand it's just that she simply doesn't get it about fetishism and never will. No harm there. Bettie Page is simply being who she is. The film captured this quite nicely.The social atmosphere of the 1950's depicted by Ms. Harron and written by her along with Guinevere Turner makes me truly glad I live in the day and age that I do. The hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world. The film well captures this and brings to cheering as Bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naivet.This film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points Ms. Harron attempted and hit them well. I'd recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect she had on American culture. For those with such interests then this film is a must see.".

Bettie Page saw the movie at Hugh Heffner's house she is now eightythree with the producers there but not the director in case it got awkward if she didn't like it. She apparently did like it up until the official inquiry which she found unsettling. Some great costumes too. The idea for the movie started in 1993 but this was worth the wait. The portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those images and snippets of dreadful movies that many of us will have already seen. It would make an interesting companion piece with Goodnight and Goodluck but much more pleasant viewing!".

A nave gal from Tennessee churchgoing and raised by a strict mother hits New York City in 1949 after walking out on her marriage to an abusive soldier. Bettie wins a few modest beauty contests before stepping into her future role as a pinup model for men's entertainment magazines with times and tastes quickly changing however the era of the cheesecake photo passes and Bettie smoothly segues into a harder type of pornography bondage photos and light SM shorts. Nothing in this girl's life appears to happen according to a plan...it's all serendipitous. Bettie is asked You wanna try this? or Can you do something like this? and her answer is always Sure why not! To her it was all fun and games accompanied by a big country smile and an innocent shrug. When her steady fellow points out to her how disreputable her SM photos are her answer is to fly off to Miami Beach where she picks up a muscleboy and dances under the stars. Are we to assume Bettie was not so sweet and innocent that she knew exactly what she was doing? A flashback to Page's childhood suggests a certain looseness already forming also a hint of sexual abuse by a man who appears to be her father. The subplot about a formal investigation into smutpeddlers is a squashy mess and the blackandwhite cinematography is mostly disappointing. Still Gretchen Mol is something else entirely creating a genuine character out of this noodleheaded script shows true talent and she matches up with our memories of the legendary Bettie Page quite nicely. We never feel anything for this Bettie we're never moved by her sordid upsanddowns though that's due to the handling. Mol rises above the sloppy material and gives it more than just a nostalgic kick. She's in the spirit even if the rest of the picture could certainly use some soul.  from ".

And since the movie follows her we don't get much insight beyond the superficial into either her emotions or the world she's a part of. What we do get are miles of titillating footage of Bettie posing in various stages of undress. That's okay to a point but then what's the point of the film beyond that of exploiting an underground icon for titillation purposes. At least the screenplay has the good sense to resist passing judgment on her career and thus on itself.

	schema:reviewBody "On the 26th of September 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of Leonie Haddad a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly. Haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had in fact come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. Haddad soon realised that something was 'rotten in Denmark' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about' seven Gods'. Haddad's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that God has inspired me to kill you. Haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. It was a miracle she survived. The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent kicking and screaming back to the laughing academy. Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the 'Queen of the Curve's the 'Tennessee Tease' and 'Miss Pin Up Girl of the World'  the Notorious Bettie Page. Director Mary Harron mainly known for 'American Psycho' takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model played solidly enough by Gretchen Mol who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks. T.N.B.P is dayglo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the1950's where Page with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers becomes the number one star of pocket sized men's glossies with titles like Wink Tab and Parade. Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God. The overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father's incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her. Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs happy carefree and fun  even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. The film ends on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her avoiding what I think is the essential core of Page's story  rebirth and resurrection. Having emerged from a decade of incarceration Page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980's and that she had become a huge underground icon during which many were asking whatever happened to Bettie Page. Her 'mysterious' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend. When the world's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines T.V and being photographed at Playboy parties with the likes of Pamela Anderson and the equally tragic Anna Nicole Smith. She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her 'glory years' but in the glare of this 'resurrection' it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light.The only notorious thing about The Notorious Bettie Page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there's one genre that I've never been a fan of it's the biopic. Always misleading filled with false information overdramatized scenes and trickery all around biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese The Aviator and Ron Howard A Beautiful Mind they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part. I never doubted Mol could handle the part since but I never expected to as blown as away by her performance as I was upon just viewing the film hours ago. Mol delivers a knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pinup girl who after an early life of abuse depicted subtlety and tastefully done something few directors would probably do inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time. The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story. Directorcowriter Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. Still credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully. Come Oscar time Mol Turner and Harron should be receiving nominations. Doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them. 910".

Always misleading filled with false information overdramatized scenes and trickery all around biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese The Aviator and Ron Howard A Beautiful Mind they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different.

It simply wasn't believable that Bettie Page was so galactically stupid that she wasn't aware that her work was targeted toward sexual gratification of fetishists but was simply dressing up in costumes and having fun. Her constant surprise at being objectified by weirdos really struck a false note with me also her intense religious upbringing and mental instability were glossed over or ignored. Gretchen Mol certainly looked the part however it doesn't really take a good actress to portray a bad actress.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was at the small gathering at Hef's house for this movie. In fact I had dinner with Bettie just before the movie. We were both Southerners and enjoyed each others' company in a well connected conversation about alternative medicine and spirituality. After dinner we went into Hef's screening room. I always sit directly in front of Hef's sofa nearest to the screen. Bettie was several rows back in a chair. All was fine until the rape scene. Betty screamedNo! No! from the back of the room and ran out through the lobby outside and into an SUV. I followed her. She let me into the SUV with her and I proceeded to calm her down. She was cryingNo one was supposed to know that! Apparently only Bettie and one other person a relative knew about the gang rape. She was very upset and felt betrayed that her lifelong secret had been exposed and she had to witness it in a room full of strangers. Hef never did come out to see what was going on. Richard Bann a long timer at Hef's did come out. My friend Elliot Silverstein director of Cat Ballou and A Man Called Horse came out. I waved them away. I sat and talked to Bettie for quite a while until her driver appeared and took her away. For ANYONE to say this movie pleased Bettie and she liked it is not true! And whoever wrote that was NOT in the room when this film premiered at Hef's. I was there. I sat in the car with this marvelous woman then in her 80s and held her hand as she cried. That is the God's honest truth. My heart went out to her. She truly felt that Hollywood had beaten her down yet again.".

	schema:headline " A Cliffs Notes version of Bettie's life.";
	schema:reviewBody "Although The Notorious Bettie Page is well acted and shot is is at best a Cliffs Notes version of Bettie's biography. The film mainly centers on her work with Irving and Paula Klaw the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos. It does not detail her life after posing aside from her religious rebirth. It cites The Real Bettie Page by Richard Foster as a source but it ignores Bettie's later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital. The narrow focus of the biography can be debated but the majority of Bettie's fans and the civilians would probably be more interested in her modeling career which is what they get.The film is well acted with Gretchen Mol faithfully reproducing the look of Bettie as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded. The character is played as rather naive a probable byproduct of interviews given by Bettie in recent years. It is more likely that Bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumes.The supporting cast is also outstanding with Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor playing Irving and Paula Klaw and David Strathairn as Estes Kefauver. The film errs with the character of John Willie played by Jared Harris. John Willie never met Bettie Page and was not involved in photo shoots with the Klaws. Harris plays Willie a bit like Peter O'Toole in his more debauched state.Despite the quality of acting the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth. The story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know Bettie. Much like her photos it's just an image. It does tend to exaggerate Bettie's notoriety. Her photos were mainly seen in and around New York in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications. Her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late 70's and 80's and the Cult of Betty Page as her name was usually spelled grew. Bettie's greatest exposure pardon the pun was in Playboy appearing in the January 1955 issue the Christmas photo which is staged in reverse in the film.The film is well done if rather shallow. It is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances. It hits the high points of Bettie's life but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth. The ending is rather a let down. It feels rather abrupt. Still the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in Bettie or even the time period. The soundtrack is great really pulling the viewer into the 1950's. If nothing else the film stands as a showcase for America's burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its Puritan past. It's also a peek at an icon for both men and women.".

Whereas Gable exuded some real menace and had no intention of leaving the rackets Lamas actually wants to quit and settle down.Of course the racism in The Girl Who Had Everything just bubbles over. Lamas apparently really does want to leave but Powell is a snob and he's ready to violate lawyerclient privilege and testify himself before the Senate hearing as to Lamas's criminal enterprises. This would in fact get him disbarred in any state in the Union and the District of Columbia a fact the film doesn't mention.As for Lamas's associates they take the attitude of once in never out and deal with it accordingly. Wrongly in my opinion but that's the fault of a very confused script.This rehash of A Free Soul is only 69 minutes long my guess the shortest feature film Elizabeth Taylor was ever in. She tries but does not come close to what Norma Shearer did in the original version.And Gig Young as her society boyfriend repeating the role that Leslie Howard had has very little to do but look concerned and issue grave warnings about getting mixed up with those kind of people.Dore Schary was unloading all of MGM's big stars from its golden era and The Girl Who Had Everything was the kiss off to William Powell. He looks plain bored with the whole thing and who could blame him. He had two more films in him as a free lance star How to Marry a Millionaire and Mr. Roberts both infinitely better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though this movie lacks the menace and seediness of A Free Soul it nonetheless shares the blazing sensuality that we saw between Clark Gable and Norma Shearer in 1931 in Fernando Lamas and the impossibly gorgeous 22 yr old Taylor.When contrasted with A Free Soul which is hard not to since the film was so sexy and frank and Lionel Barrymore's performance won him an Oscar the story in The Girl Who Had Everything is pretty slim. A few reviews mentioned this was MGM's kiss goodbye to 61 yr old William Powell who'd been with the studio since 1934 and it looks it. The sets are pretty stripped down and simple with minimal outdoor shotsbut that's not to say the movie looks cheap because even at programmer status the MGM gloss remained.Taylor is perfect as a willful headstrong Jean Latimer and her growth from spoiled immature flirt to a sobered woman is powerful. Though mores of the 1950s are ever present the double standards when it comes to female sexuality remaina man can be a free soul without suffering the consequences a woman will and Jean and her father Steve are forced to realize that she cannot live life the way he has despite his raising her to be independent and free.Where this film falls short in comparison to its source material is the 1950s Code Era ending where Lamas gets his comeuppance through his gangster associations rather than the result of Jean's honor being defended by her fianc.Gig Young is woefully underused here was the movie cut down? and Fernando Lamas for all his intensity is a standard Latin lover.However this is an entertaining film and if anyone manages to get a hold of this and A Free Soul watching both is an interesting study in changing mores as well as what was permissible in the PreCode era.".

	schema:headline " Decent Remake with Great Cast";
	schema:reviewBody "The Girl Who Had Everything 1953  12 out of 4 Decent remake of A FREE SOUL has William Powell playing a lawyer who gets his scumbag client Fernando Lamas off some serious charges only to live to regret it when his spoiled daughter Elizabeth Taylor starts to date him. The lawyer tries to talk some sense into his daughter but as the title says he's always given her everything she's wanted so she's not willing to take his advice. This MGM production had big shoes to fill as the original 1931 version featured Lionel Barrymore playing the role of the father which ended up getting him the Oscar and it also featured Norma Shearer as his daughter and Clark Gable in the role of the gangster. Both versions have good and bad things so it's really hard to compare the two as this one here at least changes up quite a bit of things including the ending and also missing are various courtroom scenes. It's funny to see such a powerful cast and then watch the movie and realize that this is basically a B picture that doesn't have any of the lavish production that you'd expect from the studio and the cast. This actually somewhat helps the film because we never get too much melodrama although it's constantly on display. Thankfully the film runs a short 69minutes and it doesn't overstay its welcome at that time but had this thing gone on another twenty minutes or so then it would have been a lot less entertaining. The best thing going for the movie are the three lead performances. Powell didn't get to show off his dramatic skills too often but he's very believable here and manages to turn in a fine performance. Taylor is as beautiful as always and also manages to turn in a good performance. Lamas was the real scenestealer as he's perfect in the role of the gangster who lets his guard down. Gig Young and James Whitmore are both good in their supporting roles. As I said there's certainly plenty of melodrama here and while there aren't as many hardhitting scenes this remake does offer up a few good things including a rather brutal finale that you'll see coming a mile away but it still hits home. While the movie is predictable there's no question that it's worth seeing thanks in large part to the terrific cast.".

	schema:headline " Mediocre remake of a juicier precode film with glossy MGM production.";
	schema:reviewBody "Who better to take on the role of Norma Shearer's heroine of 1931's A Free Soul than Elizabeth Taylor? 22 years after that film starring the queen of the studio at that time MGM remade it with one of their three reigning queens of the early 50's Ava Gardner and Lana Turner being the others. What they did to Adela St. John's story was shrink it down to 69 minutes and taking a bite out of it that leaves it seeming a bit inconclusive.In A Free Soul rebellious society girl Shearer got involved with a gangster Clark Gable leaving her fiance Leslie Howard high and dry and upsetting her attorney father Lionel Barrymore who once defended Gable. That story remains with Taylor Fernando Lamas Gig Young and William Powell in the roles listed by actor in the order of the characters in the synopsis above. Taylor and Powell reunited from 1947's Life With Father are perfect replacements for Shearer and Barrymore who won an Oscar for his powerful performance and leave the other two actors on the skids. Lamas tries to make his character multidimensional but he is too easy to see through. It is understandable that two extremely attractive people like Lamas and Taylor would fall into bed with each other left to the imagination here but how Taylor much feistier than Shearer would consider marrying such an obvious scumbag makes her more The Girl Who Had Everything but Smarts.Powell is still dashing almost 20 years after teaming with Gable and Myrna Loy in MGM's 1934 gangster classic Manhattan Melodrama. He gives the film's best performance but sadly it lacks the trial scene that Barrymore won the Oscar for in the first place. The ending here comes too swift to be satisfying. While at the height of her young adult beauty Taylor is forced to wear far too much eye makeup which hides the natural beauty of those violet peepers. Gig Young's character is never fleshed out enough making him a one dimensional opposite of Lamas's scoundrel. The film is too well cast to be one of MGM's B outputs of the early TV era and that makes it obvious why this is considered no classic. Still the MGM gloss shines through and any film with Taylor and Powell is worth a viewing or two.".

What they did to Adela St. John's story was shrink it down to 69 minutes and taking a bite out of it that leaves it seeming a bit inconclusive.In A Free Soul rebellious society girl Shearer got involved with a gangster Clark Gable leaving her fiance Leslie Howard high and dry and upsetting her attorney father Lionel Barrymore who once defended Gable.

His lawyer played by William Powell in the role that earned Lionel Barrymore an Oscar manages to help him escape prosecution. Soon Lamas' character is involved with Powell's daughter Elizabeth Taylor taking over the part originated by Norma Shearer.

Fernando Lamas is fine as the hoodlum love interest. Both Fernando Lamas and Elizabeth Taylor look incredibly beautiful and sexy! James Whitmore is surprisingly good as the best friend but a part of the syndicate . This is one of his early films but he carries himself wonderfully! This film is not heavy on depth as many of the classic films of the 1950's are known have. I enjoyed myself. The film held my interest. 5 out of 10 stars!".

Action sequences are spaced every ten minutes or so as bookends to move Cube onto the next dilemma each new sequence becoming further and further detached from reality the final twenty minutes is utter insanity that makes films like Charlie's Angels Full Throttle seem like documentaries. A sequence involving a train should be parody material not a serious plot device.Samuel L Jackson cashes in his paycheck and plods through the movie looking as though he just read the script and realized what he has got himself involved in. Scott Speedman's looks too immature to play a senior NSA agent and is largely in the film so the white folks don't feel left out. Willem Dafoe typecasts himself as the overacting bad guy yet again and XZibit pops in so he can possible audition for the lead in the next sequel xXx3 Turkey Season.Women are treated as fodder to either slap around or grind up against sometimes at the same time all to a soundtrack of nameless rappers inserted at appropriate moments so that the white kids can know what its like to be African American.My only positive comment on this whole debacle are the cars used in the film not being a car enthusiast even I had to be quietly impressed by the rides in this film. Also this film is under the 2 hour mark a sign of a film that does know when its wearing out its welcome.Hopefully with the resoundingly negative response xXx2 has currently received another sequel looks unlikely as films like this are about as satisfying as a having your nose broken.".

In fairness to Mr. Cube he's far from the only thing wrong with this Simon Kinberg's screenplay seems not only to have been aimed at emotionally and intellectually stunted 13yearolds but written by them as well with the plot starting idiotically and continuing from there  the villainous Secretary of Defence played by Willem Dafoe is so pantomime villainous that when he makes a speech to Jackson you're surprised he doesn't laugh maniacally.Suspending disbelief is one thing but when you have a movie that expects people to believe that tanks can be handled like motorbikes... and which works in such daft plot turns as characters having their deaths faked just so they can be around for the climax why not just kill them there?... and that has a finale which depends on a car and a Presidential bullet train being able to fit on the same track despite the car being a compact if speedy sports car... in this case it's just impossible. Admittedly it doesn't help that said scenes are incompetently executed thanks to shockingly bad special effects and shoddy direction some of the miniatures are glaringly obvious and I particularly hope that lead effects house Industrial Light and Magic didn't do the CGI bullet train shots. And as for the way some of the shots go from film to what looks like video and back again...The cast isn't much good either although it's fun to see Peter Strauss as the President in spite or because of his not sounding like he believes a word of this Xzibit not only helps parts of this seem like Pimp My Ride The Movie but he can't act Dafoe is Special Guest Villain level and Jackson phones it in. As for the female characters Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey are pretty much defined by their cleavage and by the fact that one's good and the other the one who looks like a cross between Nicolette Sheridan and Rachel Bilson isn't. The movie can't even be laddish properly for some reason the sexiest woman in the movie Masuimi Max who plays Xzibit's girlfriend and who helps out with the robbery of the artillerycarrying cheese truck isn't listed in the credits. And the tiresome crowbarredin rap numbers don't help certainly not compared to Marco Beltrami's score. Ironically at one point on hearing the female string quartet Bond our hero complains about the music they are not to blame for the aural wrongs.xXx2 Whatever is so unexciting and so absurd that despite its stabs at relevance our hero claims Dafoe is hatching World War IV the only way to get through it is as a laugher the sight of Ice Cube in a suit and tie with umbrella! is funnier than his intentional attempt at comedy later in the same scene. To make it worse the last scene leaves the door wide open for a third movie... if it does happen why not cast Scarlett Johansson or Charlotte Church as the new Triple X?

	schema:headline " Best comedy of the year......for all the wrong reasons";
	schema:reviewBody "If you're thinking of seeing this stop just a minute. What could you do with the two hours of your life that this is likely to take up? You could write a short story you could do a drawing you could father some children or you could remove your own intestines with a rusty spoon. All of these activities would be a lot more worthwhile than seeing xXx 2 State of the union or The Next Level if you live in Blighty like me. I went to see this with high hopes that it would be another xXx... A mindless American James Bond Movie just without the class sorry if i offend anyone by that but thats is essentially what xXx was. But I was so wrong.The film opened promisingly showing something that wasn't what it seemed but despite this being a film about setups and double crosses that was possibly the best plot twist in the whole film. The film rapidly descends into clich after clich the script seems to have been created by entering lots of clichd lines into a computer and programming it to spit them out randomly. The plot is riddled with holes which leave you wondering what just happened and was it significant then later on you find out that it wasn't. In terms of acting Ice Cube is brilliant....at saying every line in exactly the same way. The great Samuel L gives an average performance but he could have just telephoned his lines in and it wouldn't really have made much difference. Willem Dafoe give us a generic bad guy performance. Scott Speedman does quite a good job as the investigative NSA agent despite being dangled from a helicopter but this role is unlikely to get him very far in terms of his career. Lets get down to the important part now. If its an action movie it needs good and original action sequences right...not if you're working on xXx2. Basically things go boom and guns go bang but we're not given anything really new here and there aren't really enough credible action sequences to keep the audience hooked. The train sequence towards the end of the film looks terrible like something out of a Playstation game. The CGI falls flat on its face making the films action sequences loose credibility. one thing that confused me was who this was aimed at. by having a Black main character and featuring lots of black characters I thought maybe it could be trying to get a larger black audience. But nearly every black character is a stereotype of black 'Gangsta' culture. There is a line where xXx says I was born looking guilty but this is lost when the rest of the black characters are portrayed as crooks and thugs... in positive light! what kind of thing is this movie trying to say? I just gave up trying to read into it as I realised there is nothing to read into it is a very shallow badly written badly acted badly produced action yarn.

	onyx:emotionText "If you're thinking of seeing this stop just a minute. What could you do with the two hours of your life that this is likely to take up? You could write a short story you could do a drawing you could father some children or you could remove your own intestines with a rusty spoon. All of these activities would be a lot more worthwhile than seeing xXx 2 State of the union or The Next Level if you live in Blighty like me. I went to see this with high hopes that it would be another xXx... A mindless American James Bond Movie just without the class sorry if i offend anyone by that but thats is essentially what xXx was. But I was so wrong.The film opened promisingly showing something that wasn't what it seemed but despite this being a film about setups and double crosses that was possibly the best plot twist in the whole film. The film rapidly descends into clich after clich the script seems to have been created by entering lots of clichd lines into a computer and programming it to spit them out randomly. The plot is riddled with holes which leave you wondering what just happened and was it significant then later on you find out that it wasn't. In terms of acting Ice Cube is brilliant....at saying every line in exactly the same way. The great Samuel L gives an average performance but he could have just telephoned his lines in and it wouldn't really have made much difference. Willem Dafoe give us a generic bad guy performance. Scott Speedman does quite a good job as the investigative NSA agent despite being dangled from a helicopter but this role is unlikely to get him very far in terms of his career. Lets get down to the important part now. If its an action movie it needs good and original action sequences right...not if you're working on xXx2. Basically things go boom and guns go bang but we're not given anything really new here and there aren't really enough credible action sequences to keep the audience hooked. The train sequence towards the end of the film looks terrible like something out of a Playstation game. The CGI falls flat on its face making the films action sequences loose credibility. one thing that confused me was who this was aimed at. by having a Black main character and featuring lots of black characters I thought maybe it could be trying to get a larger black audience.

I didn't see the first XXX. I wish I hadn't seen the sequel. But I did. At the end I was wishing that Vin Diesel would come and save the day by shooting the characters of Willem Dafoe Samuel L. Jackson Ice Cube the College Boy and the entire biker crew. To say this movie doesn't have a plot would be insulting movies which don't have a plot but at least attempt to have one. A tyrannical Secretary of Defense who wants to kill everyone starting with the President in order of succession so he can lead the country? A crew of DC thugs who come to the rescue of the country so they can live in a country where they are free to jack cars? This movie has the same effect on a viewers intellect as does junk food on his body. It kills it slowly. And with enough Whoppers and curly fries like this one one could become brain dead.

Darius proceeds to throw people around impress the ladies blow stuff up etc etc etc. The basic concept is a hiphop James Bond and while it sounds like a cool concept that you couldn't possibly mess up no these guys messed it up... its not Ice Cube's fault he's no actor but I've seen him do better than this if the movie has a script and some direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in the Philippines as xXx The Next Level this sequel is definitely more expensive has more action has similar number of stunts and has new action lead played by an unlikely actor. But despite the production values this sequel is definitely not worth your time and money.Vin Diesel who made people think that xXx stands for Xander Cage is eXtremely eXplosive being the hero of the original is nowhere to be found which is both a good and bad thing. Diesel can deliver the action and stunts solidly but he's so annoying when it comes to dialog and comedy moments. I always hated the Think PlayStation! line.In the sequel Samuel L. Jackson's agency gets desperate and decides to hire a new action agent with more attitude. It turned out to be Ice Cube a prisoner in the film.Ice Cube never fits in well with his actionpacked role. Compared to Diesel Cube is never convincing in doing action and stunts. Worse Cube is very lousy with his dialog and certain moments that demanded comedy. I think Cube is better off with a purecomedy or purehip hop role be it lead or supporting but as an action star? NO WAY! I'd rather watch Ice Cube in his old role in Anaconda than this movie! You will end up wishing the producers got back Diesel in the sequel.Samuel L. Jackson this time gets more screen time although I would prefer they lessened his action scenes and added talking scenes instead. Early in the film you'll see Jackson dual wield guns ala John Woo to live up to his position in his agency and survive but I find his role in the first movie better. Still it's nice to see him get more screen time this time.Willem Dafoe who played a Vietnam soldier and a special forces coordinator before plays the defense secretary who plans to overthrow the government. His presence is very well felt and he delivers a good performance. You will hate him even more in this film than in SpiderMan.Sunny Mabrey? She is very pretty and very sexy. In short a hot girl but she's nothing more than just eye candy here and she cannot be taken seriously. She should be given some roles that demand performance not looks.Lee Tamahori whose most successful flick was Die Another Day is the director this time but most noticeable is his increased use of computer graphics. Thanks to him the film's pace is fast and something always happen onscreen to keep you awake.xXx story this time is shallower. Conspiracies are supposed to be deep and detailed but this sequel simply skipped all the requirements just to deliver action explosions crappy dialog and special effects. The sequel is best viewed as a nonthinking MTVstyled edited action flick.Action scenes and special effects are plenty but certain scenes are just too unbelievable to see and accept. I did notice however that the action in the sequel are more military in nature when compared to that of the first film wherein its action is more related to extreme sports.I don't recommend watching this sequel at all. You are better of skipping it. But if you really want to watch it better wait for the DVD release instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Action without brains is actually a genre i have nothing against. As long as the action sequences are well made that is. xXx State of the Union is a fair try in the genre but ultimately falls short.The plot is as ridiculous as in the first movie. The NSAagent Gibbons Samuel L. Jackson is once again looking in weird places trying to find a new agent that can break the rules and succeed. This time he finds Darius Stone Ice Cube in a military prison. Stone is an ex Navy Seal who will help Gibbons fight off a rogue part of the US Military trying to dispose of the president.Seriously no one watches these movies for the plot anyway. So that the plot is ridiculous and cheesy is beside the point. No one watches this for the acting either. So that Ice Cube is not as much an actor as a walking scowl is ALSO beside the point. He does about as good a job as Vin Diesel did anyway. What is NOT beside the point though is the fact that xXx State of the Union employs the same method of action filming as many other Hollywoodmovies of late. You know the method move the camera exceptionally close and shake it like if the cameraman was a spastic. I know that this is to hide the fact that Ice Cube doesn't know how to fight. Still it's incredibly irritating! Also the lack of logic is too evident at times. Like Ice Cube driving a sports car 360kmh on a train track with his tires torn off... Seriously.Otherwise this had some potential. The technical quality is great the movie looks really expensive. It has a lot of fun gadgets and crappy oneliners. And the speed of this movie is absolutely insane. Right from the beginning Lee Tamahori steps on it without ever looking back. So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring there is always something happening on screen. But the flaws in mostly the action department as well as the complete lack of logic disturbs the experience. It's still a lot better than the first movie though. I found the first one to be complete garbage while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.So in the end i think this James Bond on steroids will probably attract a lot of 15yearolds that like when things keep moving and lights keep flashing. People who like to see a plot and at least some traces of logic might want to stay away though. It could have been the brainless action movie of the year but it desperately needs some better actiondirecting for that. I rate it 310.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone is targeting the old unit that Agent Augustus Gibbons used to belong to under the command of George Deckert now Secretary for Defence. Half the unit are dead Triple X agent Cage is dead and Gibbons' underground base has been infiltrated by a highly trained team from which he barely escaped. With his gadgets expert in tow Gibbons turns to a new Triple X agent to help him fight this threat  former comrade and now life prisoner Darius Stone. Busting Stone out of prison Gibbons arms him and helps him start his new mission by uncovering hidden information as the danger increases so does the pace and all clues lead to something very sinister indeed.The production company credits right at the start of the film proclaim this as an Original Films Production a claim that I thought highly ironic since it then plunges into a precredit sequence that is as genrespecific as they come a title sequence that is a clear Bond rip off and a film that delivers nothing more than the genre basics. Taking the lead from the first film the script kills off Xander Cage with barely a mention and moves on to the new agent. Discussion of the plot is pointless cause the whole affair is nonsense with logic holes so large that you could drive a souped up car through it. Those looking to this for a story that they can get into will be sorely disappointed as the film throws its energy into noise explosions and typically OTT action scenes. To me and many viewers this will be just annoying hollow spectacle but to the target audience this is all they require and xXx2 does do it noisily enough to satisfy them.The action is as stupid and illogical as the plot itself but it is noisy stupid big and bold and is enjoyable on that level it is a shame that it lacks any actual tension or excitement but the noise will be enough for the target audience. At times it all gets a bit much and just looks plain silly but it never really stops moving that long so the next boom or bang is only ever minutes away preventing you turning your brain on. The attempts at character and story are the worst  the moments with the girls really slows things down without adding even titillation value while the potentially brave political stance made by the drawing of the president is just lost and wasted. Ice Cube picks up the mantle and delivers a onenote performance where he basically sneers his way across the screen he lacks any sort of charisma here and could have been any old actor something I think those hoping to make a franchise hope will be the case. Jackson is just collecting the cash so his bad performance can be ignored but Dafoe is a terrible bad guy considering he has done it well in other films. Xzibit doesn't do much but will draw humour from the MTV teenage audience thanks to his Pimp my Ride personae being called on. Mabrey and Gayle are basically just eye candy with breasts squeezed and lifted in every scene  they can't act and don't have any chemistry with the basic Cube. The support cast do lots of running around with guns or diving away form bangs but nobody gets close to a performance.Overall this is a noisy genre flick nothing more and nothing less. Those claiming how awful it is forget that there are people who don't want art films emotional films or engaging dramas they just want to whoop and holler as things get blowing up in fancylooking ways. For them and them alone this film will do the job as it provides effects stunts and noise. However those looking for even the most basic characters plot tension excitement or development will find themselves yawning through this noisy cross between a hiphop video and a video game.".

I thought the first 'XXX' was OK but the plot of 'XXX2' is so unoriginal and narrowminded it makes the first one seem like an epic. The action and stunts aren't even imaginative.. seems like even money can't buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you're even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters Ice Cube playing his usual badass self although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to 'are we there yet?' that it almost seems like him and Vin Diesel The Pacifier have teamed up secretly to harm America with such bad movies. Overall I think that Ice Cube's character lacks the edge of Vin Diesel in the first installment. The other characters in this movie including the main badguy Willem Dafoe are cardboard thin leading you to wonder as the movie goes along if the plot development will be just as bad.Overall Entertainment Value 410..I feel that the movie would have been better if they eased up on the whole government agency conspiracy aspect and focused more on stunts which made the first one much more easy to watch".

It was a B no i would say C grade movie with an A grade budget. The hero was a fat African American who thought he was Lord Of The Earth and did not even fit the stereotypical action star genre that i had expected. I swear this guy has no self esteem problems he is so much up himself i laughed my way through the entire movie. I cannot believe the extreme stupidity of this film. As i sit there in the cinema person after person was walking out not to mention the laughing at of corny and serious lines.

The movie begins on a high note and just runs all the way to the end barely pausing long enough to take a breath.This is great popcorn film making thats never really believable but which hooks you and drags you along.I loved this movie. Its so mindless and entertaining and doesn't try to be anything beyond that. Its great.I don't know if its because the movie just hits me right or because earlier in the day I suffered through the wildly uneven new Star Wars but there is something about this film thats wonderful.I have no idea why so many people dislike this film certainly its no worse than the first XXX film which was a guilty pleasure itself. Perhaps people can't buy Ice Cube as an action hero. What ever the reason this film is sorely under rated.Turn off your mind and don't think about anything just let the movie tell its story and you'll have a good time.I know I'm looking forward to future viewings of this new addition to my guilty pleasure list.".

Some would say implausible but what action movie is realistic? I also kind of got the vibe that the producers of this movie were a bit mad at Vin Diesel but all that could be just part of the storyline which I like. I guess the XXX will always be someone new even more the opposite of James Bond.Augustus Gibbons Samuel L. Jackson seems to be the main recurring character. We learn a little bit about his past his scarred face in particular. He chooses an old military acquaintance named Darius Stone Ice Cube as the new badder and meaner XXX. This time they have to stop an evil Secretary of Defense Gen. George Octavius Deckert Willem Dafoe from having all those in the chain of command above him assassinated. As Stone says the cleanest revolution in history. I kept expecting The Green Goblin to emerge somewhere. I guess there is a similarity between his two characters.XXX boasts some of the greatest action scenes I have had the pleasure of seeing. The tank fight on the aircraft carrier was simply awesome. Sure I understand this probably could not and will not ever come close to happening but it is still fun to watch. No one in their right mind could argue that.I knew well ahead of time that many many people would put this movie down much of them without even seeing it. While I do think that it does not have the same rebellious feel as the first XXX it was a great movie in it's own right. Highly recommended if you liked the first one. If you did not then why are you bothering?".

In the first ten minutes of XXX 2 we're informed based on a small hunk of plastic that the villainous commando team that has laid waste to NSA agent Augustus Gibbons' Samuel L. Jackson underground base is ten years ahead of anything at NSA that a new XXX agent is needed one with even more attitude and that our heroes will need to go off the grid to find him. Which naturally leads them to a maximum security military prison in order to bust out Darius Stone Ice Cube the only other surviving member of Gibbons'former SEAL team. How much further off the grid can you get? While the above may feel a bit rushed and convoluted it's merely the setup for what proves to be an extraordinary experiment in incoherent nonsense. Most action movies don't make sense we know this going in and hopefully try to appreciate them with that in mind. Yet XXX 2 is incomprehensible more in the sense of Dada than of say the first XXX. The ostensible connecting thread through the jumble is a plot by the US Secretary of Defense Willem Dafoe to take over the government by assassinating all his superiors during the State of the Union address. It's easy see since he's in charge of PROTECTING everyone he'll naturally have access to tanks and floor plans and assault teams. Donald Rumsfeld is surely slapping his forehead wondering why he never thought of this.Action flicks traditionally use their plots however brainless to get their heroes from one big kablooey to another. XXX 2 though instead presents a series of sortof connected sequences finally realizing that they should in theory culminate in something in this case a firefight in the Capitol rotunda. Along the way we're treated to pearls like growing up in Washington politics is like being raised in a snake pit. Everyone's fighting for territory. Do snakes do that? Amidst jumping boats onto bridges dumping tanks off of piers and assaulting the Capitol with his unstereotypical hip hop street crew Ice Cube even manages to worm a line of Tupac into a presidential speech. Cube's Stone is clearly acquainted with gangsta rap's icons why not just quote himself? Another movie could have some sly fun with such a conceit though trying to force Charlie Kaufman on this enterprise would be harder than convincing Jerry Falwell to dress in drag. the absurdity leads to the Presidential Bullet Train  is there really a bullet train beneath the White House?  where speeds of 200mph plus do nothing to deter the expected vehicle jumps and fisticuffs to say nothing of the teeny helicopter that's somehow able to keep up with it all. The formlessness of XXX 2 signals a new level of contempt for the moviegoing public though anyone going into this movie under any contrary illusions will get exactly what he deserves a cinematic cock punch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this film is like being with your current beau and yet constantly reminded of your ex. We all know that Xander Cage Vin Diesel is not the xXx in this show and he's being replaced by Darius Stone Ice Cube. Heck I think the producers make the mistake of killing Xander Cage  mentioned in the movie as being killed in action in Bora Bora Afghanistan because in my opinion his character makes an excellent action hero.That's reminiscence number one  being reminded of what could have been if the charismatic Vin Diesel continued for this film. Throughout the film we see some similarities with Xanda or scenes from the original xXx. Like a scene in a diner with Gibbons good IL mofo Samuel L Jackson who's given more screen time this time around a seacraft ride down a river wisecracks on the moniker xXx I sound like a porn star the reluctance of being drawn into the game of cloak and daggers and misquoting one of my favourite lines in the original  The things I would do for my country! But while Xander Cage's an extreme sports person Darius Stone is more in your face given his military background in covert ops with a penchant for some fries and a shake. The original film's delivery is more subtle more elegant while this one's more direct and in a way nothing different from another action flick.The action is standard Hollywoodblowemup fest right from the beginning and never lets up throughout the film. Everything's bigger M1 Abrams Tank Aircraft Carrier Choppers noisier guns and explosions everywhere and faster modified cars and humongous wheels. No doubt the movie looks good given that the action pieces looks expensive and effects well done by Industrial Light and Magic.Did I mention the girls? We get 2 in this one but their roles are merely decorative unlike Asia Argento's meatier and eyecandier chick role in xXx1. And the villains are your good old onedimensional foes who tend to lapse into monologues and I feel that Willem Dafoe is a bit underutilized.My only gripe with this film is that xXx has to rely on his boyz n the hood  it's actually quite hilarious to see street gangs take on military might carjacking a tank and actually winning. Not too credible but hey it's only a movie.Did you know this film is called xXx State of the Union in the US referring to the President's State of the Union Address which forms the finale but I guess for those outside who don't care less about US politics we're pretty OK with the dumbeddown title of xXx2 The Next Level  makes it sound like some arcade game.So buckle up and enjoy the ride and if this is proved as popular as the original we might see xXx3 given the setting up of a sequel at the end and the possibility of seeing a new face as the new xXx. Now if the producers just stop killing them I'd think it's pretty cool to see a couple of xXxs teaming up. Ooh... the potential for more mayhem!Wars come and go but my soldiers are eternal  2Pac".

With each hacked bride the main character of Harrington sees more and more of his terrible childhood memory when he saw his own mother axed.  The acting in this film is nothing terribly special nor is the story but Bava'a direction is a visual treasure to behold.  As always he makes the most he can with the camera lens.  Some of the shots are inspiring as Bava directs our attention through small orifices sometimes like a small window.  His use of a room with mannequins is very effective too.  Bava even has fun with his little joke of having Harrington watching Bava's own Black Sabbath on television when having just killed his wife he is visited by the police.  Style and visual artistry ripen all around only to be harvested by Bava's gluttonous camera lens.  The plot although missing huge pieces of coherence and logic is fairly wellcrafted.  The acting is adequate.  I particularly liked the actress that played Harrington's vitriolic wife and the character of the police inspector.The sense of the sixties and fanciful colours pervade almost every scene and the soundtrack is very suitable to this material.

Star Stephen Forsyth does a wonderfully brooding performance and makes his psychotic character strangely likable one wonders if Bret Easton Ellis saw this film before writing American Psycho. Forsyth is perfectly matched by costar Laura Betti who does a fiendish performance as Forsyth's domineering wife.Hatchet for the Honeymoon is a real treat for fans of Bava and the giallo genre or those that just enjoy oddball horror films.

	schema:reviewBody "Man I love Mario Bava's work! Every film I've seen of his is a pure masterpiece in my eyes and a complete cinematic orgasm'! Hatchet for the Honeymoon is somewhat different compared to most of his other movies and perhaps even his most accessible film. Hatchet handles about a more common horror theme namely a serial killer and his motivations but in the very first place it is another Bavaomnibus of stylish direction wonderful music beautiful scenery and a unique tense atmosphere. Bava never ceases to surprise meI find it truly remarkable how this director is able to portray such ugly things murder insanity aggression in an artistic way! Also the film is far ahead of its time with the portrayal of a horrible murderer as a classy and intelligent businessman. Stephen Forsyth is brilliantly cast as John. He owns a fashion gallery in Paris specialized in wedding dresses and there are a lot of models working for them. He urgently wants to divorce his wife because he despises her but she won't let him. Like it's the most normal thing in the world John confesses to the audience that he's a multiple murderer' A woman should only live till her wedding day' he says love once and then die'! Forsyth was a genius choice to play John he's handsome and extremely charismatic but also very frightening and morbidlooking at the same time. John is aware that he's sick yet he can't control the urge to kill again. The second half of the film is even more brilliant with a perfect image of a man stuck in a downwards spiral of insanity. Actually what Bava does here is singlehandedly changing the rules of the giallo! The identity of the killer is exposed right from the beginning yet there are numerous other aspects to discover about his personalitylike what was the origin of his hunger for violence and misery?Hatchet for the Honeymoon isn't the director best film that honor goes to Black Sunday without a doubt but it still is a perfect score of 10 out of 10 in my book. I can only bring forward one negative aspect and that is  like usual  the annoying dubbing. Definitely also worth a mention the beautiful female leads and sidecharacters in Hatchet. Dagmar Lassander is the stunning beauty that also appeared in Fulci's House by the Cemetary. Femi Bunissi plays another one of John's victims. I didn't know her but she certainly is a gifted and gorgeous lady. Enter the world of Mario Bava as soon as possible! You won't regret it!!".

Yet it also diverges from the giallo blueprint in some ways by incorporating an odd Twilight Zonestyle supernatural element into the plot and also a wry commentary on bourgeois married life. There are clear elements of both Psycho and Peeping Tom in the story and it also predates both the 1980 slasher film He Knows You're Alone and the Bret Easton Ellis book and later film American Psycho.As usual with Mario Bava the cinematography production design and lighting are all beautiful to look at and there are two great suspense setpieces the scene where the killer waltzes with his next victim to the eerie tune of a music box in a shadowy elegant storeroom full of creepy plastic mannequins in wedding dresses and the scene where he talks to the suspicious cop while his dead wife's arm is hanging from the staircase and dripping blood onto the carpet.It's also a surprisingly funny film in many ways.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that the 70's is a rather underappreciated decade for Mario Bava as it is usually overshadowed by his 60's cannon with films such as Black Sunday or Black Sabbath. Still his 1974 film Lisa and the Devil is what I consider his masterpiece 1972's Baron Blood is a great oldfashioned Gothic classic 1971's Twitch of the Death Nerve is mindless gory fun Shock is a simpleyeteffective ghost story and last but not least there is Hatchet for a Hooneymoon. Usually depicted as one of Bava's weaker efforts Hatchet... is as influential as Kill Baby Kill or Twitch... as seen in such criticallyacclaimed works as American Psycho or Santa Sangre. Here we have Bava's everpresent visual flair combined with a fresh Scroogesque twist on the typical giallo formula. The script is intelligent and gripping filled with some interesting Freudian motifs represented mostly through the protagonist's doppelganger as well as including some welldeveloped and complex characters that you really care for. The charismatic Stephen Forsyth is perfectly cast as the protagonist and is as seductively creepy as he needs to be. Laura Betti is also terrific as his cold manipulative wife. Interestingly Bava seems to play homage to the other great Italian director  Federico Fellini as he does his own 'La Dolce Vita'type satire of the plastic Italian highsociety in this film. The film also has some of the most beautiful and lyrical scenes of Bava's entire career both visually and in substance such as John's 'danse macabre' in the room full of mannequins. These moments blend magnificently with Sante Maria Romitelli's bittersweet score which captures the film's melancholic tone and perverse humor. The one thing that may put some viewers away is the lack of violence which doesn't really hurt the whole thing but doesn't add anything to it either. Overall a mesmerizing combination of ghost story with gialli that is definitely not to be missed by any fans of the Maestro or Italian horror cinema in general.".

The sets and lighting are also top notch conveying an eerie mood. Some lovely point of view shots are also utilized by Bava.This film tells the story of John Harrington who runs a fashion house specialising in bridal wear. He is unhappily married to his overbearing wife Mildred and he is also insane.I would hesitate to call this a Giallo movie as the killer is revealed at the beginning of the film. This is more of a character study of the killer and his journey into madness.For those interested in thrillers and atmosphere this comes highly recommended. Far better than Bavas better known Bay of Blood which i found rather cheap looking in comparison.This is a classic of Italian cinema. Highly recommended.".

The sets and lighting are also top notch conveying an eerie mood. Some lovely point of view shots are also utilized by Bava.This film tells the story of John Harrington who runs a fashion house specialising in bridal wear. He is unhappily married to his overbearing wife Mildred and he is also insane.I would hesitate to call this a Giallo movie as the killer is revealed at the beginning of the film. This is more of a character study of the killer and his journey into madness.For those interested in thrillers and atmosphere this comes highly recommended.

	schema:reviewBody "Having cast the original giallo mold with Sei Donne Pour L'Asassino the template for over one hundred more to follow Maestro Bava hovers between serial sex murderer films and ghost stories with this stylish and lyrical ode to morbidity and necrophilia that begins as a killerthriller and morphs almost seamlessly into a supernatural chiller. It's a leisurely slow moving movie with several shocks that are given away in the film's poster. Bava inverts the giallo formula he created. Unlike the average Italian nerothriller with its unknown protagonist Hatchet begins with full disclosure of the killer's identity. His current killing spree is based on his childhood murder of his mother and her lover. a homicidal fury rooted in sexual rage and jealousy. As an adult he kills brides to recreate the sexual excitement he felt killing his mother and to remember why he kills. His slow remembrance in blurry flashback moments is a big part of the plot. It's also why he marries a woman who is more a nagging mother figure than a sexual partner a companion for whom he has no physical need since he cannot perform as a man nor does he have the interest. This is pressed home by a sance scene early on in which his wife a spiritist channels his murdered mother. At the end of Psycho Norman Bates tells the audience in a voiceover that he wouldn't hurt a fly. In the beginning of Hatchet John Harrington coolly feeds a fly he's caught to his bird. He is a protometrosexual a macho GQ Man a forerunner of American Psycho Patrick Bateman as others have pointed out. Arrogant and haughty a pseudoaristocrat so smug he practically caresses the door handle of the train compartment he exits after slaughtering a newlywed couple covering it in fingerprints that the police seem to ignore. While his dandified behavior may seem familiar there were no similar characters in any subsequent Bava movie. Santiago Moncada's Freudianorientated script is very well thought out in a subtle manner while Bava seems to apply a few personal and recognizable brush strokes of his own As in Sei Donne the action centers around a fashion house and the victims are fashion models.The concept of a psycho killer making love to female mannequins in a secret room also appears in Umberto Lenzi's Spasmo with Robert Hoffman. The police are plodding and inert again Sei Donne. The killer is tormented by the ghost of the victim or the hallucination of a ghost The Whip and The Body.A murderous child is a prominent character as in Operation Fear Bay of Blood and to a lesser extent in the Wurdulak episode of Black Sabbath. Bava's cinematography is alway wonderful but Hatchet does not have the photographic beauty or deep colors of Sei Donne Planet of the Vampires or Black Sabbath. The main set piece is Harrington killing his wife. Faced with the prospect of a sexually needy wife he goes berserk in a sexual panic dons a bridal veil and applies lipstick and in a perverted reversal of the wedding night chases her around the bedroom and brutally chops her with his fetishized phallic weapon of choice a cleaver and not a hatchet despite the US title. This scene is the most graphic and bloody yet extremely mild by giallo standards. The three other murders we see Harrington commit are very subdued compared to this the gore and blood obscured by flashy visuals. That this film was rated PG with this kind of content once again proves that censors do not really think when they watch a film fortunately and look for only the most obvious moments but never grasp the subtext. That's why Jess Franco movies got booked into Saturday kiddie matinees during the 1960s! After this murder the film switches tracks completely and becomes a ghost story with a twist. Harrington can't see his wife's ghost yet everyone else sees her. Or is he hallucinating? The audience sees her as a ghost looking awfully spooky and creepy. Do the people around Harrington see her like this? Their behavior indicates that she looks normal to them. When he is finally arrested at the end only he can see her spirit. Or is this a hallucination also a manifestation of his madness? The original title The Red Mark of Madness is much better but lacked the punch distributors need to sell tickets. Instead of a bravura violent visually sensational ending that the audience expected from giallos and one that Dario Argento would have provided Bava ends on a lowkey crepuscular note. Overall it's one of his best films and certainly underrated. Stephen Forsyth could have continued to make a lot of European films he was better looking than most movie stars but stopped because he did not like the roles being offered.".

	schema:reviewBody "HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON Mario Bava  ItalySpain 1969Every time John Harrington hacks up a bride on her wedding night with a meat cleaver he is able to recall more details from his childhood about the mysterious death of his mother whom he apparently adored. Compelled to discover the killer's identity and unable to cope any longer with marital arguments he even takes a hatchet to his own bitchy wife Mildred who returns to haunt him as a ghost that everybody can see but him. The increasingly deluded madman imagines that Mildred is still torturing him and gives in to one more murderous deed in order to discover the true nature of his childhood experience.A creative reworking of Hitchcock's PSYCHO 1960 springs to mind but in this case it's patently clear from the start who killed John Harrington's mother. The film is sometimes categorized as a Giallo but while it's offers some traditional giallo elements the mystery element is negligible since it's quite obvious who killed the madman's mother and the traditional detective or amateur sleuth is  again  Harrington himself. Nevertheless in terms of lighting and camerawork Bava started to experiment with subjective camera techniques in the opening train scene for the first time he delivered another stylish piece of work although at times the zoomlens goes into overdrive. And Bava shows he can deliver a number of very effective suspense scenes. The best sequence occurs during the aftermath of his wife's murder. The suspicious police inspector who keeps returning to Harrington to clear up minor points inquires about the screams which emanated from the house just minutes before. Harrington covers himself by showing the detective a screamfilled horror movie Bava's own Black Sabbath which just happens to be playing on television. Meanwhile the audience can see the dead woman's corpse hanging over the edge of his bannister dripping blood just feet away from the inquisitive inspector. An eerily effective moment that will have you rooted for the killer hoping he will not be exposed.The supernatural angle the haunting of John by Mildred's vindictive spirit makes this strangely constructed film hard to categorize. Nevertheless Bava considered this one of his favorites and it was one of the few films  if not the only one  where he had complete creative control and the end result wasn't completely butchered by ignorant producers or distributors. The film is even surprisingly restrained which largely explains the relatively smooth distribution potential. The six murders are never shown graphically on screen and the amounts of gore and blood are restricted to a minimum. Furthermore the story is fairly straightforward but never terribly engaging and leading man Stephen Forstyth has the charisma of a wooden puppet. Sante Romitelli's score is not a total success either with its sudden transitions from frenzied fear themes to gentle harpsichord melodies and lush orchestrations. All in all an interesting film from a cinematographic perspective but the results are not very effective and not enough to rank this as one of Bava's best let alone as one of the better Giallos if categorized as such. The film's theme was reworked in the American slasher HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE 1980.Camera Obscura  610".

They are lifeless but he doesn't seem to care..John holds them with this kind of deep cherish relishing the silence that exudes from within the room. Also the way Bava photographs the hatchet as if providing a lustful allure..it's as if the camera embraces this weapon of execution. I mean just watch how John holds the hatchet in his hand..it's like holding the woman you love. Lastly Bava's decision to have us be a part of John's madness and despair is another important creepy part that makes this whole film quite an experience.This is an amazing piece of filmmaking..a truly bizarre masterwork of genius.".

	schema:headline " Another ingenious Mario Bava gem!";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror maestro Mario Bava directs this intriguing and ingenious horror highlight nightmare that delves deep into the mind of a madman. Stephen Forsyth is John Harrington the aforementioned madman. Unlike most lunatics John knows that he is insane. He confesses this to audience right near the start of the movie. The sequence in which he confesses is one of the creepiest and most surreal moments in the film. John confesses this to us like it is the most normal thing in the world. This confession also gives this film it's own unique edge over most giallo's normally we spend the film trying to work out who the killer is but here Mario Bava not only lets us know who it is but allows us to explore the murders with him giving us the other side of the common mystery film. Aside from being mental John is also the owner of a wedding dress shop. He murders women on their wedding night and every time he kills someone a little more of the murder of his mother is revealed. John also has a wife a callous lady who says she'll never leave him and a lady whom he despises.As usual with Bava the film is stunningly directed. Mario Bava is a man that is on top of his craft with every movie. Even when he only has a weak script or a dull story to work with Mario Bava's films can always be given credit on the directorial side. His influence and importance to cinema far exceeds what he is credited for. Hatchet for the Honeymoon features several memorable and electrifying sequences. See the skilful way that Mario directs the sequence in which our protagonist is talking to the police while the hand of his freshest victim slinks silently through the rails of the banister. Few directors could direct with such skill and precision to build up tension for a character that we don't actually like but Mario Bava manages it admirably. The film also features hardly any blood at all which is much to the film's credit. Bava concentrates on the mood and the atmosphere of the film and therefore he simply doesn't need buckets of gore. Where other directors might have put some in to help sell their film Bava just concentrates on what's important. Also worthy of note as usual with Italian horror is the music. Music helps this film massively it is striking and unforgettable and it establishes a foreboding mood of which the film makes best use.The character of John Harrington aside from being insane is given a place in reality thanks to a brilliant performance by Stephen Forsyth. The film conveys the message that looks can be deceiving and Stephen Forsyth is the perfect man to show that. On the outside he is handsome and likable but behind this facade he is completely insane. Stephen Forsyth manages to capture both elements of the character he somehow manages to do both things despite them being complete opposites of each other. Hatchet for the Honeymoon is just another highlight in a long list of highlights from master director Mario Bava.".

I'm thirty years old. I am a paranoiac. Paranoiac! What a marvellous world. So delicate. And full of possibilities. The fact is I'm completely mad.

	schema:headline " A solid effort for Mr. Bava.";
	schema:reviewBody "Master Italian filmmaker Mario Bava once again directs with plenty of style giving spice to an amusing plot that prefigures the slasher film He Knows You're Alone by a decade.The handsome Stephen Forsyth stars as John Harrington the owner of a bridal shop. He's gone mad yet still has the ability to reflect on his condition. He's married to a witchy woman Mildred Laura Betti who refuses to divorce him and is a haunted individual living with a long ago trauma and witness to visions of himself as a child. This trauma now spurs him to murder his own models whenever they plan on getting married.As we can see this story isn't a matter of whodunit. We're with our killer every step of the way aren't entirely unsympathetic to his condition and wait to see how soon the cops will catch up to him. In the meantime Bava does amazing things with colour and atmosphere crafting a powerful visualization of his protagonists' deteriorating mind.It takes until the second half for the movie to really kick into gear. Until then it goes easy on the horror with the murders parcelled out carefully and Bava making sure to cut away before things get very graphic. The second half gets effectively eerie with the hallucinatory imagery really taking over as Johns' conscience starts to eat away at him. One wonderful sequence has the investigating detective Jesus Puente dropping in on John and interrogating him while the body of his most recent victim is still quite warm! Bava fans will delight in seeing his earlier horror anthology Black Sabbath playing on TV during this sequence. The music score by Sante Maria Romitelli is beautiful and haunting much of the time yet gets appropriately discordant at certain points.A capable cast makes the most of the material no matter how poorly they may be dubbed. Forsyth is believable at all times Dagmar Lassander is appealing as the newest model to be hired by the shop Betti is a hoot as the icy wife and Femi Benussi is easy to watch as one of the unfortunate murder victims. Fans of European genre films will also recognize Luciano Pigozzi and Gerard Tichy among the supporting players.This isn't one of Bava's very best works his period in the 1960s is when he really shone but it's still pretty good of its type and deserves some respect and attention. If you're fan of Italian horror it's well worth a look.Seven out of 10.".

Still the fact that the Italian dubbing on the DVD rental edition I now checked out was newlyrecorded  rather than what was originally shown to theatres the distinctive voice of the only Italian actress among the main cast Laura Betti is sorely missed  wasnt an enthusing prospect to begin with... Anyway the film is one of Bavas most unusual  ditto for the giallo genre rather than having a variety of suspects among whom to determine the killer here the hero who also acts as narrator tells us upfront who it is  himself! This makes of it a sort of black comedy  even though handsome lead Stephen Forsyth doesnt exactly set the screen on fireand the film is in any case undermined by the deliberate pacing typical of the EuroCult style.Bava here also served as his own cinematographer with any number of smooth camera moves and striking compositions and the result  with Forsyths villa and atelier the latter a familiar giallo setting as attractive backdrops  is a beautifullooking film the editing too is creatively done. The various murders are obviously among the films highlights  as is Sante Romitellis memorable score at once melancholically playful and creepily avantgardist.Perhaps the most effective scene is Bettis murder halfway through whom Forsyth kills while hes decked out in a bridal veil!  which is immediately followed by the arrival of the police on the scene to interrogate Forsyth on a previous victim where the wifes blood dripping from the stairs and reflection on a tabletop could give the killer away at any moment an amusing injoke here is the fact that Forsyth had been watching a TV screening in blackandwhite of Bavas own BLACK SABBATH 1963! Also interesting are Bettis numerous apparitions which again stresses the absurdistpsychological aspects of the plot since this is clearly not a supernatural tale at first Forsyth cant see her but everyone else can  so to make doubly sure he exhumes her interred body burns it in his incinerator and then keeps her ashes constantly with him inside a leather bag! when hes finally captured the situation is reversed  the wife determined to haunt Forsyth till his dying day! Lovely EuroCult starlet Dagmar Lassander plays the heroine who even though shes eventually revealed to have served as policebait for the killer every step of the way demonstrates genuine affection for Fosyth throughout. Incidentally the police inspector is unusually perceptive for this type of film and at various points in the narrative he lets Forsyth know that hes his chief suspect  even equating the latters greenhouse where plants are made to grow in an unnatural manner with the inner workings of a madmans mind! While the final revelation isnt really much of a surprise its interesting that a piece of the puzzle which haunts Forsyth  he also receives intermittent visits from himself as a child to act as a guide through his hazy past  is seen to fall into place with each new murder of a bride! By the way the film was an ItalianSpanish coproduction written by Santiago Moncada  whose work includes two other fine EuroCult offerings THE CORRUPTION OF CHRIS MILLER 1973 still unavailable on DVD though I did get to catch it on DVDR while in Hollywood in late 2005early 2006 and A BELL FROM HELL 1973.".

But get ready for a REAL shock sixty minutes in after he kills his wife she comes back as a cackling bitch wife ghost  so that what was up to this point a movie about the inner quest of a 'madman' is now all of a sudden a movie about a philandering prick whose dead wife keeps spoiling his pickups. At one point he suggests a threesome! This is at once the worst thing technically about HFAH and hands down my favourite thing about it. Cool credit sequence graphics too.".

But get ready for a REAL shock sixty minutes in after he kills his wife she comes back as a cackling bitch wife ghost  so that what was up to this point a movie about the inner quest of a 'madman' is now all of a sudden a movie about a philandering prick whose dead wife keeps spoiling his pickups. At one point he suggests a threesome! This is at once the worst thing technically about HFAH and hands down my favourite thing about it. Cool credit sequence graphics too.";

	schema:headline " Beauty and Insanity in a 'Reversed' Giallo  It Could Only Be Bava!";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1963 Mario Bava singlehandedly invented the Giallo with the groundbreaking La Ragazza Che Sappeva Troppo aka. The Girl Who Knew Too Much and he defined the genre in 1964 with the masterpiece Sei Donne Per L'Assassino aka. Blood And Black Lace. In 1970 he turned the rules of his very own most intriguing Horrorsubgenre the wonderful Italian Giallo upside down with this brilliant film Il Rosso Segno Della Follia aka. Hatchet For The Honeymoon. Mario Bava is the greatest Horror director who ever lived in my eyes for a variety of reasons. First off there is no other director who was ever capable of creating a unique atmosphere and mixing beauty and terror as Bava did. Second Bava is arguably THE Horror director whose filmography includes the most masterpieces. Be it brilliant Gothic tales such as La Maschera Del Demonio Black Sunday 1960 Operazione Paura Kill Baby... Kill! 1966 La Frusta E Il Corpo The Whip And The Body 1963 or his magnificent anthology I Tre Volti Della Paura Black Sabbath 1963 sublime Giallomilestones like The Girl Who Knew Too Much and Blood And Black Lace his uncompromising and ingenious CrimeThriller Cani Arrabbiati Rabid Dogs 1974 or his protoslasher Reazione A Catena A Bay Of Blood 1971 just to name some of his films  Bava always outshines all the rest. Take this sublime Gialloalteration for example. With Hatchet For The Honeymoon Bava reverses the premise of his very own Giallogenre. While the usual major common aspect of Gialli is that the killer's identity is a secret to the viewer that is not disclosed until the end it is clear who is the killer in this film from the first minute. Yet this is not to say that the film doesn't bear many mysteries.John Harrington Stephen Forsyth is a successful and murderous Paris fashion shop owner who becomes more and more overpowered by his own insanity. While his malicious wife brilliantly played by Laura Betti refuses to agree to a divorce John whose fashion gallery specializes in wedding dresses has the urge to murder young women before their wedding. It is not quite clear yet however why the successful and elegant businessman has these homicidal longings... Hatchet For The Honeymoon is not even one of my favorite films by Mario Bava and yet this is another stunning masterpiece that no lover of Horror and CultCinema could possibly consider missing. The topic of the murderous psycho and his motivations was nothing new for the Horror genre of course but oh how brilliantly it is delivered. Stephen Forsyth delivers an excellent performance as the psychopath in disguise of an elegant witty and sophisticated businessman. Laura Betti who also worked with Bava for A Bay Of Blood is arguably even more brilliant in the role of his wife. The rest of the female cast includes stunning beauties such as Dagmar Lassander Forbidden Photos Of A Lady Without Permission and the sexy young Femi Benussi who also moved her curves through films like Strip Nude For Your Killer and Manhunt. Visually the film is stunning like all films by Bava. As stated above Bava knew to combine beauty and terror like no other director and this is another example for his unique talent. Never has the topic of an insane killer and his manic obsessions been depicted with more beauty and style than it is the case in Hatchet For The Honeymoon. Bava's typically brilliant photography and lush colors combined with a beautiful score make a sublime setting for the creepiness and exquisite insanity that is taking place. As it is always the case when I'm discussing Bava's films I could go on praising this film forever. All said this is just another brilliantly atmospheric gem in the impressive repertoire of this Horror genius and a masterpiece that no Horror lover could possibly consider missing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always considered Hatchet for the Honeymoon one of the weaker Bava films. It doesn't have the artistry of Black Sunday or the flair of Blood and Black Lace. Even with these perceived flaws a weak Bava is still an enjoyable experience.The basic story Models and customers of a wedding gown design house are turning up dead on their wedding day. Each one viciously killed by a hatchet meat clever wielding maniac. It's not difficult figuring out who the killer is. Hatchet for the Honeymoon doesn't follow the normal rules of a horrormystery. Think of it as a backwards Giallo. There are no clever red herrings no suspicious characters and no deadend clues. Instead the main character John Harrington Stephen Forsyth reveals early on that he's a crazed killer. A bit of dialogue uttered by John early in the movie give tremendous insight into his character  A woman should only live till her wedding day. She should love once and then die'. But in this case our killer feels he has a justifiable albeit selfish reason to kill. Each time he murders a woman a vision that has haunted him becomes clearer. He's obsessed with discovering the meaning of the vision. How many brides must die before John discovers the secret of his vision? John also has a nagging wife whom he would like to divorce. But it seems that she has the money and won't let him go. Instead she would rather make his life miserable. Deciding he can't take anymore of his wife John kills her. Still not wanting to leave John the wife's ghost continues to torment John. In a bizarre twist John  the lunatic  is being driven mad by his wife. Is it possible for a homicidal maniac to be driven crazy? The performances are fairly standard for this kind of film. Stephen Forsyth is more than adequate for the role of the hunky did I just use that word killer. I've always felt that his wife played by Laura Betti is the only real weak point in the cast. She just doesn't come across very naturally. In scenes where she is tormenting John from the grave she's appears to be nothing more than an actress playing a part. I never bought into her performance.While there are flashes of Bava's brilliance much of Bava's trademark style seems muted. For example while the room of mannequins makes a nice scene it's not awash in color like scenes from Bava's Black Sabbath or Blood and Black Lace. Instead it's a fairly dark room without any terribly unusual lighting. It's not that Bava's work here isn't impressive because it is. There are scenes shot through peep holes and small windows that show other facets of Bava's creativity.I should also mention the score. The music by Sante Maria Romitelli is a real asset to the movie. Much of it is a loving soft romantic score. This type of music mixed with the idea of burying a hatchet in someone may seem inappropriate but it makes these scenes even more chilling. A perfect example of this is the music box tune John plays when killing the bride in the mannequin room. It's a very effective use of music.".

What I find most fascinating about the film however are its parallels to the recently released American Psycho.Much like American Psycho from the beginning of the film we are introduced to a protagonist professing his insanity. Hatchet for the Honeymoon also slips into the zone of realityunreality frequently. Hatchet however ultimately becomes a much cleaner and more understandable narrative than American Psycho turned out to be.From start to finish Bava's incredible visual style is omnipresent in every single frame of film. Bava has the incredible ability to turn something as mundane as morning coffee into a visual masterpiece. At the same time Bava's impressive visuals easily overpower the narrative of his film.The story itself is fairly cut  dry for the first half of the film the main character is shown killing various women in an attempt to gain clarity to a mystery in his past the murder of his mother. Believing each time he kills the past becomes clearer nothing can stop the madman on his rampage. Things get interesting however when the psychotic turns on his own wife but following her murder becomes haunted by her ghost and his weak grip on reality begins to loosen...Slow at times the style of the film makes up for its lack of pacing. Recommended for fans of American Psycho and more Hitchcockian horror films Psycho. Other people really won't get this film.710".

	schema:reviewBody "For about half its length ANNABEL CHONG is a bright light unexpected vibrant witty documentary.  Annabel Chong is Grace Quek a Singaporeraised English anthropology student at the University of South California who became a porn actress after an unenlightened feminist tutorial as an expression of sexual freedom.  She became famous in 1995 when she broke the world record for sleeping with the most men 251 in ten hours and became a fixture on programmes like THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW.Grace herself is a very likeable seemingly together young woman with the teeth of Goldie and the accent of Jane Seymour who decides to become a 'stud' to critique masculinity.  She seems in complete control of her career and her image and as her world record is revealed straight away there is no conventionally contrived documentary 'success'.The film is sharply funny as it explores the strangely haphazard and hugely lucrative pornography industry.  Many of its denizens with amusingly childishly suggestive names find Annabel's antics distasteful and degrading confirming the image of sleaze the constant display of computers are trying to conceal.  The marketing men are either aging ponytailed relics who are easy to laugh at or the younger can'tquitebelievetheirluck jocks who can't stop giggling.Unfortunately things become more sinister as the pressure begins to tell on Annabel.  She is quite clearly not in control and the film constantly undermines her claims to independence as she dances for a bunch of slavering perverts.  These latter don't care what incomprehensible poststructuralist jargon comes out of her mouth as long as she delivers the goods.  In fact this feminist liberation goes beyond their wildest dreams  a woman who is actually looking to them for it.This we might have expected but more repulsive revelations begin to leak out.  Not only do we assume that she is tacitly forced into the event by leeches who can see a sucker from a mile off but she isn't paid she is quickly abandoned for an even more photogenic cashcow and most horrific of all we discover that the health and safety standards for the event were criminally lax.This becomes a deeply and properly misanthropic film in which I think the filmmakers if I may say so under IMDb guidelines collude.  Produced and directed by men the film is formally weighted against Annabel.  The more images and 'reality' contradict Annabel the less we listen to her voice the more we listen to others squeezing her out.  Music for instance the repetition of 'Amazing Grace' is used to ironise Annabel and there are a number of occasions when the film's ethics are seriously in question and not just the obvious contrivances of many scenes.  Little 'narratives' are slipped into the story eg does Annabel have AIDS?. In one she hasn't yet told her mother and the film uses this very private and damaging dilemma to generate suspense.  Frequently Annabel doesn't seem to be in control and yet the filmmakers watch her slashing her wrists so they can offer a neat thesis on different penetrations of the body.  The film is careful to record the different groups of men who use and belittle Annabel TV shows the porn industry her old teachers Cambridge students etc. but don't seem to notice their own culpability. The film becomes seriously depressing  and while it is quite right to give an audience lured by the sensationalist title a shock a play with gender identity a critique of filmmaking itself the filmmakers seem to have crossed a line where they have become as exploitative as the porn producers.  In one scene they revisit the site of a rape in another they gang up with us and an informed teacher on an unknowing Annabel.  The frequent shots from outside looking in invoke a voyeuristic model and maybe the documentary is intensely selfaware but the increasingly moralistic drive is only at the expense of Annabel Chong.".

	schema:reviewBody "Several people have commented on the insight this film gives into the porn industry. That may be true but it's not what this film is about. The events which unfold over 90 minutes in Sex The Annabel Chong Story are more about one girls trip through life and the choices she made along the way. Many of the reviews have been very judgmental and tend to present Grace as disturbed and in need if therapy. This may be true on a certain level for example the scene of her selfmutilate cutting removes any doubt that selfdestruction is in the forefront of her personality but there is much more to this young woman than that. She has substance. She's intelligent. She has a drive to succeed in life and achieve approval from her peers. Many of her personality traits are in paradox to one another...But more to the question Is this a good film? You're damn right it is. A very good documentary the places a vast array of players institutions and mechanisms into orbit around Grace and unabashedly reveals her ventures into and out of each circumstance from seeking acceptance from family and friends to navigating through the denizens of the porn industry.An interesting side note In the scenes where Grace is visiting the set of pornstarlet Jasmin St. Clairs attempt at shattering her record of 251 men in 10 hours Grace appears to be out of her element and somehow trapped in a place she'd rather not be. In comparison to the people around her she almost seems innocent and out of place. The whole feel of this shoot while technically the same style is directly the opposite of her experience. Grace leaves the set feeling dejected and lost. Her naivet is glaring in this moment. Don't know if anyone else picked up on this but I did.In the end I like Grace. After watching her go through so much selfinflicted agony with such an air of bravado real or imagined I can't help myself. She's all heart. It's a shame that her triumphs participating in the Cambridge Debate attending USC moving on to a grad degree are overshadowed by the darker elements of the film. And lastly many Thanks to Grace for having the guts to be honest in presenting the story of her life. Remarkable.".

	schema:headline " A muddled character study  or rather a study of a muddled character!";
	schema:reviewBody "The porn star Annabel Chong prepares for her part in the world record gang bang.  This documentary examines her roots in the business and follows her before and after the shoot to find out why she's doing porno and what her background is.  We see her as a real complex person who is seemingly unsure of what her motivations are for doing the work she does.The porn documentary' is an area that is becoming more popular as porn becomes more mainstream.  I have seen several  some that aim to just have a laugh The Legend of Ron Jeremy and some that are brutally honest Hardcore.  This was one of the first I'd seen and I wasn't sure what the agenda was behind it.  For the most part I don't think the makers had any aim but to be honest but fair.  This takes us to Chong herself as this is a look at her rather than a look at the business she's in.Chong changes her story during the film.  For some of it she is a porn star who is doing it because it's the ultimate ego trip' to have all these men wanting to have sex with her.  Then we find out more about her teenage gang rape and the whole porn stuff looks different.  Later however she lost my vote when she appeared at a Cambridge Uni debate and on channel 4's The Girly Show that height of political debate talking about how it was a pss take on the whole western ideal of masculinity' and similar pretentious sounding remarks.  That's fine if what you're doing is art but porn is not art.  If you are in any doubt her Cambridge debate is preceded by her boasting about loving anal sex and her pride at doing triple penetration  how very Van Gogh!She comes off very mixed up.  At times very reasonable and normal others very OTT and really into getting fcked by as many guys as she can then at others we see her tearful confession to her mother and see her slicing up her arm with a knife just so that she can really feel something'.  It's hard to know how to feel about her because she doesn't seem to know who she is and why she's doing the things she does. For the most part the film just about manages to remain tasteful.  It doesn't focus on the sex scenes and tries to have plenty of character study rather than whacking material.  However it does use a lot of clips and stuff that don't add to the message but really only serve to spice things up. Some of the scenes have a reason  for example the gang bang scenes are in no way erotic and are slightly like watch meat being processed and Chong has a weird smile the whole time.  But some from the start of her career are just there to show off breasts and ass!  The only good bit about following her early work is the interviews with directors like John T Bone Ed Powers Dick Nasty here as Richard' Ron Jeremy and Robert Black.  They don't give much insight into the business but it is clear they don't give much weight to Chong's idea that this is a social comment.  In fact they are the first to point out how she was exploited  with many of the performers not having had AIDS tests and also Chong not getting rich from her day's work.This is a little hard to take.  I watched Hardcore where we see Dick Nasty as an agent for an English girl  pressuring her into things she didn't want to do.  So to hear him take the high ground is a little daft.  Robert Black is a regular for documentaries and he always make sense because he is honest about porn  it's fcking shameful and nasty' he says in Hardcore' but he does enjoy his work!Overall this isn't a look at porn but a look at Chong and on that level it isn't great.  How can we get who she is when she isn't clear on that herself?  It's interesting viewing and slightly depressing to see a woman who is so clearly exploited claiming the artistic high ground and also seeing someone who is so intelligent she passes her degree constantly going back to work in porn.  A bit of a muddle but a compelling world to dip into for 90 minutes.......but not any longer than that thank God.".

This documentary examines her roots in the business and follows her before and after the shoot to find out why she's doing porno and what her background is.  We see her as a real complex person who is seemingly unsure of what her motivations are for doing the work she does.The porn documentary' is an area that is becoming more popular as porn becomes more mainstream.  I have seen several  some that aim to just have a laugh The Legend of Ron Jeremy and some that are brutally honest Hardcore.  This was one of the first I'd seen and I wasn't sure what the agenda was behind it.  For the most part I don't think the makers had any aim but to be honest but fair.  This takes us to Chong herself as this is a look at her rather than a look at the business she's in.Chong changes her story during the film.  For some of it she is a porn star who is doing it because it's the ultimate ego trip' to have all these men wanting to have sex with her.  Then we find out more about her teenage gang rape and the whole porn stuff looks different.  Later however she lost my vote when she appeared at a Cambridge Uni debate and on channel 4's The Girly Show that height of political debate talking about how it was a pss take on the whole western ideal of masculinity' and similar pretentious sounding remarks.  That's fine if what you're doing is art but porn is not art.  If you are in any doubt her Cambridge debate is preceded by her boasting about loving anal sex and her pride at doing triple penetration  how very Van Gogh!She comes off very mixed up.  At times very reasonable and normal others very OTT and really into getting fcked by as many guys as she can then at others we see her tearful confession to her mother and see her slicing up her arm with a knife just so that she can really feel something'.  It's hard to know how to feel about her because she doesn't seem to know who she is and why she's doing the things she does. For the most part the film just about manages to remain tasteful.  It doesn't focus on the sex scenes and tries to have plenty of character study rather than whacking material.  However it does use a lot of clips and stuff that don't add to the message but really only serve to spice things up. Some of the scenes have a reason  for example the gang bang scenes are in no way erotic and are slightly like watch meat being processed and Chong has a weird smile the whole time.  But some from the start of her career are just there to show off breasts and ass!  The only good bit about following her early work is the interviews with directors like John T Bone Ed Powers Dick Nasty here as Richard' Ron Jeremy and Robert Black.  They don't give much insight into the business but it is clear they don't give much weight to Chong's idea that this is a social comment.  In fact they are the first to point out how she was exploited  with many of the performers not having had AIDS tests and also Chong not getting rich from her day's work.This is a little hard to take.  I watched Hardcore where we see Dick Nasty as an agent for an English girl  pressuring her into things she didn't want to do.  So to hear him take the high ground is a little daft.  Robert Black is a regular for documentaries and he always make sense because he is honest about porn  it's fcking shameful and nasty' he says in Hardcore' but he does enjoy his work!Overall this isn't a look at porn but a look at Chong and on that level it isn't great.  How can we get who she is when she isn't clear on that herself?  It's interesting viewing and slightly depressing to see a woman who is so clearly exploited claiming the artistic high ground and also seeing someone who is so intelligent she passes her degree constantly going back to work in porn.  A bit of a muddle but a compelling world to dip into for 90 minutes.......but not any longer than that thank God.";

From most people's comments though this movie is a good at leaving questions to be answered from the viewer about her life what's going on in her mind and a further look at what goes on in this business. And it's also important to take a better look at Annabel Chong herself and not treat her like some passionless worthless porn star who should shut up and only provide masturbating material and label her opinions as pretentious and neofeminist. That just proves the validity in her wanting to change the slut stereotype. If you go to httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAnnabelChong you'll actually discover that she's well read and smart earning a scholarship to study law in London. She also went to graduate school studying a few subjects one of them being feminist studies. So you can see her thoughts aren't just coming from nowhere. And even if she didn't go to school...women DO have thoughts and opinions that are valid. Crazy I know. If I get the chance I would like to see the documentary after reading material from the link above she sounds very interesting and she was at least someone who tried to turn things around.

The two dutifully expose their breasts to the camera but there's a tangibly bitchy atmosphere throughout. Claire's success is then contrasted with Chong's squalor.Very few laughs can be gained from the piece though seeing a gingerhaired attendee looking nervously down at his crotch upon hearing the warmup advice the problem of getting an erection is faintly amusing. Look out too for Dick James the Annabel Chong fan club president who seems to say everything in inverted commas including the phrase fan club. Her return to the porn industry after a year of abstinence says it all as she hugs an old friend from the industry he gives a smug smile to a coworker behind her back.Only the punning end title theme of Amazing Grace disappoints making Sex an oddly compelling documentary.".

It IS very obvious that Grace is not in control of her situation with her totally different appearances in this documentary. Sometimes she is the hardcore slutqueen sometimes the academic sometimes the bimbo and mostly she just  seems lost not to mention selfdestructive. Quite a schizofrenic experience. I know that she is playing a role and living up to peoples expectations but i still....see for yourself.I think that this is a very important and thought provoking film in many aspects..and should be seen by much more people. This is Annabels movie straight out..just like a documentary should be. It is up to you the viewer to make up your mind about the questions it raises. And they are very disturbing.I hope she have found peace with herself now.Note I do not take side in the pornographydebate here but you will never look upon the pornindustry in the same way again after watching this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A documentary about Annabel Chong and her sad offbeat and occasionally desperate relationship with the US porn industry.I came to this film with mixed feelings. There is a lot of agendas going on here. Chong's the director's the producersdistributors they want money as well just look at the title! and the sex industry.Naturally I have my own agenda and ideas about the whole issue and the style of film making that this product involves At one stage the protagonist does selfharm although only token and the camera continues to roll. Why? In a stroke the film makers fall in to line with the pornographers They want their good footage at any cost. Maybe the event was staged but that doesn't really matter they were exposed.My favourite word in the English language is ambiguous and Chong is as ambiguous as any woman on the planet. She doesn't see herself as a victim per se but at the same time plays herself to the audience as a victim of circumstances  which include a slightly sadomasochistic sex drive.I felt cold to her throughout the film. She is a person of choices and the choices she has made may be bad drug taking cannot be viewed as anything else but they were her choices. No evil pimp is brought forward to take the blame. The two usual excuses Ignorance and poverty do not apply to her. She is smart and university educated. Maybe she wants to have it all  the fun and freedom of the slut and the respect of the educated. At various stages of this movie she gains both.Naturally I have my own agenda. Not just on Chong but also on the whole sex industry. You are only a victim if you look and feel like a victim. If you go to a sex club and have yourself tied down and lightly whipped ALA Madonna then you not a victim because it is your choice.I personally believe you have the right to sell yourself sexually or have people film you in a sex act for money or not but that doesn't mean that is all of a good thing. There may be consequences and repercussions  moral and medical.What we have too much of here is the I don't care's and the lookers of the other way. In truth porn is not what it was in the 1960's and early 1970's. It is everywhere and the Internet has brought it in to the home for keeps. People have adjusted to it  they are even yawning at it. In the struggle of everyday life and the diminishment of the role of the church other people's morals are not something that the mainstream loses sleep over. Chong is treated politely by all she meets here  the moral castigation while often mentioned is offscreen and maybe even imagined.The first problem any documentary maker has to do is get us to care about the central character. To bring us inside their lives and dilemmas. The producers are only fair to middling. There is no real pacing and humour it is sombre and plodding. Sometimes nothing seems to be happening at all and features scenes that add nothing to my understanding of anything. This film wants to exploit porn. But do so from a different angle. The bosses of the industry are neither devils or fighters for freedom of expression something they occasionally pretend to be. They are in the main quickbuck merchants that cannot really be trusted. But at the same time are very nickelanddime. With a video camera and a motel room you can be a director and if you can't hold the camera steady or hold focus then make this in to a feature!Like I am not a buyer of porn I am not a buyer of this movie. Chong is not really that sexy and can only operate at the lower end of the porn movie biz and that is the bottom of the show biz barrel to start with! so let us not speak falsely now. She is the centre of a freakshow but very willing to be that centrepiece.Her confused sex life would still be a confused sex life if porn was outlawed or didn't exist. If you like rough sex and Chong says she does then when you go out looking for it you might well find it!Chong seems vacant and bored for a lot of this film. Maybe she is looking for that other life that many of the lost and the vacant are secretly looking for. She has tried sex doesn't work she has tried drugs doesn't work she has tried education too early to say. Maybe she just needs a hobby or to try that one last thing that the vacant try in order to change their lives Religion. Sex has brought Chong some limited fame if only as a fifteen minute wonder but even that doesn't seem to suit her. She needs to grow up and find a life and a way of living her life without hurting herself and those around her. I wish her well on her quest.".

This is supposed to be Grace Quek's chance to tell the REAL story of her alterego porn starlet Annabel Chong. Naturally you expect some indepth analysis of Quek's unconventional trajectory with adequate psychological insight and complex discussion. However you get none.This is an exploitative and disjointed sleazefest  but Quek herself is largely part of the problem. Instead of making sense of her dubious and scandalous career choices she flounders displaying fauxconfidence and nonchalance at times emotional instability and fragility at others. Quek is one of those privileged and intelligent people who orchestrate their lives in order to precisely undermine their privilege and intelligence. It is this unrepressed egocentric ungrateful display of selfindulgence that makes such people unable to garner sympathy or respect from anybody. Such happens here and it is rather pointless to have the subject of a documentary be so contemptible.Quek grew up as the only child of wellmeaning middleclass parents in one of the world's wealthiest nations where she attended some of the top schools before being granted the means to attend university in the UK. Yet amidst this oasis of privilege and opportunity she was oh so overwhelmed by her existential lack of purpose and identity that she headed for L.A. where she nosedived into the underworld of drugs and pornography.Meanwhile she rationalizes her choices by claiming there is some sort of higher philosophical quest embedded in what is otherwise blatantly selfdestructive behavior. Although it is clear Quek has unresolved issues and most probably longstanding clinical depression there is a catch she is and always has been in a position to DEAL and SEEK HELP. That she CHOOSES to destruct beyond repair and delude herself about her motives is the real travesty here and not all the nonsense some people keep pointing out about the porn industry being sleazy and exploitative and devoid of morals.Most women who get into porn come from workingclass if not downright desolate backgrounds. Their childhoods and adolescenes are best quantified by LACK rather than excess. Many have a history of child abuse sexual abuse violence and early drug and alcohol addiction. That Quek would choose such an exploitative industry as the medium to carry out some of sort of intellectual exercise to in her words subvert Western ideals of masculinity only exposes the fact that her choice had NO SUCH INTENT. Partaking in the infamous gangbang was merely indulgence in a high form of selfdestruction  hey with an audience to boot Quek seems is undeniably a narcissistic sort of masochist. The fact that she doesn't care about never having been paid a cent also compounds this. Name a single porn actress who would work for free! The sad this is her intent in making this documentary is one and the same as her intent in doing porn more selfindulgence more selfabsorption and more selfdestruction. I am only sorry that she consented to getting her parents involved in it  watching the scenes of her mom is heartbreaking. Many kids fail their parents but for a kid to be so ungrateful as to FLAUNT their failure is just unnecessary.".

Even though she is doing graduate studies at USC and many of her teachers and friends refer to her high intelligence she doesn't mind filming pornography and degrading herself. I'll give a semibiographical synopsis of the movie's view of Quek from my personal perspective Quek was born into a middle class family in Singapore. Her life seems OK. She decides to move to London to start college. One night she is brutally raped in an alleyway. Later she moves to LA and while majoring in Gender Studies at USC she decides to film porn as an experimentation against the antifeminist views of society. The gangbang is supposed to show her as a female stud who should be admired the same way as Hugh Hefner. I believe that first Quek must have suffered from severe insecurity as a teenager due to her appearanceshe does have rather bad teeth and she feels that the porn community sees her as a beauty queen. Second the rape she suffered extremely lower her selfesteem to the point where she probably believes she has no worth. Hence the porn makes her feel powerful. Still she has extremely erratic behavior. When she is on Jerry Springer she resembles a porn bimbo instead of a supposed graduate student. She attentively follows any order given by her porn producers which are portrayed as they are shameless pigs. Later she is discarded by them and replaced with a better looking gangbang girl.In one scene when she starts yelling at someone on the streets and then runs I get the sensation that she is extremely ashamed of herself and wishes to completely disappear from public view. But later she is seen at an academic conference in London again taking pride in her gangbang. Either she's bipolar or she suffers from multiple personality disorder. This documentary shows a lonely woman with extreme selfdestructive behavior. She only has one friend she doesn't seem to have a real emotional relationship the porn community totally rejects her. As a viewer I ended up feeling sorry for this porn star.".

They can lick my a.I had to laugh when one porn star MIchael Coxx stated that her signature act gave porno a bad name and a porn star Ona Zee trying to pretend that she did high class porn.It was a great inside look at the business that killed Beta and will kill Blu Ray.I love fried zucchini but I will never look at a zucchini the same way again.";

Its not pretty but its a different matter.  Annabel's case is tragic.  Her life was endangered she was cheated out of the money she was owed and she allowed herself to be screwed by a succession of dogs who couldn't get laid any other way.  She exploited nobody but would never acknowledge she'd been used.  Anyway enough insightful stuff has been said about this movie already on this page.  I just want to ask what became of Gough Lewis.  Even though he was having an affair with Annabel at the time of the film allowing some real intimacy but zero affection we learn nothing about him.  I'd like to know he how felt about making the film and whether or not he was just another abuser trying to hold a mirror up to Annabel and show her how misguided and pathetic she was.

The plot is ludicrous the characters unbelievable and the acting oh I mentioned this already dilettante. Effects had gone overboard and factualities of science wildly disregarded. Yet!

The film is made all the better on a personal level in the fact that Rammstein make a live appearance at the beginning of the film. Vin Diesel has the charisma and potential to be the next big action movie star and has a really cool voice. Samuel Jackson gets to play his typical gruff shouting role that he has made his own and there are several stunts that are truly breathtaking it is just sad that one of these led to the stuntman performing it's death.".

It doesn't take 2 brain cells rubbing together to know what you are going to get here and you get PLENTY of it!  This was not a typical movie choice for me my guy's turn to choose but I had some idea what to expect and I think you do too. Having said that here is a BIG SURPRISE  this was one of the MOST FUN simply enjoyable movies I have seen in months maybe a couple of years!!!  This film is wonderfully unpretentious.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and we shouldn't either.  Does XXX provide deep intellectual insights an elegantly constructed production with soulsearching performances an airtight plot with masterful dialog gritty realism completely truetolife action scenes brilliant editing?  Although the answer is obvious in case you haven't seen the trailer the answer is NO a much better question is WHO CARES?!  This movie is all about fun!  Crazy mindblowing awesome and in some casesof course obviously impossible extreme stunts!  Diesel is charismatic and charming the girl is sexy and engaging and the bad guy is appropriately nuts.  The plot is good enough. The way they take out a communications tower doesn't make much sense but otherwise we'd miss out on another amazing stunt scene so once again who cares!  Hey check out 'Signs' a supposed new masterpiece by a supposed great director if you want to see a film that really makes no sense! There's some humor and a few decent oneliners too.  One of the Bond spoofs is even smartly hilarious a car stuffed Bondstyle with gadgets that end up being virtually useless.  The way this film is NOT extreme is also refreshing.  There is just basic shootemup and action stuff  no extreme violencegore no extreme profanity no extreme sexual content and no extremely 'important' artistic message.  In other words nothing to detract from the great fun of a fastpaced amazing stuntfest that is light refreshing and visually awesome.  The perfect summer action flick!".

It is also a lot of fun.After losing another spy on the trail of ultra stupid terrorist anarchy 99 whose plan for world domination involves building a boat in a landlocked country the NSA decide they need a new breed of agent. Therefore they kidnap extreme sports enthusiast and counter culture hero Xander Cage aka xXx aka Vin Diesel playing virtually the same character he did in Pitch Black and The Fast And The Furious. After watching him do Evil Kineval impersonations around a Colombian cocaine plantation whilst the army try to blow it off the face of the Earth they cut him a deal. Either save the world or go to jail. Unsurprisingly he chooses the former.For the first 20 minutes it looks encouragingly like the they have just allowed the stunt team to make the entire movie. However before long we have scenes developing the love interest set in swanky restaurants and a lush orchestral score creeping in. This wouldn't be a problem if the writer didn't think the phrase one liner referred to the amount of decent dialogue he had to include in the entire film. As it is your mind starts wandering as soon as things stop exploding.However xXx's action sequences are more than enough to compensate the viewer for their patience during the more laboured elements of the film. The stunts are by turns ambitious outrageous and just plain improbable however it seems unlikely that the film will be causing the James Bond producers too many sleepless nights. In fact before long they will be making films to appeal to people who think the xXx movies have too much dialogue and not enough numetal. They'll probably call them Jackass Bond.".

It just must be explained first.Given the way of the Hollywood blockbuster i.e. the hideously PC lacklustre uninvolving pap we're getting forcefed these days that you instantly forget when you leave the theatre it's nice to see a film that doesn't care if you like it or not. xXx is this movie. It knows it's not big clever or funny but it doesn't care and it gets on with it's exploding wares with admirable effort. In fact xXx is much like it's star Vin Diesel. He and the film may not be the greatest in their field but damn it they're gonna try as hard as possible to keep your bum on the seat.They succeed. You won't be forgetting xXx in a hurry. You might not enjoy it as much as I did but if none of this film leaves a gawping 'wow they actually went and did that' expression on your face you may well be dead. My only real criticism other than the movie's stereotypical nature which is a given anyhow given it's director and publicity is it's running time. I watched the extended special edition cut and it's about 2 hours 10 minutes. Either way you cut it that's a long time to sit through a movie that boils down to 'get girl kill baddies'. Minor gripe though. Check it out it's worth your time.".

The story structure mirrors that of the franchise of cramming in several different locations because it seemed like a good idea at the time  so much so you find yourself forgetting what the original plot was  there's a femme fatale and the bad guy wants to start effectively world war three .

	schema:reviewBody "xXx was an bad movie. It was marketed as the new Bond having biggest action and hero people could relate to. After a sequel that divebombed at the box office and the Bond franchise better then ever the xXx movies are now dead in the water.The plot of the movie was weak Xavder Cage Vin Diesel was an illegal extreme sports star ends up getting recruited into the NSA headed by Samuel L. Jackson. After a bit of training including being sent to Colombia to avoid capture by Drug Barons. He is then sent to Prague to investigate Anarchy 99. Anarchy 99 aim is world domination and planned to use chemical weapons to destroy the world's major cities. The dialogue of the film was bad and there is no subtly. It is just a show of explosions and shooting battles where the bad guys can't seem to shot straight. It isn't even trying to be comedic which at least True Lies try to do I'm not a fan of that film either. It seem to be an attack on Bond type films but it didn't work. It was just aimed at 14yearold boys and having extreme stunts and unrealistic events such as riding on a mission in the middle of the river Vltava. This sort of film would have had a short shelve life and will not last. It could not build a franchise and most people would outgrow this sort of movie.I remember when it was released that there was some talk that Vin Diesel was considered to be a potential Bond and I was thinking what the hell are you one. Die Another Day tried to be more action based and be more unbelievable. The director of that film Lee Tamahori ended up directing the sequel. The real threat to Bond and forcing it to change was not this rubbish but the Bourne Trilogy.Its just not worth watching this film.".

Even though I thought that the kids Robert Hy Gorman and Madeline Zima were absolute brats at first I still enjoyed their performances.

My opinion of the movie has definitely faltered since I watched it back in grade school but at the same time it maintained my interest for the entire hour and a half. To be fair a goofy comedy like this is aimed primarily towards children. That is not totally an excuse but you can't view this movie in the same way you'd view Citizen Kane. Hulk Hogan is no great actor. He can't even bump his head on a kitchen cabinet convincingly. But as mediocre as his talent is he is somewhat fun to watch. It wouldn't be as funny to see an actor half his size in a ballerina outfit. But Hulkster doesn't give the worst performance. The film's weakest link is the disgustingly overthetop performance by Buster Poindexter's David Johansen. It's no mystery why he's box office poison i.e. Car 54 Where Are You Freejack. Sherman Helmsley is completely overthetop as well but at least he provides some funny moments. Most of the jokes are lame and predictable but if you're looking for mindless family fun you can do a lot worse than Mr. Nanny. But I enjoyed Suburban Commando a lot more. At least in that movie the Hulkster had a talented actor like Christopher Lloyd to feed off.".

How many times had I screamed at my brother to get what I want.Overall it is a weak movie but keep an open mind it was made in the early nineties also what Hulk Hogan gets up to with Madeline I think is priceless.

How many times had I screamed at my brother to get what I want.Overall it is a weak movie but keep an open mind it was made in the early nineties also what Hulk Hogan gets up to with Madeline I think is priceless. How often do you see a wrestler in a tutu with curly hair in ribbons.";

But we should also remember that some wrestlers were involved outside of the wrestling world and finetuned their fighting skills into the movie business and one of them was the iconic  Hulk Hogan! Personally he was my favourite wrestler back in the day and probably most others would agree as well so as a kid you would sort of be excited he'll be starring in movies and we all think of Hulk as the good guy. As a kid I thought of Hulk as the unstoppable guy and he was pretty much the unstoppable guy. The movie was fun. It shouldn't be taken to seriously as that was not its purpose. I only like it mainly because Hulk was in this movie and he's one of my favourite wrestlers ever top 10. I'm not so sure if too many people know about this movie including wrestling fans. There haven't been many reviews here either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes you expect a certain something from a film. You expect it to just be good. At least. But the first impression when you hear of Mr. Nanny is instant nausea. Now you might not know why this produces nausea until I lay down the plot for you. Think of image no. 1 Hulk Hogan as a babysitter wearing a tutu. While I freely admit that it doesn't sound promising it's nevertheless astounding that the production team was able to take this simple idea and create one of the most monstrously agonizing motion pictures to come along this year. Now here is image no. 2 Hulk Hogan giving a small child weapons training. Image no. 3 The child electrifying the school bully with his newfound weapons interest. Image no. 4 Hogan and Kid celebrating because Kid has electrocuted Bully in an awful manner.What we have here is good material for a spoof. How funny would it be to see an eightyearold electrocute his bully in a Farrelly Brothers movie? But it's not a spoof. The problem is that in Mr. Nanny it is not played as a spoof but as the real thing. The kid supposedly electrocutes his school bully for real and we are supposed to feel happy because he has beaten the bully at his own game. That has to be the most sappy excuse for an emotional rush I've ever heard. I don't feel like celebrating with this kid but rather arresting Hogan and ordering a restraining order on him.Hulk Hogan plays downonhisluck exwrestler Sean Armstrong get it Armstrong?. He has long since exited the ring because of recurring nightmares involving violence in the ring. To give Sean something to do his best buddy and manager Barney Sherman Hemsley gets him a job as a bodyguard for computer genius Alex Mason Austin Pendleton. Mason has invented a new super chip and a psycho is out to get it so the engineer needs someone to look after his two motherless children played by Raymond O'Connor and Madeline Zima. Reluctantly Sean agrees but only because they already have a nanny and his job will be strictly protection. No sooner has he arrived however than the nanny quits and Armstrong finds himself babysitting two demons. A film like Mr. Nanny is intellectually insulting on all levels. You have to wonder what the producers and filmmakers were thinking when they gave the OK to this film. It doesn't have a plot. It doesn't have good acting. It doesn't even have a halfdecent script. The only reason for this film apparently is so that Hulk Hogan could be shown in a ballet tutu.Hulk Hogan can't act. His best performance was his threeliner in Gremlins 2 The New Batch. So you can imagine how awful it is when the testosteronejunkie with the deep voice fills up the majority of screentime in the film and tries to teach a father the values of family interaction and why it's good to tell your kids you love them. Perhaps this would be good material for say a muscleman that can act like Arnold Schwarzenegger but the Hulk can't act half as good as Mr. Schwarzenegger and most likely never will be able to. Most of the apparent laughs in this film come at the expense of Hogan and at the expense of every film it has borrowed from. It's a bunch of recycled gags posing as new ones. But it might as well be said that I expected it.To name some of the recycled gags here they are He's hit on the head with bowling balls see Uncle Buck drenched with water see Dennis the Menace covered in flour see Dennis the Menace a second time and electrocuted see Home Alone 2 Lost in New York. Not one of these instances is funny and it isn't because we've seen it so many times before. And another thing that doesn't help this film at all is the inept direction of Michael Gottlieb. Such comedy while once amusing in Home Alone has long since worn out its welcome. Here it's handled in such a pedestrian manner that it comes across with the audible clunk of a standup comic's joke falling flat. Don't see this movie whatever you do. If you see it glaring at you in the video store with Hulk Hogan's godawful smirk on his face pass it up. Even if it looks like clean family entertainment. It is far from it. It is PG13 material packaged in a sweet little box. It's not a film. It's merchandising plain and simple.There used to be a time when wrestling and Hulk Hogan where what Tony Hawk and skateboarding are today to children. Anything with Hawk sells and at one time anything with Hogan sold. Film execs knew this and played to it. And that's all Mr. Nanny is Marketing plain and simple. Don't give any more money to these selfish corporations. They can live with what they did. Mr. Nanny was a spurofthemoment film made for cashpurposes. I'm surprised that all copies weren't burned after Hogan withered away into the recesses of hasbeen because this film stands out as a single merchandising attempt and its time has long since passed.No stars 0 out of 5 John Ulmer".

My brother dad and I went the very first week it opened! Good thing we did because it didn't last to week two.The movie is basically Hogan as an out of work wrestler. His manageragent Burt Sherman Helmsley can't get him any in ring work because him and Hogan told a promoter they weren't throwing matches. You may say isn't wrestling scripted like a play? Yeah but this is 1993. That was still a secret. So anyway Burt can't put him in the ring so he gets him a job as a body guard for a scientist who just created the chip to some missile or something. Hogan thinks he's golden until he learns that he's not guarding the scientist he's guarding his kids. The kids are little monsters who have terrorized every nanny they've ever had. Plus one added twist we didn't see coming HOGAN HATES KIDS!!! So who will have the last laugh Hogan or the kids? The answer not the audience.The kids play cruel jokes on Hogan in order to get him to leave. These include shortsheeting his bed making his exercise bike go really fast and causing him to fall into a pool of red seaweed. I know. The horror. Hogan sticks in there though and gets the kids to like him once he spends time with the daughter Kate and teaches the son Alex how to stick up for himself. Of course the son uses his brains because violence is never the answer. Especially when an ex pro wrestler is on the job.The kids finally fall in love with the Hulkster for good when he punishes them. If God were kind it would be by him giving Alex a big boot and dropping the legdrop on Kate. Sadly he doesn't even give the YOU!!! finger. After making them sit on a couch for about an hour the kids finally respect him and listen. Because their dad never did it and that's why he failed get it? The movie finally ends when the villain who is trying to steal the chip turns out to be the same wrestling promoter Hogan and Burt told to take a hike years back. That's right a wrestling promoter turned worlddomination villain. Not even Vince Russo could write that piece of gold! The villain who has a metal skull cap for reasons I don't have the energy to type is finally vanquished and Hogan isn't needed anymore. But he doesn't leave empty handed. He learns an important lesson about a children's love. Plus he ties Kate's dolly to his motorcycle. And good times are had by all. Except those who have sat through this piece of crapola.I loved this movie when I was a kid. I watched it over and over haven't watched it since and I still know the whole story. I laughed my head off every time and wondered why it didn't stay in the theaters longer.Now? Oh I'll still watch it. But not because I think it's good.".

A evil mastermind named Thesanatos finds out about the chip and tries on occasions to kidnap the kids and hold them ransom for the chip. When the kids are captured it's up to Sean to save the day.First my impression of this movie crap! I expected this to be a cute little movie with Hulk showing how he can act. Hogan can act but only in the size of a grain of sand. The kids are to annoying to care about and the father is a careless bum. Even the villain is an idiot. What are the odds of the villains head being shattered by the same man who he has to destroy years later when he tries to take over the world? This happens in the film and it stinks! The villain had his skull crushed by Sean years ago and has it replaced with a metal plate which by the way looks like tin foil. Now the film is filled with annoying actors bad plots stupid practical jokes that could never happen and horrible villains. If you want your five year olds to be happy make them watch this. If you want to sleep for an hour watch this. If you want pure entertainment watch something else. The only person in this whole film I actually liked was Sherman Hemsley he had a few good lines but he falls flat playing a retired fight promoter gone cripple. Poor Hulk Hogan I hope you learn from this mistake you made.".

If you want to sleep for an hour watch this. If you want pure entertainment watch something else. The only person in this whole film I actually liked was Sherman Hemsley he had a few good lines but he falls flat playing a retired fight promoter gone cripple. Poor Hulk Hogan I hope you learn from this mistake you made.";

The title made it seem like it would be a typical action movie all guns and brawn and little in the way of storyline but boy was I wrong. This movie based on a true story was powerful and touched me so much that it has prompted me to write my first film review on IMDb in over six years! This is a movie with a solid pedigree of cast behind it it is based on the life of Sam Childers Gerard Butler who without giving much away has a criminal past finds God and embarks on undertaking missionary work in civil wartorn Sudan leaving his loyal loving wife Lynn Childers Michelle Monaghan and his young daughter Paige Madeline Carrol back home in Penslyvania. This movie follows Sam's juggling how his Christian faith inspires him at home and also in Sudan.Gerard Butler has always been something of an enigma to me. In my opinion he can be hit and miss as an actor but in this movie he gives a powerhouse performance as the emotionally conflicted and stunted Sam Cilders someone who follows his faith and shows simple sometimes primal humanity in inhumane foreign environments. I think this is Gerard Butlers best performance to date he expertly immerses himself into Sam  he is so believable in this role both emotionally mentally and physically. The audience may find it hard to remember it is just a movie at some stages. Michael Shannon is amazing a Sam's childhood friend Donnie a troubled soul who is another person loyal to Sam but ultimately flawed.This is not a movie I feel will get the awards it richly deserves. Similar in tone to Hotel Rwanda it is an inspiring story but with a sobering message. It reminded me a lot of Hotel Rwanda because it showed how one man alone with enough faith in simple humanity can make a difference. Sam Childers is not a saint far from it he is flawed and he has a violent and criminal side and this is evident in the movie. However he is also shown as having humanity and the fact that he decides to make a stand and do something away from the comfort of his armchair in America is testament to his character. Would the audience have the courage to do what Sam did? That is a question facing the audience as they leave the movie along with the graphic images which will haunt the audience for a long time after seeing the movie.There are so many powerful moments in this movie that it is hard to pin point any without spoiling the plot. This is not a movie that you should take a date along to or anyone who is squeamish or unsettled by blood and guts. This is a movie that takes the audience in the palm of their hands and opens their eyes to the blunt reality and the truth of genocide. It is similar in that way to Hotel Rwanda but I found this movie even more graphic and unsettling in many ways. This is a movie you should watch at all costs although you may not want to see it again. It is hard hitting powerful emotional but most of all thought provoking.".

After watching the movie and checking the IMDb rate i must say it is highly underestimated and i was forced to make a statement.i would recommend this movie. it leaves you thinking not only about the characters itself but also about the issue of the movie. I myself spend hours of researching about the problems which are shown in the movie.i find the characters very appealing although at some point i thought it could be portrayed better than it was actually done.Overall it is a really good movie and worth a watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie and was simply left speechless. It was amazing!! The story of Sam Childers is amazing. It really makes you think and wonder how can one person have so much willpower and stamina to keep doing what he has been doing all these years for these children. I was shocked by what the LRA has been doing to these children but unfortunately this is the truth and history keeps repeating itself especially in African countries. I have lived in Africa for many years and seeing somebody doing something about these atrocities does mean a lot even though he is a white savior. If this is what it takes so be it. Let's not denigrate it as I have seen so many do in their reviews. It is a very moving story and although it is extremely violent at times let us not forget this is a true story and these things happened it can be very touching and emotional. Gerard Butler's performance is Oscar worthy and Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon were also great even though their roles were short but then again the story is about Sam Childers. However what I would really like to know is why some of the critics trashed this movie?? !! Most of the people who saw it found it excellent as I did. And why was it not widely distributed??? I think people should see this movie and be more awake and aware!! Was it too controversial for some?? It leaves me wondering !!!".

The story and the screenplay are engaging with a perfect combination of drama and action. The only thing that irritates me is douchbags that write that this film like is a Christian propaganda.

The real life Sam Childers at the beginning of the movie is an excon druggie gunloving drug dealer thug lousy dad worse husband and overall man of failed character. When he finds God he loses the drug labels but the only other thing that really changes is his postal address.Sam Childers sees himself as a modern day crusader working to make a better life for the war orphans in Sudan. It's impossible to argue that he hasn't had an impact on lives. The real question is at what cost and by what methods? Over the closing credits we even get a clip of the real Sam asking us does it matter how?.You will find no debate here for whether or not this man has made a difference or whether his methods should be judged. This space is merely for analyzing the movie which is telling a story. Gerard Butler does an admirable job making Sam a somewhat sympathetic character. Reread my first paragraph if you think that's easy! Michelle Monaghan plays Lynn his incredibly supportive wife who actually helped Sam find God rather than continue his criminal drugaddled ways with friend Donnie Michael Shannon.While I found the story of the Sudanese children to be heartbreaking the choppy and fragmented manner in which it's presented was quite annoying. The story began in 1998 but we never really knew what year it was or how much time had passed between Sam's trips home. Many of the gun battle scenes came across very staged and setup for a cool shot of Butler brandishing a weapon and bandanna.So while I found the story to be quite interesting I found the delivery to be less than adequate. This despite fine performances from Butler Monaghan Shannon Kathy Baker and Madeline Carroll. There are numerous magazine articles about Sam Childers and I believe you will find those more accurate and informative.".

The other actors are really good as well. Won't lie  i shed a few tears too. You feel terrible for all the people and children of Sudan and Uganda. I would definitely see this movie!!!!!!!! You won't be disappointed. Awesome! Loved it!";

	schema:headline " Childers Story Holds Great Potential  Lead Role Sadly Miscast  Inconsistent Script";
	schema:reviewBody "Machine Gun Preacher is produced by Gerard Butler who by no small accident has absorbed the lead role which is based on the reallife story of Sam Childers. Sam is a reformed excon whose former life was dangerously reckless until he turned his life around and began to do the Lord's work. I was inspired by the core storyline which concerns itself with themes of transformation.There were some missing puzzle pieces in the script. One example is just after Childers comes to Jesus. After a mandatory church scene the period of time when he truly changes his life is not addressed. If the film had shown this difficult transition of what it really means to leave the old world behind then the plot would have benefited by a realityshot to the arm. Some of the African scenes were moving like where Childers has built an orphanage and becomes a freedom fighter who rescues wartorn children. And that's why I felt that I had to give this film a rating of 6 stars rather than a mediocre 5.Kathy Baker and Michael Shannon both very fine actors should have been given more lines and more screen time. Savane did a fine turn as the African comrade. I'm not as convinced as some of the pro critics about the casting of Monaghan as his wife. She played it with a quiet sincerity but what I hoped for was a stirring undertone revealing fragments of her former hardscrabble life. Who could have done this role real justice? How about Melissa Leo?At the end of the film the rolling credits reveal the reallife Sam Childers. It was at this moment in seeing and hearing the burly earthylooking biker man that I was further convinced that Childers himself was miscast. Gerard Butler's handsome looks are distracting. He does a fair enough job but the role does not shine. In the church scenes when he was preaching the credibility was sorely lacking. It felt like Butler was going through the motions. Can Gerard Butler get an Amen brother and sisters?Sadly not from this viewer.So who could carry the mantle of Childers with sufficient gravitas? Several actors come to mind Billy Bob Thornton Philip Seymour Hoffman or Michael Shannon. Each of these gentlemen have the chops to tackle a difficult role like this. I'm grateful that this story has come to light in this film. But after going online to find out more about Sam Childers I see that his personal web site is polished and fairly commercial. This slick branding is the opposite of Childers who is a gruff rebel rouser and also happens to save children. Similarly this film seems to try too hard to be accepted into the famedriven flock of Hollywood. And that dear brethren could be the weak link in this film. While the movie is clearly faithful to the commercial demands of Movietown the genuine story of Sam Childers has been watered down and compromised. My hope is that 10 years from now some indie filmmaker will redevelop this story and infuse it with all the complex gritty glory which it deserves.".

The idea of 'turning from evil to angel' is taken word to word from a religious point in this movie and there is no decency in the the way things take action. I just cannot believe this movie has such a high rating with the amount of bullshit it contains.Another negative point is the 'facts' this movie is trying to show. At one point it started promoted Christianity as the right way of life and I do not say that is completely wrong as I am open minded but when it does that in a very explicit way it just kills the movie. Another horrible turn of the movie is a sentence that made me sad because it is being taken for granted. It is a part of the dialog in the first half of the movie where a man says The Muslim north has been killing the Christians in the south for over 30 years. From a political view that is pure bullshit and there is no other way to describe it. If they were trying to be informative they should have brought the facts in a right way the way it was said very carelessly indicates a very wrong fact about the situation between Southern and Northern parts of Sudan.I am completely disappointed with this movie and I sincerely hope I never ever heard of it.".

Although I've been in Africa and was expecting that part of the movie to be somewhat boring to me after reading a previous review that claims that the first part of the movie was slowdoing and boring I swear I was so absorbed by the story that I felt no second of bore or slowness. I have no clue what some people were expecting! The actors and actresses did a great job to do the characters justice. I loved Gerard Butler but who doesn't love this guy. What I appreciated especially about his acting was the real depth he gave his character. An amazing performance. I ended up crying towards the end because the story is so touching. It is by no way a lighthearted movie to watch if you can't think for yourself about certain truths in life if you want a brainless comedy obviously this won't be your cup of tea. I loved the reallife Sam 'takes' in the end near the credits. And yes I think this guy is doing exactly what he is supposed to be doing and he's making a huge difference in the hopeless world in Sudan. In that context of a lawless country where kids have no rights whatsoever what he does is what anyone with a consciousness and guts ought to be doing to make a difference in the world. I hope this movie opens the door to more funding for his efforts. And like Sam says to his church goers WAKE UP! Don't be like sheep. This man is truly living his life fully awakened. Thank you to all who worked to bring this story to the movie theater. It was more than worth it.".

He then magically gives the American dream to his family that he neglected and abused for 90 of his life and suddenly everything is Aokay.He then starts his own church and a mission in Africa. He spends most of his time neglecting his business and church to hide from his problems in Africa. It's like he can't focus on the problems plaguing his community which obviously has problems if there is such rampant crime and drug use which he knows of first hand. Anyways he gives some warriors of god speech to his church so they can sponsor his little jihadvacation in Sudan.He also goes to his former boss and pretty much uses the fear of god's wrath to bully him into paying for his little crusade. When his former boss doesn't give him exactly the dollar amount he demands he storms out of the party his former boss invited him to like an angry child and throws a temper tantrum at his wife and kids.I also love how he cares so much for these people half way across the globe rather than his own friends and family. He pretty much just ignores his family browbeats and verbally abuses his daughter when she just asked for some money to get a limo to her prom even though he took out a freaking loan he has no hope of repaying for his mission in Africa and leaves his friend to die all so he could run away to Africa and play hero. It's partially his wife's fault because when he wanted to quite like any person with a brain would after watching their mission burn down and be thrown into a war zone his idiotic wife tells him to stay there waste more money and possibly die.In short it was a movie about a bunch of people with a messiah complex that would rather play savior then actually think for themselves.

	schema:reviewBody "Religion and violence are far more synonymous than most people of faith would care to admit and with Machine Gun Preacher Gerard Butler's criminalturnedmanofgod certainly embraces that twisted mantra with a fervor. Despite adding a little too much storyoftheweek flavor what allows this Africanset wartime dramaactioner to distinguish itself from your typical one man against evil archetype is Butler's charisma and instances of character arc complexity that do not play out as you might expect. Directed by Marc Forster Quantum of Solace Machine Gun Preacher chronicles select chapters from the life of Sam Childers Butler and his crusades against the genocide in Sudan by constructing an orphanage for the casualties of the conflict  the ones who are still alive. When we start out Childers has just been released from prison and wastes no time returning to his biker bar reuniting with his bad influence of a best friend Michael Shannon and setting up a tidy drug score. After an unforeseen complication and an attempted murder leaves the man shaken he turns to his religious wife Michelle Monaghan for salvation. What he finds while on a missionary outing to Sudan are the orphans whose cause he initially addresses by allowing the majority of a wandering pack of young children to cram themselves in his tiny motel room. From there it becomes an obsession  an addiction  as much as a cause. It is from this point where the fable deviates favorably if not flawlessly from its traditionally constructed roots when Childers realizes simply constructing a modest orphanage and the presence of a white man is not enough to keep the rebels at bay. Hence the machine gun preacher is born allying himself with revolutionists and carrying out attacks raids and ambushes with the apparent end goal to protect his children. What we actually see unequivocally is his sociopathic side slipping through his soft veneer and his addiction swelling to an allout overdose of righteousness. To make matters worse he alienates his actual family back in the States drives them close to financial ruin with his selffunding efforts and refuses to quit because of his own broken logic. This makes Childers a somewhat unlikable individual in that respect but also makes him all the more intriguing. I still fail to see Butler ever rising to the plane of an awards garnering thespian but he is consistently largerthanlife and rarely uninteresting to watch on screen. He infuses Childers with a bravado and intensity that is enough to compensate for unevenness in the screenplay. Also of note is that while the film is about a preacher and his godly crusade Machine Gun ironically rarely preaches and lets the story and the horrible situation speak for itself. There are instances of manipulation when it comes to the orphans but things are kept refreshingly low key. Machine Gun Preacher tells an interesting story if a familiar one thanks to an amplitude of entirely fictitious and melodramatic Hollywood fare available about a man who still to this day champions orphans in Africa. Crisp action punctuations of graphic violence and solid performances throughout convey the proper message despite never really offering up of an enough impact to make anything click in the minds of the average individual. Essentially this is documentary lite with just enough energy to warrant the bigscreen treatment.".

It is from this point where the fable deviates favorably if not flawlessly from its traditionally constructed roots when Childers realizes simply constructing a modest orphanage and the presence of a white man is not enough to keep the rebels at bay. Hence the machine gun preacher is born allying himself with revolutionists and carrying out attacks raids and ambushes with the apparent end goal to protect his children. What we actually see unequivocally is his sociopathic side slipping through his soft veneer and his addiction swelling to an allout overdose of righteousness. To make matters worse he alienates his actual family back in the States drives them close to financial ruin with his selffunding efforts and refuses to quit because of his own broken logic. This makes Childers a somewhat unlikable individual in that respect but also makes him all the more intriguing. I still fail to see Butler ever rising to the plane of an awards garnering thespian but he is consistently largerthanlife and rarely uninteresting to watch on screen. He infuses Childers with a bravado and intensity that is enough to compensate for unevenness in the screenplay. Also of note is that while the film is about a preacher and his godly crusade Machine Gun ironically rarely preaches and lets the story and the horrible situation speak for itself. There are instances of manipulation when it comes to the orphans but things are kept refreshingly low key. Machine Gun Preacher tells an interesting story if a familiar one thanks to an amplitude of entirely fictitious and melodramatic Hollywood fare available about a man who still to this day champions orphans in Africa. Crisp action punctuations of graphic violence and solid performances throughout convey the proper message despite never really offering up of an enough impact to make anything click in the minds of the average individual. Essentially this is documentary lite with just enough energy to warrant the bigscreen treatment.";

Instead you get a and then and then and... narrative like reading a Wikipedia article. So is this a redemption story about a violent drugabusing criminal who gets God and turns his life around? Is it a faith story about the trials and tribulations of a Christian trying to do what he thinks is God's work in Africa? Or is it a Heart of Darkness story about a Westerner who is almost destroyed by Africa? As a result of this indecision the story is repetitive and overlong. By the second half it seems to consist entirely of watching Gerard Butler travel to Africa and then back to America. There is an interesting spin on the usual Western Save Africa sort of film. Aware that such films usually lack popular appeal this film tries to broaden its audience with lots of modern shakycame combat and an appeal to fellow especially in the US Christians to help their brothers in Africa. It doesn't really work. Partly because the battles are repetitive the same stunt involving an RPG and a jeep is used three times but mostly because they are disconnected from most of the rest of the story. They make great trailer fodder but little else. Whilst the Christian aspects never seem to quite work partly I suspect because the Director isn't a theist. I did however appreciate the treatment of the American Midwesterners. As one of the few groups you're still allowed to hate see Red State it was nice to see them treated with a little respect rather than just as redneck hillbilly Biblebashin' racists with guns.".

Because he knows what it feels like to finally walk into a place of worship and feel so alone he decides to build a storefront that says come as you are  we need you. Which is the Christian message. Not propaganda. Sam is successful in getting things going. He has a construction business and his church and is inspired to go to Africa to help build a school. It is the changing point for him. He is compelled to go back again and again to do something for the youngsters living in Hell.He finally realizes that no matter how good the missionaries are the Kona army will keep burning down everything kidnapping children killing their parents and worse until stopped. The 'government' has no help for those out in the bush country. So he grabs a gun and takes a truck and the mission guards and goes to get what kids he can and bring them back to safety.

But he only knows he is rescuing some of the children. That's it for him And it is HIS story. It's his POV. I can't fault him for that.The cast are good. Gerard Butler is especially good in the beginning scenes showing the badboy biker persona. The same qualities that made Sam an addict make him successful in other pursuits. Singleness of purpose and a laserbeam on what he wants to do. And of course Butler is fine in the action scenes. Looked real to me.Michele is good as his nononsense wife. She loves him but stands up for herself. Michael Shannon as Sams buddy doesn't get much to do. The actors in the Africa segment are all good but Savane is a strong presence. Madeline Carroll as daughter Paige is sweet and normal. Wants some attention from her Dad.The film was engrossing to me. 810 httpwww.imdb.comtitlett1586752".

	schema:reviewBody "Beginning with the inspirational connections JODI BREAKER takes the idea for its lead couple's strange profession and its title from a 2010 French film HEARTBREAKER but it is not a straight copy as was being said before its release. The plot no doubt had the potential of making a fine romantic comedy but it unfortunately doesn't work at all due to the same old repetitive stuff which we had earlier whole heartedly appreciated in BAND BAAJA BAARAT where we had Wedding Planners instead of Marriage Breakers. Interestingly this concept of a team of JODI BREAKERS or Divorce Specialist might be fresh for many but as I recall Govinda played a similar kind of specialist in his 2009 comedy LIFE PARTNER too which also couldn't sustain at the box office.The unimpressive promos of the film already had me in doubt as they clearly revealed the whole movie in a single line dialogue. In one of the key promos Helen yells at both Madhavan and Bipasha saying You two were only the cause of their breakup and now you two only would bring them together again. Now this one line only clearly gives away the whole plot of the film in just a few seconds and I really couldn't understand how the director Ashwini Chaudhary could approve such kind of revealing promo for his film made quite unintelligently. The promo heavily publicized at all the leading channels simply ruins the whole surprise element of the film which could have been easily avoided.Further it has a very boring and uneven script which neither allows it to become an enjoyable sex comedy nor a good romantic film in its both unimpressive halves. In fact the first half of the film is so distasteful that one loses all the hope of getting anything interesting in its later reels. The disappointment continues post intermission too as it once again offers those same old rotten love sequences lacking any freshness. The writers also throw in few weird comedy sequences here and there to fill in the spaces. But the unpleasant humor in them fails to do the trick wherein we are shown a Baba Kamdev referring towards Baba Ramdev a sexually psycho wife and few doctors fighting in an operation theater right in middle of an operation with the patient sinking in front of them. In the acting department its again a big letdown since noone is able to deliver something exceptional mainly due to its lousy script. Madhavan looks tired in the whole film with an untidy kind of getup. Bipasha apart from her item song doesn't look ravishing as she did in her previous films. Moreover the chemistry between the two is also missing particularly in their drunken kiss scene lacking the required sensuality. Rest of cast is strictly OK with Omi Vaidya once again trying to raise a few laughs with his new sexual speech.In all JODI BREAKERS has got nothing novel or fresh you might be expecting from its unusual title. Still ending on a positive note it offers only a few enjoyable moments which mostly come in its good songs like Kunwara Bipasha and Darmiyan. Plus it also gives you a visually delightful foreign tour at the cost of your 200 bucks ticket. So you can easily make your decision if you are interested in these.".

	onyx:emotionText "Beginning with the inspirational connections JODI BREAKER takes the idea for its lead couple's strange profession and its title from a 2010 French film HEARTBREAKER but it is not a straight copy as was being said before its release. The plot no doubt had the potential of making a fine romantic comedy but it unfortunately doesn't work at all due to the same old repetitive stuff which we had earlier whole heartedly appreciated in BAND BAAJA BAARAT where we had Wedding Planners instead of Marriage Breakers. Interestingly this concept of a team of JODI BREAKERS or Divorce Specialist might be fresh for many but as I recall Govinda played a similar kind of specialist in his 2009 comedy LIFE PARTNER too which also couldn't sustain at the box office.The unimpressive promos of the film already had me in doubt as they clearly revealed the whole movie in a single line dialogue. In one of the key promos Helen yells at both Madhavan and Bipasha saying You two were only the cause of their breakup and now you two only would bring them together again. Now this one line only clearly gives away the whole plot of the film in just a few seconds and I really couldn't understand how the director Ashwini Chaudhary could approve such kind of revealing promo for his film made quite unintelligently. The promo heavily publicized at all the leading channels simply ruins the whole surprise element of the film which could have been easily avoided.Further it has a very boring and uneven script which neither allows it to become an enjoyable sex comedy nor a good romantic film in its both unimpressive halves. In fact the first half of the film is so distasteful that one loses all the hope of getting anything interesting in its later reels. The disappointment continues post intermission too as it once again offers those same old rotten love sequences lacking any freshness. The writers also throw in few weird comedy sequences here and there to fill in the spaces. But the unpleasant humor in them fails to do the trick wherein we are shown a Baba Kamdev referring towards Baba Ramdev a sexually psycho wife and few doctors fighting in an operation theater right in middle of an operation with the patient sinking in front of them. In the acting department its again a big letdown since noone is able to deliver something exceptional mainly due to its lousy script. Madhavan looks tired in the whole film with an untidy kind of getup. Bipasha apart from her item song doesn't look ravishing as she did in her previous films. Moreover the chemistry between the two is also missing particularly in their drunken kiss scene lacking the required sensuality.

If there would of been better props we could say this movie could equal Little Giants1994 another good comic sports film.Between a one two ten I give a seven and a half thanks to the director's effort to bring in Mike Ditka to help out.";

	schema:reviewBody "Will Ferrell has had a pretty decent film career after leaving Saturday Night Live  much better than some of his contemporaries. His first effort Old School was hilarious and was followed up by Elf which was even funnier. Later he made Anchorman and most recently had the best role in Woody Allen's uneven Melinda  Melinda. Now it's back to family comedy with the tale of a frustrated milktoast father Phil Weston Ferrell the owner of a vitamin store who decides to coach a soccer team so his son can get in some playing time. Ironically his son Sam was dumped from his grandfather Buck's Robert Duval squad the champion Gladiators. Utilizing his father's worst enemy and neighbor former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka as his assistant as well as two extremely talented Italian players Francesco Liotti and Alessandro Ruggiero Phil's Tigers go on a Bad News Bearstype winning streak. Of course this is a family film so when the gentle Phil goes crazy with the intense competition and his new found addiction to coffee he has to humble himself before his team  and his son  and finally do the right thing when the Tigers meet the Gladiator's for the title. Ferrell excels playing the goofy sensitive manchild who finds himself becoming like his father a sporting goods mogul. Sure there are the typical overthetop SNLlike pratfalls he gets stomped by Buck in a violent tether ball game beaten up by a group of kids spills scalding hot coffee on himself etc. but the message is sweet the children cute and the 90 minutes for the most part very entertaining.".

He makes Robert Duvall look good. He even makes the kids look good. Will is just pretty much himself weird and a little out of touch with reality. Make that a whole lot out of touch with reality.Still the support he gets in this movie is priceless. The concept of the team arriving late at a soccer game in a Butcher truck all wearing bloody aprons is inspired. Some of the other things are creative  cute too.

Will Ferrell Old School is hilarious. He is seemingly comfortable with films for all audiences such as Elf and the soontocome Bewitched. Robert Duvall Secondhand Lions plays an excellent role as an overbearing and competitive father. Also the appearance from Mike Ditka tight end in the NFL from 1961 to 1972 and coach of the Chicago Bears from 1982 to 1992 is a great accentuating ingredient to this film.Rated PG and has thematic elements language and some crude humor.

	schema:headline " Finally a nonPixar family movie that adults can enjoy";
	schema:reviewBody "You may be surprised to learn that rather than just being another overly silly Will Ferrell movie Kicking  Screaming is actually a brilliantly poignant expos on the foibles of the human condition. While a movie like Crash chooses to tackle the heavy issue of human relationships within a racially diverse atmosphere Kicking  Screaming goes a different direction and touches the soul of two topics that are near and dear to my heart sports competition and coffee addiction.I don't know about you girly girls but all us manly men are wellrehearsed in sports competitiveness. If you're worth your man weight in gold then you're driven by the need to compete. This isn't something that you carry through high school and then grow out of oh no you're stuck with it for life. I may have been at my most intense when running over a catcher back when I played high school baseball but I'm still known to throw an elbow in the church basketball league and to do a little trash talking during a heated ping pong match. If you refuse to believe a ping pong match can get heated then you've never played it the right way.Anyway this is a movie whose humor feeds heavily off the fuel provided by the competitiveness of all the men involved. Whether it be Robert Duvall a real man who says the only daily vitamin he needs is a steak going toetotoe against Will Ferrell in a passionate game of tether ball or Duvall and Mike Ditka constantly trying to outdo each other or Will Ferrell becoming so addicted to coffee that he installs a cappuccino machine on the bench and forces Ditka to resign as assistant coach the chemistry just works.It's a chemistry that is hard to accurately depict in writing. A chemistry whose effectiveness lies in the delivery. For example there's a young Asian boy on the soccer team named Byong Sun. When his mother asks Ditka for an autograph Ditka asks how to spell his name. She starts to spell it but he stops her and says I think I got it. When she later looks at the autograph she sees that Ditka has written Bing Bong. I can't explain why but this had me cracking up for about 5 minutes. I'd try to concentrate on the movie then I'd think about how selfassured Ditka was that he now knew how to spell the name and I'd bust out laughing all over again. Then later in the movie when Ditka yells out Way to go Bing Bong! I lost it all over again. It's just one of those things.Or when Ditka tells the kids I eat quitters for breakfast and spit out their bones and then Ferrell deadpans Delicious. My words can't do it justice. It's all in the timing and delivery. Sometimes this type of humor is so subtle that it might not be fully appreciated so I'm warning you now to pay attention to it.Speaking of Ditka he steals the show. He has a natural talent for comedy like this and it's hard not to laugh when he's on screen wearing a Bears sweater vest or a shirt that has Ditka on it. Just sit back and enjoy his competitive bickering with Duvall. When Duvall starts to taunt Ditka because he's been reduced to coaching little league soccer Ditka responds by holding his hand out and saying I couldn't hear ya my Super Bowl ring was making too much noise. The selfreferential tone works perfectly.The kids can get a little too cutesy at times which will play well with soccer moms but they do have some genuinely funny moments. Steven Anthony Lawrence is pretty annoying intentionally so but I did a spit take well not literally when the camera focused on his face while he was running and he breathlessly stated I'm in bad shape for 11. I guess you had to be there.I'm giving the movie 4 marks and I realize that's fairly high but this is a family movie and as such it's one of the most entertaining family movies I've seen in a while. Sure I didn't care for some of the cutesy kid stuff and things do get predictable and silly but what are negative elements for me will be looked upon more favorably by younger audiences and sappy parents.To find a movie that will keep adults consistently laughing throughout without resorting to material that'd make you squirm if you're sitting next to mama or the kids you usually have to look for the Pixar label so I tip my hat to Kicking  Screaming for succeeding. This is the kind of kid's movie I want to take my 10yearold brother to not Racing Stripes.Oh and please do yourself a favor and try not to take the movie too seriously. If you're such a curmudgeon that you'd actually complain about the scene where a mother stops her son during a game to put sunscreen on his face and you actually question why she didn't do this BEFORE the game then I'm sorry but you deserve to be slapped. Let me explain something... ahem IT'S A MOVIE!! Still not clear? OK let me elaborate...IT'S A WILL FERRELL MOVIE!! Do you see directed by Clint Eastwood attached to the credits? No? Then remove the corn cob loosen up and enjoy life a little.Sheesh. Some people. Now who wants to go headtohead with the Bettsmeister in a friendly game of ping pong?".

	schema:headline " Will Ferrell's Attempt to Save a Crummy Cheeseball Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Out of all the talented people who were on 'Saturday Night Live' in the last fifteen years Will Ferrell is by far my favorite. He's such a charismatic energetic and hilarious performer. He truly is a comic genius. He's also one of the most successful SNL alumni of all time. For most of the cast members after they leave 'Saturday Night Live' their careers go down the toilets. But not Will Ferrell he only improved his career after his goodbye to SNL with great comedies like Old School Anchorman and even Elf. Whenever you go see a Will Ferrell film you have the strong expectation of it being really good. Well Ferell's latest effort 'Kicking and Screaming' is a disappointment of epic proportions. But that isn't his fault. Poor Mr. Ferrell tries as hard as he can to lift this dud off the ground but he just isn't able to because of the movie's beyond lame screenplay. Yes those thinking 'Kicking and Screaming' would be the next great Will Ferrell movie are sadly mistaking. I was one of those people and that's why I left the theater so incredibly disappointed.The movie is a little league soccer flick and it circles around the alltoofamiliar plot of the dipstick son trying to live up to his nonsupportive father. The dipstick is Will Ferrell's character Phil Weston. He owns a vitamin store and is always trying to gain the respect of his father Buck Weston played by Academy Award Winner Robert Duvall who owns a chain of sporting good stores and viciously coaches a little league soccer team which Phil's son is a part of. One day Buck trades Phil's son to another team because he isn't a good player. This infuriates Phil and eventually has him coach the team his son has been traded to to show daddy he's not a screwup. The movie pretty much follows the competition of the two fatherson coaches. Whose team will win the championship? By the end of the movie you really don't care anymore and you're looking at your watch frantically to see how much of this waste of film is left.It isn't so much 'Kicking and Screaming' is a horrible movie it's just not a good one by any stretch of the imagination. The biggest problem with the film is the screenplay  it is absolutely dreadful to quote Simon Cowell to one of the untalented hack wannabe singers on 'American Idol'. It's very amateurish and it doesn't go places it should to be funny. It's very bland and so conventional it will have you yawning after the 30minute mark. Although it succeeds being funny sometimes for the most part it fails miserably at earning laughs. Whoever wrote this trashy script should be banned from the film industry because it is just awful. The movie is really saved by Will Ferrell who really puts forth an effort to make the most of his part but an actor in a film is only as good as the film's screenplay. Ferrell achieves hilarity in some scenes but most of his lines are embarrassingly stupid and unoriginal. Mike Ditka is actually pretty good playing himself and Robert Duvall serves as an example of a waste of good talent in this childish sap fest. In conclusion 'Kicking and Screaming' is something you should avoid. If you really love Will Ferrell it just may be worth watching to see Ferrell break out in a violent rage brought on by too much coffee but for the lot of us it is just plain old cinematic crap. Grade C screened at AMC Deer Valley 30 Phoenix Arizona 51305".

He tries different plays with his team even though they are not the best.Will Ferrell gets back at his dad for being such a stuckup person and then realises quite near the end of the film that he is acting like his dad was to him.Will Ferrell is quick to act and explains that he was an idiot to the team and finally puts his son in.

	schema:headline " Mediocre Family Film";
	schema:reviewBody "After years of dealing with his father's insanely competitive nature Phil Weston Will Ferrell finally gets the chance to meet up to his father's lofty expectations. He starts coaching a kids' soccer team but as they get closer to the championships he finds himself turning into his manic father.The premise isn't exactly new and a movie like this one tends to be on the predictable side. However sport comedies can be enjoyable and fun so I was expecting a fun little movie from Kicking and Screaming. The film turned out to be mediocre though. It offered a few funny moments but the script is kind of weak and Ferrell isn't given a lot to work with. Screenwriters Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick offer a rather lame script filled with a bunch of clichs and it brings the film down. They seem to be stealing from the Bad News Bears and Little Giants. However Kicking and Screaming still has a few original ideas and it is a harmless movie.The acting is okay nothing special. Will Ferrell gives an okay performance as Phil. Sometimes he manages to be really funny while other times he tries way too hard. Surprisingly Mike Ditka steals the film from Ferrell and he gives a good performance. His performance isn't going to light the world on fire but at least he does a better job than Duvall. Robert Duvall gives a bad and dull performance as Phil's dad. Comedy is not his element and he should avoid doing it in the future. The funniest kid in the film is Elliot Cho who played Byong Sun. The most annoying kid in the film is Steven Anthony Lawrence since he isn't funny at all. I don't understand what casting directors see in him since he's just annoying and not funny.Jess Dylan directs and he does an okay job. He manages to come up with a few funny scenes and he keeps the film very simple and safe. While the movie did have it's funny moments it also had a few dull scenes that weren't all that necessary. The movie is also kind of bland and really predictable. It was also kind of a lazy movie since the filmmakers didn't really try anything new. The good thing is that the movie is only 95 minutes long so at least it wasn't too much of a pain to sit through. Still Kicking and Screaming is only a mediocre family film and it's kind of a one joke comedy that gets old after awhile. In the end Kicking and Screaming isn't worth the full ticket price but it might make for a decent rental. Rating 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Kicking and Screaming concerns two brazenly childish parents who learn that Winning Isn't Everything. That another movie about grown men revisiting wounds of their youth through age group sports is upon us is quite sad in its own right. That Kicking and Screaming goes for laughs with ethnic jokes at the expense of children is just ugly. The shopworn proceedings are meant to be freshened by the antics of Will Ferrell who's just started to be on a roll and the hoary support of Robert Duvall and Mike Ditka. Yes that Mike Ditka. But this is still a movie about cute kids and life lessons.Phil Weston Ferrell has had to deal with his ubercompetitive father Duvall all his life. When Phil announces his engagement dad announces his own to a much younger woman. Family rivalry runs so deep that when both men have sons born on the same day dad takes great pleasure in pointing out that his own boy is a few ounces heavier. This seems a considerable effort for a set up  Phil has a son and brother the same age etc.  but the film mostly forgets about it. Odd. Being an empowering sensitive father it's of course only a matter of time before Phil's inner Lombardi is awakened when he agrees to coach his son's soccer team to which his son has been traded by grandpa himself the coach of the best team in the league. This is perhaps the first youth sports league in which players are actually traded making it ideal for highlighting tropes about Doing Your Best and Just Having Fun.With the help of neighbor Mike Ditka as assistant coach and his introduction to coffee which he's never drunk Phil indeed becomes a competitive monster. There are a lot of jokes about his growing caffeine addiction as well as the team's game strategy of always passing to the two soccer prodigy Italian immigrants whose father lets them play only if they remember the mantra of the family butchery meat comes first! Sadly Kicking and Screaming seems largely stuck in a retarded stage of development in which immigrant caricature and mispronunciation of Asian names Ditka refers to little Byung Sun as Bing Bong pass for laughs. Ferrell is gradually proving himself capable of sustaining films with his manic energy but here he's too often constrained by the confines of playing a more of less normal guy. By the final game  you guess between which teams  the filmmakers seem to realize that neither side is worth rooting for and abruptly force a moral epiphany on Ferrell as if it were a straitjacket.There's a lot of potential for sharp satire in the culture of sports parents but its insistence on simplistic moralizing prevents Kicking and Screaming from being anything more than a kids' movie. The lessons learned are so juvenile and basic that it seems insulting to be expected to care about adults who have yet to grasp them. Characters this immature aren't worth the time it takes to witness the meager redemptions imposed upon them.".

	schema:headline " Just family fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Has Hollywood finally come to realize that families need films they can go to again? I hope so and with luck films like Kicking and Screaming will help open that door. This is a movie for kids but also for adults. Will Ferrell is one of the few SNL members who have beaten the curse of the show. His career is actually doing pretty good. From Elf to Anchorman his roles have been strong and easy to watch. Much like Elf this family film can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. As Phil the son of Buck Weston who sees all competition as nothing more then another conquest and will do just about anything to win all the time. When he coaches a kid's soccer team Buck actually trades his grandson Sam to another team because he thinks the kid is a lousy player. Phil becomes the other teams coach but upon realizing he is in way over his head he recruits his dads neighbor and enemy Mike Ditka to help him coach the team. With the help of two Italian ringers the team starts the crawl up from the lowest rank to the finals and then to the championships. During this climb Phil comes to realize that in many ways he is just life his dad and sees what he is turning himself and his son into. Folks it is a family film. There is no nudity and the worst of the language is Hell. The closest it comes to sex is a few hits in the groin by various objects. It is the sort of film that tries to tell a lesson in how we look at others and ourselves. Yes the film is filled with humor such as when Phil discovers coffee and develops an addiction to caffeine. Watching him as he is banned from the coffee shop is laugh out loud funny. And seeing him as he tries to win a tetherball game against his father will crack a smile now and then as well. No this is not Gone with the Wind nor is it supposed to be. It is just what it is a funny film about a man who is trying to be a good father and finally understands what that can mean. Mike Ditka is the best thing about the film to be honest. He steals the show with his own personality coming out in the movie. He tends to misspeak or mispronounce names is funny even when it is expected. Bing Bong is a winner no matter what you do. The film is just fun and that is all it is supposed to be. It is not supposed to be something you go to expecting a change in your life but if you are lucky you might learn something.".

	onyx:emotionText "Has Hollywood finally come to realize that families need films they can go to again? I hope so and with luck films like Kicking and Screaming will help open that door. This is a movie for kids but also for adults. Will Ferrell is one of the few SNL members who have beaten the curse of the show. His career is actually doing pretty good. From Elf to Anchorman his roles have been strong and easy to watch. Much like Elf this family film can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. As Phil the son of Buck Weston who sees all competition as nothing more then another conquest and will do just about anything to win all the time. When he coaches a kid's soccer team Buck actually trades his grandson Sam to another team because he thinks the kid is a lousy player. Phil becomes the other teams coach but upon realizing he is in way over his head he recruits his dads neighbor and enemy Mike Ditka to help him coach the team. With the help of two Italian ringers the team starts the crawl up from the lowest rank to the finals and then to the championships. During this climb Phil comes to realize that in many ways he is just life his dad and sees what he is turning himself and his son into. Folks it is a family film. There is no nudity and the worst of the language is Hell. The closest it comes to sex is a few hits in the groin by various objects. It is the sort of film that tries to tell a lesson in how we look at others and ourselves. Yes the film is filled with humor such as when Phil discovers coffee and develops an addiction to caffeine. Watching him as he is banned from the coffee shop is laugh out loud funny. And seeing him as he tries to win a tetherball game against his father will crack a smile now and then as well. No this is not Gone with the Wind nor is it supposed to be. It is just what it is a funny film about a man who is trying to be a good father and finally understands what that can mean.

The image is cheerfully Fassbinderean sic? an image of the fake official 'reality' that the film will seek to undermine.  It is also a cinematic version of Magritte's famous painting 'Ceci n'est pas un pipe'  the static images are accompanied by matching sounds  car noises church bells etc.  asking us to question the assumptions behind any 'image'.So far so Fassbinder.  But it also points from this opening to how much this will be an Ozon film.  Just as Melville filmed Cocteau's 'Les Enfants Terribles' with maximum faithfulness to the author's style themes motifs etc. so Ozon offers some quite extraordinary Fassbinder pastiche.  He makes no attempts to 'open out' the play because Fassbinder's best films were always 'theatrical' cramped interior very much concerned with ideas of performance and role playing.  Ozon captures this cramped style perfectly the unnaturally symmetrical compositons the stylised positioning of actors the intrusion of decor and framing the jarring editing the breaks in modes from say intense psychodrama to a gloriously inane dance number. But just as Melville's very faithfulness to Cocteau resulted in the ultimate Melville film so 'Water' is pure Ozon.  It's just not grimly rigorous enough to be a Fassbinder film.  This is fine  we're not up to Fassbinder in the year 2000 we're more intellectually flaccid than people were in the 1970s we cannot take such uncompromising bitter pills without a sugar coating.  This is our fault not Ozon's and certainly not Fassbinder's. Fassbinder's films were often comic but gruelling so  laughter was never a relief but a shock of recognition even horror.  Here comedy prevents the material from ever being truly harrowing.  This is not to suggest that the characters are onedimensional or the actors aren't up to it.  Far from it. As in Fassbinder 'psychological truth' is rejected because it is a lie and we get more profound insights into characters from the use of colour e.g. a shirt matching a lamp mirrors lighting miseenscene and some superbly staged setpieces such as the remarkable final shot of Vera struggling to open the window trying to let some air into this intolerable fatally claustrophobic atmosphere  we see her as the camera zooms from outside like a mimeartist trapped in an invisible structure of her own making.  But at those moments where Fassbinder is at his most intense when the roleplaying and the easilymade speeches and the contrived situations reach a pitch and everything stands at a naked exposed intolerable silence Ozon will play some music distancing in a formal Fassbinder way but also giving the audience a more comfortably ironic viewpoint one where we are not required to suffer consequences.But as I say despite the familiar Fassbinder milieu characters types names sexual traumas even situations this is a very French film.  The difference in language for instance is not superficial harsh gutteral German seeming all the more repressive and aggressive.  My reference to Cocteau wasn't entirely gratuitous there is something of 'Les Enfants Terribles' in this Teutonic chamberplay a lightness of form structuring this heavy drama in this fourcharacter psychodrama poised exquisitely between elaborate game and emotional tragedy.  Some of the filming of Franz especially near the end having taken poison and wearing Vera's fur coat has a sublimely Cocteaulike grace to go with the lighting and shifting points of view taking the drama out of the tragicomically domestic into the realm of fantasy and myth.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film version of Fassbinder's play retains the theatrical structure  with 4 acts 4 actors and 4 great performances. The dialogue wins you  over at once and keeps you in rapt attention hanging on every word.  Leopold a persuasive selfindulgent bisexual restructures the lives of  3 people as he introduces them to new sexual adventures. First there's  Franz a goodlooking 20 year old who is contemplating marriage with his  girlfriend Anna. He becomes confused about love when he has a  homosexual dream which Leopold is only too happy to recreate once he  has enticed the somewhat inexperienced Franz into his bed. Then there's  Anna who is agreeably surprised at the change in Franz's sexual  attitude. She too is overwhelmed by Leopold's advances towards her.  Thirdly there's Vera  now a woman once a man  Leopold's exlover  perhaps more confused and disappointed than any of them.  It's an entertaining romp as we watch the hand of experience create  new lives for each of them. Leopold always in search of novelty knows  what each victim is yearning for and he is only too ready to meet their  desires....at least until the novelty wears off.  I felt the first three acts were absolutely flawless. Act 4 with its  black humour was less appealing I thought. The telephone call to his  mother was quite unforgettable.....I think I'll go to Heaven because  I'm young!....and spoken with such dead pan sincerity. And the  followup call to mother was a real gem.  Yes...it's the dialogue that fascinates and holds the play together...  the casting too is exceptional....and as for the old game of Ludo....  it will be so much more meaningful to me in the future!".

	onyx:emotionText "The film version of Fassbinder's play retains the theatrical structure  with 4 acts 4 actors and 4 great performances. The dialogue wins you  over at once and keeps you in rapt attention hanging on every word.  Leopold a persuasive selfindulgent bisexual restructures the lives of  3 people as he introduces them to new sexual adventures. First there's  Franz a goodlooking 20 year old who is contemplating marriage with his  girlfriend Anna. He becomes confused about love when he has a  homosexual dream which Leopold is only too happy to recreate once he  has enticed the somewhat inexperienced Franz into his bed. Then there's  Anna who is agreeably surprised at the change in Franz's sexual  attitude. She too is overwhelmed by Leopold's advances towards her.  Thirdly there's Vera  now a woman once a man  Leopold's exlover  perhaps more confused and disappointed than any of them.  It's an entertaining romp as we watch the hand of experience create  new lives for each of them.

Somehow the problems I always had enjoying Fassbinder the intense cruelty between his characters the disorienting emotional mood swings the bleak dreary German atmosphere were completely offset by the sense of play and love of color and music that Ozon brings to this script. As in  8 Women his sense of style and beauty rival Almodovar's and even the grim reality of Fassbinder has a beautiful chic French gloss.  He understands that love and sex in Fassbinder are closely matched with jealousy and destruction.  It all clicked for me.  And the omnisexuality is so fresh  so unspoiled...  That said it's a devastating critique of what lovers can do to each other.  But it's...well...so pretty...I really really enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching Water Drops on Burning Rocks it is hard to tell exactly what flamboyant French filmmaker Francois Ozon wanted to achieve with it. On the one hand the film is a commentary on relationships and sexuality but on the other hand much like Ozon's earlier Sitcom it's easy to think that the talented young director made the film simply to shock. While I don't doubt that shocking his audience was partly his motivation for making this film Ozon has still created a film that is more than credible on the substance front as the movie professes that just like the water drops that land on burning rocks of it's title relationships and love fizzle out over time. The four parties in the play also represent four different points on the sexuality spectrum we have an old bisexual male a young confused male a straight female and a male to female transsexual so the sexuality commentary is on track as well as the comment on relationships in general. Just like Sitcom also Ozon always seems keen to push the taboos of the story into the audience's face and does a good job as at times it's easy to feel dirty just watching this movie.The play that the film works from is from the pen of tortured artist Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Francois Ozon seems keen to respect this fact throughout as he makes various tributes to Fassbinder's distinct style. Ozon is also keen to work in tributes to the French new wave cinema most notably with a very strange dance scene that in spite of being offcue with the rest of the movie works very well thanks to the energy that Ozon gives the scene. It also serves as something of a relief to the disturbing and downbeat themes of the rest of the movie and it's the only time that the underlying layer of black humour which lies dormant for the majority of the piece although it's definitely there truly comes to the surface. In today's day and age there are few filmmakers that are still capable of making a film that will leave the audience with something at the end of it but it's safe to say that Ozon has managed it with this film. When the final credits rolled I was unsure as to exactly what I had seen but as time elapsed and I reflected on the movie it's brilliance comes to light. While the movie isn't quite worthy of the term 'masterpiece' it is certainly very good and it represents another huge feather in the already featherfilled cap of Francois Ozon.".

The conversation gradually gets around to seduction and both Lopold and Franz happily reenact each other's physical fantasies. Act II some months later and Franz has moved in with Lopold becoming the devoted housewife in lederhosen to Lopold's increasingly cranky self. They argue threaten but eventually succumb to the safety of the boudoir to settle differences. Act III Lopold's ex lover Vera Anna Levine arrives at the door to find Lopold in a new life and departs brokenhearted. Anna likewise arrives during one of Lopold's absences and for two days Franz and Anna try to recapture their previous affair. Upon Lopold's return Anna finds Lopold appealing and behaves seductively. Vera arrives reports that she is a transsexual now in a female form and Lopold is delighted with the idea of a mnage a quarte. But it is Franz who has found his true life and love and how he deals with the proposed turn of events forms the rather surprising end to this film.Each of the four actors is excellent and Ozon paces them well. There are some really fine moments as when Franz reclines in his bath quoting Heine's poem 'Lorelei' revealing how far more penetrating the changes in his vision of his life really have become when Ozon improves on Fassbinder. Not a great movie but a bit of the different that spices movie viewing. Grady Harp".

Underneath the kitsch seventies style and the black humour however this film has a serious topic the very nature of desire. These are characters who will do anything in order to fulfill their desires regardless of the destruction they cause to themselves or in the case of Leopold others. But what else is their for them in the suburbs of a non descript German town? capitalism may let you have sex without whoever you want but it doesn't seem to give you the tools to know whether you really want to be having sex with that person in the first place.

What will take place during the following 90 minutes will be confined in this chic but ultimately emotionally scarred place and according to Fassbinder  the man who penned this previously unproduced play about sexual politics between men and women  love and cruelty go hand in hand.Leopold Bernard Giraudeau very imposing suave and masculine a 50 year old business man who seems to be the alterego of Fassbinder himself has picked up a shy 19 year old Franz Malik Zidi and has invited him back to his pad. Both initiate a verbal game of seduction that has its objective clear but due to its language and the two men's interaction with each other is the movie's highlight of escalating eroticism even when it uses timeworn techniques as Have you ever slept with a man? as the question Leopold asks Franz after they have reminisced about the women they have been involved with. If anything the scene charged as it is deflates noticeably when Act One concludes with Franz lying naked in bed in an unerotic pose as Leopold becomes his fantasy man dressed in a trenchcoat and fedora to the sounds of a music box.Act Two brings the story some time later and already it seems like both Franz and Leopold have started to go into the irritations and rough spots that can happen in any relationship fraught with impulsiveness in lieu of sensibility. Franz is clearly in wife mode  his hair now combed to resemble a style common for women at the time and wearing emasculating lederhosen  and Leopold is clearly a tyrant in his own place and not about to change for the whims of this young man whom he likes in bed but nowhere else. After an argument they switch sexual roles Leopold obviously uncomfortable in the submissive position as Franz walks in decked in the same trenchcoat and fedora.Act Three brings more tension Franz girlfriend Anna Ludivine Sagnier and a mysterious woman who later identifies herself as Leopold's exgirlfriend Vera Anna Thomson begin to show up. Complications ensue Anna wants Franz to marry her and it doesn't shock her that he's been in a bad relationship with another man. Franz as a matter of fact is about to take charge when somehow he's lured back in with deadly consequences as he learns of Leopold's penchant of manipulating those whom he loves from Vera's own tragic story she'd been a man once and so in love with him she had allowed her masculinity to be reduced to nothing if it meant pleasing the man she he loved.Despite being Ozon's movie this is all Fassbinder down to the heavyhandedness of its ending. The only places where the movie becomes more Ozon's is in the handling of the quartet in a dance sequence reminiscent of the first musical number in 8 FEMMES and Ozon's own visual style  which would become a trademark for his later films. WATER DROPS ON BURNING ROCKS is an odd little movie talky with elements of the surreal  Leopold's overpowering masculinity seduces Anna and Vera into a threesome although Anna is clearly set to be his next victim and Franz fantasizes of shooting Leopold through the head. If the last sequence falls to pieces it's more the vision of a young writer and soontobe filmmaker who somehow seemed to have wanted to give some gravitas to his first play.".

I just preyed the director wouldn't show the boy being physically beaten. The entry of the girlfriend after which the two of them make a plan to escape brought a release in tension for a fraction of a second but I knew it was too good to be true and doubted whether our boy would really manage to escape. The orgy is scene is all too real too with the young girl thrilled at the bizarre situation she's in and dying for some adventure. I think it was all quite real and I identified with every situation though I wish I didn't because it just goes to show how evil I am myself!".

	schema:headline " Claustrophobic sensitive blunt story about the death of passion";
	schema:reviewBody "Ozon made this film from an early play by Fassbinder. It's an intense and claustrophobic love storythe whole thing happens inside an apartmentin Germany in the 1970s. Ozon divides it into acts the first of which shows Lopold Bernard Giraudeau a handsome and assertive businessman in his 50s talking to a young man Franz Malik Zidi. The conversation becomes a seduction and they go to bed enacting a dream Franz had an enactment that recurs several times with variations. Then they've been lovers for months and though the affection and attraction persists there's a destructive element in Lopold that shows up as restless discontent and meanspirited bickering. Nothing Franz does is right and though he wants to leave he is still in love. While Lopold is away on a business trip Franz's old girlfriend Anna Ludivine Sagnier shows up and she brings some sunlight into the dark rooms of the flat with her beauty her optimism her loving plans for a future with Franz her joy in lovemakingas well as the fact that she opens the curtains. Franz almost stops moping but then Lopold returns. The movie almost descends into farce as Anna finds Lopold attractive and then Lopold's former girlfriend Vera Anna Thomson arrives. When Lopold proposes a menage  quatre the girls run giggling to the bedroom but lags behind telling Lopold You don't need me. He answers But you need me. As Lopold and Anna have some vigorous sex Vera steals away feeling superfluous and she sits beside Franz on the floor and tells him her story. Nothing not even a sex change was enough to maintain Lopold's desire and though he abandoned her and treated cruelly then and now she says I'm his creature. Franz too is his creature and he's dyinghe's taken poison. Weirdly he calls his mother and has a brief matteroffact conversation letting her know what's happening and then he dies. Lopold seems just as unperturbed and goes back to bed with the weeping Anna. Vera tries to open the apartment window but it's stuck. We see her standing head down weeping her hands pressed against the glass as if trying to escape a trap.Although much of it is dark the colours and photography are impressive as is the acting of all four characters. Giraudeau delivers a fine mixture of sleekness power affection and selfishness while Zidi's part is also a mixtureof a kind of neoexistentialist disaffection he likes to say things don't mean much to him innocence and injured affection. Thomson is surprisingly powerful in her one big scene when Vera tells Franz her story. Sagnier is quite wonderful very younglooking fresh with that husky voice and that gorgeous body Ozon loves to film. While there's no graphic representation of sex acts here there's a lot of sex mostly as it begins but also one or two brief scenes in the process.Over all the movie appears to be a story of the heartlessness and destruction at the core of some relationships or at the core of some people it is dangerous to love at the same time that it is impossible not to love them. Very sad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Water Drops on Burning Rocks which I saw in French subtitled in English was not an excellent film. The premise namely that of a curious young adult boy being taken home by an older businessman eventually leading to them living together as lovers and fighting heartbreak is an excellent concept for a film. Exploring situations contrary to gender stereotypes and seeing significant emotions portrayed by characters one would normally expect not to play them makes not only for good cinema but definitely keeps your interest.There are several old and overused clichs in this picture which are given a new light when set in the nonstandard context this film is. The great pity is that the exceptional context is all that is used to make the clichs remain entertaining.When a stereotype is broken in reality no bounds need be imposed on how exactly the breaking of the stereotype occurs. In a fictional work however one must take care to make the breaking of the stereotype believable. The fourth scene of four in this movie leaves the realm of possibility and becomes strictly surreal.Surreality in movies can be portrayed to great effect as reality but this movie takes the opposite road and attempts to portray actual reality as surreal. It sadly fails and the fourth act instead of being thoughtful and provocative manages to leave the viewer wondering what the hell was that for? In the final scene of Vera one of only four characters in the movie attempting and failing to open a window in Leopold's apartment where the entire movie is set makes it blatantly obvious to the viewer that the scene was created to symbolize the whole movie. Don't get me wrong  the scene does symbolize the whole movie but only because you know the director was attempting to do so with the scene. Just before the credits roll at what should be the apex of emotion or closure the viewer is left disappointed and with the full belief that yes this was only a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the Fassbinder play Water Drops on Burning Rocks is an acutely observed exploration of relationships successfully mixing burlesque absurdity with grim truths to create an enjoyable and insightful film.The film's characters revolve around the life and whims of Leopald Bernard Giraudeau an ageing swinger whose laissezfaire suavity seduces the callow Franz Malik Zidi. By the beginning of Act II the latter's boyish confidence has been replaced with the willingness to selflessly submit himself to the whims of his irritable older lover. With the arrival of Anna Ludivine Sagnier Franz's subservient fiance and Vera Anna Levine Leopald's former partner the latter's apartment becomes the home to both farce and tragedy as desires attachments and caprices play themselves out in a confinement from which there is no escape. Ozon's consummate direction and the 1970's setting give the film and ostensible gloss which makes its underlying darkness even more striking. This is no less aided by the effortless confidence exuded by Giraudeau and the desperate neediness that is excellently portrayed by his three lovers. What makes Water Drops on Burning Rocks a memorable work is the power of its insights and the originality of their portrayal it is a film whose exterior is humorous and playful but whose interior contains a bleak vision in which relationships mean little more than a repetitive vacuum of need where libidos and routine hold more weight than deep affection or care.A finely crafted examination of the traits that can be most destructive and tawdry in relationships Water Drops on Burning Rocks is saved from being dogmatic or overwhelming by the subtlety and wit employed by Ozon and his cast. It is an example of understated filmmaking that conveys real insight on a subject that has been much maligned in other films such as the appalling Romance. Highly recommended to those who wish to a covertly intelligent beguiling work.".

Highly recommended to those who wish to a covertly intelligent beguiling work.";

What we have here is a director desperately trying to impress us using surrealism over a really weak script. Moreover the man's mistress' character seems rather misplaced or not fully portrayed while the rest of the characters' motives are not always explained. Ok that's what surrealism is about it doesn't have to make sense. Yet I believe surrealism does not suit this kind of plot. I believe it would have been better if more time had been taken to analyze each character's personality more thoroughly.The actors were quite convincing which cannot be equally said about the actresses in this movie.

By the end of the play Women are introduced. Sexual identity takes a backseat to the object of their collective longings and passions. Not a single frame of the film leaves the confines of this trendy 70s bachelor pad and the costumes are a real trip.

As some have mentioned this bears some similarity to 8 WOMEN but this actually works better due to a more complex script. Ludivine Sagnier of the boyish face and the hottiegirl body played the tomboy in that.Every element here works on a level of being both interesting and stomachturning. This is one of the very few works I have ever seen that captures the reality of the free love 70s that it really only worked for those who were heartless users willing to play games with other people's lives for their own fleeting desire. Ludivine Sagnier is not at her acting peak here and part of what is stomach turning is that she is so beautiful but possibly underage when she shot this film... she was 20 when it was released it completes the outside looking in voyeurism of the film. The patently absurd casting of the mysterious lady with a very female if enhanced beauty Anna Levine completes the kind of fantasy world where people enmeshed in a menage a quatre could stop to take a break to dance. Exceptionally fine performances by Levine and the young male lead take this frothy sexcapade into much deeper territory that is the truth of that generation. For oceanic depth see Ozon's SWIMMING POOL which is a brilliant discussion of the creation of art. Vintage Ozon.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is based on a play that Rainer Werner Fassbinder wrote when he was just 19 and his bleak outlook is very evident. This four character story starts out with a 50 year old German named Leopold Bernard Giraudeau who has brought home a 20 year old boy named Franz Malik Zidi and he seduces him and it doesn't take long for Franz to move in and cook his meals draw his bath clean house and do whatever else he wants. They bicker and argue but Franz doesn't leave. One day Franz has his exgirlfriend Anna Ludivine Sagnier over to talk and they have sex for two days and they decide that he'll leave and they'll get married but he still admits he loves Leopold. Leopold arrives home early and they talk and it doesn't take long for Leopold to seduce Anna and then the door knocks and its Vera Anna Thomson who is Leopolds exlover and use to be a man! This film is directed by Francois Ozon and his films seem to deal with characters trying to maintain a relationship no matter what the circumstances. The character of Leopold can be described as Svengali or a spider or a pimp. And the apartment that Leopold lives in is a very important element to this story. All the characters that have entered don't leave or at least they don't leave for good. I think Franz realized this and thats why he committed the ultimate act. The last shot in the film tells the viewer that the characters are trapped in Leopolds web as Vera is unable to open the window. Ozon has developed into a very interesting filmmaker and this is a pretty thought provoking story. Its definitely not just a gay film. This is a provocative drama that is far more complicated than that!".

Several Christmas apparitions visit Eden to set her right.I chose this to be the first Christmas film I watched for the holidays. That was right of me. Young children could possibly find joy and entertainment in this Barbie film. Parents don't have to worry about 'scary things' either. The film has been padded with muchadded humor that only children will enjoy. Still to be fair it was nice to watch this film. Barbie movies are filled with innocence that I do enjoy! But I didn't like their retelling of Dickens' novel. Fans of Dickens' should steer clear from this one.Viewed on December 2223 2011".

Wrong..spoiler alert The story about the selfish singer Eden Starling has a nice twist. The girl is raised by her aunt who taught her everything by one line In a selfish world the selfish succeed. Kinda horrible..right? So well Eden is really rude and mean against her employees and her best friend..Then on one night the ghost of her aunt appears to tell her she has to change her behavior of course Eden doesn't listen so her Aunt tells her she will send 3 ghosts...Well you think here we go first she sees how she was when she was little then she sees the current state of her friends and then how she will end up alone loved by noone... Almost right...the story gets a nice little twist where not only Eden has a worse future but her best friend as well..I liked that twist it made the movie more interesting this way. The animation is fine just what we are used to when we watch a Barbie movie though of course the animations get better every movie..compare Eden to Clara of Barbie's first movie The Nutcracker and you'll see the improvements.I say not at all a really worse Christmas movie there are much worser edits of Charles's story ".

Wrong..spoiler alert The story about the selfish singer Eden Starling has a nice twist. The girl is raised by her aunt who taught her everything by one line In a selfish world the selfish succeed. Kinda horrible..right? So well Eden is really rude and mean against her employees and her best friend..Then on one night the ghost of her aunt appears to tell her she has to change her behavior of course Eden doesn't listen so her Aunt tells her she will send 3 ghosts...Well you think here we go first she sees how she was when she was little then she sees the current state of her friends and then how she will end up alone loved by noone...

	schema:reviewBody "I know I'm going out on a limb in saying I like this movie as wherever I go there is always someone who looks down on the Barbie movies with scorn. Although I am not the main target audienceI'm 20 and although none are among the best movies in the world I do get some pleasure out of them especially Nutcracker especially for the music and the characters. Barbie in A Christmas Carol is not one of my favourites in the franchise but I did like that it had its heart in the right place and it is a nice movie to me. The dialogue is on the corny side I did find the Ghost of Christmas Past annoying and the animation is not as good as that of Nutcracker Swan Lake and Diamond Castle having moments that are either too flat in colour or oversaturated even then there are some nice moments still. What tempted me in the first place in seeing this movie was not just that it was Barbie but also what they would do with such a great story that has been told so many times and of course the colourful cover. Surprisingly the story is told very nicely parts are toned down a little to make potentially scary parts like The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come but considering the target audience this was appropriate and the storytelling overall maintained the story's heart and sentiment with a heartwarming ending and not too much of an overlysentimental air. Again not one of the best adaptations of the story but a long way from the worst. The music is sprightly and really puts you in a mood for the festive season and the characters are great on the whole although I liked the change of pace for Barbie from brave strongminded and resourceful to the less idealistic values of selfish to sympathetic my favourite character was Chuzzlewit who is so funny in his clumsiness and adorable. The voice acting is good Kelly Sheridan is such a talented voice actress to me from Nutcracker she showed great promise and is getting better and better every time I hear her. Overall quite good in my opinion. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this at the library. I'm a huge fan of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol books. It has been adapted into movies musicals and dramas mostly. But this childish Barbie film wants to be turned into a childish crap of comedy. The humor is rubbish the drama is weak the action is like there's no plot in the story. I know this is supposed to be a Grated film and a special video to entertain children instead of scaring them but there are some children's Christmas Carol movie adaptations that has Scrooge falling into his grave and stuff. This one doesn't.It's about Barbie who tells a story to her younger Sister Kelly so the movie is literally a storybook kinda movie. Eden is a famous celebrity singer and all of a sudden she turns Scroogelike and tells her friends not to rehearse on Christmas day and says Bah Humbug. Then she tells Annie or whatever her freaking name is not to say Christmas at all. Now I don't remember Scrooge telling people not to say Christmas but she is a Scrooge I know.One day she is visited by Marley that night. Marley is trying to act as the Ghost of Christmas Past and then the other ghost takes her on the adventure through swirly holes and everything. Nice idea but that sounds like more fun if this was in the theater instead of a directtovideo thing.I'm telling you please avoid this Barbie film. It's a shameful film of the classic Charles Dickens books.".

A talentless soul who's only made subpar crap reaching rock bottom in crappiness by making Cash. And flopmaster Anubhav jumped up with joy and couldn't believe his luck that he was getting a 150 crore budget and India's biggest superstar after the disaster like Cash. It's just an example that God doesn't condemn anyone.The movie or the pathetic example of a grotesque cinematic experience 1. G.One. The video game character actually smiles sings and dances. Stupidity.2. Ra.One. The villain doesn't want to dominate the world. He just wants to kill a silly annoying kid. Did the makers stop to think that the audience would actually support the villain on this one?3. No explanation for anything. If it's SRK kuch bhi chalta hain.4. Action scenes look they are directed by someone else. Not a good sign for Mr.Sinha. If only the rest of the movie had been directed by competent people.5. Bad background score. For e.g.  the intro of G.One. We don't even realize the hero has arrived. Basic superhero movie 101. I guess it's too much to expect from morons.The list could go on and on but I'm just too tired and don't want to relive the experience.But the biggest people to blame are the stupid Indian audience. They'll turn up in droves like marionettes to watch something as bad as this if there's a star. But let quality movies go a begging.Wonder why don't theaters just play slideshows of still pictures of movie stars in theaters. That should be enough.I've nothing against movie stars but only against talentless people being given the reigns to make movies and the result being presented as something worthwhile.Shame on you Mr.Khan. I really like you and your movies but this one was below the belt. I mean you cheated your fans. Your real fans that is.".

Did the makers stop to think that the audience would actually support the villain on this one?3. No explanation for anything. If it's SRK kuch bhi chalta hain.4. Action scenes look they are directed by someone else. Not a good sign for Mr.Sinha. If only the rest of the movie had been directed by competent people.5. Bad background score. For e.g.  the intro of G.One. We don't even realize the hero has arrived. Basic superhero movie 101. I guess it's too much to expect from morons.The list could go on and on but I'm just too tired and don't want to relive the experience.But the biggest people to blame are the stupid Indian audience. They'll turn up in droves like marionettes to watch something as bad as this if there's a star. But let quality movies go a begging.Wonder why don't theaters just play slideshows of still pictures of movie stars in theaters. That should be enough.I've nothing against movie stars but only against talentless people being given the reigns to make movies and the result being presented as something worthwhile.Shame on you Mr.Khan. I really like you and your movies but this one was below the belt. I mean you cheated your fans. Your real fans that is.";

The beauty of the graphics and the density of the screenplay can be compared to the best of the Hollywood movies but Ra.One lacks character.The story begins on a bad note and quickly drops from there to nothingness. SRK is Shekar a video game designer from Chennai at London a stereotype South Indian who speaks bad Tamil and looks hardly the part. Bad acting has ripped this movie in tatters. The first half is a test SRK has prepared for your nerves with such mind numbing comedy. The lines were obvious and scripted lacked any surprise or energy.Kareena manages to look gorgeous but hardly looks like the mother of Armaan Verma who by the way has done a great job.The 'wow' factor of the movie is Arjun Rampal who manages to pull you with his suave and angelic Powers. 'Chamak Challo' that my friends is the high light of the entire movie! And everything else is mental rape of common sense for you. SRK is a fantastic producer lavishing on the sets and props but made a disaster of a movie. The King is severely stressed and appears like a half baked cake throughout the movie.My dear SRK you cannot be Rajnikanth not only because you are not Rajnikant but also because you are King Khan! This movie can be a great marketing case study on how excessive marketing of a damp product can actually set the box office on fire Arindam Chaudari hope you are listening! SRK's media prowess is obvious with people calling this the movie of a lifetime. YUCK!! In short Ra.One is a boring science lecture on Artificial Intelligence and also the 150 crore ego boost of a bad actor. If you decide to watch this movie please leave your brains in the fridge!".

If you are a SRK fanatic read no further.Before intermission Kareena utters the best dialogue in the entire movie 'Kya RA.One Kya G.One! Mujhe kuch samajh nahi aa raha!!'. Well she spoke for everyone in the cinema hall! After all the crazy marketing  hype by SRK the movie turned out to be DUD! The movie has a weak story screenplay and was supported by even a weaker performance by most of the cast. 'Twas like watching a daily serial on TV. One can guess what will happen at the end which is like 10000 episodes from now but still one would watch it everyday just for the heck of it! Well that is how I felt watching Ra.One. Visual EFX Amazing!! Though you see heavy influences from Video games like Mortal Kombat and movies like Matrix and Terminator I still see it as the biggest strength of the movie. 3D was alright. Looks like it was hurriedly done. Stunts RA.One and G.one are like Iron Man Spider Man and Robots from Real Steal movie all combined into one. Some stunts were good but most weren't. Almost every single action sequence has been lifted from Mortal Kombat. But I was disappointed with the climax fight. A BIG LET DOWN!South India Killed Ayyo is all you get to hear from SRK during the first half of the movie. SRK struggles with his Tamil big time and he is a tamilian in the movie?!?! Whoa! Mixing curd with noodles and taking long coffee breaks is his depiction of a South Indian guy? Great! Chammak Challo  great song but the situation of the song is so wrong. I never knew South Indian women dress the way Kareena  the background dancers have dressed in the song! Well may be in a South Indian adult movie YES PRajiniKanth  Plays a minuscule role and I don't now why he decided to do it. Horrible wig and make up. I couldn't believe if it was Rajinikant for real. Again the storyline around him is SO WEAK. I seriously don't understand how this movie is a tribute to him. Another marketing gimmick by SRK I guess.Overall RA.One didn't quite work for me... it wasn't boring but at the same time there was nothing interesting to keep me glued to my seat either no nailbiting moments power packed action sequences.. instead we got a heavy dose of Karan Johar's sentiments emotions KKHH Karwa Chauth etc! I am sure the movie will be fun to watch for kids and SRK would make his money at the box office but I don't wanna torture Any.One by recommending them to watch RA.One".

So anyway we went and got ourselves some jubilee class tickets and started watching this unbelievably crappy movie. The first half started and as it progressed it became literally the most boringstupid and just plain lame thing I have ever seen in my life in a movie. SRK plays head of technical department of a gaming company that desperate to come up with a good game release he has a son who has a really BAD hairdo and likes playing games but hates superheroes and loves villains. SRK is seen struggling with getting attention of his kid who tells SRK that he likes villains and that his father should make a game in which the villain will never lose. Amazingly I think this is the part where the movie just goes insanely dumb and lame he creates such a game in ONE DAY and guess what the game characters then come to life out of thin air without any SOUND explanationsyeah!!I knowWDF!!!After that every damn stupid thing that happens is predictable and anyways the story is so lame that I don't even want to talk about it cause just thinking about the stupid story pisses me off! Seriously at one point I was so angry frustrated and irritated I just wanted to rip off my buddy's head who's idea it was to watch this beep beepbeep movie. I felt as if I was being punished by the so called 'King khan' for some mistake I didn't do. If you know some people you seriously hate I would suggest you gift them tickets to 'RA.1'! You'll hear some people say that the effects are good and that oh no Bollywood movie has done such effects. Well let me inform everyone who shares this same view that nobody is saying that the effects were bad but what about everything else Raone has a really predictable and weak storyline and the dialogues and acting is just dump. I dare any normal person to see 34 shows of the movie nonstop and LIVE to tell the tale...yeah!! its THAT BAD! Seriously If you are a die hard fan of SRK and don't really give ANY importance to story OR dialogues OR acting OR editing OR screenplay go see it today! But in case if you are a NORMAL sane Human Being like me then Do NOT waste your money I did the mistake and I want everyone to make a better choice of NOT going to this movie.

A movie that lacks character script storyline and finesse is expected to impress the audience with just one element  A over hyped budget invested into visual effects. Oh by the way did I also mention it has also copied various themes from Sucker Punch Iron Man Terminator and Spiderman? The movie is such a awful mess it is not worth even a watch even if you life depended on it! I mean where in the world do you get the director making fun of a character you are expected to take seriously. And where the main theme was to keep it dedicated to a family audience you have so many embarrassing moments which try their best to fall into the category of humor but seriously fall short into making people uneasy in their seats. All in all superstar SRK post promotional attempts have been to keep a smiling face employ the services of marketing companies and pay movie critics to praise and compensate for undoubtedly what qualifies as the most shameful and sad attempt by the Indian Cinematic Movement to try to qualify itself as a formidable force in entertainment. I would say better than watching this movie is go home and wash the dishes.".

A movie that lacks character script storyline and finesse is expected to impress the audience with just one element  A over hyped budget invested into visual effects. Oh by the way did I also mention it has also copied various themes from Sucker Punch Iron Man Terminator and Spiderman? The movie is such a awful mess it is not worth even a watch even if you life depended on it! I mean where in the world do you get the director making fun of a character you are expected to take seriously. And where the main theme was to keep it dedicated to a family audience you have so many embarrassing moments which try their best to fall into the category of humor but seriously fall short into making people uneasy in their seats. All in all superstar SRK post promotional attempts have been to keep a smiling face employ the services of marketing companies and pay movie critics to praise and compensate for undoubtedly what qualifies as the most shameful and sad attempt by the Indian Cinematic Movement to try to qualify itself as a formidable force in entertainment. I would say better than watching this movie is go home and wash the dishes.";

Is this a movie we are taking to raise our bars in International Markets. Then its definitely the biggest joke I have ever heard.Liking an actor and Liking a film are two different things. Wish Shahrukh Khan had realized this and made a movie ahead of his caliber but unfortunately it comes nowhere to the work he has done before.Seriously I couldn't understand the reviews giving 4.5 stars to this DUST. Facepalm. What makes a good superhero movie? Good VFX and a great story. Sure this one has some limited but good special effects but what about the story man? Where was it? Also a story is required that could bring out all the emotions together. This film evokes only one expression  laughter poke and fun. A woman's husband gets killed but after one day she is seeing happily with a robot and her son and fighting the goons.A superhero gaming character has to save a fast racing train to death. yet he saves it in the comical way ever seen. The background score of RD Burman's mixture of songs can be heard during his mission of saving lives and it gives us a proper picture that this film is just made to make fun of itself.IF U JUST WANT TO ENTERTAIN...then why do you put so heavy amount of money on special effects just for this? If its all about entertainment then shahrukh could do this without going the superhero way i am sure that movie would have made much bucks than this waste.Sometimes when a movie is released we often say don't believe the negativity just go and watch the movie this time its just the opposite..if you want to go for a good movie than Ra.one is definitely not that one. The first half of the film is somewhat tolerable But believe me after the interval You will beg God to finish it as soon as possible.

	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer OK I have to admit I am not a big fan of Shah Rukh Khan no wait take 'big' out..OK take fan out as well...I used to like him during FaujiCircus days and then for the first couple of movies till he joined the Yash clan and went that lover boy route. There were moments of brilliance from him in the form of Swades Paheli and Chak de but that required a very strict director at the helm to keep the Khan in control. Which brings me to RApe.One which truly is a rape of all senses!!Let me start off with the good points a. There IS a story  structured thorough storyline. b. Technically it is good not brilliant but good. c. Arjun Rampal as the Ra.One does add some style to the movie he does what he can with the script given with mostly an angry constipated look.Now for the bad points a. Shah Rukh Khan  he can just about pull off the lover boy roles you know the ones where he runs out from a castle which is his house in UK lands on his knees pushes out his chest and arms in the air..and then does that look with his eyes like he is trying to hypnotize a pigeon to land on his head. Why would anyone let him play a Tamilian character? The accent is atrocious but what I find the most obscene and offending part is in a scene where he is eating noodles with yoghurt using his fingers  really? Is the kind of cinema we can expect from Bollywood in 2011 and that too from someone who is supposedly the King of Bollywood?b. Anubhav Sinha  a bad choice for a director who to be fair has not had the best run at the box office so far. This movie required a director who would keep the Khan in check and totally under control and now allow him to exercise any of the pathetic expressions or overacting that is allowed in his other movies. Furthermore this movie required tight editing remove all the fluff and scenes like G.one wanting to know what karva chauth is and there is a movie in there somewhere but in the process the viewer is left feeling no connection with any of the characters style takes over substance and the story is G.ONE.c. Background score  Most of the time I felt the background music was from the 70s loud and screechy. Every time G.One appears on the screen there is a loud shouting noise sounding something like 'eeerraaaaa' this gets repeated so many times that towards the end of the movie you are secretly hoping for G.one to look towards the camera and shoot a fireball at the crew.d. Story  I did there is a story in there somewhere. Unfortunately it is surrounded by so much of that Bollywood fluff that the whole movie turns into a very expensive joke. Sample some of these 1. Shah Rukh Khan is shown to be a Hindu Tamilian but when he dies he get a Christian burial with everyone dressed in black..CLASS!! 2. In the beginning of the movie the scene is set in London for a conference on 'somenonsense' to a mixed group of individuals from different parts of the world...in Hindi!! 3. The whole movie sits on the foundation of a video game that is designed by Khan to take action to the next level  this video game which has been funded by a huge conglomerate has only two characters and three levels..whatay beauty!! 4. Ra.One can take any bodily form yet when he is broken upto into pieces and needs a body he decides to take arjun rampal's shape from a poster of a perfume but not an actual guy who came to put up that poster.. You get the idea watching this movie is like watching a brainless David Dhawan comedy don't even try to make sense of ite. CGI  the CGI is not great but good. But because they had the budget they tried to do everything in one movie. The speeding train  SPEED Shah Rukh Khan landing on the ground holding Kareena  Batman the train crashing out of Mumbai central  any US disaster movie the blue HART thingy in the chest  hello major Iron Man ripoff the whole train sequence  inspired from Robot and the list goes on and on..It truly is a shame that a movie that has taken so long to make with a budget of 175 crores really fails to stay with you once you leave the theatres. This could have been the right opportunity to present what Bollywood is really capable of when it really puts it mind effort and talent behind it..if anything this movie is a lesson for future filmmakers in how NOT to spend your money and if you are going to make a serious movie do it by avoiding stereotyping which is so 80s regional or sexual differences by taking a serious actor who can become the character completely aka Aamir and with a director who has the balls to stand by his vision and not be led by a narcissistic actor.Word for advice for Shah Rukh your days are numbered stick to dancing at weddings  no one will judge you for that you still make a buck and spare us the torture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ra.one is called the most 'ambitious' Indian superhero movie with a budget exceeding Rs.100 crores most of it from SRK's own bank accounts.It is supposed to have harnessed advanced technology to give more punch to the action sequences. Hence we have video game characters bursting to pieces that look like jellyblocks and then joining back miraculously.But what about the emotions and the real world scenes in the movie where everyone seems to be 'acting'? Instead of the motto Don't be caught acting the saying Yes come watch us ACT is followed by almost everyone. In simple terms Ra.one is a pain in the bum.SRK's south Indian character is a leading video game developer whose virtualreality games are world renowned. He tries to impress his 'cool' son but is never able to gel along and therefore creates a game where the bad guy is extremely powerful and the good guy has 0.01 chances of winning. This brings him close to his son what a materialistic kid but problems arise when the videogame villain comes to life.I am a big fan of video games and am currently playing Uncharted 3. The most impressive aspect of the game is the cinematic approach to the game. Gaming industry has revolutionized. Unfortunately Ra.one's videogame seems like one of the defunct late 80s games that lie dusty in some old cupboard.The critical mistake committed here is lack of research which is a common one among many Indian filmmakers. The opening scene has Shahana Goswami's character jabbering so seriously about the advancement in virtualreality to a bunch of wayward foreigners in 'shuddha' Hindi. Why so serious by the way? Then pops up an ugly image of Dalip Tahil with long blackwhite hair and a leonine face and Shahana tells that it's a virtual image that can be touched. Here the 'intelligentsia' foreigners have to look astonished and hence the open mouths. I hate this 'group' acting where everyone has the same f reaction to some situation. A more realistic shot would be to have some people looking impressed some making notes etc. Here instead the foreigners try to 'touch' the virtual image like a bunch of impressionable kids.The next shot has SRK mumbling nonsense while on a roaring bike on some alien planet trying to save Priyanka Chopra's character promotion for 'Don 2' I suppose? from the hands of Sanjay Dutt's evil character 'Agneepath's promotion I think and his three henchwomen'Iski Li' 'Uski Li' and 'Sabki Li'. I admire the level of humor in the film. Please note the sarcasm. It all turns out to be a silly dream of Amaan Khan's character who plays SRK's 'cool' son another one in the list of snotty teenagers who too seems to have the perspicacity in the field of computers which leads to one of the most tiresome scenes in film history a teacher's pole dancing video is seen by the whole class. Now the scene could have been funny if the teacher had actually danced properly but she seems to have danced keeping in mind that the video was meant for kids. So there's an unnatural feeling when she taps her bum completely the wrong way. Anubhav Sinha the directorwatch stripper videos and then hire the right actors.SRK's south Indian character is probably the worst characterization ever no genuine acting just a clichd performance for the cameras. Kareena brings her Jab We Met act and makes an unappetizing broth out of it with her double meaning dialogues. The noodle with dahi scene is just gross and dumb so is the Michael Jackson dance sequence. And to believe this guy is a leading videogame developer that too internationally renowned is implausible.When the game is made the intimidating baddie seems menacing but only when he is in the game. The moment he leaps out he is the poor beta version of Green Goblin. Then comes the tears with the apt music behind to tug the heartstrings of the gullible ones who are more influenced by external factors than the actual progression of the story. I didn't cry I laughed I could clearly make out the ploy used by the filmmakers use music to bring out emotions when the characters don't incite any.Then comes G.one who is the avenger and let me note the painstaking attempts by Shah Rukh to look young. It a pity most of the leading men here try to look like college guys to play young characters when they very well can take some advantage of their age and do some better deeper and layered roles. But NO here everyone has to look young and pretty and act young and pretty forget maturity.The train sequence is even more intolerable with Delnaz Paul I hope the name is correct who adds to the saccharinity of the movie. Then the Silver Streak inspired end to the train sequence is absolutely bananas! The action sequences have too many closeup shots and I found the tempo of the fights to be quite slow and turgid. Rather than utilizing the technology resourcefully it is exploited to impress. I remember the GREAT Spiderman 2 train sequence where the passengers agree to keep Peter Parker's identity a secret after he saves them. Here I wanted the passengers to perish along with G.one and that Kereena thing.The homage to Robot and the street fights are overexcessive to the point where I lost any interest in the film and began paying undue attention to the lighting system in the theater and all those curtains and projectors and sound systems. Unendurable was the scene where Kareena gets possessed and does the Chammak Chalo dance. Pauline Kael had said regarding Sound of Music It's a sugar coated lie people seem to want to eat. I say this for Ra.one its candyfloss overcooked rubbish that'll smash box office records.My Rating 210".

	onyx:emotionText "Ra.one is called the most 'ambitious' Indian superhero movie with a budget exceeding Rs.100 crores most of it from SRK's own bank accounts.It is supposed to have harnessed advanced technology to give more punch to the action sequences. Hence we have video game characters bursting to pieces that look like jellyblocks and then joining back miraculously.But what about the emotions and the real world scenes in the movie where everyone seems to be 'acting'? Instead of the motto Don't be caught acting the saying Yes come watch us ACT is followed by almost everyone. In simple terms Ra.one is a pain in the bum.SRK's south Indian character is a leading video game developer whose virtualreality games are world renowned. He tries to impress his 'cool' son but is never able to gel along and therefore creates a game where the bad guy is extremely powerful and the good guy has 0.01 chances of winning. This brings him close to his son what a materialistic kid but problems arise when the videogame villain comes to life.I am a big fan of video games and am currently playing Uncharted 3. The most impressive aspect of the game is the cinematic approach to the game. Gaming industry has revolutionized. Unfortunately Ra.one's videogame seems like one of the defunct late 80s games that lie dusty in some old cupboard.The critical mistake committed here is lack of research which is a common one among many Indian filmmakers. The opening scene has Shahana Goswami's character jabbering so seriously about the advancement in virtualreality to a bunch of wayward foreigners in 'shuddha' Hindi. Why so serious by the way? Then pops up an ugly image of Dalip Tahil with long blackwhite hair and a leonine face and Shahana tells that it's a virtual image that can be touched. Here the 'intelligentsia' foreigners have to look astonished and hence the open mouths. I hate this 'group' acting where everyone has the same f reaction to some situation. A more realistic shot would be to have some people looking impressed some making notes etc. Here instead the foreigners try to 'touch' the virtual image like a bunch of impressionable kids.The next shot has SRK mumbling nonsense while on a roaring bike on some alien planet trying to save Priyanka Chopra's character promotion for 'Don 2' I suppose? from the hands of Sanjay Dutt's evil character 'Agneepath's promotion I think and his three henchwomen'Iski Li' 'Uski Li' and 'Sabki Li'. I admire the level of humor in the film. Please note the sarcasm. It all turns out to be a silly dream of Amaan Khan's character who plays SRK's 'cool' son another one in the list of snotty teenagers who too seems to have the perspicacity in the field of computers which leads to one of the most tiresome scenes in film history a teacher's pole dancing video is seen by the whole class. Now the scene could have been funny if the teacher had actually danced properly but she seems to have danced keeping in mind that the video was meant for kids. So there's an unnatural feeling when she taps her bum completely the wrong way. Anubhav Sinha the directorwatch stripper videos and then hire the right actors.SRK's south Indian character is probably the worst characterization ever no genuine acting just a clichd performance for the cameras. Kareena brings her Jab We Met act and makes an unappetizing broth out of it with her double meaning dialogues. The noodle with dahi scene is just gross and dumb so is the Michael Jackson dance sequence. And to believe this guy is a leading videogame developer that too internationally renowned is implausible.When the game is made the intimidating baddie seems menacing but only when he is in the game. The moment he leaps out he is the poor beta version of Green Goblin. Then comes the tears with the apt music behind to tug the heartstrings of the gullible ones who are more influenced by external factors than the actual progression of the story. I didn't cry I laughed I could clearly make out the ploy used by the filmmakers use music to bring out emotions when the characters don't incite any.Then comes G.one who is the avenger and let me note the painstaking attempts by Shah Rukh to look young. It a pity most of the leading men here try to look like college guys to play young characters when they very well can take some advantage of their age and do some better deeper and layered roles. But NO here everyone has to look young and pretty and act young and pretty forget maturity.The train sequence is even more intolerable with Delnaz Paul I hope the name is correct who adds to the saccharinity of the movie. Then the Silver Streak inspired end to the train sequence is absolutely bananas! The action sequences have too many closeup shots and I found the tempo of the fights to be quite slow and turgid. Rather than utilizing the technology resourcefully it is exploited to impress. I remember the GREAT Spiderman 2 train sequence where the passengers agree to keep Peter Parker's identity a secret after he saves them. Here I wanted the passengers to perish along with G.one and that Kereena thing.The homage to Robot and the street fights are overexcessive to the point where I lost any interest in the film and began paying undue attention to the lighting system in the theater and all those curtains and projectors and sound systems. Unendurable was the scene where Kareena gets possessed and does the Chammak Chalo dance. Pauline Kael had said regarding Sound of Music It's a sugar coated lie people seem to want to eat. I say this for Ra.one its candyfloss overcooked rubbish that'll smash box office records.My Rating 210";

Well if you see Ra.One you will remember those tacky effects once again. Yup there are occasional VFXes on par with Hollywood movies. But that's all about it in this SRK crapfest.Which brings us to the star himself. Yes he is no Soman and age clearly shows on his face. In fact he has never looked so old before. Add to that the overacting that he has become a master of. You will get a neat idea about what Ra.one is.The rest of the cast were just about okay. Rampal is the best. Kareena looks lost though amazingly beautiful in a hot way. The child artist is okay too. Music is pathetic with only Chammak Challo standing out. Overall a horrible film that you should give a miss. I personally feel this is a trailer of what Don2 is going to be. One shudders to think of the promotion juggernaut that we have to suffer again from SRK Seriously Retarded Khan.

G One is robotcomputer program machine. There are issues related to him not understanding human emotions and then at times he gets too touchy which makes no sense. Kareena Kapoor on the other hand is not human. Sometimes upset that her husband is dead and the very next second she is dancing to Chammak Challo. There are some attempted comedy element tried to put in between the movie from time to time which are poor. The scene when Shahruk and his son get mugged by dwarf guy is embarrassing. That time the movie hall was in pin drop silence. As confused as the script writer. 2Cheap humorThe only audience that might find this movie decent would be age 510 years. Sadly this movie has messed up for even them.The culprit the not needed cheap adult humor. A scene where Gone tries to grab kareena's boobs which for some reason comes in between and action scene. Then there is a scene when G one is holding the Ra one's crotch for a painfully long time. One wonders what Shahruk was thinking during the filming. Another one in which G one holding a packet of condoms and telling Kareena that they would improve her mood. Really????? Does he really expect us to laugh at this. 3 Misdirected Special effects  The special effects are of high quality. But with weak plots and too many effects on a single event. The whole thing gets diluted and excruciating to watch. The train chase is all about Shahrukh twisting and turning. The special effects are shown from every possible angle and with the amount of time spent one wonders how long is the train which G one is scaling. There is a fight sequence when some ruffians come at the standard bollywood  one at a time sequence and keep getting bashed up by a football. After 5 minutes it gets on your nerves and Rajni's entry after 15min of that torture adds to the pain. I guess only die hard Rajni fans could tolerate it. 4Horrible acting. Shahruk should hang up his boots after this.He looked amateur in front of the kid actor. Kareena cannot act. And please don't make her a mom.She only looks comfortable as a bimbo. The attempted pseudo west lingo of Dude and kick ass is stupid. They are extinct in the west and too old even for India. And last but not the least among the several low points in this movie there is also a racist comment by Ra One I hate Chinese.".

But the movie comes out to be an even bigger piece of trash. What to say Full of overacting both by SK n Karina trying to create humor by cheap lineswhich makes it unsuitable even for kids spineless story and plot. Worst part being SK not able to understand the character of GOne and giving emotional expressions dancing on chammak Chlo. Most of the scenes were copied from various flicks even the first dialogs of Karina gaaliyan were already filmed in golmaal 3 a scene was copied from SK'd own movie 'baadshah' tum mujhe yaha touch nahi kar sakte. SRK still believes in gay comedy scene which seems a pity. Other bloopers are when accident occurs in the barron industry only two people out of which one is a kid are there to investigate. How Gone is brought out of the game none of the viewers will ever know. The movie disappoints you so much that till chammak Chlo arrives you are not in mood to enjoy it. Final verdict Do not watch it even if you 'don't' have brains.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I will start by saying that this is not a sensible movie for sensible audience. In fact there is no particular audience that this movie caters to. If this is a 'super hero' movie it should ideally be for children but then content and language is far from a children's movie! Kareena's first scene itself talks about moving from abuses that are towards mothers and sisters to fathers and brothers and many many such shady words.Another irritating aspect is the innumerable kick to the crotch scenes which are overused and not funny at all.There is talk of this movie taking the 'special effects' in Bollywood to a different level. That is hardly the case. There are only a few actions scenes where the special effects are good. I would say Krrish was handled way much better although it's not right to compare since the two movies are quite different.Another thing is that this movie is utterly illogical. If you want to watch this put aside all your logic. The game has 3 levels and the only way to die is if they are wearing the 'hart' and that too they get only a single bullet on the last level. If this is the only way to die what does it mean then that they have to survive for a certain amount of time on earlier levels to move forward! The end is the worst. Arjun Ra.one fires the gun first even though Shahrukh G.one is the one who gets it earlier and the bullet hits Shahrukh G.one but he doesn't have the 'hart' on so he doesn't die. Before G.one fires Ra.one turns into 10 Ra.ones instead of just removing the 'hart' so that he won't die. It seems that the script has been written by a child. Also Shahrukh is shown a madrasi who speaks with that accent but soon it disappears. Also when he dies he is buried in a Christian way and still his ashes are dispersed by Kareena and their son!! Figure that one!They also brought in Rajinikant for just a minute or 2 for no reason whatsoever in the movie but just to get southern audience!And if you watch Hollywood movies you will be able to see the innumerable movies from which Ra.One has copied. The only credit to the film makers goes for this that they have really worked hard towards copying from so many sources. One of the main movie is of course Terminator besides Iron man Batman Spiderman even a particular step like one from Jet Li's The Fist of Legend and bit from Mr. Bean and so many others it is not even possible to mention.Finally about acting Shahrukh might be fine in a few scenes but it's almost as if he enjoys being himself too much and forgets that he is a Madrasi with an accent and later even forgets that he is a machine. Kareena is totally redundant except the song.".

I guess this can easily prove the level of SRK'S FANS.REVIEW Cant believe of extremely high IMDb reviews!!!!This movie is really bad  VERY WEAK STORY nothing new if you watched Hollywood Superhero flicks don't watch this you are going to get BORED And this is not the main reason.The main REASON is this movie is just for 6 year old kids.Even the boys who are saying this movie is really good or awesome are fans of Shahrukh who just like watching his movies whether he bring Om Shanti Om too and I bet these Shahrukh fans cant even find a difference between Chak De IndiaAwesome and Rab Ne Banadi Jodidisaster.Talking about acting  we all know how much Shahrukh Khan is talented but he is totally wasted in this movie  you never going to remember this Shahrukh who played g.one in upcoming days . For Kareena oh lord!! there is no difference between her and Katrina Kaif beauties without acting which i never expect from Kareenawho proved herself with the movies like jab we met and Kurbaan . Arjun he did a decent job which i was expecting from him . And i don't want to say anything about that kid who played Srks son he was awful .You will find very talented kids rather then this one whose hairs more heavy then his weight !!! StoryThere is a father SRK whose son loves BAD GUY more then hero in games.So Srk designed game and from there a big evil came outonly Shahrukh knows how. After that typical Bollwyood storyand even worst then that .There are so many errors in the movie that you will stop even counting at one stage believe me don't watch you are seriously going to waste your money and 2 and half hours of your life.Don't believe in critics4 and half stars this is just a publicity stunt. All the critics are highly paid in India after watching RA.one i can bet that. There is no doubt this movie is going to earn lots of money due to highly overrated publicity done by SRK  but then also this movie cant stand in front of Real critical acclaim movies like Rang De Basanti A Wednesday and 3 IDIOTS  can only stand in front of big dumb movies like Om Shanti OM  Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna etc.Worst movie i have ever seen on the name of movie  so forget science fiction in it .110only for Arjun Rampal.VERY VERY WEAK and Hope the international audience wont judge Indian Cinema by this highbudget mediocrity.".

But right from the outset I realized that this movie will not meet even my very low standards! SRK doing a Tamil nerd impression is painful to watch the 'aiyyo' and eating noodles with curds by hand are jokes that only a six year old would find funny. Not only is there no story there isn't even an attempt to have a story. The special effects are a yawn as one reviewer has said nothing you wouldn't have seen in umpteen Hollywood movies actually even on HBO! and the scifi explanations Ra One and G One coming to life are not even explained! are lame. There are utterly ridiculous and pointless fights like outside the airport which go on forever. The song sequences make no sense even for a Hindi movie where usually the trick is to use a dream sequence. There are no other characters in the movie other than a pointless and very unfunny Satish Shah. The finale is boring predictable and pointless. Oh and the kid is annoying typical NRI brat types who of course has the computer skills of 10 top hackers in the world put together utterly unbelievable. Only and I mean only 5 minutes in the film that entertain is the Chammak Challo song.".

	schema:reviewBody "In films like You've Got Mail where you can almost predict how it's going to turn out as soon as the opening credits appear then it is up to the writers director and actors to get us to enjoy the journey to the end credits. Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their characters well and give them a can't miss plot device.  Tom Hanks is believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain as is Meg Ryan as the owner of a small children's bookstore shop.  As the guy who is putting Meg out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop Tom Hanks character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open as many bookstores as he can and make as much money as he can in doing so. When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet we see another side of him and learn that possibly he's not the evil guy you think he is.  Of course in person Meg hates him for what he is doing on the internet she falls in love with him.  This is what makes the film work as their reaction to each other in person is completely different from when they talk on line.  Some people may quibble that the ending is not very believable but face it do you fall in love with a person because of who they are or what you think they are?  I think this question is answered quite adequately.".

	schema:headline " A pleasant little romantic comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "I really liked the original better  1940's The Shop Around the Corner. However for a modern romantic comedy this one hits the spot. It alters the means of communication between the mismatched couple to email from letters. This film has Joe Fox Tom Hanks as the heir to a Borderslike bookstore empire whose family is opening a new store near his pen pal Kathleen Kelly's Meg Ryan small children's' bookstore. It is the same as its predecessor in that the pen pals actually know each other and do not like each other. It alters the basis of the disagreement to be that of Fox's big impersonal business delivering goods at a discount with the price being a largely anonymous and unknowledgeable retail staff versus Kelly's personal service and first editions that carries a large price tag for the paying customers. It turns out that even in Manhattan people prefer to buy discount with the result being the end of Kathleen's store. The movie keeps things interesting with several little side stories and unanswered questions. Did Joe's grandfather ever date Kathleen's mother? Did Kathleen's employee Birdie Jean Stapleton have an affair with Francisco Franco in her youth? Why and how did Birdie decide to buy all of that Intel stock? Then there is the whole issue of Joe's serially monogamous dad Dabney Coleman that plays out quite humorously and the fact that Joe has an aunt that is thirty years younger than he is. Considering Joe's mother had to be a victim of his father's philandering at some point Joe seems to take his dad's personal habits quite casually. A very moving addition to this version of the story is Kathleen's identification of the store with her mother to the point that when the store does finally close she considers it to be much like her mother dying all over again.The only thing that really bothered me was the issue of Joe and Kathleen seeking other relationships while seriously involved with other people to the point of living with them and not letting on that there was anything amiss. This seemed a bit underhanded on both their parts and somewhat undermined their likability at least to me.Now I wrote the paragraphs above several years ago. The technology was relevant to the year it was made 1997. Of course today everybody would be texting one another and Joe's bookstore would probably be just as extinct as Kathleen's since Amazon managed to put not just the independent bookstores out of business but big brick and mortar chains like Border's. Of course that is not the point of the film. The point is love finding two people who on the surface seem completely mismatched in every way and who on top of that are competitors.".

Some will dub the movie predictable and sappy but hey I wasn't looking for deep psychology just a friendly feel good.  If that's what you're after Mail delivers. Hanks and Ryan have the greatest onscreen chemistry I've seen and the last half hour of the film is right on target.

Yet when at the end she learns of his identity she stills agrees to go out with him! Is she a masochist or something?. This pretends to be a romantic comedy but believe me you leave this movie with a very bad taste on your mouth.

	schema:reviewBody "This is my first comment here so I have decided to comment on a film that has received very mixed reviews. A few despise it a few hail it as a classic and the majority either find it decent or below average. Massive SPOILERS BABY WATCH OUT! Anyway I have seen all or the majority of this film about 6 times at least either on HBO or on our copy on video. And it gets better and makes more sense each time I see it.First I am gonna set some facts straight people who havent seen it stop now.  I am going to try an explain many of the things people obviously didnt get. Now some people have serious issues with this film and some people are inserting points in the story that dont exist like one reviewer saying Her life gets ohso much better after he has clobbered her book shop and gives her a job at his big phallic megamart. Now if you actually PAID ATTENTION you would know that after she is closed down she becomes a Childrens book author which is right up her alley. It would be great if she could keep her store and its still very sad that dream is gone but becoming a childrens book author is just as much of dream for her one that she never expected to realize.This is what I mean by paying attention folks. Just about everyone especially us men had a preconceived notion that this film is just innoucous fluff and doesnt require much attention to enjoy. And they have ended up missing half the film and not even getting the facts right. And if you dont pay attention to this film you could end up really not liking it.Joe is not a remorseless businessman at heart ever he feels remorse at when he zings an enemy he explains that early on while emailing Shopgirl and Shopgirl on the other hand desires to aquire some of that zing that Joe has since she is so wholesome that she cant come up with zingers all that quickly. His motto of its not personal its business is his way of reassuring himself and ignoring his concience. The only time he is ever really mean to Kathleen is the scene early on at the little convention. Well before he knew Shopgirl was Kathleen. And after that is when confides to Shopgirl the remorse he feels over those comments and that side of his personality in general mentioned in parentheses above.  A few people were creeped out by Tom Hanks actions and there was no reason to be. One guy even compared it to stalking which is sooooo way off I wont dignify it with a response except that he definatly paid no attnetion.NY152 technically never stood her up and Kathleen figures that out at the end. The writers had two options when they meet in the cafe the first time He could have come clean there or shortly thereafter or they could go the direction they did. I'm sure the writers considered the other option. But it would make things very muddled. Kathleen would have a very difficult choice with the personality NY152 she adores so much belonging the seemingly cold and heartless Joe Fox would very easily be enough for her to give up on NY152 altogether and move on. And what kind of movie would that make? I can understand why Joe withheld that info in the cafe He was coming to terms with all of this himself the persona he adores online being the same person he is putting out of business. His business just became very personal. And she has no idea. From the moment Joe finds out Shopgirl is Kathleen he contemplates giving up on the whole thing. But he goes in and talks to her as Joe Fox. And he finds out how deep her dislike of Joe is she is finally able to put together the mean words she wants to. Of course he is hurt that this woman who is so cold to him is the same woman he anonymously adores.Its the little chat with dad in the boat that convinces Joe to pursue the relationship. In fact its the final line of that chat which does and its very easy to miss. Right in the next scene Joe visits her at her apartment. And This scene is pivotal. When he first shows up she resists his charm and is still rather cold to him. But now she realizes what NY152 was talking about earlier when they talked about saying exactly what you want to say when confronted with an enemy. So she tries to not be so cold to him though she still thinks he is slime. During this scene Joe turns on the charm and starts to reveal that he is not such a bad guy which we already knew and he is remorseful about what has occured. They learn a fews things during this scene. The rest of the film up to the end is basically the two of them becoming friends. When NY152 tells shopgirl he has a project he is tweaking he means he is trying to be friends with Kathleen which even he had said himself was almost impossible but if they connected so well over the internet there is no major reason to not connect as well in real life except for the one hurdle. At the end of the Apartment scene Joe hints quite a bit at the internet relationship without giving it away. Kathleen begins to suspect I think. And this is what warms her up to him is the similaritys between him and NY152. A late line by Joe sums it up where he says NY152 is waiting for Kathleen to be primed so that she is convinced that NY152 is the guy. In fact he is partially talking about himself becoming friends with her so she is more receptive to him. He did NOT manipulate her. He simply tried and succeeded to become friends with her simply as Joe Fox. Well thats enough for now I have practically transcribed scenes to help some of the more ignorant critics. In short I liked this movie at first and I love it now.  I liked Sleepless and I like lighter romantic comedies in general though I dont like the Julia Robert's romantic comedies I dont care for her in general. This one may be my favorite though. A very interesting well paced people who thought it was slow werent paying enough attention and definatly cutesy and sweet but excellant nonetheless and a step above Sleepless in Seattle IMO.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have been reading the last three reviews I did this is the natural concluding review of the sequence. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME and SHE LOVES ME all were based in the central plot about two people at loggerheads in physical life falling in love through anonymity in penpal letters on Miklos Laszlo's PERFUMERIE. They all had their differences in a secondary plot dealing with the jealousy of the owner of the store towards the hero his closest employee resulting in his firing the hero due to a serious mistake by the employer. This was jettisoned and altered in the middle film but resumed in the Kander and Ebb musical of the 1970s made into a television version in 1978. But that version actually gave the actual villain a parting shot in his last song showing he was down but not out and would still find a way of getting an undeserved success.When Nora Ephron did her version of the play in this screenplay the jealousy angle was dumped and the concentration was on the business antagonism between the hero and heroine here Tom Hanks as Joe Fox and Meg Ryan as Kathleen Kelly. Hanks and Ryan do not work at the same store as James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan or Van Johnson and Judy Garland did. Hanks works at a mega book store Fox Books like Barnes and Noble. Ryan runs a small neighborhood book store for children called The Shop Around The Corner Hanks takes her to task for that name saying it can't be claimed as a single corporate name. Fox Books is moving into the neighborhood that Ryans's store is in and she fights it's irresistible push  in vain as it is. In the end not only is she the loser but members of her staff get hired by Fox Books as well.There are other elements here that do not come out in the original version or the 1949 version. The protagonists don't write letters but are sending emails to each other. Times are changing and the discovery of a small notice in the newspaper's classified for a penpal is replaced by Ryan meeting Fox accidentally in surfing the internet and finding a chat room a scene we are told of but never see. In the 1949 film Garland was pursued if you will  somewhat weakly by Johnson's friend and fellow employee Buster Keaton. Johnson was linked by Garland to a female friend who was a violinist. Neither relationship was that strong or threatening to the eventual JohnsonGarland relationship. But for the first half of YOU'VE GOT MAIL Ryan is living with a selfrighteous newspaper columnist Greg Kinnear and Hanks is living with a selfcentered publisher Parker Posey. We barely knew the families of Sullivan and Garland we saw an aunt or two that they lived with. Here we know that Ryan's mother is dead but her grandmother Birdie Jean Stapleton is alive and thriving. In fact we learn Birdie is rich due to a stock investment and that she once dated John Randolph Hanks' grandfather. In fact we even learn that Birdie romanced one of the most interesting political figures of 20th Century Europe. Hanks' family is developed too beyond Stewart's or Johnson's or Ellis's for that matter. Besides grandfather Randolph about to remarry we see Hanks' father Dabney Coleman who keeps running through wives and never finding the right mate. We also meet Hank's aunt and brother.The film worked well again and just as the early pairs of couples Stewart and Sullivan Johnson and Garland had good chemistry so did Hanks and Ryan. This was their third film together people forget they did JOE AND THE VOLCANO first and the second film after SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE with Ephron at the helm. With all the modernization and story changes and character histories and assaults on the concept of megastores check the scene where Hanks hears an inept salesman in the children's book section Epron managed to show the old warhorse by Mr. Laszlo still had plenty of juice in it to go down well with the public. My guess is that like Lubitsch's original film it will end up a classic version of the story. My wonder is what will be the next version be like.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I will qualify this by saying that I enjoyed both Sleepless in Seattle and Joe vs. the Volcano which are two other Tom Hanks  Meg Ryan romantic movies. Yes even a heterosexual male such as myself can enjoy getting lost in a love story if it's a good one.You've Got Mail! is anything but romantic. Basically what director Nora Ephron did is took the plot of The Shop Around the Corner and modernized it. In theory this would be fine and bringing Hanks and Ryan together again wasn't a bad idea... in theory. Somehow Ephron created a movie about a predator Hanks and his prey Ryan which is not what the original movie was about nor what a romantic movie should be about.The plot of this movie is basically this Tom Hanks character Joe Fox III is a millionaire businessman not unlike a Donald Trump type person. Fox owns a chain of commercial bookstorescoffee houses. He wants to put one of his stores in every major business district and dominate the bookcoffee business world. By doing so he's putting other small bookstores out of business. Enter Meg Ryan's character Kathleen Kelly who owns a small store around the corner that eventually she is forced to close due to Fox and his actions.Unknowingly the two of them are friends via the internet. They fall for each other by email. Fox eventually finds out that Kathleen is the woman he has been talking to over the computer but does not tell her. This is where the movie becomes truly horrible.What happens next is that Fox then manipulates Kathleen's feelings by pretending to be two different people both himself and the internet friend. He befriends her as Joe Fox in real life and keeps corresponding with her over the internet telling her completely different things under the guise of two different people. In doing so he confuses her and manipulates her. He sets up meetings with her via email and then doesn't show up as his internet self only to have his real life Fox self show up to cheer her up because she was stood up. This is not romance it's called cyberstalking and it's a criminal act.I have a friend who was stalked via the internet and it's not romantic it's a scary thing. You don't trick people into falling in love with you and if someone feels the need to they have serious emotional problems.If you are a woman and think this movie is truly romantic then I urge you to seek counseling for your selfesteem. I am not saying this as an insult to you I'm saying it as one human being truly concerned about another's wellbeing. If you feel it's romantic to have someone manipulate another to get them to fall in love then I feel very sorry for you. There are too many women who are stalked abused aquaintance raped tortured etc. in this world and it all starts with manipulation and a man putting up a false front like Joe Fox did in this movie. Ask any woman who has been in an abusive relationship and they will tell you the same thing He wasn't like that when I first met him he seemed like a really nice guy.That's what predators and abusers do they manipulate and put up a guise of being a nice person. Just because Tom Hanks is a likeable guy doesn't mean that his character is. Joe Fox is a stalker and I urge you to avoid this movie if at all possible. I know I'm probably going to hear a lot of feedback about this. I'm going to hear But it's not real life you're taking it too seriously. or Don't you know that people just like to get lost in a movie? There's nothing wrong with the suspension of disbelief or getting lost in a movie even if it's not such a great movie I've done it many times in my life. The fact is that there are GOOD romantic movies out there that don't involving sneaky manipulative people. Stick with the original movie The Shop Around the Corner or go rent Sleepless in Seattle again don't get lost in movies about stalkers being portrayed as nice people.".

It presents a real issue in a very real way and was also a movie you were drawn into rather than taking on a news broadcast tone.  The characters are likable with all their flaws and you find yourself crying with them at points.  The downside to this movie is that it is one of those indy films that few will sit down and watch.

This movie hit a very personal chord deep within me and the lasting effects of watching this particular movie are still with me today. Although the entire cast did a fantastic job of acting out their parts King was my favorite because at the time I watched this film I was a lot like him except the being homeless part. As far as Sean Astin and the part he played I couldn't relate very much at all but that didn't matter because his role was extremely powerful and believable! One more thing if it wasn't for Melissa Etheridge and her incredible talent I do not think this movie would have touched as many people as it did. Just a great movie period.".

A great movie is anything that could touch you in every way possible and this film does it!!! The entire cast was good. Seeing Christina Slater as a interviewer at the rehab clinic was ironic.

I was crying like a baby at the end of it and have seen it maybe 50 times since and last year I finally found a copy of it that I could buy. Not the most wellknown movie despite it's famous and brilliant cast. Storyline goes as follows A group of homeless kids on the streets of LA lead by the young man King Dermot Mulroney struggles with drugs cops love life each other and themselves. The movie starts as King is being released from jail after serving three months for 'assault with a deadly weapon'. When he hits the streets again his 'family' as he calls them has become a broken one. He is slowly trying to piece it back together. Heather Lara Flynn Boyle is the new comer to the group and King takes a liking to her. Greg Sean Astin has delved into drugs Little J Balthazar Getty is trying to deal with aggression and growing up. But with all the temptations around to make a quick buck how to survive on the streets parents who call the police on you and the ultimately a murder it's hard to stay together as a family. A love story about all the things you want and need but is hard to make happen in an impossible world.Mentions also to Will Smith Ricki Lake James LeGrosLaura San Giacomo Kyle McLachlan and Alyssa Milano. A story that could easily be a true one considering how many homeless kids there are on our streets. Never patronising never indulgent never moral but brilliantly written directed casted acted and the soundtrack leaves you yearning for Melissa Etheridge and Buffalo Springfield. A 1010 for me and I agree that it should be released on DVD and rereleased as a whole for a new audience. Beautiful beautiful... 'Just go where the day takes you.....'".

In fact this occasionally potent and always enthralling film has a raw squalid roughedged semiverite feel to it thanks to Mark Rocco's firm keen toughminded direction and King Baggot's crisp fluid starkly lit cinematography a cruelly eagleeyed Steadicam is put to sporadic and quite effective use. While Mulroney clearly dominates the picture with his sterling supremely charismatic portrayal of King the other cast members who play equally on the skids adolescents are just as fine Lara Flynn Boyle as a guileless new runaway who bolted away from home because her brother was sexually abusing her Sean Astin as a pathetic doomed heroin addict the scene where Astin vomits all over himself is very powerful and his ultimate fate is unforgettably chilling and disturbing Balthazar Getty as a sullen male hustler Will Smith as a brash crippled smartaleck James LeGros as King's loyal best friend Peter Dobson as a brutal punk hood and yes even tacky tubby tabloid TV show host Rikki Lake as a peevish abrasive fat chick are all superb.

You'll get a good insight on what these people's lives are like. I'm not saying that I had sympathy for them when I saw them using drugs stealing car radio's... but at least I understood why they did it.All in all I enjoyed watching this movie.

In Where the Day Takes You actors and actresses are handsome and beautiful there is no message in the end and it is almost a kind of incentive for teenagers with problem with their families to run away home provided they do not use smack or buy a gun.

The movie opens on the extreme verticals of New York skyscrapers and narrow city streets then cuts to a wonderfully elongated horizontal Monroe streeeeeeeetched across the scene in an increasingly empty apartment the girls sell their furniture to be able to pay the rent. This movie is dated and fluffy but has several interesting elements that make it worth a look for anyone interested in movie history any of the leads or in passing a wet Sunday afternoon in a pleasant way. This was Grable's last performance. She knew Monroe was about to usurp her but the two women both dealt with an uncomfortable situation in a professional way. There is a great narrative twist in the film too  Monroe plays a short sighted girl who finally meets the man to marry her when he tells her he likes her in her glasses. Unlike the usual cliched plot line it is when Monroe keeps her glasses on that she is revealed to be beautiful. Her acting is this film is among her best especially her vulnerable scene in the gold aeroplane and the moment in the powder room when she looks at herself in the mirrors and explodes into five raspberry satin dress covered Marilyn's is a visual pleasure the film and the viewer revel in Monroe can't not wearing her glasses at that point. This film is creamy smooth warm  just liked baked Alaska!!".

While the three girls chase rich husbands they somehow end up marrying for love. Personally for me it is Lauren Bacall and William Powell that standout...their witty knowing conversations are a true delight. Mr Powell shows just why he was so highly regarded. He has a magnificent calm and dignified presence beautifully complimented by Mrs Bogart's cool chic.The film shows all the problems of early CinemaScope of course ...the lack of closeups because of optical distortions that would occur and enough light to sunbake under being necessary on the sets and a sound scheme with the stereophonic image shifting from side to side as characters moves across the screen. The film is beautifully restored on the DVD with fine colour and sound.The use of a 12.55 ratio means a truly WIDE screen ....which is shown off by the location shots of New York and the girls apartment which seems enormous!The opening sequenceoverture of course was designed to show off both the brand new wide screen and stereo sound. It seems slightly redundant now but is still a fabulous piece of music by Alfred Newman.So turn the lights down turn up the stereo and step back to 1953 and watch a consumate piece of entertainment".

Of course almost any movie is improved by seeing it at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity.Lauren Bacall has always been one of my favorite actors and she and Powell do work wonderfully together. Monroe is also always a delight  I think that she was a much better actress than she is generally given credit for. However though I've seen this movie close to a dozen times before I was really struck at the wonderful performance that Grable turned in. She was perfect! I haven't seen much of her other work but in HTMAM she shows herself to be a wonderful comedic actress playing a dim blonde who really isn't that dim. What a revelation and what a delight.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes old movies but if you have a chance to catch it on a real movie screen  DO SO!

She was still slim possibly even slimmer than Lauren Bacall who'd recently had her second child and her face looked relatively youthful.  So why did she look 45?  I concluded it was the hair.

No more nickle and dime husbands for her she is going to marry a millionaire. Concocting an unusual scheme she sublets a Manhattan apartment that belonged to a businessman who had to flee the country. As it is doubtful he will ever return she begins selling the expensive piano and furnishings to afford the rent. Then she convinces two other women to join her in a plot to find moneydripping mates. Pola Marilyn Monroe is a nearsighted beauty who rarely wears her spectacles because men don't make passes on women with glasses as the saying goes. Very often she doesn't have a clue about what her date looks like. Loco Betty Grable herself a blonde beauty wants to marry well but is easily distracted by a handsome face even if the gentleman is as poor as a churchmouse. In short order Schatze is romanced by a greatlooking tieless seemingly povertystricken wisecracker Tom Cameron Mitchell and Loco intending to spend a weekend with a rich old coot meets an attractive forest ranger in the woods of Maine. Meanwhile Pola is supposed to hook up with someone in Atlantic City but boards a plane to Kansas City by mistake where she meets a handsome foureyed twobit businessman. Will the gold digging schemes of these three ladies go out the window? Here is a film my three sisters and I adored when we were teenagers in the late fiftiesearly sixties. Made in 1953 it is a wonderful romantic comedy and looks sensational to boot. Bacall Grable and especially Monroe are total delights as the women who would be glad to make matches with millionaires if only true love was not around to rear its head. The rest of the cast including Mitchell is quite nice too. Naturally the costumes are gorgeous and the settings among the uppercrust are first class as well. As for the script and direction they are both snappy memorable and fun. If you have a hankering for romantic comedy do see one of the groundbreaking romcoms of all time by renting this film or buying it for 50 cents which is what I did!. Any viewer who does so will turn a dull evening at home into an experience worth a million bucks.".

I really don't know what goes through peoples minds when they say Betty Grable wasn't good in this movie or was too old for the part. I can't imagine the story without her to make it what it is. I personally thought she looked the same age as her costars and not a bit older.Lauren Bacall was perfect for her role and as always so was Marilyn Monroe as another dumb blonde character. But I hate when most people think that just because she portrayed a ditzy girl that it means she was like that in real life too  SHE WASN'T! Marilyn Monroe was an intelligent natural darkbrown haired brunette.Anyway HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE is really good in my opinion and anyone that is a Monroe Bacall or Grable fan absolutely MUST see it! I personally am a HUGE Marilyn Monroe fan and enjoyed this movie as much as her others.The storyline was great and it had some very funny moments. I give this movie 9.510 losing a halfmark only because of the extreamly prolonged and unnecessary musical feature at the beginning which makes you lose interest and want to fast forward 5 minutes worth of inactive classical music. An overall fabulous movie.".

I personally thought she looked the same age as her costars and not a bit older.Lauren Bacall was perfect for her role and as always so was Marilyn Monroe as another dumb blonde character. But I hate when most people think that just because she portrayed a ditzy girl that it means she was like that in real life too  SHE WASN'T! Marilyn Monroe was an intelligent natural darkbrown haired brunette.Anyway HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE is really good in my opinion and anyone that is a Monroe Bacall or Grable fan absolutely MUST see it! I personally am a HUGE Marilyn Monroe fan and enjoyed this movie as much as her others.The storyline was great and it had some very funny moments. I give this movie 9.510 losing a halfmark only because of the extreamly prolonged and unnecessary musical feature at the beginning which makes you lose interest and want to fast forward 5 minutes worth of inactive classical music. An overall fabulous movie.";

Then there are the myopic Pola and the flighty Loco. It's clear that the only one with a head on her shoulders si Schatze who knows how to move in the cafe society of the New York of those years. Unfortunately the women's choice in men is awful. Two of them end up with guys that are just making a living and in a surprise at the last moment the last girl gets a real millionaire when she only thought he was a working class stiff!The film although light it's still fun to watch. Lauren Bacall is the one that fares better in the film not only does she get the prize package but she gives an intelligent account of her elegant and sophisticated Schatze. Betty Grable doesn't have much to do and a bespectacled Marilyn Monroe does a lot with her character.William Powell makes a great appearance as the older man in Schatze's life. He still was showing his charm as the Texas man with enough sense to resign being married to a much younger woman. David Wayne Cameron Mitchell Rory Calhoun Fred Clark are the men in the lives of the would be gold diggers.This is a film to be seen as a curiosity film made in the new technology of Cinemascope.".

Like another reviewer stated Bacall has this curiously old persona he used the word ageless...one could have believed her older than Grable in fact I found myself studying her face finding it hard to believe she was under 30. She also monopolizes every scene in a bitchy way that no one could possibly find sympathetic or appealing. I guess this was to show she was the brains of the operation. One thing I noted Bacall didn't need to insure her rather hefty legs for 1 million like Grable supposedly did.Monroe has some innocent charm and Grable is sort of the Betty White from Golden Girls...with Bacall being the Maude.I may have smiled at a couple of Bacall's cynical lines but she is too harsh in the movie. Monroe was sort of funny in the Magoo role but most of this movie is not funny at all and you begin to tire of it towards the end wondering how long you are going to have to endure it.It also seems chopped up the male characters become mixed up....what was the fashion show all about? If you are in to period female costume extravagance this movie will work for you. Maybe it had to do with the new color cinemascope they were using....thinking clothing in all its colors was a great way to show off its features???

This is an entertaining but superficial chickflick meditating whether a gal should marry for love or money or if you can maybe get both. Along with The Robe this was the premiere event for CinemaScope and it also provided a breathless introduction to stereophonic sound.As a romantic comedy it is imperfect and it is ironically hampered by the very things that made it important in its original release. The grand images intended for magnificent CinemaScope will only appear smaller than normal on your smallscreen television with horizontal black bars or will be absurdly distorted to fit the aspect ratio of your monitor. And the stereo means nothing to us now so the film's frequent sidetrips into sound and scenery gimmicks are only a distraction to us now.But as a historical peek at its time this film really delivers. You get the tacky materialism and newlyfound hedonism of the beginning of postwar prosperity in the early 1950's as well as a nervous examination of the changing social mores around the role of women. Plus you get a wonderful record of what New York City looked like circa 1953 and a geewhiz tribute to the new phenomenon of commercial air travel.".

This was a new kind of film for Bacall who up until this time had worked with her husband in some major film noir. She proves herself up to the task of both comedy and color. Monroe is hilarious as a nearly blind woman who refuses to let a man see her in glasses and she is gorgeous throughout. William Powell his Thin Man days over is as wonderful as ever as a gentile widower.This is a very entertaining film filled with in jokes  Grable insisting the trumpet player on the radio is Harry James Bacall insisting to Powell that she loves older men particularly that guy in the African Queen. The film makes its points well that what you think you want may not be what's in your heart that young men have years to work hard and make something of themselves and that you can't tell a book by its gas jockey cover.".

'How to Marry a Millionaire' comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of 'Street Scene' a Gershwinlite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of well Gershwin. Sitting through it takes some patience. If you have the DVD rest assured you can skip forward. You won't miss anything.The film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50's Hollywood a movie so bolstered by major starpower opulent miseenscene and perfect highconcept that failure seems inconceivable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation however are forced to ask themselves  how is this so limp? The script is an albatross about the production's neck a dead smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life. There are no comic situations just isolated moments that play for laughs. Whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop the movie quickly moves on to other less interesting things. A case in point  the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them shortsighted refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce setup surely complete with mistaken identity angry wife and probably a pie in the face for somebody? Well no. Instead we cut between the three dates as the ladies react 'comically' to things their partners say. Hit the punchline and cut to the next limp joke. If in doubt have Marilyn walk into a wall. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him?The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's breakout films and the camera just eats her up even though the script gives her nothing to do. She's so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched. Lauren Bacall on the other hand had been a major star for nearly a full decade and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with Monroe. She gets the only thing passing for a real role and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap  given the right material she could have brought this thing to life. She's a curiously ageless actress  when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty it isn't instantly ridiculous  and far less girlish than her costars giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from ageless and had a good eight years on her costars putting her near the end of her Hollywood career. There's an air of desperation about her at times stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing unable to play her real age but fooling noone as a contemporary of this new sharper generation of actresses relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career for Marilyndoubters seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw Monroe's subtlety and  yes  intelligence into sharp relief. She's also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male costars although all of the men  even the great William Powell  are guilty of lazy performances she's unable to strike any comic sparks off them. Better to have given her role to the underutilised Monroe who could be funny all by herself and left Grable with the repetitive Mr. Magoo routine.That the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious Hollywood production the sort that renders even the twee likes of 'By the Light of the Silvery Moon' watchable. But somewhere buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism lies the rough outline of a sharp cynical comedy about the business of marriage that Bacall could have made sing  and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with 'How to Marry a Millionaire' in expectation of that movie ready to be disappointed all over again.".

	schema:headline " Looking at the DVD case you'd assume that Marilyn Monroe was THE lead in this film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I hate the merchandising people at the major studios. Often to boost sales they misrepresent movies to attract audiences. One of the worst examples is 20th CenturyFox's marketing of videotapes and DVDs of films in which Marilyn Monroe appeared. While HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE isn't the worst case by looking at the box art you'd assume that she was the lead in this film. In reality there were three leadsMonroe Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall. It was truly an ensemble film. Now as I said this was not the worst example. In many of her earliest films Monroe was only a bit playeryet she is prominently featured on the cover art! Take a look at the art on the IMDb pages for THE ASPHALT JUNGLE LOVE HAPPY or MONKEY BUSINESSyou'll see what I mean even though she was a supporting or bit actress in these films.In HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE it's actually good that you have the ensemble cast. After all how can you make it a story about three moneyhungry roommates if Monroe plays all three parts!! Plus at the time the film was made Betty Grable received top billing as she was the more established and prestigious star at the time. A few short years later Miss Grable's career would be over and Monroe would shoot to superstardom.The story is a remake though I haven't seen any of the previous versions. Three ladies decide to live together in a swank Manhattan apartment as they try to hook themselves wealthy husbands.Grable's love interest is Fred Clarka rich man with the disposition of a sour pickle. He is already married and really isn't interested in marriagejust making Grable his mistress. Her character is the ditsy onenaive and dumb and she fails to grasp how nasty Clark is.Bacall is the mostpursued in the filmwith an apparently poor guy Cameron Mitchell Grable met in a deli pursuing her as well as niceguy William Powell. She is the supposedly smart one of the three but has a hard time reading meneven though the scheme is hers.As for Monroe she is sort of like a middle ground between her other two roommates. She's not as ditsy nor as bright as the other two. Despite her amazing looks she isn't quite as ardently pursued as you'd expect in the film! Heck I'd expect ALL the men in the film to chase after her! And as for finding a millionaire this shouldn't be a problem! One of her love interests in the film is the unlikely David Wayne and their scenes together are marvelous.Despite all the girls' plans things don't turn out in the end like any of them envisioned. They all get men who they really had no intention in getting...yet like a Hollywood film everything works out wonderfully at the end. Along the way the film is chock full of nice little vignettes and performances all due to good acting and a very agreeable script. I particularly liked the nice role played by William Powellhis graceful presence did a lot to add class to the film though there were several other nice performances as well. Plus everything just looked and sounded so nicewith the film being shot in CinemaScope and with lovely music throughout. It was obvious that 20th CenturyFox pulled out all the stops for this production. I'd give this one an 8 and it's well worth seeing.By the way read through the IMDb trivia for this film and you'll find one of the dumbest forced changes to a film of the era. The powers that be at the censor board would not allow Miss Monroe to say the old saying men don't make passes at girls who wear glassesas it was apparently too racy or something else that is beyond me!!

	onyx:emotionText "I hate the merchandising people at the major studios. Often to boost sales they misrepresent movies to attract audiences. One of the worst examples is 20th CenturyFox's marketing of videotapes and DVDs of films in which Marilyn Monroe appeared. While HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE isn't the worst case by looking at the box art you'd assume that she was the lead in this film. In reality there were three leadsMonroe Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall. It was truly an ensemble film. Now as I said this was not the worst example. In many of her earliest films Monroe was only a bit playeryet she is prominently featured on the cover art! Take a look at the art on the IMDb pages for THE ASPHALT JUNGLE LOVE HAPPY or MONKEY BUSINESSyou'll see what I mean even though she was a supporting or bit actress in these films.In HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE it's actually good that you have the ensemble cast. After all how can you make it a story about three moneyhungry roommates if Monroe plays all three parts!! Plus at the time the film was made Betty Grable received top billing as she was the more established and prestigious star at the time. A few short years later Miss Grable's career would be over and Monroe would shoot to superstardom.The story is a remake though I haven't seen any of the previous versions. Three ladies decide to live together in a swank Manhattan apartment as they try to hook themselves wealthy husbands.Grable's love interest is Fred Clarka rich man with the disposition of a sour pickle. He is already married and really isn't interested in marriagejust making Grable his mistress. Her character is the ditsy onenaive and dumb and she fails to grasp how nasty Clark is.Bacall is the mostpursued in the filmwith an apparently poor guy Cameron Mitchell Grable met in a deli pursuing her as well as niceguy William Powell. She is the supposedly smart one of the three but has a hard time reading meneven though the scheme is hers.As for Monroe she is sort of like a middle ground between her other two roommates. She's not as ditsy nor as bright as the other two. Despite her amazing looks she isn't quite as ardently pursued as you'd expect in the film! Heck I'd expect ALL the men in the film to chase after her! And as for finding a millionaire this shouldn't be a problem! One of her love interests in the film is the unlikely David Wayne and their scenes together are marvelous.Despite all the girls' plans things don't turn out in the end like any of them envisioned. They all get men who they really had no intention in getting...yet like a Hollywood film everything works out wonderfully at the end. Along the way the film is chock full of nice little vignettes and performances all due to good acting and a very agreeable script. I particularly liked the nice role played by William Powellhis graceful presence did a lot to add class to the film though there were several other nice performances as well. Plus everything just looked and sounded so nicewith the film being shot in CinemaScope and with lovely music throughout. It was obvious that 20th CenturyFox pulled out all the stops for this production. I'd give this one an 8 and it's well worth seeing.By the way read through the IMDb trivia for this film and you'll find one of the dumbest forced changes to a film of the era. The powers that be at the censor board would not allow Miss Monroe to say the old saying men don't make passes at girls who wear glassesas it was apparently too racy or something else that is beyond me!!

	schema:reviewBody "When you are trying to tread the same ground as a wellmade classic that has all of its best elements in place there are really only two possible outcomes. You can either do a good job and be compared to the original in somewhat flattering terms or you can do a bad job and end up the joke of the industry. The latter is what happened to director Robert Wilson and his writers when Dead Mary rolled out onto home video. A big part of the problem is their inability to provide a proper undercurrent for the story with no credible explanation for the film's events in sight. It does not matter how preposterous your story is on the surface. If you do not provide it with at least a small anchor in reality you will lose your audience. For a good example of a preposterous story going to glory because its makers took the time to anchor it in some turf of reality one need only look at such pieces as RoboCop Ghostbusters or Desperado. Dead Mary proposes a preposterous idea and does nothing to anchor its audience in its reality.That would have been forgiven or even mended if the film had taken just a little bit of time to introduce the cast of characters and give them a hint of a personality. For a good example of this done right one can simply go back to The Evil Dead again. Within the first halfhour we are given subtle yet strong hints of who each character is and what they are like as people. Dead Mary's writers attempted to cheat this by grafting soap opera archetypes into the characters and it unfortunately backfires. By the time the film goes into the gory payoff all we know about these characters is who is married to whom who is cheating on whom who is upset with whom and who failed to arrive. Outside of the parameters of this semioutdoor trip that was done far better in The Evil Dead we know so little about the cast of characters that caring about them is next to impossible. Half of the time we do not even know their names. The other half of the time their names have so little weight it would have been more effective to simply call them 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7.Making it even worse is that the central premise is so vague and illdefined that it ends up making less sense as time goes on. In The Evil Dead our heroes wind up fighting one another because they have stumbled upon the results of an archaeological expedition that turned up secrets they could barely grasp the implications of. In Dead Mary the heroes play a stupid game that was quite obviously culled from Candyman and given no mechanism of actuation. Quite literally one moment our characters are having a dispute on what was meant to be an idyllic vacation then the next they are regenerating destroyed flesh and doing bad David Vincent impersonations. It becomes such a nonsequitor that all of the impact is lost. Another comparison to The Evil Dead that Dead Mary cannot stand up to is the moment when we learn that Cheryl has been taken by something the group resurrected by accident. The dramatic buildup and payoff of The Evil Dead was arresting. Dead Mary is by comparison poorlywritten and shot even worse.Does this make the entire project a waste? Well no there are moments when the film does look like breaking out of its amateurish writing and becoming something more substantial. Dominique Swain and Maggie Castle do the best they can with a screenplay that gives them absolutely nothing to work with. One can see the frustration crossing Dominique's face as she struggles with staggeringly inept screen writing. When the film gets confused as to what it is trying to emulate and even attempts to borrow from The Thing Dominique and Maggie slot into the important roles of that particular story nicely. MarieJose Colburn also does well trying to give her character a haunting or threatening vibe but is undone by the fact that the screenplay tips its hand way too early and makes the revelations to the rest of the cast so perfunctory that the audience is a solid hour ahead of the heroes. People despair of the constantrewrite culture that pervades Hollywood but films like Dead Mary demonstrate why most screenplays should be revised at least five times.Another problem Dead Mary falls into is that it constantly needs to fade to black in order to jump from one character to another. For a film that supposedly takes place over the course of a night this is not only unnecessary but serves to deflate the dramatic tension. Another area where The Evil Dead excelled was that with the exception of some very seamless cutaways the entire thing achieves the feeling of taking place in realtime. The result is that by the time the hero emerges into a dismal morning sunrise the viewer feels gobsmacked that all this mayhem and death took place over the course of one night. The final death scenes of the possessed characters left the audience in awe. In Dead Mary the perfunctory execution of the one character we know to be possessed is edited so poorly and executed in such a whocares fashion that it ultimately robs the film of any memory of dramatic tension. There is a reason why I keep comparing Dead Mary to other better films. Namely Dead Mary is so obsessed with what not to do that it ends up not doing anything at all and the result feels more like a collection of unused footage than an actual film.Dead Mary is very much a two out of ten film. It is so pedestrian in style that it ends up being neither good nor bad. It is simply boring.".

This feeling of wanting them dead only increased as they talked and talked and talked if Leatherface had shown up with his chainsaw I would have been pulling for him...the only character I liked was the younger girlfriend of one of the aforementioned losers who did not want to be there at the extremely boring yet tense reunion and I don't blame her a bit. Well the wild weekend turns really cool when they decide to play a game of Dead Mary I am guessing because there was already a movie called bloody Mary. Well they play and from the rest of the movie on I am wondering if there was a point to the game dead Mary and if there was a reason to name the movie this. I don't know what happened after that as there was no rules established no plot established and whatever was killing people was not established. Not that it was all bad there was a lot of paranoia horror to go around and some good kills as well...along with that however there were also a lot of conjecture scenes and pointless plot points too hey where is that Ted guy anyway?.

	schema:reviewBody "Alright so I really wanted to prove the other comments wrong and write a review supporting this film. I assumed it was going to be somehow connected to the legend of Bloody Mary and that we were going to see a nice film based upon the well known urban legend. Sadly this film not only mocks the previous mentioned legend but also tricks the audience into seeing something that has nothing to do with either Bloody or Dead Mary. Exactly the cover shows the image of a ghostly woman behind one of the characters with a threatening attitude and it's a deception in a way because even though the films deals with a supernatural villain the image we see in the cover is just a way to give high hopes about something that never really appears throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact Dead Mary in a way desperately tries to imitate The Evil Dead but the results are not even comparable as it is expected. The idea of a group of friends going to a house in the middle of nowhere for vacations has been done several times before but these friends are possessed by an evil force that makes them act evil and kill each other as the movie goes. Does this ring any bells?. I don't know if I'm the only one but this looks like an evident resemblance to Sam Raimi's masterpiece to me. In The Evil Dead the possession starts when the friends invoke the spirits after playing a tape and in this movie the friends invoke the spirits after calling Dead Mary three times in front of the mirror. So yeah...it's a ripoff. Like I said before I really wanted to like this film in spite of the harsh reviews but it seems like there's little to contradict. One of the things that annoyed me to death about it besides the fact that the alleged villain never really shows up is the fact that the film mostly focuses on the love relationships between the characters. Frankly for a second I felt like I was watching the Halloween episode of Dawson's Creek or something. A horror movie is not supposed to focus on the high school sweethearts aspect so much. I'm not saying it should be all about evil spirits murderers zombies vampires or whatever it is that they choose as a theme but making 80 of the film about love relationships betrayal lies ruptures and things related to couples is completely out of place. Even the final lines are related to that and it was completely uncalled for.If I have to point out the good things I guess I have to say that even though this is a bclass horror flick the photography was very well developed and it didn't have that inexpensive quality look that most people would expect in a bclass movie. For the contrary the image looks really good and the shots are not nearly as unprofessional as I thought they would be. The movie is very well filmed and it didn't look like a low budget product. Unfortunately good photography and mildly decent shots are not enough to save the film. God knows I tried to be positive but I really didn't like Dead Mary due to the endless chats about love that reminded of those obnoxious soap operas for teenagers. If you're in the mood for real horror watch The Evil Dead again. Or even Urban Legend 3 Bloody Mary at least THAT movie is more related to the legend than this one.".

The urban legend of Bloody Mary that was brilliantly explored in Candyman in the 90's now is used in a ripoff of Evil Dead. There are many movies with a group of friends that goes to a cabin in the woods and faces evil like for example Cabin Fever which works.

Eventually they play the say Dead Mary in the mirror game with a candle with the idea that the spirit of the dead witch will appear. Instead the spirit possesses one of them but no one including the audience who it is. Borrowing heavily from John Carpenter's The Thing minus the style and suspense the characters start to distrust one another. This movie had potential to be a minor success but the lack of any action for such a long period of time sinks it fast. There is a few nice moments like when the thingI mean a character reveals herself to another character in a shack in the woods. There isn't much gore to speak of and what little there is unconvincing. The unknown cast is good but the movie needed to shift gears and actually get scary for it to work and it just doesn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a disappointment on several different levels. As we first start in it's obviously going to be yet another horror movie about beastly and possibly a couple of decent young people heading out to do stupid things in the woods and on that note it played through.Secondly the title made us believe that it was somehow going to be yet another urban legend movie this time based on the Bloody Mary theme. It did get to that as the young people went into the bathroom one by one and tried to invoke Dead Mary. What I didn't understand was the commentary by other characters that they had done this before seen her and it was ten shades of awful. Of course that didn't stop them from mocking it and doing it again. However this is never really revisited. No one goes back to say what happened before what Mary does or how to stop her. Nor do we really even see Mary again.This event and the subsequent horror plots that follow have taken us 40 minutes into the movie. This is where the movie leaves the urban legend theme and starts trying very badly to emulate The Living Dead with evil demons now possessing or maybe already possessing various characters who get killed and come to life and taunt the others until they get wise and just burn the zombiedemons.It's hard to get the idea that these possessions are the result of Mary's invocation due to the fact that there are hints that the events were starting to happen before the film's events take place. Where is Ted for crying out loud? They asked it through 34 of the movie. He never shows up leading us to believe he met his demise before the opening credits but we never find out. The gas station and the woods are deserted of any other vacation goers which seems strange to the folk about 12 through the film. This also leads the audience to think that the events started before the youngsters did their Mary invocation.Forty minutes into the film the horror action starts but it's disorganized more gore than horror and doesn't follow any connected idea. There are too many ideas that aren't followed through too many plots with no beginning and no end and the character development doesn't really lead anyone to care whether any of them live or not. Although it's my opinion I wouldn't recommend this film.".

It is not even remotely scary in fact we see very little of what the Monster is supposed to be... On the bright side it is very well acted by a group of noname actors. The cinematography looks great and could have easily made this an awesome horror film but in the end we are left empty and a bit confused.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that I understand the premise of the movie and where they where trying to go with it. But they did a horrible job with it. There was so much wrong with the movie it over shadows any good that there was making it slim pickings. The story idea was a rehash of the same old 'bunch of young adults at a camp ground for the weekend'. But they did put in some originality with the whole dead Mary thing. Yeah it's the same as bloody Mary and has been done but still. And doing in the form of a dark psychological thriller rather than the normal monster or gore hound flick was a great idea. But that is the end of it.The acting was OK at best but none of the characters had any sort of personality that actually stood out or made you remember them. They where all the same with different names.And there are just so many questions and inconsistencies that it completely ruined the movie forcing you into a totally confused viewer. We went from a very long and drawn out beginning that was more like a show of General Hospital than a movie to people chanting Dead Mary in the mirror to zombies then possession I think?. And they kept babbling about being infected when they where alone...?? Huh? The biggest pet peeve I had was the filming. Like I said I understand what they where trying to do with a dark psychological thriller but the film lighting was absolutely horrible. It looks like somebody took their hand held camcorder outside in the woods with nothing but moonlight and filmed the movie. 85 of the time your pausing the movie trying to figure out what character is on the screen. Finally you just give up hoping that they will do or say something so you know what is going on. I even turned all the lights off in the house wondering if maybe that would help and I still could barely tell what was going on. And the only way you could really tell the characters apart was what they looked like considering the lack of personality. So needless to say who's talking who's tied up and who's running around in the rain is totally lost.So what or who is Dead Mary? What is the deal with the drops of blood in the bathroom? Or the guy sleeping on the couch who is the first killed. Why are the killed characters coming back as Zombies and why does that other guy beat the crap out of and hack up the zombie looking for answers. Answers to what? And why is it after he beats the crap out of the zombie and tears it's face apart it is totally healed and back to normal moments later when it's wife comes to see it. I assume she died in the fire? Where did the bearded guy and the two ladies go off into the woods leaving the other two at the house? Where did they go? What is up with the ending and what happened to the girl who was apparently possessed by dead Mary? Oh yeah and where is everybody else in the town to begin with? And who the hell is Ted and where is he? Uggg it was just way to rushed. If they took the time to actually lay down the story and filmed it better maybe the questions above could actually be answered. You can always assume the answers though and fill in the blanks yourself if that helps. Otherwise it all adds up to one huge and very boring movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Mary is set at an isolated log cabin situated deep in the woods. Couples Kim Dominique Swain  Matt Jefferson Brown Lilly Maggie Castle  Bryce Steven McCarthy Amber Reagan Pasternak  Dash Michael Majeski plus odd one out Eve MarieJose Colburn who is on her own have all been invited to the cabin for the weekend by their friend Ted. There they hang out  well not much else really. Suddenly someone comes up with the bright idea of playing Dead Mary a campfire tale that states if you say 'Dead Mary' three times into a mirror said deceased female named Mary who was a Witch when she could be described as Alive Mary will come back from the dead  kill everyone. Noone really takes it seriously but do it anyway then by the nights end they begin to wish they hadn't as Matt turns up mutilated in the woods possessed by something evil...This American Canadian coproduction was directed by Robert Wilson  one has to say I though Dead Mary is a rather odd little teen horror film  a not particularly good one either. The script for Dead Mary is credited to Peter Sheldrick  Christopher Warre Smets although according to the IMDb while it started out as a typical teen slasher with a ghostly Dead Mary zombie rising from the lake to kill various teens director Wilson decided to change everything  have some unseen unknown  unexplained evil force possess the teens onebyone  thus turn it into some sort of modern teens in peril in the woods in a log cabin mix between The Evil Dead 1981  the bodysnatching plot of The Thing 1982 as the second half of Dead Mary plays out exactly the same as John Carpenter's masterpiece with it trying to create a real sense of paranoia  mistrust. To be brutally honest Dead Mary is a mess the first thirty minutes are so boring it's untrue after ten minutes  absolutely nothing had happened I was becoming bored after fifteen minutes I was past bored after twenty minutes of nothing happening I was praying for some sort of dramatic incident  by the twenty five minute mark  still literally nothing of any significance had happened I had all but given up on it. Upto this point the entire film has been nothing but really dull dialogue between really dull character's nothing that happens has any relevance to later on anyway which makes it even worse. Eventually the film kicks into gear  the body stealing plot starts to develop to be fair this part of the film is alright but with such a small cast of character's there's not much the makers could do with the idea they also reveal who is an evil clone far too easily  it's annoying to see people keep splitting up all the time. Also anyone possessed by whatever is possessing them seems intent on upsetting people by telling them that their boygirlfriend is cheating on them! It's just odd to see a mutilated Matt for instance just sit there  tell everyone that their lover is cheating on them for no apparent reason. The plot is a bit of a mess there is no solid or reasonable explanation for anything that happens the ending is one of those frustrating ones which just cuts to black at a really annoying moment  leaves everything up in the air  whatever happened to Ted anyway?Director Wilson does alright here actually the film has a very laid back  lazy feel to it with slow camera moves lingering shots  a pace that at times if it was any slower the film would be going backwards. The gore levels are none existent there's a couple of dead bodies a burnt arm  some blood splatter but this isn't much off a PG. I don't remember any nudity either. The film is well shot with a fair bit of style  I did like the atmosphere of the final twenty odd minutes with the dark woods  pouring rain.Technically the film is pretty impressive with nice cinematography there's no quick 'blink  you'll miss it' editing or shaky hand held camcorder shots either. Dead Mary certainly looks nice it's just a shame the script is a total mess from start to finish. Apparently shot in Ontario in Canada. The acting is pretty good while not Oscar worthy noone stands out as being particularly bad  the girls look rather nice which helps.Dead Mary is a really odd film the first thirty minutes will put most into a coma while the rest of it is some odd mix of Candyman 1992 with the whole urban myth surrounding saying someone's name three times The Evil Dead  The Thing but doesn't come close to being as good as any of those. I can't really see who would get anything out of Dead Mary I really don't.".

Except what happens is that on of the friends is possessed by a spirit that lets her turn the others into ghouls who spout out hurtful personal information on the others. The only way to keep them from regenerating is to burn them.Okay typical clichs abound in this movie. Cars that won't start. Isolated cabin slacker friends getting picked off one at a time. People responding by doing the most illogical things. Hey maybe we should cut people's hands off and see if they regenerate. Uh yeah but a slight cut would probably accomplish the same thing.This film has nothing original about it in fact the Evil Dead kind of did the same thing with a lot more class.

	schema:reviewBody "DEAD MARY 2007 is a very uniquely interesting horror film. It plays mind games with both it's characters and the moviegoer. The 7 characters Kim Dominique Swain Eve MarieJosee Colburn Baker Steve McCarthy Lily Maggie Castle Dash Michael Majeski Amber Reagan Pasternak and Matt Jefferson Brown all find themselves in over their heads big time! The initial vibe is that it's just a friendly gettogether in a remote cabin amongst friends then it takes an oddly eerie turn into horror.There is an air of isolation that permeates throughout DEAD MARY once the horror starts and the opening sequence personifies this with Kim and Matt seemingly in the middle of nowhere on the roadside on their way to meet their old college friends Ted Eve Baker and Dash along with Baker's younger girlfriend Lily at Ted's cabin. Ted himself is nowhere to be found after they all arrive and I think never showing us what happened to Ted adds to the film's isolated tone. A lingering question that I have is that I wonder if Ted was attackedpossessed before the others arrived and is he the one that initiated all this? And perhaps the Dead Mary game they played that night is just a coincidenceMacGuffin to throw both the characters and the viewers off. It's never really explained in the film.Now just in terms of what's going on with the characters we see the viewer actually knows who is responsible but not how it all started or even how or if it all ends! The most interesting aspect of DEAD MARY is that instead of settling for being just a mindless horror flick with stupid puns where a literal monster is killing off the characters it uses the device of tying the possessions into the personal lives of the characters but in a very tongueincheek all too honest way. Before the possessions you could tell these old friends were kind of jaded and uneasy with each other and with life in general then the possession releases brings all their mistrust secrets inhibitions and shortcomings to the forefront.The real success of DEAD MARY lies in it's utter ambiguity about what is really happening. Is it a simple possession by Dead Mary spurred by the game they played that first night that is causing all this? Is it some other demon or spirit and the Dead Mary game was coincidence? Is it the actual apocalypse which would explain the lack of other people around?!I thought the ensemble acting was very good amongst the cast with standout characters being Baker Eve and the scenerychewing Dash. The actors were very convincing playing longtime friends with secrets. DEAD MARY is a solid horror yarn with an ambiguity and storyline that I think warrants repeated viewing.".

Why did the friends feel like they had to go through the dead Mary ritual one after the other ? It began as a challenge to one person  but then they all do the same thing as if they agreed to make a contest out of it which was not made clear from the characters' comments . The story is full of incoherence  like how the teenager gets locked up in spite of the fact that the first victim turns out to be alive  not killed by Eve like she testified  and the one who kills him is his wife  yet the teenager girl is treated as the suspect . Only later it is revealed and explained that the woman jumped on her wounded ex because he started 'turning' and coming back to life . One would wonder how she came so quickly to understand how the zombie thing works  it's as if they have been living with zombies all their lives and how to prevent a dead person from coming back to life as a zombieis common knowledge . Why did the girl burn herself with her zombie husband ? It's not even clear if she did die in there or not  she is just shown to dowse the cabin with gas and throw a lit match  then cut to a view of the cabin from outside showing the flames . One only understands that she died with the zombie from the fact that she doesn't appear anymore after that . How did they know that the effective way to deal with the zombie reanimation issue was to burn them ? The movie did not show any development of experience on the matter  again it's as if they came ready to deal with zombies or any other supernatural creatures . The interrogation scene where the zombie husband is tied by the cheating friend does not make a lot of sense  he keeps hitting the zombie asking What do you want ?  I would like to know what HE hoped to accomplish  he was satisfied when the zombie replied  We want YOU we want you to die ? we want you to become one of us ? we want to eat you ? Who is dead Mary ? Is it the character Eve ? I think it would have been better to show why dead Mary appears after repeating the name  what is dead Mary and what does she do to make people become zombies ? Is it a form of possession ? The ending scene is the most stupid  why couldn't they at least show the evil characters dying ? I must admit however  there were some instances where they succeeded in creating suspense  it was almost scary beginning with the dead Mary contest up to the discovery and burning of the first zombie  after that the story went downhill .".

Dead Mary actually spends time in the beginning trying to give you the back stories on these individuals that are meeting for the weekend. The purpose of this you would suspect is so that you get some intrigue on the characters actions add to the paranoia advance a plot or perhaps simply gain some empathy for the characters. By the end of the movie you will realize none of these things happened and thus it was a pointless waste of time. So you might say So what it is a schlocky horror movie. Who cares about plot character developmentetc? To that I say I can enjoy a silly Bmovie horror movie as much as the next guy. But what is it that fans of let's say Friday the 13th want in a movie? I would break it down to things such as Good special effects creative kills scares maybe a few laughs and if all else fails some TA. Dead Mary fails to provide any of these things.I gave Dead Mary 2 out of 10. In hind sight this might be a little low because the acting wasn't particularly bad and the technical aspects of the film were OK. I guess I rate it so low because there is nothing to speak for in its favor. Often there are bad movies where you say The movie really stunk but there is this one scene... Not true of Dead Mary. You can go through your whole life without seeing the movie and not have missed anything.".

The film starts out uncomfortable then intense as it shows the dysfunctional relationships between some old friends who spend a weekend by the lake with each other. They seem completely sick of each other and are going through the motions of keeping in touch even though they probably hate each other more by now. They become bored the first night and dare to play the game of Dead Mary. You take a candle into a darkened room with a mirror and repeat the words Dead Mary three times into the mirror. This is supposed to bring the horrendous bloody Mary to life. A few of the friends attempt this to not much luck. Later on that night the horror unfolds. Torture and blood starts flowing fast in this suspenseful and horrifying gem. I hope to see more Canadian horror movies out of directorproducer Robert Wilson and writers Christopher Warre Smets and Peter Sheldrick. Thanks go out to the filmmakers for not trying to pose this film as if it were American. It's pitiful to see so many inept Canadian horror films try to fly American flags throughout their films in an attempt to gain American acceptance. How they think that posing as an American film helps them when their movies suck in the first place I have no idea. They just don't get it. Horror fans love excellent horror movies. It doesn't matter if it's an Italian Giallo from Dario Argento or a Japanese ghost story like the original Grudge and Ring films. We only want films that are able to keep us on the edge of our seats which this movie does throughout.".

The DVD I got have a shot of the cabin with a hand sticking out of the ground on the cover now that was proper to the movie. However the cover that is used here on IMDb is the one that sort of sets up the movie for something more than it actually is.Regardless then Dead Mary was actually a rather alright horror movie sort of think a mixture between Evil Dead The Exorcist and any of the number teenage horror movies out there then you have a basic idea of what you are in for in Dead Mary.The story is about a group of young people coming together in the woods in an old cabin for the weekend. A weekend that is supposed to be about reunion fun and partying. But fun and partying turns to dread and fear when the people start on playing the 'dead Mary' game where they have to go alone into the bathroom call out 'dead Mary' three times can anyone say Candyman here? and then apparently the spirit of a witch will appear. Something do shows up and the lives of the group are now in danger. One by one people start dying under strange circumstances and people are not whom they used to be or appear to be. Who can they trust? But more importantly will they survive the weekend?I found the story to actually be alright despite it borrowing heavily from other horror movies. Still the movie turned out to be interesting enough and provide good entertainment. The mood and setting of the movie was really good and you had a sense of isolation and dread in the movie which was nice because it helped build up the tension.Personally I found Dead Mary to be a step up from the usual teenage horrorslasher movies that have been flooding the horror scene for quite some years already. It was nice to see something aside from someone wronged coming back to wreck havoc and vengeance on the late teenagers who wronged him.Dead Mary has a couple of great scare moments but nothing that will make you jump out of the chair. What this movie is running on is the suspense and the way that it keeps you wondering whom is possessed and who isn't who is telling the truth and who is lying. For that aspect then the director Robert Wilson really did a great job.There was actually a decent amount of blood in the movie which I found great. But this wasn't really a slasher or gore movie so it was just an added bonus.The people they had on the cast list were great actors and actresses and the people did great jobs with their characters. However the ones that were carrying the movie were Jefferson Brown playing Matt Dominique Swain playing Kim and Steven McCarthy playing Baker. They really put on great performances and made the movie come to life.Dead Mary is a good horror movie that stays true to the oldschool horror movies of the late 80's and early 90's just with a pinch of Evil Dead thrown into the formula. If you enjoy horror movies and like to be kept in suspense where you are not fully sure about what is going on around you then you should definitely check out Dead Mary. Just remember to leave the lights on in your bathroom...".

When I first started to watch I found myself getting caught up in the short attention span stuff and wanting the movie to speed along to the horror. However I then stopped myself and remembered what it really is like when one is stuck at the side of the road. SLOW and BORING!! So I was intrigued.

Well if any of those people actually sat through the movie and paid attention to it they would realize that Dead Mary IS the reason these young adults are killing each other. She may not make an appearance in the movie but she is what is possessing these people. How many people actually complain about THE EVIL DEAD not having any evil dead ghouls appearing in the film? The point is and this applies to both films that these people are being possessed by the evil spirits or demons. Speaking of The Evil Dead this film reminded me a lot of it and I enjoyed it very much. There hasn't been very many really good horror movies released lately and I found this one to be highly overlooked and unappreciated. It is well worth viewing.A group of friends get together for a weekend reunion at a small place in the woods. After catching up on each others lives which mostly involves conversations about each others' love affairs they all sit around a living room area drinking and talking. Then one of them says let's play Dead Mary. Dead Mary? I thought it was 'Bloody Mary'? another replies. So then the storyline is set as one by one they take a candle into the bathroom close the door and lock it turn out the lights and look into the mirror and say aloud...Dead Mary three times.Sometime in the middle of the night one of them becomes possessed and the killings begin. You don't always know who is possessed and who isn't but neither do they. They begin to accuse each other and fight amongst themselves. This goes on throughout the movie as one by one the group becomes smaller and smaller. There is a genuinely creepy feel to the film like I said much like The Evil Dead. The actors are better than expected and play out their roles very nicely.Dead Mary is a horror film worth the rental and possibly worth buying depending on how well you like it. Don't believe all the negative remarks about this film. I think people just didn't pay much attention when no Dead Mary didn't appear in the film and some of them act like they didn't understand that these people were being possessed by Dead Mary. Keep an open mind when viewing this film and pay attention to details. I think you will really appreciate the effort and enjoy this movie for what it is. It's about possession not a ghoulish creature. I give it a 7 out of 10. Give it a shot!".

Her only consolation during the long cold nights is Matthew the American art teacher and second husband of the headmistress Veronica Van Huet. Trouble is half term is looming and Louise cannot bear the thought of being away from her lover for a whole week. So she persuades Veronica to let her remain at school ostensibly to do extra study for her exams. The holiday begins and the vast Victorian building is a spooky shell without the other pupils. Louise and Matthew grab the first opportunity to be together but in their haste expose in every way their intimate relationship. Veronica despite her considerable hurt and anger does not expel Louise from the school as she is acutely aware that her husband is the one truly responsible. She is also keen not to have a row with Matthew as she needs him now more than ever. In a conspiracy with the school's doctor Veronica and ...";

I liked the fact that you never really knew what was happening and even at the end you were still left guessing. I was confused by some of the characters and found their development a little hazy. This was especially so with veronica and imogen who i didn't understand. I also found a few too many twists. I think the best part of the film was Sophia Myles who was very good. The best thing was that I saw Celia Imrie two days after I saw this down Regent St. I don't know why I hadn't heard of this film before its better than most films in the cinema.".

Michael Elphick sadly bloated in his last bigscreen appearance has little to do. The soundtrack is too replete with creepy music the natural sounds of a big old building in the depths of the English countryside could have been used more. There are a few wincemaking genre clichs such as Sophia flinching when a sheet is pulled back and she has to ID a disfigured corpse.

Alas after seeing OUT OF BOUNDS I found myself asking couldn't one of Merlin's other scripts have been more deserving of funding ? Some people haver mentioned that the look of the film is at fault and the whole feel of the movie has that made for television look similar to one of those feature length plays found on ITV during 9pm on a Sunday night . This is certainly true but it's the screenplay that's at fault . The story starts with an art teacher at an all girls school having sex with Louise one of the pupils . It should be pointed that Louise is 18 and well above the age of consent but I couldn't help thinking this doesn't make it all right in anyway and I watched this the same day as a certain Scottish football team revealed that their new coach was someone who spent time in jail for having sex with a 15 year old so sure as heck I wasn't going to empathise with the characters Problem number one I couldn't empathise with the characters but that's not the major problem with the script which lies in its contrived over complicated nature in the last third . Rmember when you saw RETURN OF THE KING in cinemas ? Remember everyone started reaching for their jackets and handbags half an hour before the final credits ? We have a whole series of similar false endings here where you think the mystery has been cleared up then BANG Mr Ward decides an already over cluttered screenplay isn't complicated enough so he adds yet another plot twist which makes the story more and more ridiculous as it trundles along Merlin I hope you make a success of your career but remember one thing  Less is more".

There are only a few characters in the story but every one is being developed well. Thus the characters are believable which gives a film MANY plus points. The ability of the director to tell the story without ever failing to rise the tension and suspection is awesome. While the story's unfolding we never know what we're supposed to believe  we are allowed to make up our own minds. When the next twist comes we'll probably change our opinion again ... and again and all the while we enjoy great entertainment. The high amount of tension etc doesn't leave the film sparse of humour. And even though many will agree that it is not an every day story we don't all go to boarding schools where we have an affair with the married teacher who later disappears and are then hunted by nightmares we totally forget this because everything the characters the script and the acting is very much drawn from real life. All of this makes it a rare film that makes you wonder why it so far hasn't got more recognition!! It is certainly a shame! After watching the film I had my head full of thoughts and was for a long time not able to decide what it was that made the film so appealing to me. I have come to think that it's the perfect combination of everything in the film. And for me what is really standing out are the totally natural actorsactresses and that once in a while I'm again thinking about the film.

Writer Director Merlin Ward's movie debut OUT OF BOUNDS is a genuine beacon of classy Brit storytelling shining brilliantly against the usual slew of boring Brit fare punch drunk on easy come easy spend lottery funds.

Here's a story that delivers classic tension right from the opening titles  and which had me sweating on the edge of my seat till the final terrific twist in the tail  which I genuinely didn't see coming!  The fine performances Ward extracts from his cast is a sharp measure of raw professionalism and his stars Sophie Ward no relation Sophia Myles and understudy national treasure Celia Imrie should be proud to add this outing to their career portfolios.  Stealthily underlying the action composer Mark Ryder's deadly score is an unnerving cardiac backcloth worthy of Hitchcock's chilliest  and a very natural marriage to Ward's taught and frugal direction.In the set up boarding school student Louise Myles pleads with her sexy headmistress Veronica Ward to let her stay on at school during half term ostensibly for extra studies.  But oh dear the seemingly innocent little girl happens to be a regular item with Veronica's hunky American hubby and fellow teacher Matt George Asprey.  So what happens when Veronica finds out? and does Ward's dark and driving script visually live up to the graphic shock horrors that inevitably follow?  For my own part I needed a couple of Lorazepam after what you might call one of Celia Imrie's more interesting scenes!For those lucky enough to see it Sam Raimi's wonderful US movie A SIMPLE PLAN creatively eclipsed the more media bullish but greatly inferior FARGO. In the same way Merlin Ward's OUT OF BOUNDS does just this to all those tired British wannabe thrillers with nothing on board but a fat promotional budget.  Clearly OUT OF BOUNDS is a great Hollywood movie in all but country of origin and if lacking in multimillion pound promotion still has a massive audience in waiting by way of good old fashioned word of mouth.  Press Play and enjoy!Roger Hopkins".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie from time to time flashes across my mind after I discovered the songs of Yves Montand. He sang well and I always want to see whether he acted well.Just my luck that DVD of this title was and is still not easily available in town. Why? It is not a movie for green whippersnappers or precocious imps but the wellaged wise. It was filmed some twenty years ago and I then exactly lacked twenty years' maturity. My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month after having gained twenty more years experience in life now I know how to enjoy this movie. If I saw the movie right after it was freshly produced in 1983 I am very sure I would not understand the main plot or subplot the observant director Claude Sautet not to mention his ideas. After all Yves Montand is now lying six feet under inside the cemetery PreLachaise in Paris and Jacques Villeret Gilbert's head has gone halfbald in the French boxoffice hit Le Dner de cons where he plays the tricked Franois Pignon.The restaurant setting reminds me the frantic and noisy kitchen in Dinner Rush shouting chef cooking heat fire and smell the orderly mess clicking sound of cutlery and crockery conflict between waiters and chef.There are usually many subplots in Sautet's works because he was able to capture human sentiments especially those of ordinary people leading ordinary life well in details and display it with an undertone of melancholy humour even for serious subjects like human alienation one of the ideas showcased in Garon!.Resourceful Alex was once a tap dancer though not very accomplished he seems to be respected in the dancing room. With limited funds and resources this maturing restaurant waiter aspires to start an amusement park on the beach and he makes it! Jerry Maguire is the American version of Alex. Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria from whom he tactfully draws out a freeinterest loan of FFr100000. Besides he is concurrently after Claire an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat.

	onyx:emotionText "The movie from time to time flashes across my mind after I discovered the songs of Yves Montand. He sang well and I always want to see whether he acted well.Just my luck that DVD of this title was and is still not easily available in town. Why? It is not a movie for green whippersnappers or precocious imps but the wellaged wise. It was filmed some twenty years ago and I then exactly lacked twenty years' maturity. My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month after having gained twenty more years experience in life now I know how to enjoy this movie. If I saw the movie right after it was freshly produced in 1983 I am very sure I would not understand the main plot or subplot the observant director Claude Sautet not to mention his ideas. After all Yves Montand is now lying six feet under inside the cemetery PreLachaise in Paris and Jacques Villeret Gilbert's head has gone halfbald in the French boxoffice hit Le Dner de cons where he plays the tricked Franois Pignon.The restaurant setting reminds me the frantic and noisy kitchen in Dinner Rush shouting chef cooking heat fire and smell the orderly mess clicking sound of cutlery and crockery conflict between waiters and chef.There are usually many subplots in Sautet's works because he was able to capture human sentiments especially those of ordinary people leading ordinary life well in details and display it with an undertone of melancholy humour even for serious subjects like human alienation one of the ideas showcased in Garon!.Resourceful Alex was once a tap dancer though not very accomplished he seems to be respected in the dancing room. With limited funds and resources this maturing restaurant waiter aspires to start an amusement park on the beach and he makes it! Jerry Maguire is the American version of Alex. Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria from whom he tactfully draws out a freeinterest loan of FFr100000. Besides he is concurrently after Claire an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat. On top of these two relationships he keeps a punctuated contact with the downandout Coline.On the surface both Jerry and Alex are candies to all. Cruelly and honestly it is Gilbert Alex's roommate and colleague who is sharp at pointing out their common blind spot they are not related to anybody both American Jerry and French Alex only think about themselves. What different is Jerry's ending gives us hope while the final rainy scene of Alex at his wellreceived amusement park tells us what reality tends to be like remaining alone.When Alex is successful with his career his dream park all his women left both Gloria and Claire return to their husbands Coline follows a younger waiter of the restaurant.

After all one gets to meet the same faces at different times. Alex the head waiter has started in show business but now he is in charge of the staff that serve day in day out the patrons that make the place their hang out.Alex has problems in the romantic department. When we meet him he is sharing an apartment with Gilbert a plump waiter who is temporarily separated from his wife. He misses his home terribly but Gilbert cannot make up his mind about how to get back to that life. Alex on the other hand meets and fall in love for Claire a woman that is just ending a painful love affair. It is hard to conceive that Claire and Alex will end up together. After all she is much younger and Alex wants to become independent by turning his seaside property into a sort of amusement park for the summer. Will Alex find happiness at last? Claude Sautet's Garcon is one of the fastest paced comedies we had seen in quite a while. Written by Mr. Sauted and JeanLoup Davadie this joyous film is so fast one is not ready for its end. Mr. Sautet treats the restaurant as a stage play a farce if you will. All the waiters perform a sort of ballet in their comings and goings to and from the kitchen. It gives the audience a chance to see Mr. Sautet's choreography while the servers move around ceaselessly. For the record there is only one mishap involving broken dishes.Yves Montand was a versatile actor who was comfortable in drama as well as in comedy as he shows us here. It is a joy to watch Mr. Montand doing the rounds and staying in character he is the epitome of what a waiter should be. Nicole Garcia is Claire a woman with her own baggage who likes Alex but not enough to make a commitment. Jacques Villeret a comic actor plays the sad Gilbert. Others in the film are Marie Dubois Dominique Laffin Rosy Varte Bernard Fresson among the large cast.The comedy is delightful light and fresh thanks to Mr. Sautet's inspired direction.".

The setting and scenes take away from the points of the movie. The violence appears at times to be violent for violence sake. The plot line is unrealistic especially the scenes relating to the football game. Overall a complete shambles and disappointment. I assume this straight to DVD film is made for an American audience. However i feel if someone wants to watch a football in prison film may i suggest Mean Machine with Vinnie Jones which looks Oscar winning compared to this awful awful film. A great way to fleece the public in a credit crunch riding on the back of its more watchable and enjoyable prequel. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!".

It's like watching idiots fighting a war just because they believe in different religions.

A football game to allow one of the two packs of 3 to be released??? What utter rubbish. Fairytale ending to a nightmare of a film.Avoid at all costs.".

After 45 minutes if I hadnt of turned it off Id have kicked my flat screen in.

My missus loved the original to the point of watching it over and over again. I think she was as shocked as i was just how farcical this was. I had wondered how i'd missed this on the big screen maybe it was DVD release only but only learnt of it yesterday so i hurriedly made my way to our nearest store with a little bit of excitement if i may say so. We did rather well to sit through this to its conclusion and if my Sky HD box wasn't faulty to be serviced tomorrow am it would have gone off at the most 25 minutes in. Save your money. Absolutely abysmal.So to conclude a 310 is actually rather higher than it merits. I gave it a more credible rating due to some fair graphic fisticuffs etc. Otherwise a 110 would have more suitable.".

Nothing though quite prepared me for this sequel as cynical an exercise in film making it would be difficult to imagine apart from Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakwell.Only one original cast member remains and the story is set in a prison which provides the confined space for West Ham and Millwall hooligans doing prison terms to confront each other. It unfolds as a 94 minute cage fight with multiple attacks revenge attacks oneonones firm on firm etc. If it had been packaged as a sort of 18 rated WWF Bout then it would have some reason for existing but it is not and does not.The English prison is clearly an American one with no sense of an English Institution at all so it loses any authenticity as a Prison Film with both British and American audiences. Decent Prison Warder is played by Arthur Mason a fine actor who had a long stay in the British TV Series about the London Fire Service London's Burning. He spends almost the entire film with his mouth agape presumably at the dross which is swirling around him.Actrss Marina Sirtis plays a corrupt Head Warder in a curiously written role the cod script almost demands some raunchy prisoner on screw sex action but it never comes. A mass football match and fight at the end is so formulaic and contrived it is pretty much unwatchable. So not a prison or football hooligan film the market for this is restricted to those who simply enjoy watching people getting beaten up but is devoid of any other merit.".

If there's an impossible air of surrealism in my manner it's entirely down to the on screen events of this ... well I was going to say movie but it's more of a bad dream than a movie STAND YOUR GROUND is supposedly a follow up to GREEN STREET but obviously started off as an original screenplay by T.Jay O'Brien featuring tough gang members from da ghetto meeting up in an American maximum security prison . Some producer somewhere told him to rewrite the story so it'd feature a couple of supporting characters from GREEN STREET . Unfortunately someone forgot to tell director Jesse V Johnson this so we've got a film supposedly set in Britain but filmed in an American prison . I've really got to admire Jesse for getting round this by sticking a couple of goal posts in the prison basketball court and plastering signs saying  ROYAL PRISON SERVICE  NO NOT A YANK JAIL AT ALL GUV  everywhere . Okay he fails but it's a good try The two leads are played by Ross McCall and Graham McTavish and with names like those it's no surprise to learn they're both Scottish . They're playing London geezers and it must have been a challenge for them trying to master the accents because they spend so much time trying to convince us they're not Scots that they forget to do any convincing acting  just limiting themselves to making quaking noises that sound like  FAHK  and  KANT  . We also have ze meerkat from the car insurance adverts voicing one of the human characters called Max and an Australian as governor of the royal prison service Pride of place amongst the cast is that woman from STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION playing a pantomime witch who's unable to say anything without using the F and C words at least twice in every sentence . I never knew American prisons were so cosmopolitan . Amazingly there's even a few NeoNazis nonchalantly standing around showing their swastika tattoos with disgusted looks on their faces giving the impression that they were going to originally star in this movie about a prison war between the Ayran Brotherhood and The Crips set in a tough American Jail No matter how you look at it you can not escape that this was the plot on O'Brien's first draft . The screenwriter seems stumped as to how he can rewrite it and make it cohesive . It's obvious he's crossed out Crips and Brotherhood and replaced it with Millwall and West Ham . He's failed to develop anything and the screenplay is full of padding such as wicked witch female prison guard trying to get an underling to say  Two peas in a pod  . There's also a ridiculous scene where the prison governor decides to give non dangerous prisoners early release and gets two staff members to draw up a potential list . Cut to a long lasting urinating contest where each prison officers says  my list is best  No my list is best  which seems to go on forever  Thankfully the governor is an intellectual and moral giant who knows the only way to judge how rehabilitated a prisoner is if they win a football match . You can understand this way of thinking since Hitler and Stalin were never known to be good footballers while someone like John Terry or Diego Maradona are fine upstanding role models for the rest of humanity STAND YOUR GROUND is certainly one of the worst movies I've seen . . Everything about it is totally deranged  the acting  the writing  especially the dialogue  and the bizarre fact that it's obviously filmed in an American prison . Having said that it's also thoroughly entertaining almost like EASTENDERS mixed with an episode of tough prison drama OZ and whilst the entertainment level is almost certainly unintentional it gets four out of ten".

The characters are very approachable and although it is a bit disappointing that only one Green Street original is in it you find your self feeling pity on some and hating the guts of others. The violence is in abundance but i don't actually feel it is too much. Yes it makes you cringe but film such as SAW contain much more gore than this film.In summary its not a great film lets clear that up but it is equally not as bad as people suggest.

It is a polished and attractively well executed action film the locations look slick and not British at all the cast are handsome and chiseled and cheerfully smart if not intelligent then they are amusingly engaging not the usual traits of the British hooligan in fiction or even nonfiction unless you read the skin head books of the 1970's.

It is one of many scenes that transcended the material in this gritty Bmovie and really made me sit up and take notice believe me I wanted to hate this movie.Massy was a boxer once I believe and his portrayal of this tainted pugilist is outstanding it is also the one moment in the film that touches on the history of the ICF of West Ham and even back to the Viking hooligans kicking severed heads around some of the details are known to only a few but the effect is powerful. No other hooligan movie has got this yet.This film is unlikely to please many critics usually too wrapped up in their own importance to realize that this is diametrically different to anything that has come before. They will be outraged by the positive light thrown onto membership in a football firm they will be in fits of consternation over the handsome looking leads what does this say to our youth are you condoning membership in a firm are you saying it's OK to be a hooligan? I hear them saying if they say anything at all  well it may be and it may not be regardless like the best films it's doesn't judge and for once I watched a film about a subject matter with which I am intimate and it pleased me rightly. I highly recommend it but it's not for your grannie!".

But still there was tons of supporters in the first movie will small parts so you can say its 2 of them. The whole violence in the movie seem pretty real with blood and the fights are not spectacular in the sense of a martial arts movie but they are convincing as real beat downs. And I'm sorry i never been to jail either in America or UK so i can't make a difference between a USA or UK prison... That was my second watching of that movie today first being one year ago before i saw number 1not released in french DVD had to buy the English version and this one right after i saw number 1 and i say i enjoyed the movie as much as the last time. I own the DVD so i will certainly re watch it in the future. This is clearly not a bad movie as the other review try to convince people it is.".

Not much plot wise happens for most of the film accept a crooked prison warden dealing drugs amongst the bad eggs but then out of the blue near the end the film turns into 'Mean Machine' and we get a goodie prisoner v baddie prisoner footie match.Can't really say the match looks good as you don't see much footie from the bad camera work and the fact the prisoners just fight...as usual what a surprise huh. At the end it all wraps up nicely in a bow and really does seem rather pointless despite being an OK film for fighting.Main issue with the film apart from the lack of proper plot is the fact it looks like the prison is in the US! prisoners wear orange jumpsuits and outside they roam around without shirts on showing their big muscles and tattoo's despite the English weather. The weather in fact appears to be very hot and sunny all the time and the prison seems to be set in a very sandy dusty almost desert like area obviously trying for a slick desolate feel with the visuals...or something. Odd seeing as its suppose to be set in an English prison I thought it was in the US at first and was confused.You enjoy watching unfit middle aged blokes kicking the hell out of each other in meaningless scraps? watch on.

The plain little Irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done compete in The Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse The Pirate. It all made me want to ride horses which I have done now for 7 yearsand learn everything I could about their breeds so I could also draw and paint them. It's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds overcoming your fears believing in yourself and reaching difficult goals by working very hard. Also the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and I have seen many movies with horse races. I never get tired of watching this movie. Everything about it is perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the enduring classics from MGM came out in the closing years of World War II it's the film that made young Elizabeth Taylor a star. She had done a few films as a child actress before National Velvet but when it came out her place in the movies was assured. Ironically enough biologically she'd be growing up fast enough after National Velvet was out and her next struggle as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little Velvet Brown who loved her jumping horse.I'm not sure of how this would work because steeplechase horses have to have confirmed bloodlines and the Pi's are a subject not dealt with in National Velvet. All we know is that he's a reckless and untrainable horse in the hands of Reginald Owen and after he breaks free and causes considerable damage Owen gets rid of him for a nominal price to the local butcher Donald Crisp.At the same time as these things are happening Mickey Rooney comes wandering into the lives of the Brown family which consists of Crisp wife Anne Revere and daughters Angela Lansbury Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor and their little brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who's now on the open road and heading for the Brown family where his father was once a horse trainer for Anne Revere's family. It's he who sees the potential of the Pi short for pirate as a steeplechase jumper and it's Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to pass up this chance.Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in National Velvet. The Good Book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare. She infuses Rooney with it to have faith in the heart and ability of the Pi and to leave a little over for himself.Anne Revere won a Best Supporting Actress Award for National Velvet. She's a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience doesn't suspect. It turns out that back in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming the English Channel and her prize money saved all these years she gives to her daughter. That scene is probably what won her the Oscar. National Velvet also won one other Academy Award for Film Editing.Over 60 years after it made its debut National Velvet as a family classic hasn't lost a thing. Its depiction of life between the World Wars in Great Britain is still a standout. And National Velvet launched a movie legend. Can't do much better than that for high regard.".

Warm wet tears will run down your cheeks. Warm happy feelings will make you stand up and cheer as if the posse were galloping to the rescue but most of all you will feel good  it will happen often while viewing National Velvet. See the video many times  cry and use a handkerchief remember that piece of cloth mom tucked into your shirt pocket  jump up from the sofa and cheer and FEEL GOOD again  and again.National Velvet was initially released in 1944 but I must have seen a rerelease soon thereafter  because I know that I was in grade school at the time. I did not see it again until I bought the DVD for my mother recently. And if asked what the movie was about during that interim period of more than fifty years I would have answered  it's about a horse. That's a boy's initial and lasting impression.Animal lovers I'm sorry but National Velvet is not a horsey movie and never has been the film is really about the preteen innocence and enthusiasm of Velvet Brown Elizabeth Taylor. No animal  not the film's sorrel gelding nor Charlie my yellow labrador  can compete with the budding beauty of Elizabeth Taylor for the camera's attention. But stay focused on Velvet's three interwoven relationships  with Mi Taylor Mickey Rooney with her mother Anne Revere best supporting actress Academy Award and the horse Pirate Pi. What characterizes winsome Velvet in these attachments is a 12year old's single mindedness of commitment and trust together with her unwaivering loyalty  admirable qualities also of Ms. Taylor in real life. Mi whose father mentored Mrs. Brown is a young itinerant from less fortunate circumstances with a working knowledge of jumping horses. Mrs. Brown ever mindful of her own growing experiences is especially supportive of both her daughter and Mi. The spirited Pi is difficult handling for its owner and the horse soon becomes a project for Mi and Velvet.Angela Lansbury Velvet's older sister Edwina aka TV's Jessica Fletcher fifty years later Jackie Jenkins the young brother and particularly Donald Crisp Mr. Brown Velvet's father and village butcher provide able and entertaining support roles. National Velvet received five Academy nominations winning two.Set in the 1920's English coastal village of Sewels and its green pasturelands on location in Carmel California Enid Bagnold's book 1933and the film 1944 tell us a lot about the moral and social structure of small villages and our small towns too. One meaningful scene shows Mrs. Brown stowing money in a kitchen pot on her pantry shelf while Mi spies from the window  we are wary of what he might do next. Villagers could be suspicious of strangers but they also extended trust believing in a person's goodness. Front doors were left open  grandparents will tell of neighbors regularly walking into an empty house through the unlatched screen to borrow a cup of sugar from the same cupboard where family monies were stored my mother kept petty cash in an unused sugar bowl. Honesty was important but entrusting friends and neighbors was equally valued. That unlatched screen with open front door was a symbol of our neighborliness and trust and a more meaningful symbol of the times we lived in  and yes maybe it said something about our innocence too.".

Mi whose father mentored Mrs. Brown is a young itinerant from less fortunate circumstances with a working knowledge of jumping horses. Mrs. Brown ever mindful of her own growing experiences is especially supportive of both her daughter and Mi. The spirited Pi is difficult handling for its owner and the horse soon becomes a project for Mi and Velvet.Angela Lansbury Velvet's older sister Edwina aka TV's Jessica Fletcher fifty years later Jackie Jenkins the young brother and particularly Donald Crisp Mr. Brown Velvet's father and village butcher provide able and entertaining support roles. National Velvet received five Academy nominations winning two.Set in the 1920's English coastal village of Sewels and its green pasturelands on location in Carmel California Enid Bagnold's book 1933and the film 1944 tell us a lot about the moral and social structure of small villages and our small towns too. One meaningful scene shows Mrs. Brown stowing money in a kitchen pot on her pantry shelf while Mi spies from the window  we are wary of what he might do next. Villagers could be suspicious of strangers but they also extended trust believing in a person's goodness. Front doors were left open  grandparents will tell of neighbors regularly walking into an empty house through the unlatched screen to borrow a cup of sugar from the same cupboard where family monies were stored my mother kept petty cash in an unused sugar bowl. Honesty was important but entrusting friends and neighbors was equally valued. That unlatched screen with open front door was a symbol of our neighborliness and trust and a more meaningful symbol of the times we lived in  and yes maybe it said something about our innocence too.";

	schema:reviewBody "My daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in...but I want to add a few words. National Velvet' was one of my two favorite movies as a child. The other being 'The Wizard of Oz. The cinematography the acting the script and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes. Based on a book by Enid Bagnold the script followed the book quite well. The characters are so thoughtfully created. It's easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little Irish village in which they live. The premise...complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world...is awe inspiring to any young person especially a young girl in the 40's...a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone athletes. You would have to be terribly hardboiled not to appreciate it's merit. But the perspective I cherished most about this movie is the unabridged innocence in it's moral message.. It's almost magical how 'mom and apple pie' the movies were back then. I was really taken aback by the IMDB reviewer who asked...'Was the world ever really this trusting?' and then proceeded to chastize the director for his complacency regarding unchaperoned' overnight travel involving the two main characters. My answer to his question is an unequivocal YES!!!! The movie going world was that trusting in the 40's.My grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released. Then my mother took me to see it when I was young and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape. Now we have it on DVD. It's been a family favorite for generations albeit generations of horse lovers. It was never about sex...it's about coming of age! It's about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals. Also so old fashioned it wasn't even about the prize money! It's about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to be the best'. And yes the director was indeed concerned with Elizabeth Taylor's lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about Velvet Brown Liz Taylor's character having to cut her hair and bind her chest so that she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the Grand National Steeplechase. This was a guys only sport back then...I think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race. It's almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the Lolita thing about this particular movie...besides anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail.And now for a great bit of trivia...the stunt riding was performed by the now famous Horse Whisperer' Monty Roberts. I believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits.I give this movie a 10 out of 10! I never get tired of watching it again.".

Good ethics of Velvet's parents particularly her mother is something to take into account. Our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose.

This was my first look at her and she reminded me of Irene Dunne's character in I Remember Mama. Both women characters  mothers  are strongwilled loving and seemingly right about everything.Meanwhile Mickey Rooney and Donald Crisp both play interesting characters too and I like the fact that the movie didn't end with the climactic horse race which is usually the case in horse racing films.

	schema:reviewBody "Death Warrant 1990 is noholdsbarredaction classic another prison style Van Damme movie. It is my fourth favorite best underrated Van Damme movie. This movie is really underrated but it is one of my best favorite prison style movies. Also my favorite childhood movie that I still watch today like other Van Damme action movies I do. The action fighting sequences are awesome. Sylvester Stallone made an action Drama movie Lock Up in 1989 and JeanClaude Van Damme made Death Warrant a year later in 1990. Directed by Deran Sarafian and written by a David S. Goyer who at the time was a college student and it was his first script. Cynthia Gibb is awesome as co star alongside Van Damme. The movie is awesome another adrenaline action packed movie I also love the music score Bring Me a Dream by Craig Thomas which I am still listening today.Bring me a dream Burke.This movie to me is a kicksass Patrick Kilpatrick as The Sandman was a bad ass villain on screen I have ever seen. This movie is also a horror film and get's scary when you see the prison place and the murders of the doctor and the prison inmates inside those cells. When prisoners brake loose was really scary. I love loved the prison movies about prison inmates it was one the reason why I love Prison Break 2005 and why it become my favorite TV Show! This movie is a kick ass and it will always be forever my favorite Van Damme movie that I love it to death!  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson Bloodfist and David Bradley American Ninja 3 the action stars from the 80's and 90's both ripped off Van Damme movies! Like Bloodfist 1 ripped off the story from Bloodsport Bloodfist 2 ripped off the story from Kickboxer and Bloodfist 3 ripped off the story from Death Warrant! And Don Wilson was praising him self that he could beat Van Damme to a pulp?! I don't think so! David Bradley's Hard Justice 1995 ripped off the story from John Woo's Hard Boiled even the title they stole Bloodfist III Forced to Fight and Death Warrant! That movie copied and stole everything from those three movies. That is the thing I had a problems in the 90's they could have been all creative and not copy someone else's movies work! Even Jerry Trimble  Live by the Fist 1993 ripped off Bloodfist III Forced to Fight. I know they were all different movies but they copied and ripped off the story from Death Warrant geesh! I want to point this out! That's fine by me if you read my review and you don't agree but that is me.Attila from Lionheart and Sandman in here Death Warrant fights comes very close. The movie is filled with action and the inside of the prisons is great. The cells are also great. This is the first time JeanClaude Van Damme played a Canadian the second time he played a Canadian was in Sudden Death 1995. I always enjoyed Death warrant and like I mentioned before it is my fourth favorite best Van Damme Movie. The other three are Hard Target Bloodsport and Universal Soldier than is Death Warrant. It's part of that first generation of JCVD films Bloodsport Cyborg Kickboxer Death Warrant and Double Impact before the biggest budget film he was part of Universal Soldier. I love JeanClaude Van Damme and I am a big fan of him. I grew up watching his old movies and other kids including me grew up too watching his movies. Bolo Yeung Michel Qissi Abdel Qissi and Patrick Kilpatrick where great villains in Van Damme movies. Cynthia Gibb was also awesome she played in Youngblood 1986 in the 80's another my favorite all time sports film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1980s were a guiltless time. Rock music was hard meaningless and not subtle with its innuendo. The same can be said about 80s action movies. The 80s Action movie had to be classic good guybad guy because all action movies should be like that. The 80s action movie had to have some babe in it and though it was meant to attract female viewers to a movie the result was nothing more than a sex object for men. The 80s action movie had to have an absurd amount of killing and testosterone. 90s and 00s action movies are the same but they are riddled with guilt. They try to have a good guybad guy mix but the good guy is not entirely good and the bad guy is not entirely bad. They try to incorporate deep love interests but fail miserably...at least 80s action movies didn't really try in that department. Lastly they don't have good action anymore. Everything is computer and shaky camera during fight scenes. Where is the good old fashioned pile of dead extras? 80s action movies are guiltless and treat themselves like revenge fantasy epics while modern action movies try to be deep. Just like 80s rockers they did not try to be deep while modern alternative music's attempt at deepness and subtleness fails to invoke any real intelligent thought. 80s music movies presidents were not deep in meaning...everything was a MTV sound bite a rude in your face unashamed whatever it was. It did not pretend to be something different.Death Warrant like the band Firehouse was the last breath of the 80s burning out in the 90s. It has 80s music 80s clothes and most importantly the 80s mentality. The story revolves around a bad ass shallow as a puddle cop in Van Damme. He quickly defeats Kilpatrick Naylor Sandman by firing 400 bullets at him and gets thrusted into the average American prisona cesspool of political corruption racial tension violence and sodomy. The movie is rather guiltless at all of these aspects of America's prisons making stunningly deep observations. The politician justifies harvesting prisoner's organs because they're all scuma reflection of real policy. When Burke Van Damme enters the black part of the prison the music gets stereotypically black with its bass guiltless 80s mentality and the warden's comment I know that you are hereWhy? I can smell the nbomb is a reflection upon the racism. As a prison movie violence and sodomy don't need to be explained. Of course the movie is all ridiculous hyperbole but it is so extreme yet at a strange level true it makes the bad ass action movie extremely comical as well.The movie has many ridiculous elements added on purpose for the sake of guiltless badassness and hilarity. Everyone in this prison is part of a gang has access to drugs cell phones weaponspeople leave their cells at will..the Priest a prisoner seems to be more powerful than the Governor of California let alone the warden of the prison. The Sandman is stronger than Goliath and refuses to die until he ironically dies like every other prisoner who died as part of the organ ring conspiracya spike in the back of the head. Lastly the Sandman after taunting Burke lets him wallow a little longer. Sure the Sandman could had killed him right there but instead he says something incredibly deep instead Bring me a dream Burke bring me a dream This has nothing to do with the plot. It is an inside joke a little jab at the song named Mister Sandman which the first lines of the song are Mister Sandman Bring Me a Dream. The movie ends as all movies should end. The hero gets the babe mends racial boundaries gets the ultimate honor of Prison Respect where every convict will move out of your way and sing your praises like He just dusted the Sandman and You got it homes and ends with a kick ass 80s sounding rock ballad called Bring Me A Dreamanother inside joke. I wrote an email to the composer of the song and he sent me the MP3 of it because I got the joke. Very cool.I rate this movie 8 out of ten in not a light fashion. I have watched a lot of movies and only a handful are 8 and up. This movie is that good for its genre and its ultimate entertainment value. It is smart incredibly stupid subtle but blatant at the same time. It is an 80s movie masterpiece and is up there with some of the best movies of all time.".

The final fight had all the ingrediants for the usual Van Climax Swift brutal kicks to the face and an action hero trademark an impaling.If you watch enough Seagal Norris and Van Damme flicks you realize it's all the same but who cares it's another 90 minute action movie with mediocre writing and directing!

He's a pretty good actor as well which is evident when you compare Chuck Norris' movies from the same era.Although the movie is more than 20 years old it doesn't look dated. The movie is also not a mindless martial arts movie either. It has some good story behind it. Even compared to Lionheart made the same year this movie is way ahead in terms of quality.Amanda Gibbs is gorgeous in this movie. Too bad that we didn't get to see her during the '90s asides from this movie.Seriously this is one of the best JCVD movie made and is recommended for viewing even if you're NOT a JCVD fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is a death warrant? you may ask. I'm not too sure myself. I assume it must like an arrest warrant but instead of arresting the target of the warrant Van Damme gets to kill them. Pretty simple really. I mean if JeanClaude was only intending to ARREST the antagonists it would be a pretty boring movie right? Van Damme plays Louis Burke a Canadian Mountie who never wears the proper Mountie uniform which is a damn shame because those Mountie hats are cool. Burke is on assignment in Los Angeles tracking down a villain known as the Sandman bulletproof serialkiller extraordinaire. After taking down The Sandman in the first few minutes Burke is given another assignment The inmates of the local maximumsecurity prison have developed a nasty habit of being killed by icepick to the head. Burke's assignment is to go undercover naturally and find out where all these icepicks are coming from and who is behind it. Is it a prisongang war or a massive conspiracy involving corrupt officials and mad scientists? Have a guess.Naturally one would assume that a Van Damme movie  set in a prison  called 'Death Warrant' would be action packed. Unfortunately 'Death Warrant' much like 'Legionnaire' proves that not all Van Damme movies are excuses for a showcase of spinkicks. It is a shame that 'Death Warrant' is not as action packed as I would like it to be. There are some cool fights but it is a fairly slow movie and the less said about the scenes involving a character called Priest Abdul Salaam El Razzac the better. Priest is a weird weird fellow. I'm pretty sure he is really some sort of alien replicon from the beyond the moon...Now I'm trying to judge 'Death Warrant' harshly I really am. There just isn't enough action but I just can't speak ill of any movie that was made in the 80s is about the 80s or features music and fashion from the 80s. In this case 'Death Warrant' has 80s music AND a mad scientist. Both big bonuses in any movie's favour. Granted the mad scientist's screen time is almost negligible but the presence of a mad scientist makes the coolness metre of any movie shoot straight up.Sure 'Death Warrant' may be slow lack action and feature a lot of Van Damme acting rather than fighting but it is entertaining enough what with the 80s music and all but it is only for Van Damme fans  610".

With the help of some local convicts that he befriended in the prison including Hawkins Robert GuillaumeBurke begins to find out that whats happening is being conducted by the very people who placed him there DA Tom Vogler and head of prisons Ben Keane George Dickerson  Jack Bannon. Voler  Keane are working together with the head of the prison guards and the prison doctor Sgt. DeGraf  Dr. Gottesman Art Laflevr  Arimin Shierman in killing healthy and nonaddicted to either drugs or alcohol prisoners. These murders are being done in order to take out their vital organs and then sell them on the open market to the highest bidder! In fact DA Voglar has gotten Dr. Gottesman to get him a healthy liver from one of the murdered prisoners for his sick wife Helen Dorothy Dells without even her knowing about it. Burke had been set up by the corrupt state administrators to show the higher ups in the government that they were doing all that they could to find out about the murders there. When Burke started to find out the real reason for them the dead prisoners he was to be terminated before he could expose Volgar  Co. and their illegal human organ racket.The action in the film was as good and as exciting as you could ever want in a movie like Death Warrent with Van Damme in top form taking out the bad guys with his fists and feet in a number of gut crunching fight sequences. Being a marked man with his identity as an undercover policeman exposed by the prison officials themselves it's a wonder why those in authority not involved in this organ racket didn't come to Bruke's rescue earlier then they did. Bruke's outside contact Amanda was doing everything to alert them but they seemed to be either out to lunch or on vacation. Thrilling final with Burke having it out with the almost indestructible Sandman giving him a hot foot as well as a one way trip to Blazeville with the prisoners forgetting about Burke's police identity giving him a standing ovation at the end of the film. P.S Despite two major inconsistence. 1.Why the noncorrupt government authorities were so late in sending state troopers and national guardsmen to Harrison State Prison in order to rescue fellow police officer Louis Burke from hundreds angry and homicidal convicts. 2. The fact that The Sandman seemed to have come back to life at the end movie after he was obviously killed by Burke with a hail of bullets when the movie started.

I mean I can't remember ever hearing a cowboy talk like him.Jean was even accompanied by good actors for once including Cynthia Gibb Robert Guillaume and of course Patrick Kilpatrick. If you haven't seen this film especially if your a Van Damme fan please give it a try you won't be disappointed.

I am talking about high kicks jump kicks face punches and people getting lit by fire. This was filmed during Van Damme's glory years with such classics as Kickboxer Bloodsport and Universal Soldier MY personal Favorite. Death Warrant is Top Tier Van Damme and he knows it. He has that early cockiness about him that he seems to lose as he gets older and his films steadily get worse and worse and eventually he only makes straight to video type films. Interesting tidbit Death warrant was written by David Goyer who has also written Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy for those starving Batman fans who need more. This film is dark and gritty but still has that 90s flare which I think brings a nice balance to the movie. If you are in the mood for some Van Damme Spilt kicks and don't want to think to hard then this is the film for you.You can get more info by visiting my Youtube Channel Logan Toxic or by visiting my page at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vSIsfVfAAtU".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Warrant should do just fine when film fans need their action fix. It's a pretty entertaining JeanClaude Van Damme vehicle with a solid pace assorted brutality and enjoyably heinous villains. Written by David S. Goyer and directed by Deran Sarafian it stars JCVD as Louis Burke a Royal Canadian Mountie from Quebec thus explaining his accent this time around who is recruited to work undercover in the L.A. prison system. Posing as a prisoner his job is to find out who has been offing various inmates. The real trouble begins when an old nemesis of his a serial killer dubbed The Sandman Patrick Kilpatrick is transferred to the same prison as Louis. All in all this movie is a good deal of fun even if forgettable in the end it's slickly made with JCVD in fine form and kicking lots of ass as per usual. It benefits from a strong supporting cast beginning with Robert Benson Guillaume as Hawkins a oneeyed veteran prisoner who provides Burke with valuable assistance. The bad guys are an entertaining bunch from brutal head guard DeGraf Art LaFleur to the hilarious Sandman a swaggering psycho often to be seen with a smile on his face. He also proves to be very hard to kill! Joshua Miller Near Dark is a geeky genius computer hacker Armin Shimerman 'Star Trek Deep Space Nine' a nefarious prison doctor Conrad Dunn Psycho from Stripes the solicitous Konefke and the extremely striking Abdul Salaam El Razzac plays enigmatic prisoner Priest. The pretty Cynthia Gibb is adequate as the major female presence and requisite love interest. The instantly recognizable Al Leong has one of his standard henchmen parts and Larry Hankin himself no stranger to prison pictures having done Escape from Alcatraz appears unbilled as Myerson. Russell Carpenter does the frequently moody cinematography and plenty of atmosphere is guaranteed due to the prison setting the opening sequence with Burke searching for The Sandman is likewise full of menace. The final quarter hour or so with Burke and The Sandman facing off is exciting and a total hoot as The Sandman keeps coming back for more. Fans of the star and the genre should be quite amused overall and at just under an hour and a half the movie does not overstay its welcome. Seven out of 10.".

Still the overthetop knuckle cracking sequences were excitingly welldone especially when Van Damme goes up against his nemesis a maniac performance by Robert Kilpatrick as the dangerous Christian The Sandman Taylor. When the two come to blows after the first being landed by a large spanner hell erupts. Kilpatrick's character might no have much to do with the central plot but his rousing inclusion the atmospheric first encounter in the prison was a memorable one. Van Damme goes about trying to make friends with the inmates but instead sticks out like a sore thumb by finding himself in glaring competitions asking numerous questions using his mopping skills on unexpected victims and he can't seem to hang around with his own kind. From this he catches the eyes of the prison guards. Art LaFleur stands out as the rockhard prison Sergeant. Robert Guillaume is good as a grizzled inmate and Cynthia Gibb as an outside contact. Also showing up in smaller parts are George Dickerson Abdul Salaam El Razzac Joshua John Miller and Armen Shimerman. The simplistic plot is a routine genre piece which opens up a can of worms involving a secret conspiracy although a predictable structural development unfolds with some uncanny acts. While it might be clichd with its characters circumstances and anxiety things not entirely going to plan director Deran Sarafian's tidy handling crafted some tough suspense and simmering visuals from its sordidly dark and testosterone laced surroundings. Sarafian has gone on to much bigger things. A commendably taut Van Damme action drama vehicle blast.Here no evil see no evil.".

Van Damme is a Canadian cop who goes undercover in LA to find out what is going on in a prison. He is made for this type of role as he will have plenty of opportunity to display his considerable martial arts skills.He isn't in prison long before he ticks of the Hispanic gangs and has to continually fight to stay alive.Cynthia Gibb provides the essential babe in these flicks even if she wasn't completely satisfying. And when does a prisoner in the hole get out for conjugal rights? I always enjoy Robert Guillaume and he didn't disappoint.

Van Damme is a Canadian cop who goes undercover in LA to find out what is going on in a prison. He is made for this type of role as he will have plenty of opportunity to display his considerable martial arts skills.He isn't in prison long before he ticks of the Hispanic gangs and has to continually fight to stay alive.Cynthia Gibb provides the essential babe in these flicks even if she wasn't completely satisfying. And when does a prisoner in the hole get out for conjugal rights? I always enjoy Robert Guillaume and he didn't disappoint. Patrick Kilpatrick made a formidable foe and the final bout was well worth the time spent getting there.A guilty pleasure but a pleasure nonetheless.";

It's not like really any of his other films it's very dark and gloomy but still has some great fights in it.the story is something about human organs being harvested by the prison and Van Damme goes in there undercover to find out what in the hell is going on.About halfway through the film'the sandman' becomes an inmate and before you know it he tells everyone that Van Damme is a cop and probably the fact that he is from Belgium too.This is when the action really begins but not in very large amounts. Van Damme is very broody and mumbles a lot through the film there are good cops bad guards cross dressing prisoners and red herrings galore.It's not the best film he has made but it's far from the worst.If you are a fan of Van Damme it's well worth seeing. He does his trademark roundhouse kick a few times and the fight at the end has the good old editing that makes Van Damme look like he kicks the bloke twenty times when really he does it once.very dark at times narrative could be better bit it's a cannon film so it's ultimately a guilty pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Caught this film at the Toronto Film Fest a couple days ago. Bjork was a no show however her husband  the directoractorwriter of the film Matthew Barney was in attendance. Barney very shy and reserved spoke about the origins of the Drawing Restraint films but only seemed to confuse the audience the more he spoke. He ended up explaining that in order to expandsucceed that something had to be in resistance. His final words told us that every time he didn't know what to do artistically he would always create a new Drawing Restraint film. However he announced that Drawing Restraint 9 became more of a narrative than just images. The Toronto Film Festival Representative told us that this was the best loveromance movie that had played since the festival began earlier that week. The film starts with someone giftwrapping a fossil. Like most of the film it is drawn out and some may find it boring. Although if you are patient and enjoy beautiful imagesBarney and musicBjork you'll be happy. We move on to the construction of a ramp that extends into the ocean. Following we watch strange breathing pearl divers that are dressed in all white. The Guests Bjork and Matthew Barney travel separate to the whaling vessel on two different smaller ships. Bjork arrives first to the vessel and is bathed in a very interesting and creative scene that includes strategically placed oranges. Matthew arrives a bit later and is shaved. Their rituals continue as they are prepped for I'm assuming some type of union. They wear elaborate mammal costumes that reflect the Japanese environment they're in. Bjork has such a headpiece on that I am surprised her neck didn't break while filming. The special effects of the film seem to blow Hollywood big budget movies out of the water. From the titles to the Panic Roomlike dolly through the kitchen through the keyhole shots to the globs of blood that dance in the water near the end the effects are seamless and amazing. By the way for Bjork fans the blood in the water reminded me of the Lynn Fox video for Nature is Ancient. More for Bjork Fans. Drawing Restraint 9 is nothing like Dancer In The Dark. Shot on 35 mm the color is magical and contrasts against many of the backgrounds within the film. Bjork speaks only a few words within the film and it sounds like her native language. And it doesn't leave you depressed for three weeks like Dancer does. Like I said before the film is long and drawn out at times. But stick with it. The end is a huge pay off for anyone that enjoys a cryptic and extremely gory ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I went to the movies saw Drawing Restraint 9 a new film by Matthew Barney and featuring Bjork. I don't go to a lot of movies but when I left this one I was convinced that I had not gone to a movie at all but participated in an ancient magical rite having nothing to so with modern movie making.While definitely not a Hollywood feature it was nevertheless described in the usual hyperbole put out by the theatrical machine conglomerates Mesmerizing Viewing Amazingly Beautiful Startling Wit and Invention. Of course it was all of the above but what I saw and experienced in the movie theater was something more than that something else altogether the telling without words and reconstruction of an ancient primeval theater that can only be entered by instinct and nonhuman intelligence.Most of the action takes place aboard ship. On board a Japanese whaling vessel two occidental guests Barney and Bjork are invited aboard to share in a formal tea ceremony with the captain. First they are dressed in elaborate wedding clothes inspired by Shinto marriage rites because after the ceremony they will emerge themselves in a kiss that not only unites the two in a limited matrimony but also reunites them with the greater sea.I'm not even sure if this was a movie perhaps it was an actual documentary constructed around the performance of some long forgotten ancient religious ritual being remembered just now with the help of modern awareness that media affords like the telescope aided Galileo in redefining the heavens. Yet I do not think the hundreds of extras were privy to any of this.And I should make it clear that the extras weren't really extras at all  they were the actual crew members who live aboard ship. What Barney and Bjork have done in my estimation was commandeered the ship and held the captain and crew hostage  with their permission of course while pretending to star in a movie  and then initiated the ancient rites recently remembered by the Icelandic Bjork.But of course the millions of dollars that this all must have cost would've produced one hell of a Hollywood blockbuster! Yet for Bjork and Barney it is an extremely limited engagement that will disappear within a week of its showing. For them the rewards will have been recognized instantly not in box office dollars but in a newer awareness that an old universe continually demands of its inhabitants.The soundtrack is made of songs chants and primeval sounds dispersed throughout the movie which on another level act as incantations spoken directly to Nature to reverse the direction of Art specifically the Art of the Whaling Ship. This is hinted at when Bjork and Barney go through an amazing transformation at the close of the film transforming themselves into whales complete with blowholes and return to the sea from which we were all plucked in our infancy.Further indication that this movie is really a magical rite in which we are all invited to take part is the captain's short telling of the history of the ship how it suffered a slight scar at sea being rammed by another ship a scar which is now etched on the memory of the crew. But there is a much older story within the deeper scar. The captain and his occidental guests tell that story to us through the traditional Japanese tea ceremony wherein they drink of a mixture infused from of the magnificent ambergris that was once passed through the whale and the subsequent marriage vows by which the guests cut away superfluous limbs and prepare themselves for their voyage back to the sea where ceremony once again takes on the fluidity of life.There are additional insights from Bjork's sparsely sung sound track. Utilizing the essential sounds from the ocean and the life in around and aboard the ship she whispers in places the ancient formula of creation From the moment of commitment Nature conspires to help us. It is the old Christian aphorism All things are provided when we first seek the Kingdom of Heaven. Or Hell if you prefer.In truth I believe this movie was conceived as ritual performed by devout and honest people who were not acting only accentuating and theatricalizing their normal activities but ultimately redirecting the energies of nature towards the ending of a cruel and unusual punishment still being practiced on one of the great and magnificent life forms that welcomed us aboard in the first place.Possibly tedious at some points I thought it was equally wonderful that Bjork and Matthew and the Captain and crew had so much leisure to be able to tell the story to act in this way to live for weeks or months on the ship and its legacy. But then I'm a full time artist who has no idea what time it is.What was happening on the screen was only a key meant to unlock what has always been happening within us within the deeper scar from which we all are naturally and continually emerging our being.Warning Don't go see this movie with an audience who expected to go see a movie. Buy the DVD instead and follow the instructions safely inside the privacy of your own home.".

And to have witnessed it even if it is bastardized from it's Japanese roots is a fortunate event. I'll attempt to write the plot as I saw it. Barney and Bjork were invited onto the whaling vessel as guests. They begin their journey by transforming into sea spirits through several elaborate and beautiful however long and confusing ceremonies and rites of passages . This all happens while the whaling crew perform their duties on the symbolic whale. In the end the journey takes a gruesome turn and the transformation is complete. This is by no means an easy movie to sit through be forewarned. However I believe the value is in your furthered exploration into the subject of Japanese culture ritual and mythology. Be sure to check out the exhibit at your local museum if it comes to your town. It is absolutely amazing to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can appreciate what Barney is trying to achieve but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house I couldn't help but think...when is this gonna end? A very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. I had only seen a part of Cremaster 3 on DVD and thought I knew what to expect. That said experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments. There are a couple of beautifulhorrible images...including the title sequence no kidding but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning then you are in for a long snoozeinducing ride. I managed to stay awake for the whole thing if that's a compliment but more often than not I was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative...big mistake. Among the collection of images are a very ornate giftwrapping ceremony the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it and the mutual evisceration of Bjork and director Matthew Barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion followed by their transformation into whalelike creatures. The soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying...sometimes even maddening. At one time there is a song being sung by Bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us and at other times there is just a constant droning of a highpitched instrument which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie. If this sounds like it doesn't make sense that is because is DOESN'T! If this sounds like your cup of tea then you will absolutely LOVE it! If this sounds like something that you probably won't like then stay far away from it because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening I attended. This is the very definition of an art film. You get from it what you take from it.

	onyx:emotionText "I can appreciate what Barney is trying to achieve but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house I couldn't help but think...when is this gonna end? A very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. I had only seen a part of Cremaster 3 on DVD and thought I knew what to expect. That said experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments. There are a couple of beautifulhorrible images...including the title sequence no kidding but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning then you are in for a long snoozeinducing ride. I managed to stay awake for the whole thing if that's a compliment but more often than not I was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative...big mistake. Among the collection of images are a very ornate giftwrapping ceremony the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it and the mutual evisceration of Bjork and director Matthew Barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion followed by their transformation into whalelike creatures. The soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying...sometimes even maddening. At one time there is a song being sung by Bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us and at other times there is just a constant droning of a highpitched instrument which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie. If this sounds like it doesn't make sense that is because is DOESN'T! If this sounds like your cup of tea then you will absolutely LOVE it! If this sounds like something that you probably won't like then stay far away from it because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening I attended. This is the very definition of an art film. You get from it what you take from it. But otherwise there really isn't much there other than a few oddities and constant construction and deconstruction rituals.

Yet the evolution of Drawing Restraint 9 is spiritual not formal. DR9 in fact is a complete repudiation of the noxious Ayn Randstinking cosmology of the Cremaster films. Freud has been replaced by Jung and Hegel by Kierkegaard. This is a Barney film that could bring you to tears. Any doubts about whether he's an artist or fraud are laid to rest by this film  frauds do not grow they just keep along the same path. I had my doubts about the Cremaster films  except for Cremaster 2 still the most uncanny piece on Barney's resume  The first hour and a half of Drawing Restraint 9 had me squirming sure that Barney was unmasking himself as a joke once and for all. All of Barney's faults are on display  the crude appropriation and dim understanding of other cultures and myths the glossy yet flat cinematography that would only look stylish to a reader of Vogue the hunch that the only movie he's ever seen is The Shining and a generally unfocused feeling as if he's casting around for meaning that isn't there. And then of course there are those endless shots of men doing their work building a better future creating that obelisk to the sky! Except here the bumbleheaded Hegelian philosophy of historyinaction was even more boring because of the documentary trappings. Instead of showing a legless woman strap on a blade and chop potatoes a metaphor for a halfcompleted action we see real men doing real jobs. Only occasionally Barney has them producing one of his symbols or sticks a blue feathered afro on top of a tanker so that we know these seemingly mundane tasks will eventually have vaguely triumphant Wagnerian results. Then suddenly  if you can speak of suddenness in a film like this and I think you can  the Japanese men start loading a harpoon gun and firing nasty spikes at nasty speeds into the sea. And you realize that what you took to be another Barney paean to progress has crumbled. We are now sailing in deep hippie waters my friend. And the sailing is good. Barney and Bjork retire to a tatamimatted cabin and the film begins to go places the Cremaster films would never dare. The cinematographer suddenly discovers shadow and graintexture. Bjork's uninspired score becomes hypnotic. A feeling of death doubt and failure creeps into the film as a Japanese sage tells a story of a primal scar made by the collision of two ships while Barney and Bjork are posed with the edge of a whale statue separating them. The personal the political the spiritual and the mythical start to engage in supercollision.The film seems to have been conceived as an exercise in humility repentance for the colossal egotism of the Cremaster films. Barney takes pains to highlight his new bald spot making him look like a tonsured monk there is a nude scene which proves he is no Vincent Gallo and  most memorably  Barney speaks! As a studly silent mannequin in the Cremaster films he had mystery but here he lets you in on the dirty little secret He has the geekiest voice in history almost like how a castrato would talk in daily conversation. Listen closer however and he sounds almost angelic... This new humility which may have roots in marriage troubles or encroaching baldness  the root of insight is often just this shallow  justifies the Asiatic trappings. But Barney is hiding his real light under a bushel. It is a Western religion that truly moves him these days. There are a trinity  hint hint  of symbols consisting of whale ambergris pomegranate seeds and shrimp whose meaning I won't spoil for you. Except to say that Barney is calling you a shrimp. And asking you to be a whale. The restraint of the title starts to feel a whole lot more like renunciation and the inner joys it brings.Life is fair after all It costs ten dollars for a ticket to DR9 and unless you're a zombie you will get more pleasure and consolation from this film than any billionaire computerpeddler could get out of one of Barney's vaseline tubs.".

Think 'film' as in the sort of media that might attract the attention of the Turner Prize or its American equivalent with an international remit the Hugo Boss award. The most recent Hugo Boss award was won by a Brit Tacita Dean who has also been shortlisted for the Turner. Barney won it back in 1996 and has garnered a string of prizes since. So you could say that in his field he's comfortably at the top of the heap.I mention all this because you may come to a review of his film with the question But will I like it? And while that question is still open it is probably rather better than Is it any good?Although Barney has his critics even in the art world to suggest his stuff is rubbish is maybe a bit like saying Meryl Streep can't act her finished work may vary in quality but it's the product of someone at the top of their profession. But even if Drawing Restraint 9 is great art  of which this reviewer is unqualified to say  it is reasonable to wonder whether going to the cinema should entail the attitude of mind that going to see a Tate Modern multimedia application might demand. Surely a filmgoer has every right to judge a fill as a movie rather than an art exhibit?Drawing Restraint 9 demands more  or perhaps a rather different type  of application to the type of movie commonly at art house cinemas. Yet I recall the delightful shock of seeing Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou  that unapologetically surrealist outburst that resulted from his friendship with Salvador Dali. Or Andy Warhol's Screen Tests that reveal astonishing depth in the personalities instructed not to move or blink for four minutes. More recently Bla Tarr's masterpiece The Man From London where the scenery carries a force as powerful as the plot or characters. These people dared to use moving pictures in a different way and cinema is in my opinion better for them.Matthew Barney has little or no interest that I can deduce in conventional cinematic form. When it comes to film it is as if he started with a blank page or another medium upon which to bend like sculpture and ideas. Fans of his earlier Cremaster cycle of films will recognise a certain organic development in his films the plots and persons seems to grow in a way that mimics the growth of crystals or of speeded up plant growth all redolent with arcane or sexual symbolism.Drawing Restraint 9 seems to me a more rounded and mature work than his Cremaster opus. It is more tightly structured and coherent. The viewer can piece together the threads of stories by patient observation. The work of a Japanese whaling ship and various issues surrounding its trade and the Shinto marriage ceremony on board. During an intense lightning storm the tea ceremony  marriage ceremony takes on disturbing dimensions that set our mind and senses racing.Barney's real life partner Bjrk also combines many new ideas in creating the music. The main suite is written for the sho one of Japan's most ancient instruments. She worked with Noh theatre scholars to develop musical settings for a poem to produce an authentic haunting sound.Drawing Restraint 9 is no more an easy cinematic experience than a Rodin is a catchy picture postcard. But it rewards serious attention and its lyrical and elegiac qualities make the journey an interesting one. The strange visual experiences will leave an impression even on viewers that don't delve beyond the surface. Those that do will find Barney has drawn his cinematic sculpture on sound ideas and symbols of substance.".

Cremaster was such a convoluted mythological universe that I tend to find it unlikely that anyone could produce a body of work that is equally accomplished thought out and sprawling. Watching the opening scene of Drawing Restraint I think of Chris Marker's filmic essay Sans Soleil. Mostly because of the reference to Japan's Holiday Coming of Age Day. The dancing seems to be lifted right out of Marker's film. The pacing of both films is actually pretty similar as is the content. As Marker chose seemingly disparate images and concepts to illustrate a larger commonality in his films Barney conflates his ideas about artistic restraint with a fantasy about whaling.An extraordinary chain of events occurs in this film. A convergence of mythic proportions in true Mathew Barney style. A whaling moratorium is lifted in Japan. Bjork and Barney's occidental guest characters arrive inexplicably by prearranged fishing boat trips in the middle of a Japanese ocean on a whaling ship. The combination of a violent storm loosely Japanese and heavily stylized costuming a large petroleum jelly sculpture a riveting and very aquatic tea ceremony some bizarre dismemberment and a giant raw ambergris log culminate in a humantowhale transubstantiation for these occidental guests. The pacing of the film is generally slow for its first two thirds with beautiful imagery of a twenty year old whaling vessel seductively competing against this restrained pace. Then the storm comes the petroleum begins to consume the entire ship and there is no more restraint. At its core this is what the film is about. Barney's obsession with restraint and his fearful desire to let it go. The Coming of Age Day dance speaks about evolution from childhood to adulthood. This evolution is echoed throughout the film. The first song composed by Bjork and Barney speaks of a million year old fossil which is then lovingly wrapped and sent as a thank you for lifting the whaling moratorium again restraints are released allowing for a thriving economy and plenty of food in a previously depressed community ethical issues of whaling notwithstanding. The petroleum and steel sculpture The Field goes through a constant evolution from liquid petroleum to something a little more solid changing shape having a spinal cord like object removed from it briefly housing the ambergris log then utterly falling apart and being melted down into liquid again. All of this preparing changing waiting is the restraint part of this equation. Then something in this case ambergris and a storm catalyzes a strange metamorphosis and Bjork and Barney turn into whales. Barney must have undergone a similar process with this work this ninth part of the Drawing Restraint whole being the product of that internal metamorphosis I am imagining for Barney. In all its grandiosity all of Barney's timid pomp its actually a very honest expression of fear. Fear of release accomplishment potential energy and the unknown.".

	schema:reviewBody "Drawing Restraint 9. dir Matthew Barney.How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art film? Is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudoAsian ritual? Maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment. Or when you're about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a Philip Glass score? In any case Drawing Restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies. At 135 minutes it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot. I would call the use of color stunning and the opening sequence interesting but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. That is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of Pss Christ but that will be coming up later.Actually the documentaryesquire portions were the best parts of it. The surface plot is about a whaling ship and then there is a ritual about making whale fat. Then there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passedout head shaving think frat boy pranks nicotine patches and giant furry pita hats. Then there is mutual evisceration cannibalism and lets not forget the giant turd.Matthew Barney has written that this is about the relationship between selfimposed resistance and creativity. That's almost like saying if you don't get it then you're not creative in your interpretation so sod off because I'm an artist. Oh wait that's the POSTmodern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was POSTmodern. But its supposed to be Modern art. Which is about the art itself.So let's start this whole interpretation bit shall we? The following lines are only 34 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie.The first halfhour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp. Obviously the ramp is symbolic of the need for selfelevation to whatever standards you hold dear and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then on a whaling ship they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale. Obviously a crude element of foreshadowing.On the ship they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale and take out the fins portion. They replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd. These are supposed to be the states of the movie itself. When its fat its entertaining but bad for you. When it is the spinal column its the important parts of the movie or the backbone so to speak. Then the giant turd is the bowels of the movie or when the movie is crap.Bjork and Matthew Barney the arrive on separate ships are put into strange humiliating outfits which AREN'T EVEN WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL one suspects that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking. SO they put patches on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese wise man who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it a crash or intersection if you will. This inspires Bjork and Barney who are different on the outside to start cutting each other's legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person. They intersect. Oh did I forget to mention that this has been done in a Robbie Williams video? Then the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid Venn Diagram. Barney made it through 8th grade geometry obviously. Or maybe at least some social studies.Oh and did I forget Bjork's eargouging Iwanttokillher score? At times it is hypnotic but at others you just want to assassinate her.Art film is one thing but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people it becomes a selfdestructive joke. When do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent andor entertaining than this piece of trash. Un Chien Andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour.So can I recommend this? Only if you like dull HIGH ART films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery.D".

I almost skipped the exhibit and in retrospect probably should have.Aside from the score being great Bjork and the photography rich and colorful the content was mostly tedious and predictable. Gee I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the pearldivers were up to. The film was mostly a silly mixture of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology being used in a mockhuntharvest. The film peaks with enough gratuitous shockart to turn your stomach.What was the point of the movie? While others might argue that it is an antiwhaling piece one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling. Personally I think it was Barney's attempt at flashing the audience with his anal fecal selfmutilation and cannibalistic fetishes.Bottom line unless you really get off on Barney's sense of art don't bother seeing this movie. The message is obscure the pace slow and the cultural references pretentious. If you're after shockart you'll do better at one of the many Undead movies or hunting down an old copy of Hustler and taking in a fecalcartoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "As with reading all comments you will find it useful to know where the writer is placed. I have watched the first Cremaster and Barney's entry in the Destricted compilation. That latter piece was a failure in my mind. There's not much overlap between the sculptural and the cinematic anyway. One is more on the noun side the other on the verb side contextual environmental. I admire that he tried to find that commonality in the erotic but the result is rather sophomoric in all but the initial choices.This isn't wonderful either. I hold hope for the later Cremaster experiences that there will be some valuable conversation between us. This is a wholly different thing altogether. This man has found his love and has created a valentine. Its a conversation an intercourse between the two of them. The value we are expected to get is in witnessing rather than participating.The forms he has chosen are all Japanese because they have developed an observational distance with the ordinary things of their life we do not have.The basic urge here is the melding of the two lives Bjarney but with careful artificial constraints. We have the merging of the tea ceremony with the whaling ritual the reversal of rendering blubber to whaleoil to the coagulation of pseudoblubber from pseudowhaleoil.We have the melding of humans with whales ambergris with pearls constructing whale icons with consumption...And of course the conflating of Barney's sculptural objects with Japanese ritualistic ones. I am not well enough versed in details of Japanese esoterica to know where one starts and the other stops but I suppose in his view it is perfectly balanced one restraining the other one drawing the other each drawing restraints on another level tea to whale and so on.The most engaging sequence is at the beginning three phenomenal episodes one the wrapping of two packages bodies a second the procession of the whale oil returned and ritual construction thereupon and finally a dive into the water seeking marine truth revealing a hot blade seen later as the humans transform into whales.Its not for us they made this. Its a conversation of love and commitment between the two. We've only crew members.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Aesthetically the movie could have been pleasing especially its first half until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting. Until then it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda and no single frame is an exception. I use the word propaganda because the movie uses basically the old morality play device where good and bad are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone. Probably it's just me but I find such type of art shallow and preconceived even when it's all about the noble no sarcasm here quest of protecting the environment.In my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification for the sake of stretching only. In my opinion Drawing Restraint 9 could've been easily fit into 75 minutes but has a torturous length of 2 and 14 hours. Yes there were interesting shots but there were not enough of these to leave 15minute gaps of nothingness without notice. The movie has no standard scenario and there's no evolution of characters but neither it is a documentary it's rather a kind of conceptual installation. That's an unusual form for a movie but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also believe that the director should've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutes.And yes the music score mostly resembled whale sounds. How surprising.210.".

By stating that his film is apolitical and refusing to take any position about whaling he can be paired with all the brainless creatures that think that wearing a fur coat is OK taking this sort of cheap appeal as something better than Nature and the Beauty of living beings. This film would be as bad as one refusing to take a position about human rights or such... so no Mr Barney as much as I love good photography and while I think that your film has some merit in this particular point it soon becomes very ugly when the slaughter you didn't want to make explicit becomes as clear as you metaphors about it... And please once it was filmed inside the ship itself don't expect me to believe that it carries any antiwhaling message underneath it... Shame shame shame on you Mr Barney.

But lost hope when i saw the screening information never to be released to home video and scarcely showing in theaters mostly in art Galleries along with Barney's exhibit. A few days ago i was looking in the Austin chronicle and saw it was plying at the Dobie for 4 days. i went on Sunday at 4. I thought i would never see this in my life. The movie was amazing my mouth open the whole time amazing imagery and representation. at the end of the movie nobody in the theater could leave their seats there was so much to absorb and i felt like i woke up out of a deep meditation. And on my drive home i tried to Analyze it without the help of the pamphlet for what i came up with i was right but there was so much more behind it. The movie as a whole is a deep representation of the Japanese culture and their relationship with nature around them and how it all recycles in the end. A theme of Reincarnation if you will. Even the scene of the morbid leg dismemberment between Barney and Bjork was beautiful. And the music added to the aura and atmosphere to the movie as a whole. As for the no speaking i think this added to the understanding and representation as a whole.In all i highly recommend this movie to all who love deep meaning and imagery in a beautiful art film.

Unbeknownst to the passengers the visas they purchased were from a corrupt Cuban director of immigration and they were invalid. Upon arrival in Havana only 28 people were allowed to disembark while the rest remained on board for weeks as they sailed to Florida and eventually Canada searching for safe haven. Sadly the ship returned to Antwerp after more than a month at sea. Forced back under Nazi rule as the low countries fell it is estimated that approximately 250 of the refugees died in the extermination camps in occupied Poland.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is such a thing as too much of a good thingbut nobody seemed to realize this when overloading the ship with star names and then giving them little to do. Although based on a true incident VOYAGE OF THE DAMNED gives the subject a sprawling Hollywood treatment and does what Ship of Fools did to Katherine Anne Porter's intriguing novel.At least MAX VON SYDOW gets to be dynamic as the captain and has the appropriate amount of star footage but otherslike JAMES MASON JULIE HARRIS and WENDY HILLERare gone before they can do much.However the film's chief fault is the running timewell over two hours without ever building up the tension when the fate of the passengers should be pumping up audience interest in the outcome. The story takes a dramatic turn when the Jewish passengers are denied entry into Cuba and must return to their homeland unless the captain can come up with a better plan.FAYE DUNAWAY makes a stunning impression and LEE GRANT got an Oscar nomination for her strong supporting role but others in the large cast come and go in an indifferent mannerexcept for OSKAR WERNER who seems to be doing a repeat of his role in Ship of Fools as the ship's doctor and is as earnest as ever.Too bad the storyline couldn't have been trimmed to give the film a tighter length. As it is it just seems to make its point of man's inhumanity to man without subtlety. Just misses being a more significant film.".

Although based on a true incident VOYAGE OF THE DAMNED gives the subject a sprawling Hollywood treatment and does what Ship of Fools did to Katherine Anne Porter's intriguing novel.At least MAX VON SYDOW gets to be dynamic as the captain and has the appropriate amount of star footage but otherslike JAMES MASON JULIE HARRIS and WENDY HILLERare gone before they can do much.However the film's chief fault is the running timewell over two hours without ever building up the tension when the fate of the passengers should be pumping up audience interest in the outcome. The story takes a dramatic turn when the Jewish passengers are denied entry into Cuba and must return to their homeland unless the captain can come up with a better plan.FAYE DUNAWAY makes a stunning impression and LEE GRANT got an Oscar nomination for her strong supporting role but others in the large cast come and go in an indifferent mannerexcept for OSKAR WERNER who seems to be doing a repeat of his role in Ship of Fools as the ship's doctor and is as earnest as ever.Too bad the storyline couldn't have been trimmed to give the film a tighter length. As it is it just seems to make its point of man's inhumanity to man without subtlety. Just misses being a more significant film.";

Most notable are Pryce  Koslo unforgettably vulnerable as concentration camp escapees and Grant as the emotionally stunned wife of Wanamaker. Dunaway and Oscarnominated Grant share the film's most memorable scene as Grant becomes unhinged by the events around her. The film has a sense of cruelty and dread even if one is not aware of the outcome and it can be painful to behold but this is a story that needs to be told and the drama is at times quite compelling.

Faye Dunaway plays Werner's embittered wife and her commanding charisma and beauty are at full wattage.  Malcolm McDowell is rather endearingly miscast as a ship's steward who has a romance with Grant's daughter.

Rather they were going to use this trip to show that no one wanted the Jews and therefore when they would destroy them no one would care or have the right to care.The picture has a terrific cast in this illfated adventure.For a second time Oskar Werner so memorable as the Dr. Willie in Ship of Fools plays another doctor but this time a Jewish one. Along with his wifeFaye Dunaway they are passengers. Of course it's hard to fathom Miss Dunaway as Jewish.Sam Wanamaker and Lee Grant are a couple fleeing from persecution by the Gestapo. Grant's acting in a pivotal scene by cutting off her hair was Oscar madeand while she received the only acting nomination in the film she lost to Beatrice Straight's Network. It should also be noted that Straight's time on the screen was even more brief that Grant. Grant's brief performance was probably her best even better than in Shampoo the film that gave her the supporting Oscar the year before.While the boat is drifting along we see the players in Cuba either desperately trying to help the unfortunate Jews or corrupt officials in the Cuban government who played along with the Nazis for their own selfish economic interests.Wendy Hiller and Luther Adler have their moments as an elderly Jewish couple. It's also hard to conceive Hiller as Jewish until she rips her garment in the traditional way when a death occurs. Hard to envision a Jewish funeral at sea with the Nazi swastika swerving on the ship.Ben Gazzara is brilliant as a Jewish operative desperately trying to free the passengers. He goes all over the world and uncovers nothing more than frustration. Only a last minute reprieve saved the passengers from returning to Germany. Many of those however wound up perishing in countries invaded by Germany during the war.This brilliant film serves as a reminder to the moral decay of the 1930s and that nations did little to stop the Nazi menace from the killing of 6 million innocents.It is amazing that this film does not rank up there with Ship of Fools or even Schindler's List.".

No matter what your nationality this allstar movie will haunt you forever!!  And echoes of our similar silence toward the Bosnians as the genocide progressed will also occur to you.Knowing how it ends makes it all MORE agonizing and while you hate the stupid waste of the young lovers German and Jew you know that it is EXACTLY true of adolescents who cannot see beyond tomorrow.  And these 2 weren't prepared to wait around to see.Lee Grant as the berserk mother cutting her hair down to the concentration camp style did an outstanding job as she also tried to deal with her increasingly more irrational husband.  The sense of uprootedness of even the richest and most well educated is powerfully presented.I suppose the most shameful scene of all was the US Coast Guard cutter performing the same function as the electric chair switchthrower does in our nation.......legalized murder in the name of us all.  This is another one I will have to arm myself to see again.  The message must be never forgotten.As a Unitarian I always thank God for the Jews.  As much as human beings hate those that are different those that are evolved beyond many of the rest of us in brilliance and sensitivity are hated most of all.  When the frustrated turn to vent their venom on anyone as the Nazis did in WWII the Jews are usually the first to feel the brunt.  Now homosexuals seem to have joined the ranks of 'first out' for similar reasons.  Why can't we human beings rise above these evil actions?   It's enough to make you believe in original sin.See it.  It might just prevent you for ganging up on someone in your office or at school though I doubt it.  We don't seem to learn from history.".

	onyx:emotionText "Just as I finally understand why we left England in the lurch until 1941 because of the fierce isolationism caused by the murderinthemudandgas of WWI I have to be faced with another example of our inhumanity to man. No matter what your nationality this allstar movie will haunt you forever!!  And echoes of our similar silence toward the Bosnians as the genocide progressed will also occur to you.Knowing how it ends makes it all MORE agonizing and while you hate the stupid waste of the young lovers German and Jew you know that it is EXACTLY true of adolescents who cannot see beyond tomorrow.  And these 2 weren't prepared to wait around to see.Lee Grant as the berserk mother cutting her hair down to the concentration camp style did an outstanding job as she also tried to deal with her increasingly more irrational husband.  The sense of uprootedness of even the richest and most well educated is powerfully presented.I suppose the most shameful scene of all was the US Coast Guard cutter performing the same function as the electric chair switchthrower does in our nation.......legalized murder in the name of us all.  This is another one I will have to arm myself to see again.  The message must be never forgotten.As a Unitarian I always thank God for the Jews.  As much as human beings hate those that are different those that are evolved beyond many of the rest of us in brilliance and sensitivity are hated most of all.  When the frustrated turn to vent their venom on anyone as the Nazis did in WWII the Jews are usually the first to feel the brunt.  Now homosexuals seem to have joined the ranks of 'first out' for similar reasons.  Why can't we human beings rise above these evil actions?   It's enough to make you believe in original sin.See it.  It might just prevent you for ganging up on someone in your office or at school though I doubt it.  We don't seem to learn from history.";

That said the cast do seem more interested in giving good performances rather than enjoying themselves which isn't always the case with movies with a large cast of big names . Special mention should go to Paul Koslo was very prolific in 1970s B movies and who appeared in some utterly pathetic movies in the 80s and 90s  while the always excellent Johnathan Pryce shows us what he can do in an early role . Max Von Sydow as Captain Schroeder gives the best performance in the movieAll the cast do their best but it's really the script that is at fault . I did mention Von Sydow's acting performance as Schroeder  but you often feel his character is written as a litery point illustrating party member  bad  non party member  good  this point feels too forced and unsubtle . Remember it's when people become indifferent that bad things happen  not when they join a political party . I don't want to mention this but Erwin Rommel was a member of the Nazi party and he was the most respected German general by the allies because of his code of chilvary while many Wermacht non party members committed war crimes every bit as brutal as their SS counterparts so don't be fooled that everything is as black and white as seen here  as the caption at the end shows Schroeder himself was questioned about crimes against humanity after the war There's a couple of other flaws with the script . Aaron Pozner is shown being beaten to a pulp by some SA brownshirts in 1939 which is strange considering the SA were liquidated by Hitler in 1934 and lets be blunt in saying that the movie is at least half an hour too long . This is often a problem with a great number of movies featuring anti semitism 193345 in that by showing us mans inhumanity to man they often feel the need to labour the point home of the cruelty of the regime and the victims fear when in fact less would been more . It could also be that this is always not a very good subject to base a movie around especially when there's documentaries like THE WORLD AT WAR that shows the very real horrors of what the Nazis did to their victims".

	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools was an entertaining story of a congeries of disparate characters aboard a German cruise ship in the 1930s. It must have been a success because this negligible film is a shameless and bathetic rip off. This time the entire ship's passenger list is Jewish and they suffer crisis after crisis. The fact that German Jews in 1939 were actually suffering those crises makes this blatantly commercial attempt at exploitation a cheapening of the historical experience.It really IS a rip off. I mean that's not rhetoric. Oskar Werner plays a doctor in both movies. Jose Ferrer is cheerfully villainous in both. There is a liaison between a member of the crew and a desperate passenger in both. There is a costume party in both. There's the familiar rabid Nazi commisar whose job is to keep an eye on party loyalty among the crew. It reminds me of the way cars are remodeled year by year a bit of new chrome here a set of new tail lights there all in an attempt to cash in on novelty.Nice cast though. Not just expensive Hollywood actors  in fact no leading stars at all  but a lot of competent supporting players some of whom have made careers out of gracing the screen for a few moments with superb performances. Orson Welles is on hand as are Max von Sydow Malcolm MacDowell Lee Grant and the endless list of recognizable faces that these kinds of films require. The budget must have been sizable. Faye Dunaway appears in a costume that looks like a copy of John Singer Sargent's Madame X. Add a black choker. The wardrobe is emblematic of the whole enterprise. Copy something and then add a few disguising touches.But it's still tragedy played for lower middlebrows who will weep generous tears as the director manipulates their sentimentality and rakes in the shekels. The director is Stuart Rosenberg. I can't imagine how he managed to turn out a magnificent movie like Cool Hand Luke. This stuff is all in your face.I don't like propaganda movies in general regardless of their source region. They don't really convert anyone or change already existing sentiments. Most attitudes follow the usual bellshaped curve with the overwhelming majority of people occupying the middle part  ignorant or indifferent or genuinely moderate  with a few extremists at either end. But I suspect that movies like this carrying the heavy burden of an important social message will reach respondents that form a rarer Ushaped curve. Those who are already sympathetic to the message will applaud it. Those who aren't will dismiss it bitterly as the kind of propaganda they've come to expect from Hollywood. So if it isn't going to improve our souls what is its purpose aside from commercial success? A rite of intensification for those of us who agree with its message. The people who made the movie know which side the angels are on and so do we. It allows us to despise those who don't. I'm afraid movies like this generate as much hatred as empathy.I'd watch Ship of Fools again any time but not this. It shows nothing that we didn't know or guess before. The fact that it resembles a genuine historical incident is irrelevant. I don't mean to seem well carried away but I do wish there had been some understatement here. I suppose it would be too much to ask for a little poetry too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a true incident Voyage Of The Damned is the story of a select group of Jews picked from concentration camps that had not yet turned into slaughterhouses and allowed to depart Germany to Cuba where ostensibly they will stay and try to later immigrate to the USA. The problem is that they will never be allowed to land in Havana it's all just a propaganda ploy to show how other nations don't want these people because they are insidious troublemakers by nature and the Nazis can then justify anything they do to them.Hitler was not a fool on this he knew well the American system of immigration with its quotas and percentages and the way it was put in place as a backlash against foreigners in the Twenties. To its everlasting shame the USA put this into affect the result being millions of people dying. This from a country whose greatest strength was its immigrant population uncounted millions in this country enjoy its benefits because our ancestors came here from a variety of places for refuge and for opportunity.So these people filled with hopes and dreams take passage in the hopes of avoiding the slaughter to come. What happens to them collectively and individually is the story of Voyage Of The Damned.The Germans are not shown as stereotypes either which is a major strength this film has. They range from a humane captain who is Max Von Sydow to Malcolm McDowell as his personal orderly who is marked for tragedy when he falls for the daughter of one of the refugee families and starts seeing things in a new light to Helmut Griem who is the official Nazi party representative on the ship and who challenges successfully Von Sydow's authority as captain.Our laws being what they were and with isolationist sentiment as it was in May of 1939 a case could be made for not officially granting the ship landing clearance. We see our own Coast Guard cutter warning the German ship not to land or even enter our territorial waters. A few winks and nods and they could have. Or some pressure could be brought to bare on the Cuban government which in fact was our client state which never happened. The Cubans like Jose Ferrer and Orson Welles and Fernando Rey are shown to be eminently corruptible. One played by James Mason is most assuredly not and he intervenes in one very poignant case involving some children on the boat being reunited with their father.The refugees much like the smaller unit that inhabited that attic where Anne Frank's refugee extended family took place are a wide cross section of Jewish Germany. One Lee Grant was given an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress but it seems not fair to have just singled her out. Oskar Werner Faye Dunaway Sam Wanamaker Wendy Hiller and Luther Adler are all equally memorable. And Ben Gazzara has the most straightforward role as a representative of the American Jewish Committee in the film. He functions like Richard Widmark the prosecutor in Judgment At Nuremberg the voice of conscience as he tries to raise money to essentially buy officials in the Cuban government. Voyage Of The Damned has worn well over time and it's something to be seen and seen again. And it's quite a condemnation of our Twenties immigration laws still largely in effect. Funny in the 19th century there was never an issue over illegal aliens we took whatever we got. Maybe we can't return to the days of my grandparents coming here but we have to do better than we have.".

To its everlasting shame the USA put this into affect the result being millions of people dying. This from a country whose greatest strength was its immigrant population uncounted millions in this country enjoy its benefits because our ancestors came here from a variety of places for refuge and for opportunity.So these people filled with hopes and dreams take passage in the hopes of avoiding the slaughter to come. What happens to them collectively and individually is the story of Voyage Of The Damned.The Germans are not shown as stereotypes either which is a major strength this film has. They range from a humane captain who is Max Von Sydow to Malcolm McDowell as his personal orderly who is marked for tragedy when he falls for the daughter of one of the refugee families and starts seeing things in a new light to Helmut Griem who is the official Nazi party representative on the ship and who challenges successfully Von Sydow's authority as captain.Our laws being what they were and with isolationist sentiment as it was in May of 1939 a case could be made for not officially granting the ship landing clearance. We see our own Coast Guard cutter warning the German ship not to land or even enter our territorial waters. A few winks and nods and they could have. Or some pressure could be brought to bare on the Cuban government which in fact was our client state which never happened. The Cubans like Jose Ferrer and Orson Welles and Fernando Rey are shown to be eminently corruptible. One played by James Mason is most assuredly not and he intervenes in one very poignant case involving some children on the boat being reunited with their father.The refugees much like the smaller unit that inhabited that attic where Anne Frank's refugee extended family took place are a wide cross section of Jewish Germany. One Lee Grant was given an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress but it seems not fair to have just singled her out. Oskar Werner Faye Dunaway Sam Wanamaker Wendy Hiller and Luther Adler are all equally memorable. And Ben Gazzara has the most straightforward role as a representative of the American Jewish Committee in the film. He functions like Richard Widmark the prosecutor in Judgment At Nuremberg the voice of conscience as he tries to raise money to essentially buy officials in the Cuban government. Voyage Of The Damned has worn well over time and it's something to be seen and seen again. And it's quite a condemnation of our Twenties immigration laws still largely in effect. Funny in the 19th century there was never an issue over illegal aliens we took whatever we got. Maybe we can't return to the days of my grandparents coming here but we have to do better than we have.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really remarkable film of great importance. It concerns the voyage of an ocean liner from Hamburg in Germany to Cuba loaded with Jews who have bought their way out of the Nazi nightmare by paying money to Heinrich Himmler. The voyage across the Atlantic is long and slow with much drama taking place on the way. But when the ship reaches Cuba the Jews are not allowed to disembark after all and the whole voyage turns out to have been a 'setup' a cover for a military cargo arrangement. The film has an allstar cast of prominent film actors of the 1970s. There are so many of them it almost seems as if the whole of Hollywood tried to squeeze into the cast list. The stars include Faye Dunaway Orson Welles James Mason Max von Sydow as the ship's captain Jose Ferrer Julie Harris Oscar Werner in his last film Maria Schell Wendy Hiller who is marvellous as always Sam Wanamaker Ben Gazzara and the list goes on. Some of these stars appear only fleetingly between decks as it were and others have real parts. Some like Orson Welles and Fernando Rey are even on land and not at sea at all. After all various diplomats in capital cities have to be seen debating whether to save the Jews or not or the story would have no context. Some of the younger stars of the day such as Katharine Ross Lynne Frederick and Malcolm McDowell are now largely forgotten as 'names' but were 'big' then. In his first feature film role Jonathan Pryce is spectacular. Supporting actors like Lee Grant Victor Spinetti and Luther Adler were familiar then but few now remember them at all despite the many roles they played on countless occasions so that everyone at least knew their faces. The film was directed by Stuart Rosenberg and was based on a bestselling novel which in turn was based upon the notorious real events which actually happened and were an international scandal. The name of the ship was the S.S. St. Louis and there were 937 Jewish passengers aboard. I cannot reveal the ending of the film or the fate of these passengers but the historical remarks under 'Trivia' in the IMDb entry add information which partially corrects details of the facts as portrayed in the film.".

The film ended up being two and a half hours and it easily could have been ninety minutes. Each scene was painfully slow each shot could have been cut shorter or eliminated to get to the meat of the movie quicker.I could say that without the slow pacing of the film it would have been entertaining but not only is that a useless what if but it wouldn't be true. Most of the acting in this film is extremely overthetop from the leads to the extras in the background. It's a true story about the good will voyage in 1939 during which Germany sent 937 Jewish refugees to Cuba and the disasters the political climate took on the passengers. As in all disaster movies there's an all star cast with equally brief screen times giving the audience a taste of their various plights to make them endearing. Faye Dunaway Oskar Werner Lee Grant Sam Wanamaker Lynne Frederick Wendy Hiller Luther Adler Julie Harris Maria Schell Nehemiah Persoff and many others make up the passenger list Max Von Sydow Helmut Griem and Malcom McDowell are the featured members of the crew. In Cuba other movie stars provide cameos including Orson Welles Ben Gazzara Katharine Ross Denholm Elliott Jose Ferrer and James Mason. The basic premise of the story is interesting from a historical perspective about the bigwigs in Cuba the United States and Germany but those portions of the film are brief compared to the different families' on the ship screen time. With exception to the absolutely adorable romance between Lynne Frederick and Malcom McDowell everyone else on board irritated me to no end. As sweet and darling as the young couple were they didn't take up two and a half hours and therefore couldn't save the movie. The characters who were supposed to evoke the most sympathy like Lee Grant who earned an Oscar nomination were the most annoying. There were many scenes that were written to make the audience cry and I didn't even get a lump in my throat. In short this movie is incredibly boring and overrated. If you insist on watching it make sure you have something else handy like a doodle pad or someone entertaining to talk to because you'll need it.".

Basically it is the story of a group of friends of a certain age who meet regularly in the Garlington bar its name is a tribute to two of the owner's idols Carlos Gardel of Argentina and Duke Ellington of the United States. In many ways the film kept reminding this viewer of a better made movie about the same theme Wayne Wang's Smoke that takes place in a smoke shop in Brooklyn with a screenplay by Paul Auster.The action centers on three friends and Duke the owner of the Garlington. Sergio a writer is seen spending his time on writing a screenplay. He sees the world passing by without making a contribution to either finishing his project or changing anything he sees wrong. Marcos is another friend always on the lookout for women. He is sometimes lucky but most of the time he spends idling away at the bar. Valeria a voluptuous singer has been involved with Sergio now there does not seem they have much going on but the memories of what they experienced once. The news of their friend's Sebastian's suicide weighs heavily on all of the friends. Duke the owner sees the changes around him enduring the visit of a homeless woman as well as an attempt of robbery in his bar. The film does not maintain its momentum as there are some arid patches in the narrative which tend to get the viewer sidetracked when some things are unexplained. Director Hernan Gaffet shows some talent and one wished he added more humor to the text. The setting lends itself for a lot more but one keeps waiting in vain for it to become a reality. What Mr. Gaffet gets is good ensemble playing from his cast.".

As I left the theater I noticed people standing around and chatting about the movie and still laughing. The group I saw it with discussed it for nearly an hour. We relived lots of the funny parts but also pondered its serious dimensions. Its humor is a response to life's fragility and unpredictability. Like Trueba's Belle Epoque it is a cinematographic carpe dieman invitation to pack as much joy as possible into a life that is absurd and fleeting. The humor is not black humor however. It is joyful although its joy is framed in darkness. Unlike Belle Epoque whose historical setting makes its darkness less immediately apparent Ciudad en celo is set in contemporary Buenos Aires and shows people coping with current situations. Its portrayal of Buenos Aires is touching and right on target. It captures the soul of the city. The movie is also visually and orally engaging. The tangos Dolores Sola sings are haunting. Other scenes make effective use of barely audible music. The camera work is excellent as are all the performances. I am a big fan of Spanish and Latin American cinema and especially like Argentine movies. Although Spain has recently made some excellent comedies the genre is underdeveloped in Latin America. This film is a welcome step toward filling the gap. I hope it starts a trend.".

All the while I longed to see this beautiful island which my parents sadly left behind. Though Andy Carcia's film was not filmed in Cuba it was filmed in the Dominican Republic it gave me a chance to see a Cuba I had only heard about. As for the film itself the conflicts of family politics and love in the film is beautifully portrayed to reflect what has been a painful truth to a great number of Cubans. I definitely recommend this to all Cubans and nonCubans alike. I hope Mr. Garcia gets due recognition for this beautiful body of work. By the way... Is there an accompanying soundtrack album?

	onyx:emotionText "As an American of Cuban parents I had always heard the political rhetoric about Cuba as I was growing up. All the while I longed to see this beautiful island which my parents sadly left behind. Though Andy Carcia's film was not filmed in Cuba it was filmed in the Dominican Republic it gave me a chance to see a Cuba I had only heard about. As for the film itself the conflicts of family politics and love in the film is beautifully portrayed to reflect what has been a painful truth to a great number of Cubans. I definitely recommend this to all Cubans and nonCubans alike. I hope Mr. Garcia gets due recognition for this beautiful body of work. By the way... Is there an accompanying soundtrack album? The music was phenomenal!";

Also the choreography was very good and the dancers where spectacular in particular the fellow that participated as a solo. The guy playing the trumpet at the beginning and end of the movie was superb.It gives an overall picture of the history from that period in the island nation and without being documentary it respects the motives and shortcomings of any historical process such as this one.Thanks Andy for this movie and keep up the good work.".

Worse a romantic night club owner with strong family principles and a passion for Classic Ballet!!.In this lamentable parody of a movie Garcia is a poor pathetic and full of clichs caricature of a Puritan Casablanca's Bogart better suited for films like AIRPLANE or SPY HARD.Come on!!! Like it or not EVERYBODY knows that despite all the flamboyancy and quality of the spectacle PreCastro Cuba's was a Maffia's paradise As it was Las Vegas and the Nightclubs were Luxury Bordellos with strong ties with the Maffia and any kind of Thugs and lowlifes IF NOT DIRECTLY OWNED BY THEM where prostitution and illegal activities of all kinds were a commonplace.And GAMBLING WAS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL IN PRECASTRO CUBA still is in most of the Caribbean islands so there was NO reason other than pathetic soap opera moralism for Fico to not fulfill Lansky's wishes.The pathetic and unreal portrayal of a humble nice and easy going Meyer Lansky is simply ridiculous.The real Meyer Lansky was a though MAFIA BOSS a ruthless murderer and one of the MOST powerful figures in Maffia's History who didn't ask for favors.In fact He wouldn't had paid a personal visit to a stupid Club owner.And NOBODY would say NO to Meyer Lansky so easily.AH!! The Writer  poorly played by a painfully miscast Bill Murray is one of the most unnecessary annoying and unfunny characters in cinema history since JAR JAR BINKS.You take out Bill Murray's parts from this crappy movie and nobody wouldn't notice the smallest change.This character has no impact at all in the entire movie other than spitting unfunny and out of place one liners.The writer is just annoying and unnecessary filler.The rest of the characters are totally forgettable severely undeveloped and incredibly unsympathetic.There is no reason background or origin for any of the character' s actions.For example Luis spouse Ines Sastre who played a simple wife who didn't show no political background opinion or interest who wasn't involved in any kind of political movement AT ALL who didn't know nothing about her husband's secret political activities during the entire film suddenly out of nothing in a blink of an eye becomes the quintessential symbol of Castro's revolution and his most powerful advocate just because she was the wife of an in the closet revolutionary.Pathetic.The weak stories never gets to a developed state.Ther is no conclusive moments. All the movie looks like a perennial first chapter of a very boring soap opera To worsen things the movie is excruciatingly long and slow.Special mention has to be made to Eduardo's revolutionary beard a Landmark in the annals of the cheap looking makeup art in film history only found in B or Z movies.It looks like a cheap Halloween werewolf beard from PARTY CITY.The only OK Not fantastic just OK thing about this movie is the photography.The Music was great.But this was a MOVIE not a CONCERT.EEEEECH!! The Dialog!!! What can I say? There is one scene in which the conversation looks like it was entirely made out of SLOGANS and phrases taken from a clichd political campaign scrapbook.I'm sorry Andy but your labor of love SUCKS.Maybe next time.".

Like it or not EVERYBODY knows that despite all the flamboyancy and quality of the spectacle PreCastro Cuba's was a Maffia's paradise As it was Las Vegas and the Nightclubs were Luxury Bordellos with strong ties with the Maffia and any kind of Thugs and lowlifes IF NOT DIRECTLY OWNED BY THEM where prostitution and illegal activities of all kinds were a commonplace.And GAMBLING WAS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL IN PRECASTRO CUBA still is in most of the Caribbean islands so there was NO reason other than pathetic soap opera moralism for Fico to not fulfill Lansky's wishes.The pathetic and unreal portrayal of a humble nice and easy going Meyer Lansky is simply ridiculous.The real Meyer Lansky was a though MAFIA BOSS a ruthless murderer and one of the MOST powerful figures in Maffia's History who didn't ask for favors.In fact He wouldn't had paid a personal visit to a stupid Club owner.And NOBODY would say NO to Meyer Lansky so easily.AH!! The Writer  poorly played by a painfully miscast Bill Murray is one of the most unnecessary annoying and unfunny characters in cinema history since JAR JAR BINKS.You take out Bill Murray's parts from this crappy movie and nobody wouldn't notice the smallest change.This character has no impact at all in the entire movie other than spitting unfunny and out of place one liners.The writer is just annoying and unnecessary filler.The rest of the characters are totally forgettable severely undeveloped and incredibly unsympathetic.There is no reason background or origin for any of the character' s actions.For example Luis spouse Ines Sastre who played a simple wife who didn't show no political background opinion or interest who wasn't involved in any kind of political movement AT ALL who didn't know nothing about her husband's secret political activities during the entire film suddenly out of nothing in a blink of an eye becomes the quintessential symbol of Castro's revolution and his most powerful advocate just because she was the wife of an in the closet revolutionary.Pathetic.The weak stories never gets to a developed state.Ther is no conclusive moments. All the movie looks like a perennial first chapter of a very boring soap opera To worsen things the movie is excruciatingly long and slow.Special mention has to be made to Eduardo's revolutionary beard a Landmark in the annals of the cheap looking makeup art in film history only found in B or Z movies.It looks like a cheap Halloween werewolf beard from PARTY CITY.The only OK Not fantastic just OK thing about this movie is the photography.The Music was great.But this was a MOVIE not a CONCERT.EEEEECH!! The Dialog!!! What can I say? There is one scene in which the conversation looks like it was entirely made out of SLOGANS and phrases taken from a clichd political campaign scrapbook.I'm sorry Andy but your labor of love SUCKS.Maybe next time.";

Those providing the turmoil are his brothers Luis and Ricardo Carbonell and Murciano respectively who consistently are chomping at the bit with their disputes about the impending revolution and the desire to remain a patriot despite the odds of Communism infiltrating the masses. Fico remains the peacekeeper and will not tolerate any disrespect towards his decenthearted father but the dam will only hold for so long as the siblings go their separate ways.When Luis is killed in an attempted coupdetat assassination on loathed Presidente Batista Fernandez Fico can only see the writing on the wall when he allows his heart to open to Luis' widow the beautiful Aurora Sastre the two fall in love and marry. Shortly thereafter things get worse when Ricardo has fled to the deep jungles of the covert military ops of Fidel Castro after he was arrested and beaten by the corrupt chief of police the vile hand crop bearing Colonel Candela Mechosa who has slain Luis. Fico knows this but is powerless to do anything which makes the tragedy unfolding even more devastating for him to burden himself with.Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbrogliotobe with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire. The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours. It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a Casablanca tinged melodrama or a Godfather wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words. Although I love Bill Murray his unnamed Writer is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting oh who am I kidding  I loved him! His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes and a panama hat. Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soulsearching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.".

I heard that Garcia wanted to direct this movie for a long time and it wasn't until recently that he finally acquired the means to do so. The movie clearly is influenced by Casablanca and The Cotton Club Havana The Godfather and I thought even Buena Vista Social Club. Let me tell you flat out this turkey does not come close to those movies! It has been a while since I have seen such a convoluted fractured and aimless disaster of a movie. If there was a story or a message in the movie it got lost amidst all of the clutter of ideas Andy Garcia sought to include in this movie. I read in an article that the original script came out to more than 300 pages and Garcia had to be pushed to shorten it down to 125 or so! The plot the storyline the characters are all cartoonish superficial and onedimensional. This is not about being politically correct or being pro this and against that. I am just speaking as a movie fan who expected more from an artist such as Andy Garcia. I mean is this the same man from Night Falls On Manhattan Hero The Dissapeareance of Garcia Lorca and other good movies? I think not! One critic called this movie if it can be called that a personal story that turned into a vanity project. How right he is. This encapsulates the main problem with this flop. I think that in making this movie Garcia let his personal bias and feelings compromise his artistic integrity and gave birth to an egotistical narrowminded infatuation with his own view on things. He confused the story he wanted to tell with his own egodriven diatribe.While he might be entitled to be enraged biased and personally touched by certain events that affected him and his family as a director he let that alone dictate the course of his own creation without any thought of how the public who perhaps is not familiar with the events portrayed in the movie would assimilate and digest the story he so dismally tries to get across.The one bright spot in this mess was Ines Sastre. She is simply put fantastic even in such a godawful failure as this. When the movie reached the two hour mark I was ready to get up and leave the theater the only thing that kept me in the seat was just looking upon her face a face that tells its own story even if it does not say anything! I would suggest that perhaps it would have been more interesting if Andy Garcia did a a documentary about his own experience as a Cuban exile and about his family etc. Otherwise The Lost City is not even worth renting!".

Unlike Rick Fico never changes and only connects with the enemy to save his brother or his friend.The movie is just too darn pretty. It presents a Cuba that may be familiar to the upper class and the rich American tourists and neglects to mention the Cuba that demanded a revolution. This Cuba one of poor uneducated peasants that were in virtual slavery on sugar and tobacco plantations and women who sold themselves to tourists is seen only in Mikhail Kalatozov's Soy Cuba which will be released in a deluxe edition this month.The movie worth watching for Garcia's performance and the performances of Dustin Hoffman Bill Murray and Elizabeth Pea as well as some great AfroCuban music.It probably did great box office in Miami.".

Worth a look though for it's style and feel of the glamor that was Havana the physical warmth and affection that lives in Cuban families and it's interesting antiCastro portrayal of events. It even challenges the hero status of Che Guevara.But Andy Garcia's tale of a wealthy family coming apart like this lovely island during the Cuban revolution suffers from the selfindulgence that so often weakens the work of writerdirectorproducer combos. Who is going to say Andy enough of those closeups of you looking longingly at your lost loves? After about an hour and a half we sure wish someone would! It leaves me wondering why with all Cuba has gone through our government continues to punish Cubans with economic sanctions that do no harm to Castro but keep the Cubans from thriving from their hard hard work and record breaking high literacy rates.".

I don't think this was my fault I don't usually have any trouble following a story even a notverywell written one.So I blame the script and the editing the camera work was quite good although I was hoping for a good peek at Havana of that era or even this one but I since found out the film was shot in the Dominican Republic which isn't going to look much like Cuba methinks.So while I can understand why some people gave this film top marks I am not able to do that for any movie that keeps losing me as consistently as this one did. Some of this could be redeemed on a repeat viewing but I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to stay awake.Sorry Andy maybe next time.".

Now to be fair with the movie it has great soundtrack and it shows people dancing everywhere at least they used to do so before Fidel came. Apart from that the general feeling while watching the movie was that probably Andy Garcia had in his mind something like hey I'm the producer it's my money so I'll direct it make the score and play the leading role!.I noticed other comments about how deep and insightful this movie is. In my view it is far from that. We had our own share of communism in Romania so I guess I know what I'm talking about. Mr. Garcia does not. He only has a shallow vision about what happened there about the drama of the people and about what a revolution means or at least this is what he shows to us.Regarding the main characters I found them to be unconvincing. I count here the entire family of the main character. And all the time we have closeups of Mr. Garcia's eyes reminding me about the expression of Steven Seagal.I wouldn't have bothered to write a review but I really felt cheated for the time I spent watching the movie. Whatever you want history romance drama good acting etc. try something else.".

I've been studying prerevolution Cuba for months now and I keep coming back to try to watch this movie  visually it's a gorgeous depiction of the place and time. But I can only get through about twenty minutes of cringing through the horrible script before I have to turn it of. It's as if Garcia made a list of every clich he could think of and then had beautiful talented actors deliver them in no particular order and with no particular depth of feeling. I'm afraid from now on whenever I see Garcia in any of my favorite movies he's done part of my mind will be wondering what the hell he was thinking when he decided to shoot this script instead of hiring a real writer I don't think even in Hollywood he could've found a screenwriter who couldn't have done much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lost City has some nice cinematography and GREAT soundtrack to offer. But ultimately it all serves as vehicle to deliver harsh condemnation of Cuban Revolution. That is for me where this movie is falling apart  it paints everything in such unrealistic colors. Everything before revolution is one amazing fairytale. Everything after is a nightmare. When protagonist rejects his lover that decides that there are things in life greater than us and starts working for Castro regime you cannot tell if it is because his property was confiscated or because his childhood friend who worked as police officer was executed. He does not seem to have much of political beliefs himself and in the days of Batista he seems to be content with not rocking the boat. It does not bother him that his friend was working for regime that was killing patriots  those things did not exist in his little world of cabaret Tropical before his own brothers were arrested and then executed by the regime. Still his response seemed to be focused on taking care of his brother's widow and having good time. Until the revolution comes crashing in and destroying the fairytale. I think that the weakest part of the movie was cartoonish stereotypes of revolutionaries as bearded green uniformclad bloodthirsty thugs spewing some idiotic slogans about it belongs to revolution now. That is a bad caricature and that is where movie loses a lot of credibility. Overall I had hard time sympathizing with Fico's character because director decided to force me into sympathy by making Fico this nice guy who does not try to make to many enemies loves family loves cabaret loves his brothers and his brother's widow has a beautiful life and tries to to stay away from politics. And then suddenly big bad wolf of Revolution takes his beautiful life away from him. And you want to say and?.... Anyways  for me the nostalgic picture of Cuba before the revolution  however unrealistic it may be was worth the price of admission. It was just so.... NICE. Rest of the movie was soso.".
