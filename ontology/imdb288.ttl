The Technicolor is still sumptuous clever and thoughtprovoking however and overall it doesn't need remastering  just turn the volume up! Noel Coward's witty play transferred to the ghastly green screen perfectly in 1945 it was as wildly oldfashioned as Brief Encounter was in 1936 on stage as Still Life. But same as that film and almost everything Coward did from the '20's to the '40's it remains eminently watchable and a riveting experience.Basically Rex Harrison's dead 1st wife is summoned back in a sance to the real world much to his and his 2nd wife's consternation. A marvellous cast mainly depicting erudite and splendidly eccentric English socalled middleclass  because they had to work for a living hence they were all highly paid working class  an amusing concept Coward would have violently and amusingly disagreed with. Margaret Rutherford takes the prize for the most eccentric performance as ever flailing never failing Madame Arcati the lively spiritualist. The dialogue is urbane brisk and witty throughout so a thorough knowledge of English language and English customs up to 1945 is essential to getting the most from this.That can also mean that although it helps you don't have to be English and live in England to enjoy it. A previous nonblithe commenter with apparently no sense of humour from the UK displayed a complete nonunderstanding noninterest and nonacceptance of anything British and must desire complete separation from anything to do with Britain  probably apart from the passport. What would the ghosts of 1945 say if they could come back today and realise that a classic such as this can be dismissed so negatively?".

The film tackles some dark themes such as death and falling in and out of love. The characters themselves are on the face of it unsympathetic. Elvira is a siren Ruth is shrewish and Charles a misogynist. Despite this the film works well as a comedy because of the quick and clever dialogue between the characters and the scene stealing performances of Margaret Rutherford's Madame Arcarti.

Constance Cummings and Rex Harrison play the unfortunate married couple who are haunted by the ghost of a previous dead spouse. Harrison playing very much himself here and with an uncannily resemblance to the character 'Higgins' that he was to play some twenty years later in My Fair Lady conceited and nauseatingly arrogant...One of the best scenes in this classic that stands out far from the rest with some great dialogue is when Mrs. Condomine pays a visit to Madame Arcati demanding she be rid of her husband's previous wife's ghost. This turns into a fiery exchange of some great home truths for both characters! An interesting point is the drama of this craftily slipped in the middle of an otherwise complete 'comic' Movie  very cleverly done! This Film has some marvellous Special Effects for its day in particular Rutherford's extremely long finger and the clever shot of Constance Cummings running upstairs and seemingly passing straight through Kay Hammond's ghostly apparition!

	schema:reviewBody "Rex Harrison is Charles Condimine a prominent novelist whose first wife Elvira Kay Hammond died of flutype illness. His second wife Ruth Constance Cummings is planning to assist his research into the occult for a new novel. This includes a dinner party where a local medium Madame Arcati  Margaret Rutherford is invited to hold a sance. So far it seems simple. Harrison and Cummings treat the whole matter as a joke politely of course but just before the sance begins Madame Arcati requests some music  and Ruth finds a recording of Irving Berlin's song Always and puts it on. Charles shows disquiet at this the first time that happens but despite protests the record is put in. And as a result when Madame Arcati puts the record on she manages to contact Elvira who shows up much to Charles increasing panic. Always you see was her favorite tune.So begins Noel Coward's and David Lean's film version of BLITHE SPIRIT. It is technically the best of the three films based on Coward's classic comedies the other two are PRIVATE LIVES and DESIGN FOR LIVING. Note for example the way Elvira is colored green in the filmstock. But in it's way it is flawed just as they are. Enough remains however for an above average comedy.To it's credit it revealed Margaret Rutherford as the delightful eccentric comic actress who would help push British comedies in the 1950s and 1960s until she became the first popular Mrs. Marple and an Oscar winner for THE V.I.P.S. Look at her trances as her voice assumes that of the little girl with a runny nose who is her contact with the other side.Rex Harrison gave one of his best comic performances as a realistic man caught in a occult nightmare when Arcati says the spirit she contacts wants to speak to Charles it is suggested that it is the recently deceased old Mrs. Plunkett who wants to speak to him  a surprised and annoyed Harrison asks Why should old Mrs. Plunkett want to speak to me? It's a typical response. As the two warring wives Hammond and Cummings are quite good the former all frivolous and fun loving the latter more downtoearth and serious.

	onyx:emotionText "Rex Harrison is Charles Condimine a prominent novelist whose first wife Elvira Kay Hammond died of flutype illness. His second wife Ruth Constance Cummings is planning to assist his research into the occult for a new novel. This includes a dinner party where a local medium Madame Arcati  Margaret Rutherford is invited to hold a sance. So far it seems simple. Harrison and Cummings treat the whole matter as a joke politely of course but just before the sance begins Madame Arcati requests some music  and Ruth finds a recording of Irving Berlin's song Always and puts it on. Charles shows disquiet at this the first time that happens but despite protests the record is put in. And as a result when Madame Arcati puts the record on she manages to contact Elvira who shows up much to Charles increasing panic. Always you see was her favorite tune.So begins Noel Coward's and David Lean's film version of BLITHE SPIRIT. It is technically the best of the three films based on Coward's classic comedies the other two are PRIVATE LIVES and DESIGN FOR LIVING. Note for example the way Elvira is colored green in the filmstock. But in it's way it is flawed just as they are. Enough remains however for an above average comedy.To it's credit it revealed Margaret Rutherford as the delightful eccentric comic actress who would help push British comedies in the 1950s and 1960s until she became the first popular Mrs. Marple and an Oscar winner for THE V.I.P.S. Look at her trances as her voice assumes that of the little girl with a runny nose who is her contact with the other side.Rex Harrison gave one of his best comic performances as a realistic man caught in a occult nightmare when Arcati says the spirit she contacts wants to speak to Charles it is suggested that it is the recently deceased old Mrs. Plunkett who wants to speak to him  a surprised and annoyed Harrison asks Why should old Mrs. Plunkett want to speak to me? It's a typical response. As the two warring wives Hammond and Cummings are quite good the former all frivolous and fun loving the latter more downtoearth and serious. But both love Charles although not blind to his real flaws. Nor as it turns out is he blind to theirs.The film is better than Lubitsch's DESIGN FOR LIVING. That one had some nice touches in it I mentioned Edward Everett Horton's Honeymoon kick in my review of that film but it was censored in revealing the bisexuality of the characters played by Cooper and March.

	schema:reviewBody "As a cinematic archive Blithe Spirit preserves a certain style and era of the British stage and Noel Coward's writing that otherwise would be lost.I've personally never quite understood the popular rage Noel Coward's plays are said to have been. I appeared onstage early in my shortlived acting career yes I'm a member of SAG and Equity as Charles Condomine so I'm familiar with Blithe Spirit. And while I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton onstage in Coward's Private Lives and Joan Collins in the same play I was more intrigued by the movie stars' stage performances than by the actual script.Coward's dialogue is SO arch and precious and of its period that it absolutely requires an uppercrust British accent to work and a fairly rapid light touch to disguise how studied and artificial it really is. No American ever spoke this way. Of course Shakespeare's dialogue was also of its period and nobody ever spoke in iambic pentameter either yet it's anything but arch and precious. Blithe Spirit gives Margaret Rutherford and Kay Hammond the chance to recreate their stage roles for the camera and Rex Harrison and Constance Cummings the opportunity to perfectly embody the rarefied world of the Condomines. Miss Cummings incidentally was American. She married a British actor moved to London and enjoyed a long and successful stage career. She was London's original Martha in Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The actors in Blithe Spirit even the minor characters are flawless. One example and for me perhaps the funniest line in the production is Hugh Wakefield's response as Dr. Bradman to Madame Arcati's Rutherford pronouncement that as a young girl following in her mother's footsteps as a medium she always used to be sick before going into a trance. How fortunate that you grew out of it Bradman deadpans with perfect throwaway aplomb.Cummings and Harrison are utterly believable and droll as the Condomines the very embodiment of British drawingroom comedy of the '40s.But Rutherford and Hammond steal the show. Rutherford in particular exhibits really astonishing emotional and vocal range in a role that can easily be onedimensionally comic. Kay Hammond somehow manages to seem to float slightly off the ground watch how she uses her hands to achieve that effect and her slightly exaggerated uppercrust diction relishes and milks the most out of her every syllable 'Twasn't a punt it was a launch sounds flat on the page but listen to what she makes of it on the stage. Or her vocal rendering of her dalliance with Captain Bracegirdle on her honeymoon with Charles in Budleigh Salterton. Priceless! While Cummings and Harrison are the two normals in Blithe Spirit Rutherford and Hammond can  and do  take every advantage of their characters' overthetop renderings physically and vocally as actors demonstrating once and for all how Coward SHOULD be played.Repeated viewings yield deeper appreciation for these performers' historic expertise as artists.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blythe Spirit has been written about by so many viewers here that it would seem redundant to go in to its entire plot summary or the performances of the entire cast. I agree with most reviewers particularly about Margaret Rutherford's performance as the spiritual medium Rex Harrison has never been one of my favorite performers but he has appeared to good effect in several of my favorite films such as Unfaithfully Yours My Fair Lady and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. He was probably the best thing about Cleopatra 1963. On the other hand if you can watch Harrison playing a man bent on driving his wifeDoris Dayinsane with a straight face his shenanigans include a series of taperecorded deaththreats delivered in a singsong semifalsetto that are not to be missed for laughs in Midnight Lace 1960 than you're stronger than me. In Harrison's defensemost of that film's problems are due to its script but still... In Blythe Spirithe is his usual irascible self and he plays his part well. I would like to make a few comments about the performance of Kay Hammond as Elvira Mr. Condimine's first deceased wife. To me she is a revelation in this film. She's a knockout extremely funny and timelessly warm. She manages to be ethereal and downtoearth in her acting while playing the part of someone who possesses both of those qualities.There is a poignant aspect to Ms. Hammond's performance a tender touch that is slightly heavier than the material calls for. If played by someone else this might have detracted from the humorous nature of the part Ms.Hammond makes it work by blending it seamlessly within her characterization. One is genuinely touched by her interpretation and we can believe that she indeed pined away for her husband from the other side. We can also see why Rex Harrison's character would have found her Elvira fascinating and lovable. Then there is the comic side of her performance which effortlessly finds its target and never misses a mark throughout. The emphasis she places on Noel Coward's dialog is letter perfect in its suggestive nuances and she employs a slight slur in her voice that is both whimsical and realistic at once. More than that her indolent line delivery using the same 'upper crust' British accent employed by the other main players turns it faintly trashysounding as if in life she wouldn't be bothered to speak with perfect diction her character would have found that tiresome. She never uses a staccato or sharp tone instead she lets the dry observations and criticisms flow from her mouth languidly they sound pleasantly lilting even as the words are acerbic to the point of acidity! Listen to her murmur The way that woman harps on bed to have me exorcised of course really she's quite bad tempered I can't see why you married her or Look at that awful picture and that terrifying dress. Note  all of these lines are directed towards the character of Ruth the second Mrs. Condimine. I've never encountered this style of underplaying before which I suppose is what inspired me to write this review. I think Kay Hammond was wonderful! I wish she had appeared more frequently on film.".

One is genuinely touched by her interpretation and we can believe that she indeed pined away for her husband from the other side. We can also see why Rex Harrison's character would have found her Elvira fascinating and lovable. Then there is the comic side of her performance which effortlessly finds its target and never misses a mark throughout. The emphasis she places on Noel Coward's dialog is letter perfect in its suggestive nuances and she employs a slight slur in her voice that is both whimsical and realistic at once. More than that her indolent line delivery using the same 'upper crust' British accent employed by the other main players turns it faintly trashysounding as if in life she wouldn't be bothered to speak with perfect diction her character would have found that tiresome. She never uses a staccato or sharp tone instead she lets the dry observations and criticisms flow from her mouth languidly they sound pleasantly lilting even as the words are acerbic to the point of acidity! Listen to her murmur The way that woman harps on bed to have me exorcised of course really she's quite bad tempered I can't see why you married her or Look at that awful picture and that terrifying dress. Note  all of these lines are directed towards the character of Ruth the second Mrs. Condimine. I've never encountered this style of underplaying before which I suppose is what inspired me to write this review. I think Kay Hammond was wonderful! I wish she had appeared more frequently on film.";

	schema:reviewBody "I must say this was a bloody good film. Unlike the other older films that I have watched this one actually had originality spunk and a whole lot of fun. Blithe Spirit is the story of a couple that is happy in every way. Rex Harrison and Constance Cummings play a couple Charles and Ruth Condomine who have been married for five years. This is both of theirs second marriage. They are seemingly wealthy due to Harrison's books that he has written. His next book is about the supernatural so he has invited the local gypsy to their house on night to not only study what she does but also for a form of entertainment. Wonderfully played by Margaret Rutherford Madame Arcati the gypsy makes her entrance and immediately sets the tone for the remainder of the film. She runs around the room like a hyperactive child standing ... sitting ... running ... and jumping she puts on a great performance for those watching. After the sance is completed with no results the two couples find themselves laughing as Arcati leaves for the night. The only one not laughing is Harrison. He has discovered that his dead wife has actually risen from the grave and can see and talk to him. The only trouble Harrison is the only one that can see her. Harrison hysterical in a Hugh Grant sort of way is not so much frightened that she is a ghost but that his exwife is back in the same room as he. He spends the evening to his current wife's displeasure talking to Edith his first wife about her current disposition. Humor suspicion and creative filmmaking continue throughout the rest of this film. The ending to this film surprised me but also kept well within the themes of this film. Rex Harrison has proved that he was one of Britain and Hollywood's greatest assets. After my first two run ins with 19401950s cinema I was ready to be board and asleep by now instead I am awake and have a huge smile on my face. It is so impressive to see such quality and original work come from this time period. Looking at the most recent horrorthriller cinema that has graced our screens lately like The Others The Sixth Sense and even The Ring it was a joy to sit back and enjoy a comedy that combines the same elements from these into a very funny caper. Taken from a play by author Noel Coward Blithe Spirit sharpens your intellect and brings you deep into the world of British comedy. The casting was perfect. This is actually my first Rex Harrison film and I cannot wait to see him again. The style of acting that he has and it may have just been for this film is not only sharp but directly on cue. I couldn't keep my eyes off the old gypsy. Her facial expressions plus mannerisms showed that she was very excited about this part. The concept of this film was extraordinary. Since I have only seen a handful of 1940s films the plot and elements in this film far exceed the others plus some of the cinema released today. I love British humor. I loved the fact that after the first ten minutes nobody was scared of these ghosts. It was like it was the normality of life for these characters. It took a little longer for Ruth to be comfortable but Charles stepped right into it. Add to this mix a surprise element about Charles' marriage brings continual laughter and surprises. So not only do we have ghosts in the house but we also have a crumbling marriage. Not only do we have a very funny film about ghosts but we also have an ending that I did not see coming at all. Overall it was not just a funny ghost film but instead a funny ghost film with a pinch of whodunit. If you are in the movie store looking for that 1940s film that will tie you over for the night please check out Blithe Spirit. I think you will thoroughly enjoy it. No spooky in any way just straight out fun!!Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "When Noel Coward wrote Blithe Spirit it was to give British audiences something to laugh at during the blitz. Odd that he picked a subject like spiritualism which became popular in the United Kingdom after the first World War when people tried to contact loved ones left dead on the Western front. It was a serious thing back in the Twenties yet Coward managed to find a whole lot of laughs in it.Blithe Spirit concerns a skeptical mystery writer who was twice married his first wife dying of illness and he's now married to the second one. The husband here is Rex Harrison and he wants to write another novel with the background being spiritualism. He invites a well known spiritual medium in Margaret Rutherford for dinner with the express purpose of seeing how she operates.Well we can't say that Rutherford didn't warn Harrison about the unintended effects that eating red meat can have. The London broil that he was serving did look superb. She has her sance with the usual rappings but when its over it turns out that Rutherford has managed to materialize Harrison's first wife Kay Hammond who only Harrison can see.Having two wives even if they exist on a different plane is a bit much for the household. The ghostly Hammond who looks fetching in that green tint she's photographed in wants to assert herself in what was her home. But that kind of gives current wife Constance Cummings a bad attitude because she's come to feel this is her home now.I can't go any farther but simply to say that Coward gives us a whole lot to think about maybe leaving the dead alone. Also just what will the arrangements be in a next life?Blithe Spirit debuting in London in 1941 in the height of the blitz ran for 1997 performances there and Kay Hammond and Margaret Rutherford recreated their roles for this film. The other stars were Cecil Parker and Fay Compton. When it got to Broadway the male lead was taken by Clifton Webb and I can certainly see Mildred Natwick in the part of the medium. The wives were Peggy Wood and Jacqueline Scott. Coward who narrates this film off screen also played the husband in touring companies.Coward's wit is certainly present in the play but the accent here is on the physical comedy and the whole absurdity of the situation. Rex Harrison on the strength of the popularity of this film on both sides of the pond got a contract from 20th Century Fox studios in America. And the role of Madame Arcati the spiritualist became the most well known one that Margaret Rutherford ever essayed until the Miss Marple films of the Sixties and her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for The VIPS.If Blithe Spirit does anything it will make you think about just what kind of arrangements one will have in a next life.

However Noel Coward's dialogue  sometimes a little difficult to catch  keeps you well amused and the acting generally is on a high level and while the camera is allowed no great scope photography is of excellent quality. The film is in Technicolour which is presumably one reason why no liberties were taken with the stage play. Rex Harrison is easily natural as the harassed husband whose first wife's spirit appears disconcertingly and later kills his second wife. She too is conjured up from the dead and the pair of them see to it that their husband is involved in a fatal accident and is forced to join them in the spirit world just as he had hoped he had got rid of them. Kay Hammond in a somewhat terrifying green makeup with scarlet fingernails is sulkily cynical as wife number one and Constance Cummings scores too as wife number two. The hit of the show is the hearty fooling of Margaret Rutherford the medium responsible for all the bother.Note  This review originally appeared in Picturegoer Magazine 12 May 1945.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen BLITHE SPIRIT several times since I was a kid and having seen it recently again I finally realized why I never thought much of this film the story just doesn't make any sense at all. The setup is excellent. Had the movie stayed at the same level as the beginning it would have been a classic but somewhere in the middle the film is derailed beyond repair with plot points that belie the whole setup. The idea of a sance that accidentally beckons the ghost of a deceased wife who then proceeds to start haunting her still living husband who's now married to a new wife is filled with potential and the way it's achieved in the first act is actually quite fun. But the second and third act don't jibe at all in the second act Ruth and Charles realize that Elvira the Ghost wants Charles for herself and Elvira is planning on killing him so she can live for all eternity with her husband. But Elvira's plan backfires as she inadvertently kills Ruth instead who when once dead runs after Elvira and torments her Charles doesn't see the dead Ruth yet.With Ruth out of the picture we only see Charles and Elvira the Ghost talking and reminiscing of their relationship. Suddenly Elvira hates Charles has always hated Charles and his boring life and she even admits she had a fling with another man when she was still married to Charles. The two bicker on and on and the comedy steams from the how can I get rid of this annoying exwife from hell who is haunting me plot line. This is when the story falls apart because the story doesn't make any sense if Elvira hated Charles so much and even had an affair with another man why would she want to kill Charles so she can stay live with him permanently in the afterlife? Her actions of wanting Charles all to herself ended up with Ruth getting killed and yet Elvira loathes her husband? Plot point 1 that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Having lost a wife again and being haunted by a wife he despises Charles is now desperate about his situation and wonders how to get rid of Elvira the Ghost. As he's trying to get rid of Elvira with the help of the medium who started the whole mess Madame Acarti wonderfully played by the eccentric Margaret Rutherford inadvertently summons the ghost of Ruth. Now Charles is haunted by two exwives Elvira and Ruth. More wacky comedy ensues. As the story moves along the medium finally realizes who is actually summoning these dead wives because Charles is certainly not the one doing it it's the maid.Huh?Why? Why would the maid who has psychic powers of some sort summon Elvira and then Ruth? No explanation is ever given for this outofleftfield storyline. I'm sure it has something to do with the very British working class tormenting the upper class thingy but even so this makes plot point 2 that doesn't make any sense.When they figure out who is responsible for the appearance of the two dead wives the medium exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished. But at the very end of the film the house is still haunted by some unseen ghost and the two dead wives weren't really banished. Instead they deliberately cause a car accident which kills Charles and at the very end we see a ghostly Charles sitting in between Elvira and Ruth on some bridge. The whole comical conclusion belies the whole setup the only time we saw the ghosts of Elvira and Ruth occurred after some sort of sance and yet we now see Charles as a ghost sitting next to his dead wives without having been summoned by anyone. Plot point 3 that doesn't make any sense at all.The film is fun sharply directed and the cast is wonderful and game but the story is completely bonkers. The whole thing feels like a play you'd see at a summer theater the type of play no one really pays any attention to the story a trifle little thing to see on a warm summer evening after downing a few gin and tonics. This film had the potential of being a classic but alas the story is so inconsistent with what it's trying to setup that it only works as a cute little movie with a cute cast and a cute idea that's never fully realized.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back story Vexille 2007 Nihon Sakoku Vexille 2007 Japan National Isolation is set in the middle of this century at about the edge of the foreseeable future. There has been rapid development in the areas of humanform robots able to assist humanity with running it's civilization. Ten years ago technology reached a point where completely humanmade robots reached the peak of their potential. The trend shifted towards the augmentation of the human body and the merging of man and machine. However the basis and ethical implications of such technology were condemned by international treaties and organizations and all development was banned. Japan the world leader in robotics was completely opposed to the condemnation and the potential ban it found imposed on itself. Japan withdrew from the international community and went into national isolation.Ten years later there have been no visitors allowed in or out of Japan. There has been no cultural contact and no shared media from Japan since the isolation. However despite the selfimposed isolation Japan remains the world leader in the field of robotics. The robots manufactured by the conglomerate DAIWA can be seen all over L.A. able to assist mankind with maintaining it's civilization. Before the isolation the robotics industry was so vital to Japan that DAIWA had grown in to a colossal megaconglomerate with strong ties to every part of the government.After two incidents of terrorism by DAIWA outside of Japanese territory America discovers that Japan may well have cyborg technology. Fearing the worst America sends its most highly specialized team Sword to secretly infiltrate Japan and gather intelligence.The CG There's no doubt that the CG is an important part of the appeal of this film and for the most part I think it comes off very well. Fans of the last major CG film released outside Japan will feel very at home with the visual style's blend of very photo realistic elements such as mechs landscapes and highpaced action scenes with lowpolly toonshaded actors. Although landscapes mechs and characters are all very pleasing to the eye the one complaint I have is that the characters sometimes suffer from very stiff movement where motion capture seems to not have been used. Sometimes this stiff movement will happen between cuts in the middle of a scene which tended to remind me that I was watching a CG movie.The Music The film also follows a similar flare to Appleseed in its choice of dance and electronic artists such as Basement Jaxx Boom Boom Satellites Carl Craig etc and other more aesthetic tracks by Paul Okenfold. The blend of music does a good job of making the movie come alive without sounding forced.The story The story was the most important thing for me and probably the hardest to criticize. I enjoyed the story very much  the progression is smooth and easy to follow. The characters are presented well and developed in enough detail to satisfy the viewer. The story progression starts very quickly and immediately moves into meat of the story which is infiltrating Japan. The story is spread out with a lot of action scenes no doubt because this is a CG movie. Most of which do a job in telling the story but truth be told are mostly for eyecandy value.The main criticism I have of the story comes down to the complexity and presentation. I think as a CG film Vexille didn't have enough time to devote to its story.With a story so central to people and events of the past I feel Vexille falls short in its delivery of everything it set up  including the back story. Because of time constraints  probably both in production and running time  most of the story's revelations and plot points happen quite close together which means the viewer's attention is often pulled away from one revelation to a new facet of the story which does tend to dull the experience in the more dramatic scenes and leaves little time to savour the experience.In all honesty I think a more expanded Vexille story could have easily filled another film with a little bit still taken out. Of course this is a natural part of cinema and storytelling but it doesn't make it any less disappointing.Final Verdict I think Vexille is quite a solid CG film that stands apart from Applesed with its own qualities and enough differences to enjoy it for what it is. Although I was slightly disappointed by story in what I personally wanted to see I think that just shows it to be a fairly wellbalanced film that I would recommend to anyone with a taste for action CG or Japanese entertainment.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Vexille";
	schema:reviewBody "This year had perhaps seen a bumper crop of anime movies making it to the theatres with the likes of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time Paprika Brave Story Doraemon and now a science fiction mecha genre anime by the producer of Appleseed Fumihiko Sori.Set in the middle of the 21st century the world has become like that in Isaac Asimov novels with robots having the intelligence finally to assist mankind in various tasks which doesn't discount the fact that they'll be used in warfare too with creations resembling those seen in Clone Wars. Coming from the largest factory in the world Japan for their technological genius the world soon frowns upon their quest to fuse robots and humans much like the brouhaha on potential abuse of stem cell technology and Japan decides to shut itself off from the rest of the world.Naturally US foreign policy dictates that they are curious as to what's going on behind the iron curtain so they send their crack paramilitary unit called SWORD to infiltrate Japan. They are afraid of the potential threat the robots give to humankind and more so are suspicious of the largest conglomerate and robot producer Daiwa Heavy Industries who are dabbling into questionable robotic research. Led by Leon voiced by Shosuke Tanihara it goes without saying that titular character Vexille Meisa Kuroki will get to save the day hey it's her name on the billboard. Interestingly enough though this movie has its weight put on the strength of its female characters Vexille and rebel fighter Maria Yasuko MatsuyukiThere are many familiar elements in Vexille both character and plot wise but that doesn't detract from the fact that there still are a number of plus points leading to the enjoyment of this movie. The designs of the mecha used by SWORD units which is like an exoskeleton suit designed for middleweight individual battles are crafted to look like they just walked out of any generic Hollywood science fiction movie as do the enemy's guard droids which look like they were heavily influenced by Robocop's ED209.And with the many ships and transporters can someone say Star Wars too? But the one that takes the cake is the postapocalyptic look at Japan making it seem like the planet of Arakis from Frank Herbert's Dune complete with their version of the Fremen with their tinkering prowess and those monstrous lethal sandworms too which take on a mechanical facade over here known as Jags. Even the inevitable finale seemed to have taken a leaf from Herbert's literary masterpiece.As with any mecharelated stories there's always a tussle between what it means to be a human and android erm Blade Runner? and the hopes and dreams to preserve their way of life against a megalomaniac industrialist who shares six degrees of separation with everyone involved. But we're not really here for rehashed cyberpunk stories involving the first 2 installments of the Animatrix are we? We're here for the action pieces and boy they don't disappoint.

	onyx:emotionText "This year had perhaps seen a bumper crop of anime movies making it to the theatres with the likes of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time Paprika Brave Story Doraemon and now a science fiction mecha genre anime by the producer of Appleseed Fumihiko Sori.Set in the middle of the 21st century the world has become like that in Isaac Asimov novels with robots having the intelligence finally to assist mankind in various tasks which doesn't discount the fact that they'll be used in warfare too with creations resembling those seen in Clone Wars. Coming from the largest factory in the world Japan for their technological genius the world soon frowns upon their quest to fuse robots and humans much like the brouhaha on potential abuse of stem cell technology and Japan decides to shut itself off from the rest of the world.Naturally US foreign policy dictates that they are curious as to what's going on behind the iron curtain so they send their crack paramilitary unit called SWORD to infiltrate Japan. They are afraid of the potential threat the robots give to humankind and more so are suspicious of the largest conglomerate and robot producer Daiwa Heavy Industries who are dabbling into questionable robotic research. Led by Leon voiced by Shosuke Tanihara it goes without saying that titular character Vexille Meisa Kuroki will get to save the day hey it's her name on the billboard. Interestingly enough though this movie has its weight put on the strength of its female characters Vexille and rebel fighter Maria Yasuko MatsuyukiThere are many familiar elements in Vexille both character and plot wise but that doesn't detract from the fact that there still are a number of plus points leading to the enjoyment of this movie. The designs of the mecha used by SWORD units which is like an exoskeleton suit designed for middleweight individual battles are crafted to look like they just walked out of any generic Hollywood science fiction movie as do the enemy's guard droids which look like they were heavily influenced by Robocop's ED209.And with the many ships and transporters can someone say Star Wars too? But the one that takes the cake is the postapocalyptic look at Japan making it seem like the planet of Arakis from Frank Herbert's Dune complete with their version of the Fremen with their tinkering prowess and those monstrous lethal sandworms too which take on a mechanical facade over here known as Jags. Even the inevitable finale seemed to have taken a leaf from Herbert's literary masterpiece.As with any mecharelated stories there's always a tussle between what it means to be a human and android erm Blade Runner? and the hopes and dreams to preserve their way of life against a megalomaniac industrialist who shares six degrees of separation with everyone involved. But we're not really here for rehashed cyberpunk stories involving the first 2 installments of the Animatrix are we? We're here for the action pieces and boy they don't disappoint. From the get go we're treated to a full scale assault and brought to see what SWORD can do and it played out to John Wooish distinction with plenty of violence set to slow motion with numerous guns blazing that would even make the master proud.

	schema:reviewBody "Went into Vexille on the heels of the disappointing Appleseed Ex Machina and was BLOWN AWAY. Everything about this is top notch the storyline while involved is still easy to follow and very engaging. You care about characters when they die even the ones with limited screen time. For a standard read non HD disc the image is fantastic though I watched it on a PS3 so the upconverting may have helped. The surround sound mix is totally immersive and goes a long way to bring you into the story. The action sequences while somewhat derivative are brilliant and very well staged and executed. All of this is served spectacularly well by the music which is a combination of Oakenfold's signature breakbeat techno and selected songs by other artists and is never off putting or out of place. Also the anime style a blend of cell shaded 2D and CGI is reminiscent of Appleseed only a bit more fluid and stylized. The Japanese audio track is solid as to be expected and to my surprise the English dub is actually very well done. Bonus points for that.All told Vexille is a must buy for cyberpunk sci fi and anime afficionados and is definitely reference material for your home theatre system.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.".

We have an evil genius type of bad guy with thin motivation for...taking over the world of course because he needs test subjects for an experiment. Does that sound believable to you? Granted it's all fiction but it has to be at least a little authentic. Anyway the good guys aren't much better. In fact they're extremely generic we have the main girl who's extremely emotional in spite of being part of the film's version of SWAT who also carry out CIAtype missions. Then we have a hard ass girl who's the main girl's ex. Both girls are pretty much eye candy and nothing more. Then we have the dude they're both after who does nothing except getting captured thus being in need of rescuing by the two girls. Then we have...the plot. Which is full of holes so big Leonidas could throw in the whole Persian army inside it in the blink of an eye. You'll see what I mean if you decide to watch this. If you don't...well basically there's a company taking over Japan on its own and turning it into a wasteland. How does a single company take over a whole country? How does it fall so easily after two girls infiltrate it when it's supposed to be so powerful? Beats me. So much more could have been done with this with some more thought. That's really all it required. The writers sitting down and figuring out some tighter storyline rather than getting the easy way out and shrugging off all coherence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where did this movie come from? I rented it with reserved anticipation because it looked like another generic anime action movie. I had no idea I was about to witness the greatest animated cinematic experience of my entire life.Over the past few years I've grown fond of Japanese anime action films. My favorites are Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Appleseed Karas The Prophecy and Revelation and Ghost In the Shell. Yeah I also like a lot of the artsy stuff like 5 Centimeters Per Second The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and the most of the Studio Ghibli portfolio but nothing wets my palette like a great anime action movie. And my goodness did Vexille wet my palette! In the year 2077 an elite commando unit infiltrates Japan to expose their technological secrets to the world. Character development is weak but the storyline is excellent with plenty of engaging scenarios unexpected surprises and formidable antagonists. The visuals are outstanding and the score is unorthodox and refreshing. The action scenes are also stunning. Whether it's a mansion infiltration a high speed motorcycle pursuit or an escape from enigmatic machina the choreography editing and placement of the virtual camera are all top notch. One 11minute scene is unquestionably the most nerveracking and utterly spectacular actionsuspense sequence in the history of animated cinema. Nothing comes close to this in the world of anime action. Nothing.Now anyone who reads my other IMDb comments knows that there are two things that I really hate Hollywood movies and arthouse snobs. Of course I'm sure that those stuckup snobs will urinate all over this movie due to the relative lack of character development but Vexille thrives so much on the action and storyline that the characters earn our concern because of how they are absorbed within this exceptionally crafted conflict. This is NOT a brainless action movie. The aforementioned 11minute extravaganza does not exist for eye candy and superficial beauty alone like most of the scenes in FFVII Advent Children. It has a significant emotional weight behind it which makes the viewer clench their seat in apprehension for every single second of the entire sequence. I know I know the snobs would rather watch a couple kids walk around in a war zone collecting rice for two hours instead of an entertaining action movie. So maybe they should just spare us the high and mighty routine and not even bother watching this movie to begin with. God knows they should've skipped The Machine Girl. One enigmatic complaint I've heard on the web is with regards to the dialogue. Some have claimed it to be cheesy but I honestly cannot recall more than one or two sentences that apply. Believe me I know cheese when I see it. Most of the dialogue is rather intelligent and there is a noticeable lack of melodrama. Seriously there are virtually NO eyerolling moments in this movie which is a huge positive.I honestly cannot express in words how awesome Vexille is. It's almost like I'm in a state of shock or something because I just can't get this movie out of my head for a split second. Things might change over the course of weeks and subsequent viewings of which there will be many I promise you that but as of this very moment this film may have just cracked my Top 20 All Time list live action included.Just watch it and judge for yourself. From the very first shot right up til the end this movie is just nonstop entertainment. And why on earth are theaters showing some stupid kung fu panda tripe instead of this spectacular action film?".

	schema:reviewBody "Ping Pong is one of the greatest and most welldirected sports movie ever made. I am quite disappointed Souri Fumihiro's second attempt turned out to be such a failure. The setting of this film was extremely creative and promising. Japan became a closed nation in 2067 in retaliation against international restriction on robotic technology. In the past 10 years no one has seen the true Japan was an extremely impactful quote to begin the story. Unfortunately things take a downturn once the heroine reaches Japan.Surprisingly people in Japan was living in a nearly homeless condition and Tokyo had turned into one large slum. I must say I was a bit disappointed I wouldn't see all the amazing technologies but it was a nice twist that offered another promising story. What really disappointed me was how there were so many things that didn't make sense. If no one had seen Japan for 10 years and their guard was so perfect how did Vexille and team so effortlessly infiltrate Japan? The very existence of those Jags were way too random and its structure makes absolutely no sense. What was its power source? Why the worm structure?

I understand this movie is a science FICTION but all stories must be plausible given the setting.

Some scenes were excessively cheesy even for an anime and other than intro music choice was very poor. The most disturbing thing was the inconsistency in computer graphics.

	onyx:emotionText "Ping Pong is one of the greatest and most welldirected sports movie ever made. I am quite disappointed Souri Fumihiro's second attempt turned out to be such a failure. The setting of this film was extremely creative and promising. Japan became a closed nation in 2067 in retaliation against international restriction on robotic technology. In the past 10 years no one has seen the true Japan was an extremely impactful quote to begin the story. Unfortunately things take a downturn once the heroine reaches Japan.Surprisingly people in Japan was living in a nearly homeless condition and Tokyo had turned into one large slum. I must say I was a bit disappointed I wouldn't see all the amazing technologies but it was a nice twist that offered another promising story. What really disappointed me was how there were so many things that didn't make sense. If no one had seen Japan for 10 years and their guard was so perfect how did Vexille and team so effortlessly infiltrate Japan? The very existence of those Jags were way too random and its structure makes absolutely no sense. What was its power source? Why the worm structure? It just felt like they needed a device to show off the computer graphics. Another thing is how can a company become so powerful that it completely control Japanese government? No amount of corruption can allow virus injection to the entire population. And why oh why nobody in the street was surprised to see a white girl walking around when no foreigner had visited Japan for 10 years?

Also though not all of the reviewers agree my opinion of the action in this film was that it was sweet and sick in the most radical fashion. For the animation and action alone this film is totally worth the price of a rental. Which brings us to the plot of the film while some reviewers thought the plot was empty or lacked merit I am of the opinion that those reviewers probably didn't pay attention to all of the dialog. The plot was well developed more believable than several of the bigbudget liveaction Hollywood films such as The Happening which totally sucked and played along the social issue of fear of technological invasiveness quite nicely though it was a rather formulaic script. The dialog was a little weak and there wasn't much for serious character development but the nonverbal scripting played quite well. After all this was an animated action flick and quite frankly it was one of the better offerings from the anime genre in recent years. To recap this is worth the cost of the rental if only for the visual imagery. However if you have a well developed sensibility for the suspension of disbelief then you will also likely enjoy the story as a whole. I know that I certainly did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Masamune Shirow pen name for revolutionary cyperpunk visionaryartist Ota Masanori has wowed audiences around the world with his ultradetailed future design works and realistic militaryinspired mecha in manga works like Black Magic M66 Dominion Appleseed and most notably Ghost In The Shell. Many of Shirow's influential works have been adapted to both film and TV. If Vexille bears more than a passing resemblance to Shirow's cyperpunk world then that is quite possibly intentional as both writerdirector Sori Fumihiko and cowriter Handa Haruka worked on the film adaptation of Shirow's long running and much heralded manga Appleseed in 2004.At first glance Vexille an animated feature incorporating both traditional 2D as well as cuttingedge 3D animation seems like an adaptation of one of Shirow's stories but is in fact an original work by Sori and Handa that seems as if to be a homage to Shirow's work as it has many of his trademark themes  the strong gutsy heroine the omni present corporate entityzaibatsu the fascination for futuristic military hardware and robotics the clash between the human and machine cultures.Originally released in Japan during the late summer of 2007 it was surprisingly overlooked by audiences in Japan. Perhaps it was cyberpunk anime overkill as the genre seemed to played to death in the last couple of years or maybe it had something to do with Sori and Handa's selfcritical screenplay which focused on an alternate reality Japan whose cybernetictechnological ambitions and industrial dominance causes the country to become a rogue government in the eyes of the world.The story of Vexille seems to recall Japan's WWII Imperial aspirations as Japan leads a technological revolution spearheaded by one of it's leading industrial conglomerates Daiwa and begins development of technologies relating to radical cloning bioengineering and humanmachine integration. This outrages the international community which sees these new technological applications as perverse. The United Nations orders Japan to stop all further development in these areas but Japan retaliates by sanctioning a policy of complete isolationism from the rest of the world and goes as far as erecting an electromagnetic barrier around its borders which prevents any communications in and out of the country reminiscent to the Tokugawa Sakoku closed country period between 16331639 from which part of the title references. Ten years pass and American covert operational forces intercept communication that Japan's experimentations in cloning and cybernetics has reached a new level of sophistication that can transform humans into cyborgs. A task force codenamed SWORD is dispatched to infiltrate Japan's zone barriers to investigate this threat.Vexille borrows liberally from countless scifi films from the past several decades most notably Blade Runner Escape From New York Matrix and Dune as well as other Japanese anime films including Ghost In The Shell and of course Appleseed.Title character Vexille is voiced by the fetching Okinawan half Eurasian actress Kuroki Meisa who made a notable movie debut in Kamyu Nante ShiranaiWho Is Camus. She does very good work here as the spunky heroine with the weird French? name. She is the typical scifi heroine  strong smart beautiful and more than a match for any man. Surprisingly even though the character of Vexille is supposed to be American she looks eerily like Japanese Azumi actress Ueto Aya. Similarly Daiwa villain and henchman Saito voiced with menacing glee by seiyuu actor Otsuka Akio looks a lot like actor Watanabe Ken.I was somewhat bemused by the stark character design contrasts in the film. Outside of the lead characters of Vexille and Maria almost all the supporting and background people seem photorealistic in appearance foregoing many of the Japanese anime conventions we normally see overexpressive wide eyes strangely colored hair perfect complexion. I'm not sure why Sori and his design team went this route as it is strangely odd. I would have loved to have seen Vexille Maria and Leon rendered in a more realistic fashion instead of in stylized anime perfection. I also found it quite perplexing that most of the American character looked Asian or mixed. I saw very few if any typically White AngloSaxon looking characters or nonAsians African American Hispanic Middle Eastern European. Perhaps this was intentional on the part of Sori a statement against media preference for the blond blueeyed ideal or maybe I'm reading too much into the film's racial commentaries of the future.Outside of Yasuko Matsuyuki Hula Girls Another Heaven who voices the sexy rebel leader Maria and seiyuu actor Toshiyuki Morikawa Last Exile Bleach Inuyasha Devil May Cry who plays Daiwa Industries CEO Kisaragi the rest of the cast does serviceable but not particularly distinguishable voice work as supporting characters.The CGIanime work by Oxybot's Takata Toshinori and Yosumi Hidetaka are absolutely stunning and breathtaking incorporating a unique blend of traditional 2D anime style and photo realistic 3D effects. The world of Vexille is absolutely mesmerizing and recalls similar CGI work done in Appleseed and some more recent Japanese TV anime like Zoids and Ghost In The Shell  Stand Alone Complex. In some ways it trumps the motioncapture work of the recent Beowulf. While sometimes coming off as the type of cinema CGI one would possibly see in such video games like Halo Oxybot's work here is truly eyecatching and spectacular but not groundbreaking in scope as Pixar's CGI work in its films like Cars Ratatouille or The Incredibles.With all its flash and fancy Vexille is undone by its cold and emotionless story which goes through the standard motions of a scifi film but does not bring with it any human drama. People die but because they are cyborgclones there is no emotional impact. A similar criticism could be said of other CGI heavy films such as Awazu Jun's Negadon and the most recent Cloverfield both of which also had superior CGI effects but surprisingly very little human elements.".

	schema:headline " a very ironic film";
	schema:reviewBody "A movie that is protesting the mechanization of human beings... and the destruction of the soul.... is entirely CGI and is full of mindless and pointless violence and special effects.The best character is Maria. This character fascinated me... the only character i can remember to speak less is Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the old Sergio Leone western movies. It is a credit to the animators and artists and voice actor ... did they use motion capture? if so then the actor as well to portray this character as she is portrayed.Actually Saito isn't too bad there are one or two scenes that hint at his complexity... but it is hard to find them when buildings are exploding airplanes are slamming through windows explosions pound inside your head etc.The kid character is not too bad... not great though. Wanted to know more about him. Sadly I feel I know more about 'walle' the robot in the Disney movie than about this kid who is so eager to go off to battle.Some other strange things a kid going to battle whats his relationship with Maria? child?.. the neverexplained desecration of the entire island of Japan the lack of curiosity that Vexille displays about this ie how about 'where is mt fuji?' Oh yeah. Actually the entire damn plot is strange and makes no sense. I half expected for the movie to stop in some parts and et me play a level of 'starcraft'. That is the level of exposition we are talking about here... just people droning on about missions and '50 years ago the xyz corporation blah blah blah'. The thing with the iron wire makes absolutely no sense the giant wall is the same... the inability of the 'jags' to jump when they jump all over the land.

It is a much better film than Indiana Jones 4. . . and even I like it better than some of the Star Wars prequels.If nothing else it is unique and if you just see 5 minutes of it for the visual effects of the jag just do it. Or if you actually want a story fast forward to the scenes where Maria 'reacts' to events happening around her.. and see her 'discussion' with Vexille... I found these scenes to be fascinating. If you only care about action you will not be disappointed.But if you have to have things polished up with nice neat plots to tie things together logically... you need to take a leap of faith before you are going to get any enjoyment out of this film.Bye and thanks for reading.".

	onyx:emotionText "A movie that is protesting the mechanization of human beings... and the destruction of the soul.... is entirely CGI and is full of mindless and pointless violence and special effects.The best character is Maria. This character fascinated me... the only character i can remember to speak less is Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the old Sergio Leone western movies. It is a credit to the animators and artists and voice actor ... did they use motion capture? if so then the actor as well to portray this character as she is portrayed.Actually Saito isn't too bad there are one or two scenes that hint at his complexity... but it is hard to find them when buildings are exploding airplanes are slamming through windows explosions pound inside your head etc.The kid character is not too bad... not great though. Wanted to know more about him. Sadly I feel I know more about 'walle' the robot in the Disney movie than about this kid who is so eager to go off to battle.Some other strange things a kid going to battle whats his relationship with Maria? child?.. the neverexplained desecration of the entire island of Japan the lack of curiosity that Vexille displays about this ie how about 'where is mt fuji?' Oh yeah. Actually the entire damn plot is strange and makes no sense. I half expected for the movie to stop in some parts and et me play a level of 'starcraft'. That is the level of exposition we are talking about here... just people droning on about missions and '50 years ago the xyz corporation blah blah blah'. The thing with the iron wire makes absolutely no sense the giant wall is the same... the inability of the 'jags' to jump when they jump all over the land. Why does the city have gates in the first place? How about a tiny little hole you drive out of? If the security is so tight why are the top of the walls safe to hang around on? Why attack America?

Too bad that the first Appleseed although not too great in itself did circles around this utterly meandering story. I am not sure who thought that this had a complete story to begin with. It very much seemed like they just decided to do a bunch of cool CG then decided to fit in some sort of storyline as an afterthought. As I wrote in my heading you will probably get just as much out of this with the mute button on as you would with it off. I would suggest skipping this unless you are a hardcore Japanese Anime fan.

There were many scenes throughout this film that blew me away. The camera angles choreography and the atypical soundtrack were all done and chosen impeccably. There is a particular action sequence in this film which had me riveted to my seat and completely engrossed to my screen.A lot of people have said that the dialogue is pretty dry they're right but I found that the depth of this story is almost completely revealed through the images on the screen than through the narration. As a result the limited dialogue allows you to insert many of your own emotions into the film making it a very unique and personal experience.Overall the film is an enthralling story of survival and salvation in a very bleak and downright frightening future.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to start out by saying that the artwork and animation in this film are gorgeous. Truly beautiful art stunningly realistic animations. My only complaints about the art are pretty typical anime complaints everyone's hair looks like leaves from some kind of weird plant growth on their head and there is no detail in anyone's face so everyone pretty much looks alike except for having different colored leaves on their heads. This is truest of the 2 female lead characters who are virtually indistinguishable looking.Where the movie fails is in the story the characters character reactions the science the sociology and nearly everything else that doesn't have to do with the visual aspect of the film.The movie contradicts it's own internal logic over and over again. It ignores basic physics biology and sociology. Here's some examples1. People in huge metal exosuits are able to sneak around. They can smash thru house walls but when they infiltrate a house they move like a commando team as if no one can hear the incredible racket that half a dozen 8 foot tall robots would make. Somehow the exosuited people are able to climb stairs that could in no way hold their weight.2. People in exos are surprised by a group of RPG launching soldiers. Why wouldn't these exos have radar or other bio signature reading capabilities?3. The mission they are on requires a device to be active for 3 minutes. Why is the exfil for their mission 72 hours after insertion? Makes no sense.4. When the last ditch effort to crush Daiwa happens it is foiled because the tunnels are a greater distance from the facility than thought. One of the bad guys opines jags aren't much for jumping as an explanation for why the facility is safe. WTF? We just spent like 20 minutes watching these things swim thru dirt and leap hundreds of feet into the air covering hundreds of lateral feet per jump.5. People react all wrong to emotional triggers. Vexille cries out in aguish at Maria's death. WTF? She just met Maria and Maria isn't even human. Vexille is upset that Maria shot Takeshi after he turned. Why? She just met Takeshi and she knows he isn't human anymore. Vexille is also perturbed by many small horrors all of which are not realistic depictions IMO of this character. She's a freaking special ops commando one of the most elite of elite yet she's bothered by little things even more than a 1950s sitcom mom would have been.6. There's just too much more in the film that isn't believable isn't at all true to real life and which violates the conventions set up in the film. If a film's own internal logic isn't consistent it's difficult if not impossible to understand and empathize with what's happening and that's what happens in this film. It's understandable if complete nonsense but there's no way to empathize or feel anything for anyone in this film.7. Which leads to this point there is no real attempt to give us any characters with any depth whatsoever. Everyone in the film is so flat that they are aren't just two dimensional they are nearly onedimensional.The few early attempts to humanize even the humans in film are too short Vexille talking to a fellow commando asks him if he heard from his wifegirlfriend and he says not since she left and that's it.One quick shot of Vexille and Leon together at home to establish their relationship a reluctant embrace after a confrontation about Leon's past and that's it. Other than that everyone in the movie is a prop including Vexille.8. It's fine to play loose with science in science fiction but visually its hard to watch enormous heavy things flying on rockets that can turn on a dime as if they had no inertia of their own. Weight mass inertia are all absent from the world this film inhabits.9. I just wanted to point out since others have made comments about Paul Oakenfold's involvement that Paul Oakenfold is a DJ. He did not write the music for this film he simply selected songs for it. Mr. Oakenfold is very good at what he does and for the most part the music fit the scenes it was paired with but to credit him with the music is wrong. He just picked the songs he didn't write and record them. Much of the film was maddening to watch since it was so ridiculous yet I've watched this 3 times now and will likely watch it more. Why? It's amazing to look at. The visual style the colors the lighting the camerawork yes the camerawork! are all stunning and they are so overwhelmingly awesome that they make the movie watchable.If we could just get a story from a manga writer that wasn't a completely incomprehensible bhackneyed beyond belief and c filled with crappy pseudophilosophical undertones I'm looking at you Ghost In The Shell... and Akira... and Appleseed... and nearly every other anime that isn't Dragonball Z there is no doubt in my mind that mainstream audiences would be excited about the format and turn out in droves to see it.Overall if you like anime already I'd be surprised if you didn't like this film. If you're new to anime you'll probably like this film. If you think that The Matrix Revolutions and Reloaded were the best thing to happen to movies EVAH you'll prolly like this.If you thought that Phantom Menace was crap if you didn't bother with anything Star Trek since they added psychics if you hold out on seeing a movie because Ben Affleck is in it without Kevin Smith directing... you may want to just rent this one or even better get a friend to rent it.".

This is the kind of movie that has themes that a 15 year old would find incredibly deep and philosophical mixing in generic cyberpunk themes with Romanticism and technophobia. Very little of the movie was actually engaging.

He's also got his Tae Kwon Do school back after telling folk in the last film he gave it up. Heyho. Let's not over think things.Who's gonna mess with Tommy's family this time and then act all surprised when his cheesy feet start zooming towards their faces knocking their teeth out and stuff? This time you've got the bad guy from Saw some other guy and Killian's henchman from The Running Man out to get a disc from Tommy that he didn't even know he had as some girl slipped it into his pocket shortly before being machine gunned to death by a bad guy from some counterfeiting gang.This gang steal and entire truck at the start of the film and waste loads of cops so we know they mean business. They also prove to be the biggest bunch of morons Tommy's had to face as they do the one thing that Tommy hates the most  That's right they target his family.Blah blah fight scenes blah blah threats. Tommy kicks his way through a lot of bad guys in this one but I reckon we spend a bit too much time with the bad guys infighting rather that Tommy jumping all over their heads. He's also managed to go up against bad guys that take themselves out! Not only are they all threatening and shooting each other one of them manages to kill more bad guys than Tommy.Seriously there's loads of bad guys chasing Tommy at one end of a tunnel on motorbikes and this one guy at the other end of the tunnel grabs a truck and speeds towards them then misses Tommy then hits the rest of the bad guys causing a huge explosion that takes out a helicopter too. All Tommy had to do was get out of the way.Phillip Rhee also directs this one too and it'll do for a quick action fix. The second film's the best one in the series by my reckoning. I think there was plans for a fifth one where Tommy didn't even bother getting out of bed while the bad guys just took care of themselves.".

As a fan of best of the best this movie was highly entertaining. its somewhat in the mold of diehard type action however nobody does fight scenes quite like Phillip Rhee still known as Tommy Lee in the movie and so calling it an imitator is misleading since rhee brings so much more to the action due to his martial arts background. In these type of movies its never about the plot but how the overall movie flows and entertains. tommy lee is a likable hero as usual and the supporting cast are as well. the bad guys are even very entertaining to watch. while this movie can never have the budget of die hard in my opinion it has more likable and realistic characters. If your a fan please ignore the haters just don't expect this to be anything like 1 and 2 or as good. its better than 3 which itself was good and underrated in my opinion. I can understand fans complaints that this movie has nothing to do with the best of the best universe that is true however its still a movie that stands on its own and provides fans of Phillip Rhee yet another good action movie with heart.

Can Tommy Lee stop the counterfeiting agents rescue his friends and daughter from imminent doom and clear his own name in the process? Some people might think about the Best of the Best series there are FOUR of them? While it may seem puzzling and hard to justify this fourth entry in the series was solid fun and worth seeing. Phillip Rhee is a very talented guy  he stars in the film he directed it cowrote it and he's a gifted martial artist and worked on the choreography. He's also likable. Rhee does seem to have wellrounded skills and because of this his name should be more wellknown outside of diehard action circles. He's so badass he doesn't turn off his lights at night using a lightswitch like a sucker he JUMPKICKS his lights off.Supporting him is an impressive array of Bmovie names. Tobin Bell puts in an understated lowkey villain performance which was a welcome change from the frothingatthemouth baddies we usually see. He pulls off a tricky balance  be subtle but not be boring. He does a great job and interestingly there's some preSaw torture he's involved with. Coincidence? Or did the makers of the unending Saw franchise see this movie and picture him as the ultimate torturer? And speaking of people who probably saw this movie there's an American Beauty 1999like fantasy sequence one year before that film. Is it possible the American Beauty people saw this movie and thought If we rip this off no one will know because we don't share any of the same audience? Hudson plays the BYD instead of Black Yelling Chief here he's a detective and there's even a fight scene between him and Rhee where Hudson attempts some HudsonFu on him. Chris Lemmon's not in it that much and resembles Joe Piscopo. It's no Firehead 1991 for him. Paul Gleason Art LaFleur and SvenOle Thorsen round out the cast of familiar faces and someone who's been turning up a lot lately David Shark Fralick Deadly Reckoning 1998 Executive Target 1997 Inside Edge 1992 is on board as well.A highlight of the movie is a combination stickfightingfencing fight scene.

	schema:headline " Not as bad as it could have been.";
	schema:reviewBody "Best of the Best Without Warning is set in Los Angeles  starts as two Russian gangsters Yuri Thure Riefenstein  Karina Jessic Collins bluff their way into city traffic control  kill everyone there they cause chaos on the streets  every road is gridlocked this confusion gives their Russian mobster mates the chance to steal a federal truck with blank bank note paper  a CD of US dollar bill typefaces. Together it's an easy way to print up untraceable money Russian mobster Lukasz Tobin Bell can now print real money on real bank note paper using the real typeface. A young woman named Mickey Jill Ritchie develops a conscience  decide to steal the CD  hand it over to the DA but the Russian mobsters find out her plan  go after her. They shoot her dead in a shop but not before she slips the CD into the pocket of martial arts trainer Tommy Lee cowriter executive producer  director Phillip Rhee who the Russian mob then go after using his daughter as a hostage the Russians want Tommy to hand the CD over but he is unsure of who he can trust...Cowritten executive produced  directed by Phillip Rhee who also stars in the thing I didn't have particularly high hopes for the fourth entry in the Best of the Best franchise but to my surprise like the previous sequels I didn't think it was half bad sure it's no masterpiece  Best of the Best 2 1993 is still the best of the Best of the Best ! films but to be fair they all are all quite watchable. Series continuity disappeared a long time ago from being an only child the original Best of the Best 1989 martial arts star Tommy Lee suddenly got a sister from nowhere in Best of the Best 3 No Turning Back 1995 while here he was not only married but he actually has a five year old daughter where did she come from? Then there's the oath never to instruct martial arts again in part three but here he's training the LAPD. To be fair the Best of the Best films have little in common they all seem to have started life as routine action film scripts that were then slightly rewritten to include Tommy Lee who is the only consistent between the four films. Having fought illegal pitfighters  Nazi racists this time Tommy Lee comes up against the Russian mafia. Now having seen all four Best of the Best films I can say that it's dangerous to know Tommy Lee I mean trouble follows this guy around like a bad smell. Bad cops drunks mobsters racists thugs hit men illegal fighters  his drunken brother have all given him a hard time  targeted his friends  family. In Best of the Best Without Warning his mate the shopkeeper his daughter  a Priest all get a rough deal merely by association with Tommy Lee. As far as action potboilers go this is fairy good the plot moves along at a decent pace the character's are alright even if the good cop bad cop twist is too obvious  it passes the time harmlessly enough I suppose.The action scenes save this really the fights are again well choreographed  there's an audacious if farfetched hijacking at the start in the middle of Los Angeles.

	onyx:emotionText "Best of the Best Without Warning is set in Los Angeles  starts as two Russian gangsters Yuri Thure Riefenstein  Karina Jessic Collins bluff their way into city traffic control  kill everyone there they cause chaos on the streets  every road is gridlocked this confusion gives their Russian mobster mates the chance to steal a federal truck with blank bank note paper  a CD of US dollar bill typefaces. Together it's an easy way to print up untraceable money Russian mobster Lukasz Tobin Bell can now print real money on real bank note paper using the real typeface. A young woman named Mickey Jill Ritchie develops a conscience  decide to steal the CD  hand it over to the DA but the Russian mobsters find out her plan  go after her. They shoot her dead in a shop but not before she slips the CD into the pocket of martial arts trainer Tommy Lee cowriter executive producer  director Phillip Rhee who the Russian mob then go after using his daughter as a hostage the Russians want Tommy to hand the CD over but he is unsure of who he can trust...Cowritten executive produced  directed by Phillip Rhee who also stars in the thing I didn't have particularly high hopes for the fourth entry in the Best of the Best franchise but to my surprise like the previous sequels I didn't think it was half bad sure it's no masterpiece  Best of the Best 2 1993 is still the best of the Best of the Best ! films but to be fair they all are all quite watchable. Series continuity disappeared a long time ago from being an only child the original Best of the Best 1989 martial arts star Tommy Lee suddenly got a sister from nowhere in Best of the Best 3 No Turning Back 1995 while here he was not only married but he actually has a five year old daughter where did she come from? Then there's the oath never to instruct martial arts again in part three but here he's training the LAPD. To be fair the Best of the Best films have little in common they all seem to have started life as routine action film scripts that were then slightly rewritten to include Tommy Lee who is the only consistent between the four films. Having fought illegal pitfighters  Nazi racists this time Tommy Lee comes up against the Russian mafia. Now having seen all four Best of the Best films I can say that it's dangerous to know Tommy Lee I mean trouble follows this guy around like a bad smell. Bad cops drunks mobsters racists thugs hit men illegal fighters  his drunken brother have all given him a hard time  targeted his friends  family. In Best of the Best Without Warning his mate the shopkeeper his daughter  a Priest all get a rough deal merely by association with Tommy Lee. As far as action potboilers go this is fairy good the plot moves along at a decent pace the character's are alright even if the good cop bad cop twist is too obvious  it passes the time harmlessly enough I suppose.The action scenes save this really the fights are again well choreographed  there's an audacious if farfetched hijacking at the start in the middle of Los Angeles. There's some shootouts a cool scene with Tommy Lee on a motorbike in a tunnel with a huge taker truck heading straight for him  a cool scene of a plane on fire crashing  exploding. Some of the CGI effects look dated but all the fights seem like they were shot on set with no digital touch up.

This loses the racist elements of the abominable third entry and gives us more martial arts stupid plot threads and a hot love interest for our hero. Phillip Rhee while no gifted thespian is surprisingly likable and seems far more exciting in the fight sequences than he was in parts 13. Indeed his fight sequences are intensely choreographed and Rhee proves to be an excellent director as martial arts sequences go. Also the cast includes Ernie Hudson Tobin Bell Jigsaw from Saw and Art La Fleur. Also there is torture that involves a pitching machine bad guys who screw up a traffic light to cause an accident and tons of kickboxing. Indeed the film is an excuse to give us Phillip Rhee at his asskicking best and frankly who on earth can hate such a flick? 12 Out Of 4Pretty Good".

	schema:text "    Between 1975 and 1979 the communist inspired Khmer Rouge waged a campaign of terror and mass murder on Cambodia's population. Up to 1.7 mill. Cambodians lost their lives to famine hard labor and murder as the urban population was forced into the countryside to fulfill the Khmer Rouge's dream of an agrarian utopia. In the former Security Prison 21 codenamed S21 which was once a high school and is today the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum director Rithy Panh brings two of the few survivors back to discuss what happened there between 1975 and 1979. Painter Vann Nath survived by chance and didn't suffer the same fate as 17000 other men women and children who were taken there tortured and their socalled 'crimes' meticulously documented to justify their execution. The exKhmer Rouge guards respond to Nath's questions with excuses chilling stoicism or apparent remorse as they recount the atrocities they committed at ages as young as 12 years old. To escape torture the prisoners ...";

Many of the small audience in the screening room the copy screened was a DVD did not bother to finish the film.For myself I found the film a flawed but powerful experience. One major flaw is as other reviewers have pointed out its cold opening. In other words it assumes you already know what S21 is and what the Khmer Rouge are. Without this valuable background information which the documentary does not provide the viewers may be lost at first.It is also kind of dry since the movie takes place only within the walls of S21 involving only the few survivors of the prison and some of their former jailers. Essentially they spent the entire film talking. There is no attempt on the part of the director to make it more cinematic.However the patient viewer will soon find him or herself immersed in the horrors of the Khmer Rouge as detail after detail of the atrocities committed in the prison emerge. The handful of survivors go through mementos of the prison including logbooks detailing the tortures committed against inmates along with some of those who worked in the prison including a guard and a doctor. The question the survivors constantly ask their former jailers is How? How could you do these things? And they have no answers.The most chilling scenes in the film involve a former prison guard recreating in an empty cell the routine he took with the prisoners bringing them food water or a container to pee in threatening them with a beating if they don't go to sleep or cry too loudly. Its throughly disturbing to see even if there are no actual prisoners there.S21 is not for everybody. But if you're already familiar with the Khmer Roune and this part of Cambodian history the documentary may be worth watching to deepen your understanding of this dark period of history.".

For example interviews with two of the only seven survivors out of over 14000 prisoners detained and killed at S21 was remarkable by itself as was the opening sequence of a former guard discussing the morality of his role with parents who no doubt felt the full brunt of the Khmer Rouge's brutality yet survived.Seeing details such as the private cells photography apparatus the typewriters that clacked away to record prisoners' tortured confessions and the former guards' convincing reenactment of their job as teenage guards at this grisly place was at the same time deeply disturbing and satisfying in improving my understanding of this total institution.

Either way it is a country that makes me ashamed to be a Westerner. Yet Cambodians have more to worry about than my sense of emotional wellbeing.

In Joffe's film an American journalist travels to a Red Cross camp to be reunited with a Cambodian colleague he deserted to his fate. Do you forgive me? he asks. The Cambodian answers with a smile Nothing to forgive Sydney nothing to forgive. Although it won many awards Panh's movie is rarely shown outside of Cambodia. There you can pick it up for about 3.

That's what made it so powerful to see the people who committed this incomprehensible evil and those that suffered it asking their own questions trying to make sense of it all trying to justify it analyzing their roles in real time as the cameras roll. It was very evident that this was the first time many of them had questioned themselves on what they had done. The repetitive reenactment and explanation of the guard's day to day activities were horrific in their normality. Even after all these years after all that's happened these men had no qualms about showing the world their routines making it obvious that they don't equate their actions directly to the effects it had on their fellow country men and women. One has to remember that the guards were brain washed and indoctrinated by the communists at a very young age. This can be directly equated with what's happening in the world today with militant Islam. They're creating their own amoral killers and fanatics by indoctrinating and brain washing children. If nothing else this documentary shows how once indoctrinated at a young age with fanatical ideology all that remains for the rest of that persons life is an empty shell incapable of comprehending basic humanity.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Documentary that Needed More Balance";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this documentary at the Toronto International Film Festival.  The film offered powerful testimony from jailers that perpetrated torture and killings. As well this film elicits the expected emotions from survivors. It was stunning to listen to members of the Khymer Rouge speak so candidly about their inhumanity and also portray themselves as victims that had been simultaneously coerced and indoctrinated into this movement. Very similar to ideas heard in Nazi Germany with the Holocaust and later at the Nuremberg trials. i.e. I was just following orders I had no choice or indoctrination similar to fascist propaganda.  As powerful as this documentary was I believe that the extensive testimonies that filled an entire film limited the effectiveness of the genre.  By filling the film with nothing but testimonies the documentary became repetitive and detracted from the impact it could have had.  Jailers acting out the daily routine of checking cells and the lengthy reading of forced admissions of guilt occasionally dulled the impact of other powerful testimonySometimes less is more.  The director Rithy Panh searched for answers from the jailers but the standard responses i was following orders etc. would not suffice.  He was looking for larger answers on the nature of humanity and what causes people to do such atrocities.  The responses from the Khymer Rouge were unacceptable for Panh and he never got the answers that he seemed to need to start the healing process.  I believe that more background into the history of Cambodia would have answered some of those questions.  No one will ever adequately answer questions on the nature of humanity but an investigation into the movement would have given many viewers insight into this horrific historical event.  At the same time it would have made the testimony more powerful.  The barrage of testimony almost made the atrocities seem common. The balancing of information and background with testimony would have made this all the more powerful. Many people have a limited knowledge of events in Cambodia when compared to Nazi Germany or the Stalinist Purges and yet it is equally disturbing in both scope and sheer evil. I was hoping to be educated and informed whilst being numbed by the inhumanity. For the most part that did not happen.  Nevertheless the documentary is still well done. Much of the testimony is shocking particularly the mass burials. A film that is well worth two hours of your life to watch but not for the faint at heart.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this documentary at the Toronto International Film Festival.  The film offered powerful testimony from jailers that perpetrated torture and killings. As well this film elicits the expected emotions from survivors. It was stunning to listen to members of the Khymer Rouge speak so candidly about their inhumanity and also portray themselves as victims that had been simultaneously coerced and indoctrinated into this movement. Very similar to ideas heard in Nazi Germany with the Holocaust and later at the Nuremberg trials. i.e. I was just following orders I had no choice or indoctrination similar to fascist propaganda.  As powerful as this documentary was I believe that the extensive testimonies that filled an entire film limited the effectiveness of the genre.  By filling the film with nothing but testimonies the documentary became repetitive and detracted from the impact it could have had.  Jailers acting out the daily routine of checking cells and the lengthy reading of forced admissions of guilt occasionally dulled the impact of other powerful testimonySometimes less is more.  The director Rithy Panh searched for answers from the jailers but the standard responses i was following orders etc. would not suffice.  He was looking for larger answers on the nature of humanity and what causes people to do such atrocities.  The responses from the Khymer Rouge were unacceptable for Panh and he never got the answers that he seemed to need to start the healing process.  I believe that more background into the history of Cambodia would have answered some of those questions.  No one will ever adequately answer questions on the nature of humanity but an investigation into the movement would have given many viewers insight into this horrific historical event.  At the same time it would have made the testimony more powerful.  The barrage of testimony almost made the atrocities seem common. The balancing of information and background with testimony would have made this all the more powerful. Many people have a limited knowledge of events in Cambodia when compared to Nazi Germany or the Stalinist Purges and yet it is equally disturbing in both scope and sheer evil. I was hoping to be educated and informed whilst being numbed by the inhumanity. For the most part that did not happen.  Nevertheless the documentary is still well done.

What starts out as an interesting and powerful documentary about the Khymer Rouge and the horrible events that unfolded in Cambodia quickly turns into a documentary of testimonials. The testimonials are initially powerful and moving as both former prisoners and guards are able to confront each other about the events in the past. However after the first few subjects give their stories there is a sense of repetitiveness that echoes more and more with each following testimonial. It probably would have helped if there were some more historical information provided about Cambodia and how the Khymer Rouge came about. Overall S21 covers an interesting subject but it did not flow very well.".

Instead I wished to view the first hand accounts of guards and survivors and this is what the film gave me.It doesn't make this a good or bad film on this basis alone I'm simply explaining on the criteria which I'm judging it.Bringing together 2 of the 3 surviving prisoners a few guards and a doctor from the death factory of S21 to show one of several face to face encounters they have shared we get the chance to have a front row seat to what they experienced. There were several mentions of these gatherings plural that it is clear this is not something the filmmaker took upon himself for the sake of the audience.We hear of the punishments the torture and most upsetting to me the fact the they were coerced and beaten sometimes treated medically so they would survive the torture until they would give a confession. Yet all admit the confessions were for the simple reason the prisoners were executed. This sent shivers down my spine.The beginning scene to me was like a scene in a modern motion picture it frames how we will view the rest of the footage. It succeeded very well on this extent.I marked this film slightly lower than perfect for two reasons. The first is that there was no outside footage except for a Kampuchea Loyalty song. Since this was the only outside influence I recall it threw me out of the context when it played. Second a few scenes would have been handled better in a longer slightly shorter single scene. The two separate daytime examples one guard gave of his behavior to called prisoners would have really benefited from this treatment. It also would have allowed the single nighttime example this guard gave of his treatments to these walkingdead men and women an added punch.Overall still an excellent film as was Shoah which took the same technique. Don't expect a primer on the Khmer Roige there are plenty of good ones around.".

I found it confusing and I know the history. They make the mistake of assuming people already know what happened there.S21 has such a horrifying history a place where humanity reached its nadir but the film really just scratches the surface.One angle that goes almost completely unexplored is the losslack of humanity on both sides. The destruction of the prisoners is wellcovered but the guards are given a mostly onedimensional role and their own situation is barely considered aside from overly long reenactments of how they would conduct themselves toward the prisoners.Vann Nath one of the few survivors of S21 talks to the guards who are pretty closemouthed and unwillingunable to defend themselves. One should remember that they were largely 12 or 13 yearolds selected at that age because they could be easily manipulated and indoctrinated or they did what they did because they feared for their own lives. Seeing a survivor talk to the guards is very interesting but they also needed someone neutral as Vann has no patience for their explanations. Vann laments the loss of humanity of the prisoners but does not consider that it existed on both sides.Many of the things the guards did would be so anathema to human nature be so morally repugnant that I don't think or like to believe that most people would do them unless they fear for their lives or could not really grasp what they were doing.Granted many Khmer Rouge knew exactly what was going on and they condoned torture and murder. If one ever goes to S21 and sees the mug shots on the wall with men women children even infants looking back at you with heartbreaking fear and hopelessness you cannot help but hate those who killed them. But if this film also looked at those who did it and why it would have been much more effective.On the whole it's a very disappointing experience. There's so much to talk about and more horror than you can really wrap your mind around but the film doesn't help you appreciate this.".

I practically fell asleep three times during the showing because of the lack of information presented to me and the mediocre filming.The film also lacked integration of background information regarding the history of the country and expected the viewer to have that knowledge before entering the theater. It was a compilation of two sides coming together to share their stories of pain. Truly it was a horrible incident but the continuing narration by the soldiers through every move they made when picking up and delivering a prisoner was rather unnecessary and added about twenty minutes of film that was not needed.The two hours and eight dollars I spent on this film would have been better spent on a pony ride. I recommend picking up a book before going to this movie that is if you choose to do so. Beware that going in without being informed about the Khmer Roug massacre will result in you leaving with the same amount of knowledge with the addition of numerous tragic stories to amplify your interest but it delivers nothing of substance.".

There seems very little point in just assembling a group of guards and prisoners when it's evident human nature dictates that abusers are often in denial of everything they have done. Such an attempt is not just cruel but merciless for it brings untold suffering to the victims who actually have to put up with the torment of seeing their abusers again. There was also no moderator with indepth and relevant knowledge of said events to intervene and to help bridge the communication between all the parties involved. Nor was there a mental health specialist who might be able to comment on the circumstances and guide everyone to a point of understanding and even redemption. What results instead is sensationalism where the victims' suffering and the abusers' depictions are exploited for the sake of eliciting a response in the audience by accident or intention. Yes the torture was chilling but without further exploration what did that really add to the documentary? Missing too were historians or even academics to add layers of rich history facts analysis and commentaries which would link the incidents depicted to the Khmer Rogue history and even open set after set of questions. As mentioned by others the film makes a fatal flaw of mentioning little about the Khmer Rogue or even the history of the S21 prison. I know some of the S21 guards were actually prisoners who were given the choice of kill or be killed. Yet this issue is never really approached and there is no indepth analysis of their mindsets their motivations trauma etc. Nor is there any exploration of whether certain historical and even cultural aspects might have further eased the rise and acceptance of the Khmer Rogue or figures like Pol Pot or Duch. For example did you know that antiSemitism had existed in Germany since the medieval era possibly because of the stoning of Jesus Christ or maybe other events? In certain Asian cultures authoritarian figures are accepted and sometimes even welcomed regardless of any acts they're guilty of. Is this blind acceptance a 21st century phenomenon paralleled in other cultures or was that a sign of a decaying structure or had it existed in Cambodian culture for over 1000 years? And did that play any role to the acceptance of Duch as a leader of S21? Or did Duch hold his position simply because of his ability to instill terror and fear and not anything else? And there were many other questions in my mind too. Yet unlike most documentaries I've watched I didn't emerge with a broader understanding on at least some of the questions. Instead the viewers are left to assume or if not take certain things at face value. Such an approach is fine in the realm of fiction but for nonfiction it's never good to allow a viewer's thoughts viewpoints prejudices etc. to influence his perceptions so that he might engage in guesswork. Anyone unfamiliar with the history pertaining to this subject would be in the dark and emerge with no better understanding. At the worst someone might even emerge with partial denial of said events because of how they deduce and arrive at certain conclusions.

	schema:reviewBody "This filmnoir crime drama gets my vote for sleeper of the year.   It is an expertly written story that is subtly directed and superbly acted.  It makes up for the dozens of dreadful independent films one has to mine to find such a gem.  Jack Manfred Clive Owen is a struggling writer who on the advice of his father takes a job as a croupier at a local casino a job he previously held when he lived in South Africa.  He takes the job to make some extra money but soon he realizes that it would be an excellent setting for a novel.  He becomes an impassive observer of the gambling culture on both sides of the table taking mental notes that are later incorporated into his book. However as time goes on he is seduced from observer to participant gradually breaking all his own rules and justifying his decadence by convincing himself that he has become the character in his book.  His feeling of control is delusional as he is being manipulated by unseen forces that are beyond his comprehension.There is a wonderful multilayered texture to the story.  It examines the psychological aspects of the gambling casino from the inside out allowing us to look at the trade from the casino's perspective.  It also weaves in love sex deceit and betrayal along with robbery and murder.  A few plot gaps leave the viewer with some unanswered questions but they are minor. The ingenious weave of plot elements culminating in a clever ending more than makes up for the flaws.  Director Mike Hodges did an outstanding job of creating realistic casino environment without a lush budget.  Hodges got the feeling just right as well portraying various types of gamblers from the high rollers to the addicts.The acting was superlative.  Clive Owen emerges from the shadow of his television resume to deliver a complex and brilliant performance as the cunning but stolid croupier.  If anyone with clout ever sees this film his agent will certainly be getting some calls.  Alex Kingston also does a fine job as the enigmatic Jani who lures him into a nefarious scheme that sends his life spinning dangerously out of control.This intelligent film keeps the viewer engrossed throughout.  I rated it a 910.  It presents a fine alternative to mindless big budget films that are more form than substance.".

The film follows his struggle with fatalism or chance and grand design. Whether as a writer a croupier or an observer he likes to be in control risk free.Making sure this isn't quite how it works is a pretty solid list of fine support actors. Alex Kingston turns up with an impressively rendered South African accent and more sex appeal than the distilled accumulation of all her work on ER. Potent stuff. Gina McKee plays a conventional love interest without simply being wallpaper David Hamilton runs the Casino with an ambiguity that mirrors Jack's.Mike Hodges engineers tight claustrophobic shots and choppy editing. Everything about the film is up close and suffocating shots in cars Jack's tiny flat stairwells and copulating couples in toilet cubicles. Owen's Jack is neither repelled by nor engages with this proximity. It only affects him if it foists itself upon him violently or he chooses to deal with it. Whether or not he actually has a choice is the point of this entertaining film. 710".

Yet this short film is oddly compelling although we actually get only a brief insight into the workings of the casino there's something very addictive about the way it is presented the film has the smack of authenticity and one watches transfixed as if one was being shown it all for real.  Also effectively communicated is the mixture of alienation and exhilaration that comes to possess and drive an increasingly dehumanised Jack.

One was that it was narrated in the 3rd person by the star usually it's someone else who narrates in the third person another is that I saw a world I didn't know about before.  Sure I know about casinos and bosses and workers but I didn't know how it worked in Britain.  In fact I saw this as a British version of Casino except without the mob and violence though there is some violence.  Also Clive Owen makes a great lead as Jack who goes through changes in his careers as a writer and a croupier.  Possibly the best film to come from Britain this year so far.".

	schema:headline " A good film but not as satisfying as I would have liked";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack Manfield is a writer but an unpublished one thus far. With money running out he follows a connection from his father that earns him a job interview in a London casino. After a short time he finds he has rediscovered the croupier bug and is back in love with his new job. He also finds that his experiences useful in creating a new book lead the lead character Jake as a croupier. As he drifts apart from his girlfriend he loses himself in the world and starts breaking the rules  ultimately getting involved with a patron Jani who asks him for help in organising a heist at the casino.Quite often it'll be the UK European or underground markets that expose an American film as a good film after the US market has ignored it but with Croupier it worked the other way round. Hardly making any impact at all upon release in the UK it was apparently good reviews and good figures from the US that helped make it better known. As such I came to it with mixed expectations  I sort of half knew what to expect from it but I had also been led to believe that it would impress me a great deal. In some regards I enjoyed the film it is intelligent dark thoughtful and has a reasonably enjoyable plot  even if the plot does have equal billing with the atmosphere. However don't expect a great plot that piles twist on twist because this isn't what the film is about. Rather the film relies very heavily on the observations of the croupier himself both as Jack and Jake to drive the film forward. I can't think of another film that I've seen that uses voiceover to such a degree and makes it work usually heavy voiceover use implies that the script and characters were not strong enough to hold the film up by themselves.The clever twisting of JackJake is subtle but done to good effect and was a big part of the reason that this film engaged me. Outside of this I found the plot to be rather hard work  there is no one real thrust to the film with only the main one involving Jani really coming out to the front in order to deliver an ending in the traditional manner. This is a weakness and it stops the film being as satisfying as it could have been with Jack not being provided with enough of a plot to be set in. That said it still works due to his character and some great direction from Hodges who avoids being overly flashy as the gambling world setting often encourages directors to be.Owen is very good and convinces in his many scenes  he is the heart of the film and it is to his credit that he manages to do it. Even in voiceover he delivers good character and direction for the film. Kingston is not as good. Aside from doing her whole nudity thing yet again she also is lumbered with an accent that doesn't suit her and one that she doesn't sound comfortable with even if it isn't that bad. McKee is OK as are Ball Morton and Parnell albeit in smaller roles. But in a film that is more about the croupier than anything else the film is Owen's and he rises to it and does well with the lead role. Overall this is an OK film and one that deserves better than it received upon first release in the UK. However plotwise it is not as satisfying as I would have liked it to be instead it relies heavily on the character of Jack  an aspect that is both the film's making and it's weakness in that the film doesn't give him a good enough plot to be developed against.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Croupier' is a very dark very bleak noir thriller about one man and his general struggle in life. This message is put across through his inability to get a good book going and general lack of being able to communicate and holding things together.This film just feels 'efficient'. It's never really that colourful the characters voices never really get above a certain low decibel level and most people just seem to skulk around getting on with their business. But what is it that makes this such entertaining viewing? Well for one the constant reference to the protagonist BY the protagonist is fascinating. We're well aware of his writers block by now and as he narrates everything he does we get the feeling he's basically narrating his book. This means he's chopping and changing between 1st and 3rd person referencing another thing to suggest he's disconnected. This connected very well with the story telling method the film got across.The fact that early on his father calls to tell him he's supposedly moving into a new business is not in the slight bit interesting to Jack Owen and this also suggests a lack of interest and communication skills with people most noticeably this time his family. Oddly enough this little item comes back to bite him and the viewer and acts as the twist in the end. What's also interesting is the general things about this film. The script contains constant references to 'luck' and 'chance' as well as quips like 'what are the odds?' I found this knitted in nicely with the general dialogue and there wasn't too much of it either. Other such things include the way we see a conflict towards the end at a gambling table yet we don't cut away to the following situation in the office where the offender was taken to by the management like we would've done in films such as 'The Cooler' 2003.There are very few disappointing things with Croupier but one I can't forgive is the scene that the final third of the film builds towards the actual robbery. It was quick chaotic and just plain bad. I had no clue as to what happened and had to wait for the characters to tell me if it had been a success or not as the images didn't tell the story at all. Oddly enough the entire cast seem to be pretty fed up. In fact it's pretty dull yet effective acting from all concerned and this added to the film and its atmosphere it had going on.With most of the good principals Croupier has and very few flaws the film ends up being a stylish dark and close to depressing noir tale that delivers.".

Hodges turns on the magic however making the life of Jack Manfred struggling writer and parttime Croupier as complex and as multidimensional as any character I've ever seen as he is sucked into London's gaming underworld.This is a great film  I can't tell you too much or I'll spoil it because this one twists and turns and doubles back on itself like a rattlesnake in a sack. Clive Owen is fantastic as the emotionless stony faced Croupier and the supporting cast is always believable.This is a low budget film with minor stars and functional sets but the quality of the writing acting and directing shines through and I only loved this film more when I saw it again on cable payperview. I now own it on video and it's one of those few films which holds my highest accolade  it's worth watching again and again. If you enjoyed 'Get Carter' 1971 get this.".

There are accurate insights into the mentality of The Croupier Clive Owen in this film. Its an atmospheric film that draws you into mental workout through some stylish directing  firstly you feel as if you are inside the casino with Owen then one feels perched on his shoulder he then draws you in with his views of those around him then as the film progresses you become a friend of his and through a smooth direction in narative which seems entirely plausible you go beyond perching and venture instead into Owens head  you feel like you are there rooting along side him as if you are kindred spirits and are reading his mind.......Owen excels as the Croupier his portrayal FORCES you into joining him whether you want to or not.The plot is subtle and I wont spoil the outcome. It revolves around addiction be it gambling or otherwise. But its believeable this is what I liked most it suspended my disbelief.My brother  a noncroupier enjoyed it as did my girlfriend too they found it very insightful and creepy.See this if you like clever films such as The Game and films with atmospere and dark undertones.

But if you are a croupier ITS A MUST!I did laugh at one piece of poor chip handling though  see if you can spot it?!";

Right on...words don't always cut it in movies and his face says more than words could anyway. Great work by an actor I hope to see more of. I loved the movie as much as I loved Clive.  I loved the contradictions of him..he's not a gambler yet he is a gambler.  Very interesting stuff a real person in the real world is on the screen and that is much appreciated by the thinkers in the audience.I was slightly taken aback by the ending which rung a little false. Something about it was inconsistent with everything else so that was a disappointment but did not ruin the rest of it by any means.  910.".

It was a heist movie directed by Mike Hodges of GET CARTER fame and its a movie that brought Clive Owen to everyones notice  but it was a movie I never got round to seeing until a few nights ago when channel 4 broadcast it.Right away I was convinced that I was going to be watching something that was influenced by CASINO  Hodges directing style of this movie screamed at me Scorsese  Scorsese  Scorsese but after the first ten or so minutes that struck me the movie might not be going anywhere it finally finds its feet . CROUPIER might not be the most compelling movie Ive seen all year but it is a very interesting drama as we follow Jack Manfred a wannabe writer who works in a casino . Two things I should point out though  First of all a lot of reviews I read when the movie was originally released is that they over stated the point about this being a  heist  movie when in fact its more of a drama . If youre expecting something along the lines of OCEANS ELEVEN youre going to be disappointed . Secondly if you have no interest whatsoever in what croupiers or  frustrated writers do for a living youll probably have little desire in watching this movie . Like I said this is mainly a drama than a crime film and I must say that Hodges has perfectly captured the rather impersonal  empty and lonely atmosphere of London very well  and seeing as Clive Owen seems really at home in a casino wearing a tuxedo he wins my nomination as the next Bond . James Bond I did start off this review by criticising the start of this movie so Ill finish by criticising the ending . Its not the worst ending Ive ever seen in a movie but I cant help feeling cheated by the last twenty minutes which sees an unlikely plot twist of Jack visiting a morgue along with some unlikely dialogue with a policeman . Were also treated to Jack having a telephone conversation which does seem ridiculous almost as though the screenwriter didnt know how to finish off the screenplay along with a faintly ridiculous final scene".

That's the movie and all the almost inevitable pressures on him to eventually either cheat of get involved in a crime. But he gives the appearance of having been there and done that and he's cool as a cucumber. And very effective. This is one of this first really movie roles after years of British t.v. and you can see how he is a whole level above his peers. There isn't really a bad performance in the bunch but lots of just serviceable stuff that lets him do his thing. The plot builds nicely with some subtle twists and decent writing. The ending is a weirdly flat experiencemeant to be shocking and openended no doubtwhich makes you reevaluate the climax right before that. Owes plays it all as if nothing mattered though he does on the inside seem affected.The other twist here almost unnecessary but it works is that Owen is also writing a book about it all and he sometimes through voiceover narration confuses and conflates the lead character in the book with himself. They are of course the same sort of but not too closely or he'd get caught.At doing whatever he is really doing. Never mind all the possible flaws in the plot it clicks overall and it's intriguing. It also has a nice if a bit brightly illuminated t.v. style filming. Solid low budget stuff. And an entry into the life of a megaactor to be. Oh and I wouldn't call it a noir or neonoir even with all the voiceovers and the alienated lead maleit lacks the other element of pure style which this functional movie avoids too well.".

His subtle use of gesture and eye movement is masterful. I find him riveting in this character. The rest of the cast is also evenly talented. I especially enjoy Kate Hardie as Bella. This is one of the moodiest films I have ever seen. It sucks you in and holds you. The beauty of it for me is that the arc of Jack's character is not in the least bit flat despite the blunt darkness of the film. It is the closest thing in quality to Michael Caine's early angryyoungman flicks. Mike Hodges directed Caine in Get Carter which was retooled by Hodges with Clive Owen as I'll Sleep When I'm Dead another wonderfully moody film. Clive Owen has the potential to be one of the very few male superstars of our age.".

Yeah and he does have that kind of old fashioned movie star look but I just never got it. Not until I saw 'Croupier' ironically made long before those two other movies.Here he plays the mysterious outonhisluck writer Jack moonlighting at a shifty London casino while writing the confessions of a man of his trade. Things are good for Jack until a noir like femme fatale makes entry to his world.But 'Croupier' is not your ordinary thriller. Not even your ordinary noiralike but an astonishing performance of playing with genre conventions fired up by the genuine British feeling not far from 'Naked' in a sense. The story is not really what's the core of the movie it's the acting the settings the dialog and the presence of that certain something... Strange to say but it is much thanks to the boor dome and the feeling of standing still while moving that makes Hodges' dark Britcom such a masterpiece of coolness. Not even the very twist of the story raises more than a brow on the main character  that's how cool it is.Of course the whole movie and everything in it is very stylized. But that's if not not the point the entire idea of it.And then again Thanks to Clive Owen! As written he is as Jack the croupier beyond great cooler than Eastwood in his tuxedo black hair and dark eyes cynically looking up from under those brows.

That is so wrong the guy is cool in the first meaning his croupier job is to act it cool to get impressed by nothing and from there he lives the same way. But sometimes well sometimes he has to let it go to gamble even if he never gambles. The action is not that quiet the only thing is that this is not an Hollywoodstyle movie the twists in the action are not punctuated by thrilling music etc. The action is all left to the spectator's appreciation it's up to him to fully enjoy what is happening.

One as the Crow then as the Crow's brother. Well once again I was mislead by Thomas Weisser's book Spaghetti Westerns the Good the Bad and the Violent. I know it must be exhausting viewing 558 westerns. Berger actually plays only the Crow who has about 10 minutes of film time. He was very cool and great acting as the crow. Now for the others my god I actually stomached it through the lame fight scenes and retarded town folk of five brothers and their pa. I actually had to pop a lower tab just to relax.The duel between Link and the Crow sucked for the simple reason here is a famous gunslinger Crow who is being relentlessly tracked down by the Connelly's who's father was gunned down by the crow years ago. He doesn't even get his gun out of his holster fighting Link who blows him away talk about the fastest gun in the west. Link should stop being a wannabe detective and be a pro gunmen. I am actually scared to view the three other movies Director Gianni Crea made. Diehard Spaghetti fans good luck with this one!".

	schema:reviewBody "A lovely interesting film given more meaning by being the third of the three parts that more or less make up the history of Ingmar Bergman's family starting with the sublime Fanny and Alexander moving on to The Best Intentions and then ending with Sunday's Children which starts in the 1920s but jumps forward and back to the late 1960s occasionally where a character named Ingmar is confronting his dying father from whom he's long felt estranged. Most of the film focuses on the Ingmar character's childhood in typical Bergman fashion capturing the complexities of family life good and bad funny and heartbreaking. Also fascinating is that Ingmar Bergman chose his own son Daniel to direct this story of Ingmar Bergman's relationship with HIS father. While there's clearly a certain poetry to that choice I'm not sure it was the strongest possible one artistically. Unlike Billie August with 'The Best Intentions' Daniel Bergman sometimes seems to just be doing an imitation of his father's style and that lack of an organic feeling to the filmmaking keeps this from fully soaring. But the complexity of seeing the fatherson relationship though both a child's eyes when his father seems like a basically decent man with problems. and his adult perspective on the same behavior as cold and destructive is pretty fascinating. A complex film I look forward to seeing again.".

The result is a beautifully crafted film on all levels that is among the best of Bergman's later films. Daniel Bergman directs very assuredly so much so that at times it does feel that Ingmar Bergman directed it which I liked. The autobiographicaltoned script is very personal and written with such honesty and thought as well as a complex and even tone. Sunday's Children is also incredibly well made the cinematography is stunning and the settings evocative. The use of sunlit country picnics and cycle rides also help to give a personal and nostalgic feel to the film which I found quite poignant. In contrast there are also the confrontations between Pu and his father that are incredibly dramatic and powerful. Thommy Berggren and Henrik Linnros give spoton performances as those characters who as always with Bergman are compelling in how realistically they are written. All in all a remarkable film and while not among Bergman's very finest films it is one of his better later ones and is also his most personal. 1010 Bethany Cox".

Yet the movie serves its purpose to bring some mindless entertainment with some nicely done action.Nicole Kidman in a main part of an action movie? Yes Nicole Kidman in the main part of an action movie and who would have ever known she is actually believable in her part but her acting is just a bit too standard and boring but yet like I said before her characters remains believable. Thumbs up for that! But the best roles are played by George Clooney and Armin MuellerStahl who is always great in a movie.The movie's opening is really a memorable one and is one of the very best action movie openings I have ever seen along with The Rock which was made one year earlier. After that the movie looses some of it's power and pace and we begin losing interest until the next action sequence occurs. Yes it truly are the action sequences that are the highlights of the movie and make this movie a watchable one.The visual style of the movie is also what makes this movie above average. The cinematography by Dietrich Lohmann gives the movie a cool action movie feeling. Dietrich Lohmann unfortunately died not much later during or shortly after completing the movie Deep Impact.The music by Hans Zimmer is most excellent. Zimmer and co really set up some new standards for action movie soundtracks in the nineties.Standard action movie but well executed! 710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Julia's intelligence background and Thomas' more direct approach don't gel too well but they must recover the weapons before they are used in a terrorist strike against the US.This starts well  with the detonation of a nuke in rural Russia and indeed it goes on quite well from there. The story is the basic 'terrorist with stolen nuke' story but it has sufficient ability to rise above the norm to be quite enjoyable. The oddcouple of Devoe and Kelly isn't made too much of and it avoids that pitfall. The action scenes are handled well and though lacking in flair they do contain plenty of tension and excitement.The cast really help  in particular Clooney. Clooney takes what could have been just a one dimensional tough military role and adds layers to it. His violence is just beneath the surface and it shows in his face and eyes. At times he does what is expected of him  but for the most he lifts the role and the film. Kidman also does well  at times she is a screaming sidekick but she also has a bit of depth there too. The support cast never really get beyond ethnic stereotype  only Armin MuellerStahl has a good role. There are some interesting roles given to now famous people  Boatman Carter in Spin City and to complete the ER coonnection between star and director Goran Visnijc in a tiny role.Overall this is a standard story. But a topclass Clooney and plenty of good tense action scenes make this much better than the average stolen bomb flick.".

Valerie Plame that work not only in the US government but also others like Israel.Make no mistake many of them are as beautiful as they are intelligent. And I give kudos to the filmmakers for resisting the one formulaic turn and that is making it into a romance flick where the malefemale protagonists first dislike each other and then fall into each others arms by the end of the movie.So for all those who say this movie is predictable here's one predictable and clichd turn it didn't take. It concentrated on the action and suspense and only hinted in the very end at the possibility of a romance.It was interesting to see that even though Dr. Kelly was Devoe's boss the actual dynamics were in reverse with her following Devoe's lead for most of the time and listening to lectures from him about her inexperience.I guess the movie's producers thought it was too much for someone like Clooney to constantly take orders from a woman.

Kidman probably has more range and is definitely more decorative.  Her nose seems to have been professionally drafted by someone with a set of transparent plastic French curves.  Iures is frankly charismatic on the order of Yves Montand and is the only character given any developmental background.  That is to say the performances aren't bad  but the movie is. Where to begin.1.  We meet Clooney at a Senate hearing while he is being asked to account for his arrest during a fist fight in a saloon in the company of a foreign spy and a prostitute.  He's one of those roguish wisecracking mavericks we are supposed to like immediately.  In case you don't like fist fights foreign spies or whores he has an explanation that absolves him of depraved tastes.2.  The dialogue is ineffable.  We've got AUTHORIZATION boys!  Let's ROCK AND ROLL!3.  The writers were unsure of who to pin the blame on so they spread the guilt around generously.  There are the Russians of course since we can't seem to get over the Cold War.  And then the German are shown hard at work doing evil a stretch true but still World War II was no pink tea.  The chief villain describes himself as a Serb a Croat and a Moslem.  Iraq is brought up in the first few minutes and the stolen nukes are headed towards Iraq.  North Korea was not invited to the party.4.  The action scenes were I'm sure generated by computer.  A truck entering a bridge is blasted by a helicopter swerves wildly knocking down utility poles and whipping around cables that emit sparkling fountains before finally smashing through the railing and being jolted to a halt by the cables now wrapped around its axle.  Clooney is dropped onto the truck bed by cable from a helicopter.  A surving villain knocks the pistol out of his hand and we get the obligatory shot of it skidding across the floor out of reach.  Another fist fight while the cables snap their stops one by one and the truck dips farther off the edge of the bridge.  Cf. the elevator scene at the beginning of Speed.  The helicopter crew decides the truck is about to take its final nose dive and they yank Clooney back up but the cable was somehow wrapped around his neck and is strangling him so he whips out a knife and cuts the metal cable in one swipe.  He drops back into the truck finishes off the heavy saves the stolen nukes and the truck finally pulls loose of its encumberances and drops towards the gorge below exploding halfway down and leaving a Harvardeducated Pakistani astrophysicist dangling from a bridge girder.  None of this is made up I swear.5.  Clooney Kidman and an accomplice complete a dangerous theft and make off happily in their car.  The accomplice mentions that they are in an embassy car so it's armor plated and has bulletproof windows.  I leave you to guess whether this datum turns out to be important in the next 60 seconds.6.  Those cars skidding and twirling and pirouetting along the rainslick streets of Vienna the driver Clooney having presumably learned his skills at the feet of Remi Julian or however it's spelled.7.  Iures intends to explode a nuke at the UN Building but is wounded and goes to ground a few blocks away.  Clooney poses the perfectly reasonable question of why Iures just doesn't blow the thing up now since it will take out half of New York City.  Kidman shouts back You don't UNDERSTAND.  That's not what he wants.  He wants his death to MEAN something!  Well you can tell just from this exchange that Iures is a man of no mean principle.  Looked at pragmatically a few hundred yards would make little difference and nobody would be left alive to tell whether Iures had reached his goal or not anyway. Where was I?  Oh yes number eight.  Thank you.8.  Iures is now dead on the altar but his warhead or whatever it is is timed to go off in a few minutes.  We know this because there is a red digital readout that tells us how much time is left.  All exploding devices have red digital readouts.  Why?  That's a deeply profound question. Kidman must figure out how to disarm the primer so that only the preprimer will explode or something.  She hacks at the fiendish device with fingernails screwdriver and pistol butt while Clooney counts aloud the number of seconds remaining.  Nine.  Eight.  Hurry up!  Seven.  Doing the countdown in a situation like this it's true is a dirty and thankless task but somebody's got to do it!My mind is so benumbed by exposure to radiation leakage that I can no longer count past eight.  I don't think the producers of this piece of derivative stereotypical commercial garbage could either unless the number were preceded by a dollar sign.".

Bad news for humanity but good news for Hollywood producers who want to make a post cold war thriller featuring stolen nuclear warheads getting into the wrong hands but this type of scenario has become over familiar . While women watch  Disease of the week  TVMs I guess the boys will be watching  stolen nuclear warhead of the week  on another channel So what makes THE PEACEMAKER different from a mediocre Tom Clancey novel or a James Bond movie ? Good question and one that I can't really come with a good answer to . I could point out that the bad guy is a White European Christian but if I remember correctly the plot of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was changed so instead of Arabs we had WASPish Neo Nazis as the bad guys . In fact I'm struggling to remember when the bad guys weren't whacko white guys  would it be GOLDFINGER by any chance ? I guess the movie deserves some credit in mentioning the motives of the villain who is misguided rather than evil  and the motives don't exactly put the United States in a very good light but of course it's left to an American special forces officer to save the day and yes there's a scene where the hero attempts to defuse a bomb that has a timer that helpfully lets the audience know how many seconds are left to detonation YAWN THE PEACEMAKER isn't a terrible movie . In it's favour it's much better than another Hollywood blockbuster dealing with the Balkans conflict namely BEHIND ENEMY LINES but is in no way comparable to something like SAVIOR . It's also infinitely inferior to a mainly forgotten British production called SEVEN DAYS TO NOON and it's a movie that is more interested in making money at the box office than giving people sleepless nights in a world where a stolen nuclear warhead might explode anywhere".

In movies of this ilk the American Military is omniscient portrayed as so technologically advanced they can pinpoint license plate numbers half a world away relishing showing off their spysatellite capabilities and infiltration devices  yet never putting that technology to use in deterring the theft of nuclear weapons in the first place. They seemingly only use these gadgets to sell your confidential details to lowlife corporate bidders to conveniently lose your records when you report an identity fraud and to send you garbageloads of junk mail whenever you purchase a new electronic appliance with your credit card  instead of doing something important like CAPTURING OSAMA BIN LADEN.

But they get too busy to get busy barking orders at everyone within modeling distance as is the manner of Nuclear Threat movies walking through office hallways hastily glass doors and staircases add extra points handing off reports getting reports handed to them hectoring underlings to get the President or the head of That Department on the phone reeling off statistics and information to each other extras with one line updating them on the crisis situation oh joy!  one step closer to a SAG card!  doesn't anyone in the star's walking trajectory ever have something that they should actually be doing at the time they're lining the star's route being barked at? Meanwhile something of worldshaking import is happening  but in Nuclear Threat movies I can never quite scare up the interest to find out what. Ultimately the Russian plot to blow up the United States grinds to a standstill through the efforts of the poreless Kelly whose bra is always tantalizingly translucently apparent through her secretariat blouse and the headwaggling of Devoe who is airlifted onto a truck which hangs off a bridge in classic VehicleHangingOffBridge position leaving him just the right amount of time to get off before it falls.Flowerpot hats off to Devoe as all the stolen nukes are accounted for  but one! So begins the final idiot act of the movie  congruent with the final idiot act of a desperate terrorist played by a nonthreatening apathetic Marcel Iures who has the opportunity to detonate the nuclear device in his backpack at any time  keeping in mind that a bomb that powerful would do the same amount of damage no matter where it blows  yet opts to mill aimlessly through New York streets presenting himself as a target for military rooftop snipers. Despite Devoe's imprecations of Are We Not Men?! the snipers refuse to take out the Russian due to curlyhaired American kids getting in the way  strange that's never stopped them in real life....When the movie has degenerated to the final chase sequence Devoe gets to perform the action hero staple of Running Over Car Roofs and sliding over car hoods like a TV cop  he even gets to knock over a bum with a shopping cart! This movie has everything!Finally we meet the star of our show  The Bomb  replete with easytoread big red digital numbers ticking down Sesame Street was so proud they dedicated a sock puppet to Devoe which Julia must defuse. And the big red numbers only give us two minutes to think about how predictable this whole scenario is  as if the filmmakers would risk mussing Nicole Kidman's makeup by having a bomb explode in her face. But wait!  there's more malarkey to digest we are told  via Julia's harried and wholly specious dialog  that this contraption is a bomb within a bomb that there is a small normal bomb that they can detonate which will actually negate the detonation of the nuclear bomb  I'd like to slap someone now please  so we can still have our happy ending the big convenient explosion and yet save civilization! Diving through a stainedglass window with an explosion at your heels apparently only sustains a few minor scratches to the forehead no worse than falling off your bike on some soft grass.

Actually he is the only reason i watched this film he is romanian just like me and this is his first important role in Hollywood.And he manages to play superbly but that's usual for a fabulous actor like he is. After a long career in Romania Iures started in Hollywood with minor roles in movies like Interview with The Vampire. This is his most important Hollywood role so far and he does it so well! After this film he came back home and acted in a few theaters and impressed everybody playing absolutely brilliant the role of Richard the Third from the Shakespearean play.Enough about Iures  the movie Peacemaker is a good action film with all the ingredients for a success. Still it lacks many things but it's a good watch if you enjoy action films. Plus Iures. Vote 7 out of 10.".

I saw Deep Impact in 2000 or 2001 and liked it so much. Especially the scenes which the meteor comes down to the earth were dazzling and glorious. However The Peacemaker is her masterpiece. George Clooney is great in this film he is a great actor especially his mimics. Yes any actor can play this role Thomas Devoe but Clooney is a gift I believe. Action? A critic says that The Peacemaker is one of slow paced movies so in the bonus disc in the behind the scenes part we can watch making of two action scenes. A big lie! How many action scenes does The Peacemeker have? Let's count. The first action sequence is a car chase. This scene is so stylish. Mimi Leder chose a cloudy rainy day to shoot this part the cinematography consists of gray tones mainly. The background music is sweeping the crash moments are very strong and generally it is not showy. Thomas Devoe squeezes the car almost. The second long action sequence occurs on the air and then in an aircraft. The third action sequence attention I always use sequence not scene takes place in New York. In those scenes Leder catches dazzling panoramic views. And this time she chose a sunny day. However there is a thought provoking and frustrating scene. There is a little girl who obstructs the visual angle of the sniper but Clooney and Kidman insist him to shoot. Returning to the action the camera follows Clooney while he is jumping from one car to another then makes a half rotation around him. Brilliant! The gunfight scene recalls John Woo movies. From the deliberately made opening sequence till the end a solid thriller.".

Director Mimi Leder in her cinematic debut struggles with a secondhand warmed over story. The cliffhanger predicaments and their resolutions emerge as more hackneyed and pretentious than virile and exciting. Enough with these adventure sagas set in the new Russia! Few surprises enliven this downbeat humorless technical Tom Clancy clone. Although The Peacemaker boasts a couple of decent scenes the film grovels under a heavyhanded script dull villains and equal opportunity his'n her plotting. The Michael Crimson Tide Schiffer screenplay follows the strenuous efforts of U.S. Army Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel Tom Devoe George Clooney of ER and scientist Dr. Julia Kelly Nicole Kidman of Far  Away to recover 10 nukes that corrupt Soviet General Aleksandr Kodoroff Aleksandr Baluyev 0f Deep Impact has purloined. The action ignites with sizzling promise as a team of commandos armed with machine guns and night goggles stages a daring night train robbery. With the red laser beam sighting systems on their guns and the twinkle of red from their night vision equipment they manage to evoke an evil sinister look.

There's nothing charismatic about Dusan so the filmmakers have stacked the cards in this drama against themselves. You cannot really hate the Dusan Gavrich character in a way that a great villain should be despised.When Leder stresses the human elements in The Peacemaker she allows her audience to think instead of react. Thinking audiences are less susceptible to the hokey rollercoaster machinations that convulse The Peacemaker. In a good adventure movie audiences mentally dodge what the heroes must physically evade.

Director Leder wellintentioned message about the horrors of a nuclear blast would make a better disaster of the week television movie than a globetrotting ClancyBond wannabe thriller. Undiscriminating audiences looking for a distracting bit of action with exotic scenery and juvenile heroes may appreciate The Peacemaker until the tragedy dampens the aura of escapism.

	onyx:emotionText "Stolen Russian nukes are up for grabs in the George Clooney  Nicole Kidman escapade The Peacemaker a sloppy but serviceable global thriller that drowns its audience in sentiment rather than buoys them with entertainment. Director Mimi Leder in her cinematic debut struggles with a secondhand warmed over story. The cliffhanger predicaments and their resolutions emerge as more hackneyed and pretentious than virile and exciting. Enough with these adventure sagas set in the new Russia! Few surprises enliven this downbeat humorless technical Tom Clancy clone. Although The Peacemaker boasts a couple of decent scenes the film grovels under a heavyhanded script dull villains and equal opportunity his'n her plotting. The Michael Crimson Tide Schiffer screenplay follows the strenuous efforts of U.S. Army Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel Tom Devoe George Clooney of ER and scientist Dr. Julia Kelly Nicole Kidman of Far  Away to recover 10 nukes that corrupt Soviet General Aleksandr Kodoroff Aleksandr Baluyev 0f Deep Impact has purloined. The action ignites with sizzling promise as a team of commandos armed with machine guns and night goggles stages a daring night train robbery. With the red laser beam sighting systems on their guns and the twinkle of red from their night vision equipment they manage to evoke an evil sinister look.

	schema:reviewBody "MAJOR SPOILERS!! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE!!Commenters have touched on the major theme of honor in the film and too many comparisons to Braveheart. I'll point out a few things about this movie that I have not seen other comments touch onThis movie has a decidedly different take on abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the villain's Roth girlfriend and when he coldly suggests an abortion she states it is too late for that. The shame of her situation I'm to have a bastard's bastard. leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to find herself pregnant is Mary Rob's wife after a rape by Roth's character and at least one sex scene with her husband Rob. Late in the movie as Rob is leaving for a final confrontation with Roth Mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins with a tone hinting of abortion. Rob replies in a noble tone it's not the fault of the child and then states what he thinks the name should be girl or boy. I find this prolife stance on the part of the hero to be very unHollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment  not coincidental symbolism.Another related theme is Roth's character is a bastard someone who evidently does not know who his father was and has few kind words for his mother though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck. Is it coincidence that Roth devoid of family stability is the walking definition of psychopath while Rob is the strong husbandfather figure and of course the hero. In the final sword fight between Rob and the villain Roth the former slices the latter deeply across the chest  the left side of the chest over the heart. His employer and pseudofather figure John Hurt character holds the mother's picture in his hand and gazes at it before snatching it from the neck of the dead Roth.Also what I find interesting was the direction of the rape scene which was not quite graphic but neither was it offcamera and implied. I found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction with Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and subsequent post traumatic stress as we call it now. My point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied which I find an interesting middle road for Hollywood to take.In the final fight scene I have to correct an earlier commenter The weapon Roth chose was a rapier or perhaps a short sword the weapon Rob chose was a Claymore. Someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene. Roth would have the upper hand in such a situation but of course the Claymore is a distinctly Scottish weapon. What is even more striking to me as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made The actors seem actually trying to kill each other  not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights including the movies opening fight. Even more true to history Roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon which is it's purpose by design! Rapiers were edged but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust. Rob uses the Claymore in broad slashes as it's design intent. The fight goes down as I would expect it to  Roth effectively wins. Though Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon more symbolism and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut.Folks it is RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight.I'll also note that for whatever reason I remember 1995 the year of release distinctly as a time of distrust of the U.S. government. Hollywood was obviously tuned into that with the release of both Rob Roy and Braveheart and I think the antigovernment leanings are why both films get so much comparison. I think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans tired of the same old not so hidden messages from Hollywood.".

With all due credit to Mel Gibson Braveheart struck me as too much of a selfconscious and preachy epic to rival Rob Roy as the kind of movie I would care to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic Rob Roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling. Not a single scene is wasted.Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension action and even occasional humor. The characters are well fleshedout perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting.Further they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film.For example while we hope the heroic Rob Roy prevails we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.Rob Roy is a delightful treasure featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation.".

The scene then switches to a swordfighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs adorned shirts soft colored coats paleface makeup and conventional gestures...MacGregor lives under the protection of a local lord named Marquis of Montrose... When he enters an illadvised trade agreement with Montrose he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of Montrose's evildoers... The unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape... When Rob Roy is finally compelled to rebel against the English soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade...Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion to his character... He is intelligent fair and virile... He carries his height with grace as the Scottish chieftain of a small community... He is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains... He'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust... Oscar winner Jessica Lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife a proud peasant woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat... Lange's lines are filled with dignity and integrity 'I will think on you dead until my husband makes you so. And then I will think on you no more.'John Hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make Montrose something more than a greedy Marquis ruthless with money and tempered by the English court's fashion for foppery... He is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service... Honor in his view seems a quaint notion... He has two objectives ruin the reputation of his rival the Duke of Argyle and to hunt down the fugitive MacGregor... He sends his soldiers to burn the Highlanders' homes to kill their people and their livestock...Tim Roththe perfect antithesis to the hero is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer... He is a penniless British aristocrat a nasty 'hired sword' wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the Scottish mist... His name is Archibald Cunningham... He turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer... He dismisses himself as 'but a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the favors of great men and therefore can't care about anyone else Love is a dung hill and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow. He even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl...Cunningham seems pathetic... He smiles foolishly and utters words with affected refinement but not terribly harmfuluntil a muscular swordsman insults him and we discover that he's a cool head and an expert with a sword... He really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination...And while Brian Cox is suitably odious as Killearn Andrew Keir is Montrose's rival the powerful local aristocrat the Duke of Argyll one of the few trustworthy men McGregor meets outside his own family... Set in 18thcentury Scotland and with an atmospheric musical score 'Rob Roy' is really a love story between a man and his wife a recognizably human story unjustly dwarfed by Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing English landlords...".

He smiles foolishly and utters words with affected refinement but not terribly harmfuluntil a muscular swordsman insults him and we discover that he's a cool head and an expert with a sword... He really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination...And while Brian Cox is suitably odious as Killearn Andrew Keir is Montrose's rival the powerful local aristocrat the Duke of Argyll one of the few trustworthy men McGregor meets outside his own family... Set in 18thcentury Scotland and with an atmospheric musical score 'Rob Roy' is really a love story between a man and his wife a recognizably human story unjustly dwarfed by Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing English landlords...";

	schema:headline " This film is better than Braveheart and here's why....";
	schema:reviewBody "Attention SpoilersFirst of all let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90's. It was an amazing achievement for all those involved especially the acting of Liam Neeson Jessica Lange John Hurt Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. But alas...it constantly and unfairly gets compared to Braveheart. These are two entirely different films probably only similar in the fact that they are both about Scots in historical Scotland. Yet this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that Braveheart is a better film than Rob Roy. I like Braveheart a lot but the idea of comparing it to Rob Roy is a little insulting to me. To put quite simply I love Braveheart but it is a pale shadow to how much I love Rob Roy. Here are my particular reasons...Rob Roy is about real people.Let's face it the William Wallace in Braveheart is not a real person. He's a legend a martyr a larger than life figurehead. Because of this depiction he is also a perfect person never doing wrong and basically showing his Scot countrymen to the promised land. When he finally does fail it is not to his fault. Like Jesus he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most. He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.The depiction of Wallace is very well done and effective. But it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection. That is why The Last Temptation of Christ is a better film than King of Kings and that is also one of the reasons why I think Rob Roy is better than Braveheart. Rob Roy may be heroic and brave but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. Now sure not bearing false claim against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness. Let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did the best he could and that was all you could ask of him.Rob's Wife Mary is also a normal ambigious person. Let us start though with how she looks in this film. Sure she's beautiful but she doesn't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show. Compare this with the two loves or one depending on your point of view of William Wallace in Braveheart. Now these two ladies are hot but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time especially the lay persons. Maybe not a fair comparison but just another example of how Rob Roy's attempts for accuracy are far more effective.Throughout Rob Roy Mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion Cunningham. She feels compelled to tell Rob of her struggle but doesn't because she knows that Rob must seek revenge for her rape. Such revenge would surely mean the death of Rob and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.The villains in Rob Roy are equally as compelling. Although the enemies in Braveheart are well written they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce a man both brave and cowardly is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm. Should he take his claim as the king of Scotland or should he betray Wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name? Bruce is the most ambigious character in Braveheart but from Brutus in Julius Ceasar to Fredo in The Godfather Part II these types of characters are hardly original. Longshanks although a compelling villain in his own right is very one dimensional. He is the epidemy of evil and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to Wallace's heroism.Rob Roy has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery. First of all let's start with Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his self image that he's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. See to it that I am not mocked are his favorite words to his factor. He is a man obsessed with power upset that a man of great noble bearing as the Duke of Argyll can be considered of greater providency then him. He is shamefully self obsessed and insecure. He is an evil aristocrat but in ways that make him unique.Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators in Rob Roy and are also Roy's direct assailants. Callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical. He will do anything to maintain the good will of the Marquis which includes backstabbing and trickery. Cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the Marquis. He needs a father little does he know that the Marquis is his real father. Therefore when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from Callarn he grabs it without even questioning it. He is very much like the evil of modern man so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as overacting. Hogwash I say. It is clear that Cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement is Cunningham too much of an unbelievable character? We live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life. Rob Roy simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed. It is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness will prevail but snakes will always exist in our world.Another character that I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the Marquis. He appreciates the bravery of Rob Roy and Mary and has a direct vexation for the Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. Hopefully people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule.The final duel in Rob Roy is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in Braveheart.One thing I get tired of is people telling me that Braveheart is a better film because of the battle scenes. First of all battle scenes are hardly original. From Spartacus to Gladiator Hollywood has had a long tradition of historical European battle scenes. Braveheart has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film but they suffer from one important problem. These battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.Now don't get me wrong duels are hardly original either. In fact there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold. It is one of the greatest scenes in film history. Let me explain why...First of all the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. Cunningham is effette and dangerous Rob Roy is strong and courageous. Cunningham uses a fencing sword while Rob uses a broadsword. Cunningham fights with quick tricky movements while Roy's fighting style is more obvious.The whole film from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half is leading up to this moment. It is powerful stuff and it is clear that Rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. When Rob finally gets the upper hand literally and figuratively it is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to live for and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunningham's. The use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. Good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell FREEDOM!. But hey maybe that's just me.Rob Roy is more realistic than BraveheartI don't know that people in the aristocracy or Scotsmen talked like the people in Rob Roy but I do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. I feel that many people are bored by Rob Roy simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case then read some Shakesphere or put on the closecaptioning. Rob Roy is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's. Many of the dialogue in this film is clever but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.By contrast the dialogue in Braveheart is hardly very interesting. Of course what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian? This is a legend and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times. This film takes place several centuries before Rob Roy and yet they talk like the people today. Thus the reason that many people like it better. Audiences today have become increasingly lazy and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. Therefore as with many epic films they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable English accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our American language. Sure it is clear that the Wallace is Scotish but other than sounding like Scotty from Star Trek and a couple of Ayes for acknowledgement the Scots in this film fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we believe Scots should sound.So do these descriptions prove that Rob Roy is a better film than Braveheart? Hardly. But if it proves one thing it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that Braveheart is a better film than Rob Roy. To put simply Rob Roy is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today's world. Braveheart is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. You can make a decision on what you think is better...Grade  A Score  9".

Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history he was nominated for an Oscar. John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose another dislikeable character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose who inherited his title has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining it should appeal to all. It has romance action beautiful scenery and has a exciting plot. One of my favorite films.".

Both Braveheart and Rob Roy compellingly depict Scots history in bloody romantic fashion. Braveheart is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. It's also melodramatic anachronistic and maudlin. Note its cornball usage of slow motion filming. Its violence is both ugly and glorious. It is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset. While Braveheart surpasses Rob Roy in sheer levels of carnage not to mention its indulgent running time the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. Its action is more understated yet more surprising and clever. Its sex is less showy yet more erotic. Rob Roy also has a better realized romantic interest. Its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. Its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended The Last of the Mohicans and The Patriot. You may find the latter more akin to Braveheart with its emphasis on blood lust with the former more similar to Rob Roy in tone. All the of the aforementioned movies merit their R ratings for violence.".

	schema:headline " Powerful portrait of an ordinary but honourable Scottish clansman";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the moving tale of Scotland's legendary hero Rob Roy and his battles with the feudal landowners. Like Braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical. Despite their primarily fictional nature I rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two. The 13 Century William Wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early 18th Century Rob Roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary Scotsman.The story revolves around a clan chieftain Robert Roy McGregor who lives in a Scottish highland cottage with his wife Mary and their two young sons. As the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle. Rob Roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand Scottish pounds from a local noble the Marquis of Montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market. He temporarily entrusts this money to his friend Alan McDonald. When both McDonald and the money turn up missing Rob Roy finds himself in conflict with Montrose as well as his despicable protg Archibald Cunningham and his sleazy factor Killearn. Rob Roy's honour is also tested when Montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the Duke of Argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a Jacobite.The charismatic Liam Leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander Rob Roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale. Personally I feel that this is Neeson's best performance his brogue albeit Irish adding authenticity for the average viewer. Rob Roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted. He is a loving husband  father and also touchingly loyal to his friend McDonald who is accused of robbing him. Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains Archibald Cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock. He is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise. The pathetic Cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery. Also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl Betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide. John Hurt plays the arrogant and foppish Montrose who is eventually implied to be Cunningham's father.The movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between Rob Roy and Mary. Those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife! I think the phrase used by this pair 'How fine you are to me...' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema. The most compelling performance is possibly by Jessica Lange as Rob's wife Mary McGregor. Lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother. The actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable Cunningham while the disgusting Killearn looks on. Her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace. I give Hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as Mary's pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize. Their kinsman Alastair McGregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of Mary's rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by Cunningham. Of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the Scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring. There are no grand battle scenes as in Braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham. This is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale.".

I think the two most underrated actors in this film were Eric Stoltz as McDonald and Brian Macardie as Rob Roy's younger brother.  The scene in the woods where Cunningham is pursuing  MacDonald is simply agonizing to watch and brilliantly filmed.  MacArdie's compassion for Mary McGregor when he learns her secret is so moving you just want to cuddle the guy and pat him on the head.

	schema:reviewBody "Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend but it's his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful.

There is violence and blood but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes.

He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend but it's his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful.

This is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values whereas Braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale.  What makes this film is the cast.  Liam Neeson plays the hero in a role he basically reprised in a watereddown fashion in the Phantom Menace.  The character is heroic but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover.  Admirable yet human he commands the screen.  Against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including Tim Roth's Cunningham obnoxious but brilliant and John Hurt's morally bankrupt laird.  Also to praise is Jessica Lange as Rob's pragmatic wife also strong and noble but 300 years away from a modern heroine which is only as it should be.  This is not the most original film you will see but it has the courage of its own convictions and the strong performances make you care.".

If you like Shawshank Redemption andor Braveheart you will definitely love this movie!The acting performances are superb!  Tim Roth John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size.  The Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking.  It is onw of the few movies I have seen in my life along with Shawshank that was virtually flawless from casting directing writing acting etc.!!!I was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed.  I felt so passionately about it that I just registered with IMDB so I could let everyone know the real scoop.  I have seen this movie about 10 times each time with a different person and everyone has loved it!  You must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning.  If you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site than you will love this movie!  Come on...all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix at 32?!?!  That should show you the age range of most reviewers here!This is a top 50 movie!!!".

It really has everything  interesting story great acting remarkable dialog and breathtaking scenery. I was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog. I can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved.Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it to be more repulsive and shocking albeit often more subtle than most found in films set in modern times. The movie had a very racy and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era.The pace was very tight with hardly a dull moment. There was much intrigue and political subplots that complicated things a bit but yet did not detract from the main storyline.The action was also very well done and gripping. Something that I will forever find remarkable is that during the highlight action piece in the film there is no soundtrack whatsoever. It makes for a very tense exciting sequence since we have no musical cue as to the direction and resolution of the scene.Rob Roy will always remain high on my list of favorite films.

	schema:headline " Disguised Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Rob Roy was made at a time when the success of Dances with Wolves and Unforgiven had revived interest in the traditional Western and director Michael CatonJones himself a Scot has admitted that the film is essentially a disguised Western. It transfers what could be a classic Western plot from 19thcentury America to early 18th century Scotland with claymores standing in for sixshooters. The hero is even a cattle drover or as Americans would put it a cowboy. That hero Robert Roy MacGregor was a real historical figure who also features in Walter Scott's novel of the same name. Roy in this context was a nickname derived from Gaelic meaning redhaired but here it is treated as a second Christian name Liam Neeson does not play the part in a red wig.The film does not follow Scott's plot but is loosely based on the facts of the real MacGregor's life. In 1713 Rob Roy a clan chief in the Scottish Highlands is financially ruined by the machinations of the unscrupulous Marquess of Montrose and his villainous protg Archibald Cunningham. Cunningham is fictitious but Montrose was another real person. Cunningham has been described as an aristocrat but this is not really accurate because for all his dandyish appearance and foppish mannerisms he is really the illegitimate son of a prostitute and does not know who his real father is. Montrose has probably taken him under his wing because he recognises in him a kindred spirit equally unscrupulous and even more ruthless.When Rob Roy is unable to repay the money he owes Montrose has him declared an outlaw seizes his land and slaughters his cattle Cunningham brutally rapes his wife Mary. Rob Roy and his followers who have fled into hiding in the mountains wage a guerrilla campaign of revenge against Montrose stealing his cattle and other property.This was one of two historical films with a Scottish setting made in 1995 the other being the Oscarwinning Braveheart. The two films share one feature namely a somewhat disapproving attitude towards homosexuality which today makes them look rather oldfashioned even though they were only made around twenty years ago. In Braveheart the future King Edward II is portrayed as stereotypically weak and effeminate whereas here the treacherous Cunningham is gratuitously made bisexual a lover of boys as well as women a piece of characterisation which the scriptwriter presumably thought would make him seem all the nastier.That said I must say that I found Rob Roy a considerably better film than the muchhyped Braveheart. Mel Gibson's epic is a reasonably entertaining adventure story but it does have its faults quite apart from its many historical inaccuracies. It is overlong by at least half an hour and the acting is of a variable standard. In Rob Roy CatonJones paces the action in a more satisfactory way than does Gibson and the acting is also a lot better. I was not too keen on Tim Roth's performance as I felt that he made Cunningham a bit too much of a onedimensional pantomime villain but there are three outstanding contributions from Neeson Jessica Lange and John Hurt.Despite his status as Chief of Clan MacGregor Rob Roy lives simply in a modest house which contrasts sharply with Montrose's elaborate palace. The code by which he lives is equally simple honesty loyalty and honour when Montrose offers to forgive Rob's debt if Rob will testify falsely against one of Montrose's enemies Rob indignantly refuses. Hurt's Montrose appears to be an elegant courtly gentleman but his surface sophistication hides a ruthless opportunist who will use other people in any way he can provided it is to his advantage. Mary MacGregor could simply have come across as a hapless victim and little else but Lange who copes well with the Scottish accent instead plays her as a tough independentminded woman who frequently disagrees with her husband even though she loves him dearly.The swordfighting scenes particularly the climactic duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham were well handled the filmmakers clearly realised that the Scottish claymore was a heavier weapon than the duelling rapiers more commonly seen on screen and called for a different fighting style. Overall this is a splendid stirring historical yarn on the themes of honour love and loyalty. 810".

I found myself first seeing through a very direct lens of a slave narrativeAmerican liberal white guilt. This is an easy interpretation that lives on the surface.The film then transformed into a statement about the presumption that we can teach others how to govern when they may have a system that works better in their context. The system in Manderlay was not overseerslave the system was socialismcommunism and each slave as Grace saw them had his or her own specialized role. The inhabitants of Manderlay were free within their system but Grace was so completely blinded by what her culture had taught her about freedom and democracy and the inferiority of all other ways of life. The democracy she implemented was a complete farce. Their society did not function when the arrogant outsider who thought she knew what was best for them began implementing her system with force. The most direct comparison is operation iraqi freedom and other US nation building exercises or sponsored coups.I found many other characters to be representations of a global system of oppression. The card shark was an international lending institution like the World Bank or the IMF and the prince was a corrupt leader who sold out his people for a cut of the profits of the international business elites like Marcos Suharto or seemingly countless others.I was very pleased with Manderlay and thoroughly frustrated by simplistic the reviews I read of it. I feel that this film falls apart with a straightforward viewing. As a white guilt slave narrative the film is mediocre. As commentary on imperialism and an absolutely corrupt global system the film is a wonderful composition. I can't wait for Wasington.".

It is one that director Lars von Trier takes very seriously constantly seeming to question his role and duty as an artist  and whether the duty is to the audience or to art itself.Both with his Dogme movement films and now with later works such as Dancer in the Dark Dogville and Manderlay his answer seems to be firmly towards art as a worthy end in itself  or at least as a serious medium by which to raise though not answer questions of social conscience. He makes little or no concessions towards audiences who are not interested in what he has to say.Manderlay a story about emancipation from slavery and on a deeper level of the more topical problems of introducing democracy continues the Dogville tradition of using Brechtian acting and a semibare stage. The immediate dissociation this brings from any semblance of everyday reality focuses our attention on the issues in a similar way that Greek tragedy or grand opera is able to do  by insisting that ordinary details are secondary or even irrelevant to the main theme.Grace played by Bryce Dallas Howard who takes over seamlessly from Dogville's Nicole Kidman travels across America with her father and comes across an isolated town where slavery has not been abolished. With a pure heart god intentions and the power of her father's lawyer and henchmen behind her Grace makes wellmeaning but unfortunate illinformed attempts to put things right. She never stops to question the fact that she knows best or whether her high moral values are appropriate or whether they will win the day. Not unexpectedly there is much trouble in store for her.Manderlay's high points are that it is deeply philosophical but at the same time highly coherent and accessible. It asks important and necessary questions about the nature of freedom and democracy. Such questions and the discussion which this film makes possible are urgently needed in the light of such unsolved dilemmas as Iraq the philosophical basis for the removal of Saddam Hussein the introduction of westernstyle democracy to countries like Iraq or even Afghanistan. The broader practical problems also tackled by Manderlay of how to restore power to those who have been disenfranchised whether by slavery colonialism dictatorships or market forces is one that applies to many countries irrespective of the morality involved.The weakness of Manderlay is that the USA and its internal and foreign policy is an ideal example for any artist tackling such issues  as it's visibility provides a common focus throughout the world. Sensitive American citizens and politicians however will mistakenly see the film as simply antiAmerican which is not too difficult and avoid it. This means the people in power who most need to see it as they need such fora to find answers will probably avoid it.But von Trier has discharged his duty as one of the most intelligent artists of our time. He has discarded sensational entertainment using art as a tool to help us think outside the square  and his thinking is both profoundly stimulating and fully accessible to those with the patience and inclination. Does art need to tantalize our senses? If so we would miss out on some of the finest literature the greatest plays anything that did not provide immediate sensory satisfaction. Works such as Manderlay help to firmly position cinema as one of the great intellectual arenas of art  one that has the power to inform enrich and enlighten.".

	schema:headline " one of the bravest movies of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Indeed one of this years best films. I have just returned from the cinema and i'm still thinking about Manderlay. The story continues where Dogville ended. Grace and her father makes a short brake their travel and discovers that a slave is getting punished near by in a plantation named Manderlay. Grace's father continues his travel and Grace stays in Manderlay to set the slaves free as they should have been 70 years ago when the slavery was made illegal. And of course this is not easy.Manderlay isn't as shocking and far out as Dogville was. Not that it was a bad thing of course. But this is just a very much stronger film because you get personally involved in the characters in a way that i don't think you did in Dogville. The only thing missing is a little bit of action. Nothing really happens. People just walk around and talk. The biggest scenes in the film has no direct influence on the following physical action and development in the story. well of course they does but the development lies in the head of the characters. These developments are more interesting to analyze after you have seen the movie that during the movie. But instead of a lot of physical action we are given as i remember three truly terrifying and terrific scenes that are as strong as scenes in Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves and they does in my opinion make up for the lack of action.Manderlay is also a lot stronger i it's message than Dogville was. Yes the message is pointed against USA but as in Dogville it is so much more than just a criticism of that country... it's a criticism of the human kind. The reason for Lars von Trier to place the story in USA is that he likes to tease the big ones. He said that in an interview on TV not so long ago. He also said that the screenplay was written before the incidents in Iraq so it's a coincidence that there are so many parallels between the events in Manderlay and in Iraq.Lars von Trier is in my opinion one of the biggest directors of our time. It takes a courage that i see in no other directors than him to make a film like this. Manderlay is one of the bravest movies i have seen.".

	schema:headline " Masterful Brechtian Treatment of the White Social Work Solutions to the Race Problem";
	schema:reviewBody "Von Trier's Brechtian Gamble On Manderlay This time liberal is a dirty word By Jayson HarsinThe movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society . . . America must be born again!  Martin Luther King Jr. 1967Dear American liberals You're Idiots! Love Lars.In a nutshell that is the message of Manderlay controversial Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier's latest effort. Yet Manderlay is a complicated film that will produce multiple interpretations. Some will walk away calling it racist and antiAmerican. Others will find it a condemnation of Bush's war in Iraq. Yet as I say it is mostly a critique of American liberal politics. A condemnation of conservative racial politics is its point of departure. The film's complicated style and extreme plot produce intentional uneasiness. Von Trier has cited German playwright Bertolt Brecht right as an artistic inspiration yet one may wonder if he is reinventing the Brechtian wheel one that Brecht himself admitted did not turn for others as he had wished. ...On one level the film is set in 1930s Alabama on a plantation called Manderlay where 70 years after the Emancipation Proclamation slavery is apparently still being practiced. Continuing the narrative of Dogville Grace now Bryce Howard after touring with her gangster father now Willem Dafoe and his thugs since her departure from Dogville stumbles upon Manderlay with her father's entourage. She is alerted to the anachronistic existence of slavery by a slave who asks her for help. Her father asserts that this is a local matter echoing a common Southern response to Federal intervention in race problems that was often coded through states' rights. It specifically recalls the language of Martin Luther King's powerful Letter from Birmingham Jail in which he responded to Southern clergymen who had accused him of among other things being a meddling outsider. White liberal American intellectuals will no doubt have a hard time resisting identification with the white dogooder Grace who like the North the Federal government and the social worker believes that race relations at Manderlay are in moral terms not a local matter. We have a moral obligation Grace says to her father as she persuades him to loan her gangster firepower to oversee her reform initiative. But King was AfricanAmerican and Grace is white. Should that matter? It matters in terms of Von Trier's audience mostly American art cinema liberals and European intellectuals. It also matters for the history of white social and policy reactions to the race problem liberal and conservative responses from segregation to integration welfare to workfare white flight to affirmative action. Grace's color is extremely significant. Resonances with Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust and Absalom Absalom can also be found in the simplicity of the white liberal Northerner's analysis and solution to race problems. In this sense Von Trier's provocative film is perhaps above all else an indictment of American liberalism or liberal individualism domestically and globally. All of these aspects should be considered through the lens of his Brechtian alienation techniques. Otherwise this turns out to be one of the most ignominiously racist films since Birth of a Nation. First domestically the historical debate about freedmen and resistance to them is important. While one could go back further the contradictions of the modern liberalrace problem invoked by Von Trier date from the end of the Civil War. From 18651867 white southerners made very little effort to welcome AfricanAmericans into a reborn American society symbolized by the historically altered Constitution. The Ku Klux Klan together with the Black Codes terrorized AfricanAmericans physically and deprived them of education and the legal franchise. While some American historians have noted the important changes of freedmen and women marrying establishing households schools and churches owning 20 percent more land during the Reconstruction years  others emphasize that even so the country did not solve the problem of race. And the South in particular in terms of land reforms enfranchisement and education was not ready to change of its own accord. Many AfricanAmericans exercised agency and made valiant efforts to become selfsufficient yet they faced no little opposition from the planter class and some poor whites even though evidence exists of some alliances between AfricanAmericans and poor whites. While Von Trier's film does little to emphasize the efforts made by AfricanAmericans to exercise their freedom in the ways I've noted it is virtuosic at portraying the structures many faced when they set foot off the plantation symbolized by a shortlived character who venturing off the plantation waits for a sympathetic woman a white reformer like Grace but finds bloodthirsty white men instead. The role of a traveling salesman huckster also portrays the white mediation of emancipation through debt peonage and sharecropping. The failure of Reconstruction with the Compromise of 1877 brought a more precarious period of civil and economic life to AfricanAmericans in the South. And yet Manderlay makes claims to a historical context in the 1930s. Here von Trier's dramatic vehicle of slavery existing in the 1930s is again more metaphorical than realist. The point is that while the furniture of racism was rearranged it was still the same racist edifice. In addition the role of an AfricanAmerican leader is played by Wilhelm Danny Glover a house slave entrusted with knowledge of the entire Manderlay plantation rules and governance. Echoing views of nineteenthcentury AfricanAmerican leader Booker T. Washington Wilhelm's analysis is that under the conditions at Manderlay his people will meet a better life by consenting to the old social structures. The fact that armed gangsters must enforce the redistribution of social roles on one piece of property which disappears when they disappear is not a little reminiscent of Reconstruction military occupation of the South and its aftermath.

	schema:reviewBody "A person may not have to see Dogville before they get to this film but it helps. Von Trier takes his time getting where he is going laying tracks in plenty of directions and if you are not familiar with his style and don't know that it will all end with a colossal crunch you may feel bored or confused. Fear not though this movie's climax and finish depend wholly on the buildup and when they happen they are shattering. In a shorter movie with less nuance and fewer ideas presented it would just be exploitation.Critics who say that Lars von Trier is just grinding an axe and that his views on America are unwelcome and inaccurate are missing the larger point. So far the two movies of his new trilogy seem to be seething with questions not preaching answers. The spectrum of perspectives and philosophies presented make these movies themselves as experimental as the moral quests of Tom in Dogville and Grace in Manderlay. We get to share initial outrage labor for a solution and then despair in how easily it all falls apart once human weakness and natural disaster are factored in.Adjusting to the change of casting takes a few moments but then it just fits right in with the theatrical nature of these movies. Anyone who has seen a play performed with different casts knows that the two productions are weird cousins and this can make actors shine in their individual gifts. I would have loved to see Nicole Kidman devour this role but Howard's youth and vulnerability really add to the tenuous nature of her power over Manderlay and its dark secrets.I think it's lucky that von Trier is not an American. If an American director showed these images of oppression and slavery he'd be reviled even moreso especially if he were white. Americans demand sensitivity from movies about real issues and violence and humiliation are really only safe subjects in horror films and art cinema. Sometimes it takes an outsider to show you what you look like to the world and remind you of the work you have left to do. This movie feels distinctly American in its woe and in it's heartsickness at good deeds gone not unpunished. Isn't change impossible? Haven't we given it our best shot already? Manderlay agrees with us but urges us to keep trying.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1933 after leaving Dogville while traveling with her father Willem Dafoe and his gangsters to the south of USA Grace Margaret Mulligan Bryce Dallas Howard sees a slave ready to be punished in a property called Manderlay. The slavery had been abolished seventy years ago and Grace becomes revolted with the attitude of the owners of Manderlay keeping slaves in their cotton fields and following predetermined despicable rules called Mam's Law. Grace decides to stay with some gangsters in Manderlay and give notions of democracy to the slaves and to the white family. When harvest time comes Grace sees the social and economical reality of Manderlay.Manderley is the second part of Lars von Trier trilogy initiated with the awesome Dogville and following the same aesthetic of theatrical scenarios. I was impressed with the magnificent performance of the gorgeous actress Bryce Dallas Howard that I know only from her minor participation in Book of Love and her lead role in The Village. The screenplay of Manderlay is great with the narrative being very well conducted by John Hurt and in spite of having no action and being developed in a low pace the plot is interesting until the very last scene. I did not understand the point of Lars von Trier in the end since Grace defends the democratic principles inclusive with the suffrage but Wilhelm tells her that she sent the guns away too soon. Therefore does Mr. von Trier believe that guns are necessary to establish democracy? Or is he making an analogy to the present situation in Iraq showing that democracy can not be reached by the use of force? Another point is the social and economical situation of the poor former slaves free only in laws but without condition to survive seventy years after the abolishment of slavery. The same happened in Brazil and I believe in the countries that used slave labor therefore the wounds exposed in Manderlay are universal and not only an American issue. The kind of assistance that Grace gives to the former slaves is full of good intentions and does not resolve their situation since she has never reached the root of their problem. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Manderlay".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Manderlay in the run up to the Presidential Election. I was moved by it. The film is certainly topical with two weeks to go before we have the opportunity to possibly elect the first AfricanAmerican President. I believe to do so would make statement to the people of the world that this experiment we're conducting with Freedom can work. What it has taken to get us to this point has been harrowing. This nation fought a Civil War which helped to put an end to the institution of slavery. But there has been constant slippage a polite word for the continued institutional racism that led to the need for legislation to correct injustice. The Civil Rights era is now past and still racism continues. Blacks have had to continue to put their lives on the line to expand the Rights due them. We might now though witness the election of a black man as President. Racism will not end as a result of course but what a leap forward. It has taken the disaster of the past 8 years to get the country to the place where this is even possible. No W no Obama.Von Triers makes demanding films. I understand some people's aversion to his use of a soundstage in both Manderlay and Dogville. It took me a bit of time in Dogville to adjust to the artifice. For me though making the adjustment brought the issues and ideas he's dealing with to central focus in the film. No need for a real plantation in Manderlay. But the continuing enslavement does go on and it goes on in the film in the plantations of our mind. It goes on despite Grace's attempts to correct people's behaviors and beliefs and end the racism. We don't seem able to end it in this nation either.Overall IMDb users have been much kinder to Manderlay than the critics have been. Many perhaps a majority of the negative comments take exception to the fact that Lars von Trier is a foreigner and worse yet a foreigner who has never set foot on American soil. That is not a problem for me. I have never been in Germany but I know that what happened in Germany and Europe in the 30's and 40's was wrong was evil. My opinion as a nonGerman about the Holocaust and the war itself should not cannot be discounted. It is probably more valuable for the German people to have a sense of what their actions created but am I not allowed to speak to those issues? Am I oversimplifying here? Perhaps.I think in some ways von Trier's not being an American gives him some needed objectivity. I found the racial issues raised in Manderlay to go to the heart of how racism works in this country. And right now in the United States of America we are witnessing a nation having to face it own demons concerning race once again. Many may not be able to vote for Barack Obama for no other reason that he is a Black Man. Many of those people will find another rationale for their vote.I am glad I watched Manderlay at this time. It really does deal with some very crucial issues we as a nation have not always successfully faced. We have a chance to do something new but we need some clarity of vision about what we stand for as Free People. I feel Manderlay did a good job in helping clarify for me how we're all in this together. This was not an easy film for me to write about and I apologize for the political nature of what I have written.".

Manderlay is no exception.Our heroin spots a dictator on the axis of evil storms in with light sabers and an everoptimistic smile brushes away the dictator and her regime and is proud of having brought freedom and democracy to yet another place any similarities with other persons  living or dead  are fully intentional and of course debatable.But how do you make democracy work when people have not learned it through practice and the collective memory of democracy's fallacies since the ancient Greek city states. How do you make people value their freedom and be responsible for their own fortune when it is much more comfortable to blame someone else for their fate.Von Trier brilliantly and ironically discusses these issues with surprising twists in the plot. But he will most definitely offend all kinds of Americans who will be too rash to judge this movie as anything between a misunderstanding and an insult of the American people of whatever color.Bryce Dallas Howard Grace delivers a great performance.To make a movie on an almost naked stage with imaginary doors etc. is very different from anything else and it actually could contribute to focus more on the actors performance as on a theater stage. But I think that the hasty cutting of scenes and the annoyingly shaky handheld camera actually diminish the actors chances of delivering a forceful performance. I don't mind the handheld camera of the Dogma movies but this is no Dogma movie. It has artificial music sound effects lightning requisites etc. So why bother to have a handheld camera.Manderlay is an excellent movie for anybody who enjoys being provoked or how wants to confirm herhis prejudice about von Trier as a weird director with tendencies to be proudtobeoldEurope.".

	schema:reviewBody "I find it interesting to note that many critics have expressed an outrage against this film because its director a man who has never been to this country due to a fear of flying has dared to paint a picture of America that we may not like. It's funny because for the past 100 years of filmmaking American cinema has taken liberties with criticizing other cultures and presenting racial stereotypes left and right without batting an eye and even awarded such films either on acting or directing etc.. Most recently THE LAST SAMURAI presented a portentuous and condescending Tom Cruise teaching a samurai of all people how to be... a samurai! Now we cringe and scream when a Danish director brings a movie that touches on a part of our history we'd rather not touch? It's interesting though. I went into MANDERLAY only for its Brechtian concept and nothing else. Not having seen DOGVILLE I can't opine in terms of how does this compare to its predecessor. It did take me a little to get into the swing of the story but once I got past the gigantic blueprint that was the miseenscene even though the story kept changing tones from a straightforward epic to an erotic drama and back again and John Hurt's voice kept resembling Anthony Hopkins' in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula I was hooked.However I never got the sense of history being perverted in the name of antiAmericanism in watching the events of MANDERLAY unfold. Nor did I begin comparing it to America's attempt to bring democracy to Iraq. What I did get though was a sense of watching a much different version of the Shirley Jackson story The Lottery in which a woman in trying to do a right gets stoned by a ritual that has no true meaning but is there because of something called the Stockholm Syndrome where people have come to accept their situation and do nothing to change it. Grace Bryce Dallas Howard kept giving me data that she was like Tess Hutchinson from that short story  idealistic quick to act and innocent of her surroundings. She is the younger version of Mam Lauren Bacall who at first seems to be the victimizer but is later revealed to be the victim. She's thrown into the battlefield of Manderlay trained much like Patty Hearst until one day Manderlay exposes its ugly teeth and comes out to bite her in the last ugly chapter. And this is what I believe is the theme of MANDERLAY in trying to do a right one person unleashes a flood of wrongs because there are people who do not want to be taught. Lars von Trier has presented in this film a sharp but exacting allegory of human nature that is not meant to be take literally but is aimed at the thinking audience.".

What I did get though was a sense of watching a much different version of the Shirley Jackson story The Lottery in which a woman in trying to do a right gets stoned by a ritual that has no true meaning but is there because of something called the Stockholm Syndrome where people have come to accept their situation and do nothing to change it. Grace Bryce Dallas Howard kept giving me data that she was like Tess Hutchinson from that short story  idealistic quick to act and innocent of her surroundings. She is the younger version of Mam Lauren Bacall who at first seems to be the victimizer but is later revealed to be the victim. She's thrown into the battlefield of Manderlay trained much like Patty Hearst until one day Manderlay exposes its ugly teeth and comes out to bite her in the last ugly chapter. And this is what I believe is the theme of MANDERLAY in trying to do a right one person unleashes a flood of wrongs because there are people who do not want to be taught. Lars von Trier has presented in this film a sharp but exacting allegory of human nature that is not meant to be take literally but is aimed at the thinking audience.";

	schema:headline " Powerful message that can be easily twisted";
	schema:reviewBody "Manderlay is the second installment of Lars Von Trier's thoughtprovoking trilogy USA  Land of Opportunities. The story told in eight episodes starts where Dogville ended. Grace her father and their bunch of gangsters stop to eat by a place in Alabama called Manderlay Plantation where slavery persists 70 years after its Abolition. Idealistic Grace decides to stay free the blacks and start a communal free plantation.The setting like in Dogville is a theatrical set with minimalist elements of architecture and floor drawings marking the different areas of the place. The camera wanders both very close to the characters as if the viewer was filming them with their own videocamera but also from above from bird's view as if all they were little pieces in a chess table or little dolls. The setting serves the viewer to focus on the story and its message.Trier is always merciless depicting the human being and Society not because he is nasty or weird but because it an artist' obligation or it should be because that's the matter of Art to reflect on the issues that affect the world we live in. You like it or not Trier is a true artist. In fact Manderlay's story is indeed relevant to contemporary Western society.Three main questions are explored and answered in Manderlay and explicitly posed to the viewer through the events told in the movie 1 Is democracy the best political system to have a free society? 2 Can democracy be preached by using the support of guns? 3 What is the best solution to the race problem in America both in the past and in the present? Thus Grace teaches the blacks the rudiments of democracy but does so as she is escorted and supported by a bunch of gangsters therefore from a position of power and of white superior  the same she believes she's fighting against. Moreover nobody has elected her so she shouldn't be preaching democracy. If this wasn't enough Grace tries always with the best intention to teach blacks people how to be black and be free without even asking them what they want she who is not black and has never been a Slave. Actually she was a sort of slave in Dogville but she did not learn from that. The shock that she gets at the end of the movie masterly reflects how a just system can be unjust and oppressive when imposed on people who don't benefit from it and have had no voice in its establishment.There is not blinderdeaf person that the one who doesn't want to seehear. The little moral of the story is mentioned at the beginning when Grace's father reminds her of her childhood and the bird she had in a cage which she freed thinking that it was the best thing for it but not being a wild bird she found it frozen in the window next day. And once again she would treat the blacks with affection and love but also as if she was her owner.The actors are all good in their respective roles. Bryce Dallas Howard is good as Grace Margaret Mulligan she looks very sweet and innocent which helps to convey the naivety and paternalism of her character however I found her a little bland sometimes To be honest I would have liked seeing Nicole Kidman as she still looks fragile and naive but she has a maturity that would have given an extra push to the character however I don't think that frigid Nicky would have been good enough in the sex scene. Also very convincing are Isaach De Bankol as the proud and feisty Timothy Danny Glover as Wise Elder Wilhelm and Mona Hammond as lovely but week Old Wilma. However all the cast is terrific.The music is terrific as well as the last song by David Bowie Young Americans which is really relevant to the story as well as the photos of the America that would have waited for the Manderlay blacks until well entered the 1970s.The main flaws of the film are that the story can be easily twisted if interpreted literally to say that the movie supports slavery or that puts the blame on the blacks for not freeing themselves earlier which is completely the opposite of what the films intends. The movie moreover is not engaging enough at the beginning and a little bit of footage could have been cut. Finally the colors and quality of the film used are very poor which really makes the watching not as enjoyable as it could have been. Trier was much more careful in Dogville and had better colors lightening and a sharper contrast.A very good film not always engaging.".

	schema:reviewBody "Returning to Denver from Dogville Grace and her father find that their absence has allowed rival gangsters to increase in power and force them out. Beating a humiliating retreat they and their small army of hoods head across the states to find a new place to call theirs. On the road they happen across a place called Manderlay where a slave asks for help to avoid a beating about to take place. Shocked by the existence of slavery almost 70 years after it had been abolished Grace intervenes and uses her father's muscle to liberate the slaves and force the white owners into submission denying their contracts and encouraging the freed slaves to embrace freedom. This is not an easy road to go down though and Grace finds the introduction of concepts of freedom and democracy into their lives to be a challenge to implement.Dogville was my favourite film of the year when it came out. It was not perfect but it forced me to think and was done in an intelligent and interesting way and I found it rewarding despite its flaws. So I was looking forward to Manderlay. Knowing the subject I can understand why this second film in the trilogy is even more prone to being solely seen as antiAmerican and also why so many AfroAmerican actors refraining from auditioning for the film. The focus here is slavery and Grace's good intentions this time helping to bring about fairness and democracy and the problems with just doing this  regardless of best intentions. It is a clever story that provides much of interest and totally intentionally or not more and more works as an allegory for efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan to introduce democracy by force if necessary. Of course by picking this subject Von Trier hasn't really helped himself because of course it was going to be taken at face value and of course some viewers were going to throw their hands up and refuse to watch it with shouts of racism. Some may even think that the film suggests that the end of slavery was a bad thing.And this is a weakness of the film because at some points it seems that this is the message it is trying to send  particularly the ending that sees the democracy fails and everyone basically agrees that the old ways were best. These points may have been made from the scenario in hand but it is not well done and asks a lot without having much backing for making it. However stepping out of the specific race issue and seeing it as a general comment is perhaps easier as it does take the heat out of the situation and prevents the audience stressing over the finger being pointed at individuals  because it isn't. The film challenges a society that makes a sweeping change but does little to ease it or plan for it. The end credits show us what it means as we see an America split along racial lines in the present and a history of hate and fear on both sides  much like the change Grace makes with little planning for how to best do it. A reference to the World Trade Centre also suggests that this is far from an issue of just slavery but of the wider point regarding making changes for good with little understanding of the consequences. In Iraq few weep over the removal of Saddam but many weep and many die over how it was done and how badly it has all gone wrong with everyone seeking a way out of the mess and almost let them sink into the old system with a slightly new brand.As director Von Trier repeats the style of the first film in the empty set. It is an effect that doesn't work as well this time  partly because it was done before and partly because it is not as relevant to the story as it was thematically in Dogville. He does get good performances from his cast even if not as good as before. Howard is OK but not as good as Kidman. Her Grace is perhaps too young and too simplistic but she does enough to make it work reasonably well. Glover deserves credit for taking the role while Dafoe turns in a cameo at most as do Bacall Sevingy and Ivanek. The black cast included a lot of Brits such as Croll Hammond Gideon and Sosanya. They all do well but this film is less an actor's film than Dogville. In the latter it was more about the characters and their hearts thus gave more for the cast to work with. Here it is the situation and the wider theme and thus the cast are left with slightly blockier characters and fewer chances to shine even if most are good.Like my experience with Dogville I found the more thought I gave to Manderlay and the more I explored the points and themes in my own time the more rewarding I found it. So it is here if you want to get worked up about the very specific subject it is lecturing on and it is easy to do so then go for it  you will be right to do so because the film is meant as a challenge did you expect it to be about everyone else? This is its strength and it is very strong in this area and as such it is worth seeing  and if it annoys or angers you please don't assume it is therefore rubbish rather rejoice that a film has drawn a reaction and not just slipped over your brain as yet another piece of mindless entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "AntiAmerican or not? This seems to be the most important question for many American viewers when deciding whether to like von Triers trilogy of films about America. Uninteresting as the discussion may be i must still say that i don't think it's antiAmerican rather it just shows a very bleak view of humanity in general.In my opinion Dogville was an amazing film. Even though it was artificial to the core with it's theatrical style i still felt it all the way to the bone. Seldom have i seen such an arty movie that still worked so well. Amazing actors a story that is brutal and inhuman and an amazing ending. Doing a followup to such a movie is not easy and yet von Trier has promised to make two. Today i saw Manderlay and the question is if it lived up to the expectations given by Dogville.Right from the beginning Manderlay is at a disadvantage compared to Dogville. The theatrical style with it's stagelike setup and minimum of props has already been done and is not as unique as it was when Dogville was released. Also the lead actress Nicole Kidman is missing replaced by the at least to me quite unknown Bryce Dallas Howard. Also James Caan as her father is replaced by Willem Dafoe. So how did they do? Willem Dafoe is in my opinion one of the most talented actors today in Hollywood and he does excellent here as usual Bryce Dallas Howard on the other hand is rather pale as a replacement for Kidman. Don't get me wrong Howard does a decent job of tackling the lead and she fits rather nicely in the movie. However she lacks the width and depth in her acting that Kidman has honed through the years and Howards version of Grace feels more shallow and a lot less haunted.Otherwise the actors are like in Dogville the main attraction. One of von Triers main skills must definitely be bringing out the best in his actors. Everyone performs well despite the demanding format of the movie. The minimalist style demands it's actors to perform well at all times as there is no room for mistakes and nothing to cover them up.Dogville is in my opinion a better movie than Manderlay. The story is more multilayered the actors especially Kidman are better and the moral points are presented in a much more powerful way. Yet Manderlay is undoubtedly also a good movie as well as a good continuation of the story about Grace. If you enjoyed Dogville and accepted the format in which it was presented my guess is that you'll enjoy Manderlay. Part of the point of watching Dogville for me was that it was food for thought and Manderlay also gives you reason to think. So even though this was not as good as Dogville i'm still not disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Danes were active slave traders for several centuries but Denmark was also the first country to abolish slave trade in 1792 they had little to fear by the way as they were not very successful in the trade dominated by France The Netherlands England and Portugal. One of its current inhabitants Lars Von Trier has decided to make a movie about the period after official abolishment of slavery in the American South.In his former Golden Hearttrilogy Von Trier made distinct movies around one theme. This trilogy touches more themes but they have the form in common. Like in Dogville the stage with its imaginary buildings and chalk lines is used to indicate that the US is an artificial country without a soul. We have the division in eight chapters and also the same narrative ironic voiceover of John Hurt. This time the setting is even sparser although height is put to better use for example in some overhead shots flock of swallows and the location of Mam's Lauren Bacall playing the matriarch of the plantation room high above the working rest.The opening and closing shot is immediately one of the better ones in the whole movie We see a map of the US then look at the car of Grace and her father driving it from Colorado to Alabama the camera zooms in and we have actually watched the stage all the time or an illusion of that. Arriving on the Manderlay plantation they discover that slavery is still common good despite the legal wrong by that time. A debate follows between Grace and her father as she wants to free the slaves and let them start their own business with their newly obtained power. Her father is cynical about this idea and they decide to split for a while they also split the gang to let Grace try this in his eyes doomed experiment.With the help of part of her father's force she frees the slaves meanwhile the owner dies as indication of the end of slavery and with the help of her father's lawyer sets up a company where every former slave shares equally. As soon few are willing to work Grace's treatment of the new employees gets harsher and she starts to hold meetings where they have to vote on outstanding issues and are in this way forced into democracy cooperation and education a parallel to the forcefeeding of democracy in Iraq. A book is found by Grace in Mam's bedroom stating details about how to keep the slaves under control they are classified in 7 groups the number seven also very prominent in Dogville with the figurines. When hard times fall on Manderlay after a sandstorm the donkey Lucifer is slaughtered to save a sick child no we don't see the donkey dead. Lucifer is meant here as Satan and as an old woman eats the food she ends up being sentenced to death. Grace takes the role of executioner but before the execution tells several lies to her indicating her slippery slope from idealism to betrayer of her own ideals. As successful harvests emerge the force Grace used as a backing is no longer needed and they leave except for Grace. But the tragedy only continues as the roles soon reverse with another turn of events the surprise ending where Grace at one time ends up whipping a former slave and being made a permanent member of the corporation by the same voting system she once imposed. Then Manderlay breaks form and with the arrival of her father reveals a more comical side probably because rumors has it that the next part Wasington will be a comedy. The car moves on to Washington.Manderlay is also partly loosely based on the preface of the book Histoire d'O Udo Kier in both movies by the way. So another part of Manderlay relates to the sexual fantasies Grace has about the slaves especially when projected at Timothy 'the proudly niger'. The fantasies being just that as reality will show.Manderlay basically relates three themes Slavery Idealism vs. Pragmatism Grace vs. Grace's father or even Wilhelm and the philosophical view on mankind and liberty. Grace is the idealist wellknown from other Von Triermovies and is once again the victim of that idealism as more selfish Wilma Timothy people destroy that idealism and finally the pragmatism slavery as the lesser of two evils of Wilhelm wins over to continue the slave system in a more modern form. The link to the present being that African Americans are free slaves in the modern world as only the means to impose that system have changed. But Von Trier also criticizes people for not fighting that system and go along with it as lazy citizens. To confirm that the end credits contain again images of racial poverty and violence but also AfricanAmerican leaders and to confirm the Iraqlink Bush and 911 are thrown in.Danny Glover as Wilhelm and Isaach De Bankol as Timothy both give strong performances but Bryce Dallas Howard is not of Kidman's stature Her facial and body expression is more limited and she has a less interesting diction and delivery. As Von Trier generally treats his actresses in a harsh way there is a parallel with the story of Grace.In comparison with Dogville however Manderlay touches fewer themes and does not have the same amount of layers of interpretation present in the story. Manderlay is less ambiguous and ambitious also in the camerawork. Add to this the feeling that this seems far more rushed in making several editing discontinuities I can not see them on the same level although Manderlay is still an interesting and intelligent movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Danes were active slave traders for several centuries but Denmark was also the first country to abolish slave trade in 1792 they had little to fear by the way as they were not very successful in the trade dominated by France The Netherlands England and Portugal. One of its current inhabitants Lars Von Trier has decided to make a movie about the period after official abolishment of slavery in the American South.In his former Golden Hearttrilogy Von Trier made distinct movies around one theme. This trilogy touches more themes but they have the form in common. Like in Dogville the stage with its imaginary buildings and chalk lines is used to indicate that the US is an artificial country without a soul. We have the division in eight chapters and also the same narrative ironic voiceover of John Hurt. This time the setting is even sparser although height is put to better use for example in some overhead shots flock of swallows and the location of Mam's Lauren Bacall playing the matriarch of the plantation room high above the working rest.The opening and closing shot is immediately one of the better ones in the whole movie We see a map of the US then look at the car of Grace and her father driving it from Colorado to Alabama the camera zooms in and we have actually watched the stage all the time or an illusion of that. Arriving on the Manderlay plantation they discover that slavery is still common good despite the legal wrong by that time. A debate follows between Grace and her father as she wants to free the slaves and let them start their own business with their newly obtained power.

Manderlay is a rough film to watch not because of it's political aspects or it's philosophical viewpoints but because of it's narrative simplicity. But don't you just have to love that theatrical touch once you realize how it fits in this film as a means of alienation?You can not really review Bryce Dallas Howard's performance without discussing the character von Trier has built for her. Anyway I think you can grow attached to Grace within the middlepart of the film and that's basically what makes the film work after all. Rest of the cast is a delight after another especially since they're actors with little less name than you might expect in an everyday Hollywood production. Even then I especially like Danny Glover in his part though but naturally every film needs it's grand old man.".

From a purely personal point of view I must say that I regard Von Trier films as an acquired taste like poison which I have never acquired  in fact I have always found them rather revolting and have never been able to sit through one of his schizzy nightmares from beginning to end  although I did sort of make it through Dogville  by sheer will power with many cigarette breaks  but mainly because of a fascination with Nicole Kidman's uncannily shapely nose. In short I thought Dogville was nothing but pretentious bt and I couldn't believe that an actress like Lauren Bacall lent her prestige to it but  I have to admit  against my better judgement  that I actually sort of liked Manderlay. For one thing Bacall who was wooden in Dogville dies off in the first ten minutes Grace who was Kidman in the first installment of this projected trilogy has now metamorphosed into a less glamorous but far more credible actress Bryce Dallas Howard and a ponderous James Caan as Grace's gangster father has been replaced by a more digestible if slightly ridiculous Willem Defoe but what really makes Manderlay work as a drama rather than a pretentious lecture on the sad state of the world and the decay of the American Dream  is the excellent cast of black actors especially Danny Glover but all uniformly good  who somehow infuse this Von Trier head game with some real soul. Another thing which helps is that Von Trier has mercifully gotten a little away from the overweaning Monopoly Board sets and invisible clicking doors which made Dogville unbearable after the first half hour. There is still in Manderlay a certain amount of the artificial Monopoly Board geometry in place but not so much that it totally distracts as it did in the earlier film. Who knows maybe Part III will be set on a Ouija Board  in any case Manderlay has a certain feeling going for it that makes it far more watchable than any of Von Trier's previous sessions of celluloid sadomasochism.The title incidentally has nothing to do with Kiplings Mandalay but is a coopting of the name of the spooky mansion in Hitchcock's Rebeccah. Here it is the name of a strange Alabama plantation where in 1933 slavery is still going on and the slaves seem to like it that way  for as head slave Danny Glover great role puts it We ain't reddy fo' no freedom yet  we's better off dis way.".

One of the most intense and fascinating films I have seen in a long time great story great acting and really unforgettable. Easily the most critical and intelligent films I've seen since Dogville. I watched it by myself so I have no idea what any other human being would make of it I could see people loving it hating it and arguing for a long time about it there are no easy answers only complex moral and psychological judgments that require actual indepth thought. Its not just a film about slavery or African Americans or Americans in general it's a deconstruction of American myths and our basic assumptions about democracy. I know it wont happen but someone deserves an Oscar or something. I got it at Blockbuster so its pretty easy to find too. My only complaint which is small is that it does follow a familiar trajectory as Dogville at times a bit too closely. Don't let that stop you and if you haven't seen the 1st part of this The Land Of Opportunity trilogy it's not absolutely necessary. Trier takes Dogma 91 in an interesting direction with these films which act much like stage plays where actors mime with imaginary sets. What this does other than just be artsy is to show us that our constructions of society are illusory isolating the fact that we are collections of people and ideas no more a house or a town than we are a country.".

With this film the consensus doesn't matter it goes straight to the point but whereas Dogville was a little bit demagogic this one gives us a lot of different indication Grace is less onesided she fools himself in the trap of slavery she's less unreachable being overwhelmed by her sexual desire and the film become more exciting and complex. Moreover there are more events and motion and the film is less boring than Dogville was at the first view.To finish i'll say that Manderlay isn't only a brilliant sequel to Dogville but an evolution in narration with a completely different topic".

With this film the consensus doesn't matter it goes straight to the point but whereas Dogville was a little bit demagogic this one gives us a lot of different indication Grace is less onesided she fools himself in the trap of slavery she's less unreachable being overwhelmed by her sexual desire and the film become more exciting and complex. Moreover there are more events and motion and the film is less boring than Dogville was at the first view.To finish i'll say that Manderlay isn't only a brilliant sequel to Dogville but an evolution in narration with a completely different topic";

	schema:reviewBody "Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal square off in Analyze This' a satirical look at family' life from director Harold Ramis.  After witnessing a hit on a colleague outside a restaurant and narrowly escaping the same fate himself thanks to the need of a toothpick mob boss Paul Vitti De Niro finds himself overcome with panic attacks.  He sweats cries at the drop of a hat and can't breathe.  With a vital meeting only two weeks away he realizes he needs help quickly and sends one of his men Jelly Joe Viterelli in search of a shrink.'  Coincidentally Jelly has just been rearended in traffic by Dr. Ben Sobol Crystal who just happens to be a psychiatrist.  And Jelly has his business card. Unable to discourage the adamant Vitti Sobol acquiesces and agrees to treat him exclusively for two weeks though he is less than enthusiastic about being pressed into the service of a wellknown criminal even less enthused however is his fiancee Laura Lisa Kudrow.  The ensuing repartee between Vitti and Sobol served up with snappy dialogue and impeccable timing takes this comedy artistically and otherwise to the highest level.  De Niro and Crystal are absolutely outstanding infusing their characters with every possible nuance while successfully avoiding the stereotypes that lesser actors may have relied upon here.  The two play so well off of one another that the humor virtually seems to explode spontaneously.  All the while the likable Kudrow more than holds her own with her costars proving unequivocally that there is so much more to her than just being a great Friend.'  Credit must go to Ramis as well for keeping things on an even keel throughout. There's funny scenes aplenty in this film especially the ones in which the loyal but somewhat thickheaded thug Jelly or the winsome Laura take part. The most memorable though is one in which Dr. Sobol dreams that he is Don Vito Corleone in the movie The Godfather' when he is shot while buying some fruit.  This is parody at its finest.  Written by Ramis Ken Lonergan and Peter Tolan and with a supporting cast that includes Chazz Palminteri Primo Richard C. Castellano Jimmy Kyle Sabihy Ben's son Michael  Molly Shannon Caroline and Elizabeth Bracco Marie Vitti Analyze This' will keep you laughing and doing lines' You...you're good yes you are...yes you are!' long after the credits have faded from the screen.  I rate this one 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was looking forward to seeing ANALYZE THIS for many reasons. One Billy Crystal is one great and funny comedian. Two Robert De Niro is the king of crimeaction movies. I mean ever saw THE UNTOUCHABLES? Three the storyline did seem like a very good idea that had never been done before. And four I love Lisa Kudrow. I was not disappointed with this movie. There could have been more but it is surely worth seeing. There were only a few instances that I started to really laugh but there were plenty of good and funny jokes as well as some good touches of mobsterlike crime.Ben Sobol Billy Crystal is a family psychiatrist who has a son and is engaged to the beautiful Laura MacNamara Lisa Kudrow. He gets into a car accident with a dimwitted man Jelly Joe Viterelli who happens to be the righthand man to Paul Vitti Robert De Niro the most powerful mobster in New York. This leads to Vitti seeking the help of Sobol. Vitti gets into very emotional moods and anxiety attacks. He refuses to admit it because he doesn't want to show weakness before a big meeting with the heads of the mob group. Sobol must help Vitti realize his problems with his father as well as try to survive among the gangsters.The plot is very original and cool but the unlikely mixture of crime and comedy might leave a stale taste in your mouth. The curse words in this movie can get a little out of hand for a comedy but that's because of the crime added to it. They did not bother me at all in fact I thought it was funny and pulled of very well especially in scenes between Crystal and De Niro.Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro work great together. Both do very good jobs at their performances even though De Niro's crying scenes seemed a little fake. The one at the end was getting better but they still looked forced. The gorgeous Lisa Kudrow although probably a bit underplayed did a good job too. I also think Joe Viterelli did a good job as the stupid funny mobster. He certainly looks the part of a mobster and I think the comic touch in his role was pulled off well.There were a few plot holes however such as the one with Billy Crystal's character having problems with his father. This is arguably used to further the plot between De Niro and his father but it is never resolved for Crystal. There are also a few jokes that didn't work but the jokes that do work completely make up for them. This movie is different from your average SNLalumni comedy movie but it's full of funny jokes and characters and is certainly worth a rent.".

	schema:reviewBody "ANALYZE THIS  1999   It has been a long time since I have seen a comic duo form a better shtick than Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal in the mob comedy Analyze This a smart amusing satire from director Harold Ramis Multiplicity Groundhog Day. For a movie like this to succeed past a commercial level chemistry between the main characters must be amiable and spirited. Crystal and DeNiro indeed mold amiable incentive between themselves therefore quite a few hilarious moments emerge from their perception of the wellwritten script by Kenneth Lonergan Peter Tolan and Ramis himself.  Analyze This details the lives of two very different individuals. The first person is played by Billy Crystal a calm cool and collected psychiatrist named Ben Sobol who is divorced with a young teenage son and is engaged to soon wed a resigning TV reporter named Laura MacNamara Lisa Kudrow. Ben is currently dealing with a emotional patient Molly Shannon distressed because her spouse left and filed a restraining order on her. This woman's problems will seem like nothing when Ben obtains his new client. Robert DeNiro plays the second person this movie examines the most powerful mobster in the city of New York Paul Vitti. He and his accomplices including a chubby and clumsy bodyguard named Jelly Joe Viterelli are in the process of significant business when Vitti experiences an anxiety attack. On the road to a nervous breakdown this emotionally vulnerable man comes to Ben after Jelly briefly encounters the therapist during a minor car accident. Ben is very nervous with his new patient who forces compliments and demands upon him. The first confrontation sequence between Ben and Paul is quite engaging. There is an instant odd couple chemistry among the two characters. The witty sessions Sobol and Vitti consummate are also very imaginative and smart. The scenes also have the intelligence to take Vitti's emotional problems seriously.   The setup accurately introduces both the gangsters and the psychiatrist's family. We understand the mob boss's feelings of stress and depression this picture is not all shallow slapstick comedy there is a dimensional human touch. The film takes its conflicts seriously but executes them in a cute humorous style. The audience can also relate to Billy Crystal's character who is an average Joe with a typical American family in a complicated situation in which he is not entirely sure how to handle.Both external and internal conflicts are interestingly accomplished well structured presented and written. The film does a good job of convincingly bringing the world of mobsters to life with wellcast actors and their rich stylish accents. Paul Vitti's sexual life needed more exploration although his adulterous intentions do induce a few laughs the story could have gone somewhere with his infidelity. Vitti's family is also irresolute. The film almost never portrays them on screen and seldom does Paul himself discuss his children and wife. The Lisa Kudrow character is furthermore underwritten never thoroughly examined and very shallow. The lack of chemistry amid Kudrow and Crystal leads to the unconvincing relationship Ben occupies. Robert DeNiro is the perfect option for the comic role of Paul Vitti who is a more difficult character than it may appear. DeNiro triggers a sharp comic edge and gives the right amount of exaggerated sentimentality to Vitti. Lisa Kudrow is fun to watch producing a dimminded character whimsically similar to the one in her hit TV sitcom Friends. Chazz Palminteri and Joe Viterelli contribute different but energetic supporting roles. Analyze This is unmistakably the right kind of movie for Billy Crystal. I am unaware of another Hollywood comedian who could have conquered his role with more proficiency and mirth he is one of the main components that makes Analyze This work well. Harold Ramis's comedy obviously borrows ideas from past comparable films like Grosse  Point Blank and Mafia but as this production proves just because it was done before doesn't mean it cannot be successfully accomplished again with the right casting.".

	schema:reviewBody "This wasn't hilarious as everyone told me it was but it was still very enjoyable and pretty solid entertainment. Although a comedy it has violence and a lot of profanity.Robert De Niro as usual is excellent and once again surprises viewers with his comedic talent. He plays a mobster familiar territory but one who needs psychiatric help. He's hilarious when he's crying! His shrink is played by Billy Crystal in an untypical lowkey character role. My favorite in this film was Joe Viterelli the fat guymobster who has a few very funny lines. Viterelli is one of these guys you see in a ton of gangster movies and is always interesting.The female lead in here Lisa Kudrow Laura was not appealing to me characterwise. Overall a funny movie and much better than the sequel.".

And by that I mean that a simple facial contortion can send the audience into a fit of laughter or send a chill down their spine. In Taxi Driver his devilish widetoothed smile portrayed a sense of fascination and pleasure  his character was being bombarded with images that made him feel happy and almost hysterical in a strange sort of way. When he stared into that mirror and asked whom we were talkin' to he smiled because he was sick and liked the idea of having the control and enjoyed picturing the end result.In Analyze This when he stares at Billy Crystal with his iconic Who you talkin' to? glare it is not out of pleasure but out of sheer amazement. In short he is asking everyone in the room and the audience if he's the only one who's seeing what's going on and the complete absurdity of it all. Watching De Niro's face in Analyze This and listening to the accompanying comical speeches is the pure pleasure of the film. He steals the show.Paul Vitti De Niro is having problems. Lately he has been unable to work up enough will power to kill hostages gain an erection and has been found crying for forty minutes after watching bittersweet commercials on television. Normally this might be considered normal for the most part at least but the problem is that Vitti is a Mob Boss in New York City meaning that if he can't muster up enough strength to carry out his duties word of his weaknesses will travel and he'll soon find himself sleeping with the fishes.Ben Sobel Crystal is a frustrated failing psychologist trying to raise a son on his own and keep a relationship with his girlfriend Lisa Kudrow from falling apart. When he smashes into the back of Vitti's car the Mafia kingpin's righthandman Jelly the late Joe Viterelli asks him to help out his employer.Sobel is of course quite reluctant to begin practice on New York's most infamous Mafia figure but reluctantly does so after being threatened. You know who I am? Yes. No you don't. No I don't. Have you read about me in the papers? Yes. No you haven't. I don't even get the paper.Meanwhile a reunion of all the powerful Mafia figures in New York looms ominously nearer and Sobel finds himself being targeted by the FBI as well as professional hit men who find themselves being thrown out of hotel windows by Vitti. Let me guess he just jumped? Sobel asks. Vitti is eager to use this as an explanation for the incident.Analyze This is directed by Harold Ramis the man who crafted Groundhog Day with Bill Murray and who also played Murray's best friend in Ivan Reitman's Stripes 1981 about two idiots who join the Army in search of women and quick cash. Here in what is literally one of his roughest and filthiest films Ramis is able to poke fun at all the most iconic stereotypes of ItalianAmerican Mafia figures. There's even a great dream sequence that mimics The Godfather in which Sobel wanders towards a fruit stand to buy some oranges and finds himself assassinated by two hit men with De Niro doing his best impersonation of crybaby Fredo. Later when recounting his story to Vitti in a church the Mafia kingpin asks him I was Fredo? I don't think so. You will find yourself appreciating much more of Analyze This if you are familiar with its content. It may not be labeled as such but in its essence it is a spoof of the last century's best gangster films borrowing its plot from The Don's Analyst and benefiting from a wonderfully surprising and humorous performance by De Niro who stretched his funny bones with Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy and Neil Jordan's We're No Angels but masters the feat of effective facial features here. It does indeed help to know a bit about Mafia movies before you see Analyze This but even if you don't you're still guaranteed to have a fun time.45 stars.John Ulmer".

	schema:reviewBody "The laughs are few and far between. Analyze This is not subtle it's not intelligent it's not even FUNNY. I wasn't expecting a brilliant piece of work but THIS is receiving rave reviews?Crystal needs his own personal director or else some sort of mental straitjacket so that he learns that there is a point where less is more. He has a few good lines but for the most part is merely obnoxious. The last scene with the mob bosses is one of the most embarrassing scenes I've ever watched. Why is it even in the film? It looks to me like it's simply a chance for Crystal to do a bit of standup on his own but it's so bad that you want to take him out behind the barn and end his misery.I'm a huge DeNiro fan and I find even his performance disappointing. His popular crying scenes are really not that great. They look dare I say it about the great Robert poorly acted. I wanted to laugh but it just wasn't there. His you you thing was old the first time he used it. With his track record a miss is allowable. With Crystal it's expected. He should stick to making kid's films about giant actors and such things.If you want to see a really good comedy in this vein try Grosse Pointe Blank about a hitman going to his 10year high school reunion. It's witty intelligent and wellacted. But avoid Analyze This even if you're a DeNiro fan. If you're a fan of Crystal well your expectations of intelligent life have probably been lowered to the paramecium level anyway. So enjoy.".

	onyx:emotionText "The laughs are few and far between. Analyze This is not subtle it's not intelligent it's not even FUNNY. I wasn't expecting a brilliant piece of work but THIS is receiving rave reviews?Crystal needs his own personal director or else some sort of mental straitjacket so that he learns that there is a point where less is more. He has a few good lines but for the most part is merely obnoxious. The last scene with the mob bosses is one of the most embarrassing scenes I've ever watched. Why is it even in the film? It looks to me like it's simply a chance for Crystal to do a bit of standup on his own but it's so bad that you want to take him out behind the barn and end his misery.I'm a huge DeNiro fan and I find even his performance disappointing. His popular crying scenes are really not that great. They look dare I say it about the great Robert poorly acted. I wanted to laugh but it just wasn't there. His you you thing was old the first time he used it. With his track record a miss is allowable. With Crystal it's expected. He should stick to making kid's films about giant actors and such things.If you want to see a really good comedy in this vein try Grosse Pointe Blank about a hitman going to his 10year high school reunion.

So what we have is essentially a Sopranos  What About Bob? hybrid with a dose of The Godfather thrown in for good measure. I'm not saying that this movie copied The Sopranos. I realize they were in production at the same time. Just that the story is essentially the same.Not that this is a bad movie. Crystal and Deniro are good although Crystal as Dr. Sobel doesn't strike me as a particularly good psychiatrist. In general the movie is mildly amusing and reaches the heights of hilarious when Sobel is drafted to represent Vitti at a meeting of mob bosses.Overall this isn't spectacular but I would say it's above average.610".

For the most parts the story is simple to follow as we shadow Genji in his quest to conquer the high school class by class through sheer brute force gaining of respect or simply just friendship established.

Oozing plenty of testosterone and machismo there are still enough tender moments to make you cringe bearing in mind that after all these are pretty looking boys with mean and tough looking exteriors but sometimes still softies at heart.It's fight club in schools where black leather is the new uniform.

	schema:reviewBody "Personally I'm not a Miike Takashi fan and I usually dislike these Furyou deliquent high schooler genre films but it was surprisingly enjoyable film even for me.The plot is quite typical of high school movies. Genji Oguri Shun a son of yakuza boss must achieve an unprecedented unification of notorious Suzuran High School AKA Crow's High School in order to take over his father's position. Genji soon finds the strongest guy in the school Serizawa Yamada Takayuki who was also set to conquer all other classes. Genji challenges Serizawa to a duel but of course being a newcomer that he is wasn't taken seriously at first. Genji then seeks help and builds up his own army while defeating other minor 'bosses' and eventually a showdown with Serizawa in his journey to the top of Suzuran High.The story for this film is extremely welldesigned with excellent flow from beginning to the very end. What I especially liked about this movie is that it was more than just random violence by bunch of kids trying to look badass. Although it IS action packed the main theme of this film is school politics and friendship. Oguri Shun's character developed very well from a clueless kid to a leader backed by many trustworthy friends.Cinematography for this film was extremely welldone from school to the streets you can tell the production crew paid attention to the tiniest detail in every single scene. Action was also very welldirected for an exciting 2 hours. I thought it was even more visually pleasing than Miike's Ryuu ga Gotoku.Casting for this film is absolutely incredible. I recognized so many faces many who established themselves in yakuza or delinquent roles but the most pleasant surprise was Yamada Takayuki who had his share of dark roles in the past but never a violent one such as this and possibly the first as a villain. I've never thought him as a wild type but he was so cool as a villain and gave his character really big presence in this film. I'm still not convinced with Oguri Shun's acting or his role as a violent punk student but he seemed to be less out of place as he was in Hana Yori Dango dorama series. All the other cast did what they do best and a very high level of acting overall.Although I haven't read the manga series this prequel was very easy to follow. It's impossible to take away the cheesiness associated with mangaadaptation or high school violence but it was an extremely welldirected action movie with a meaningful message.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crows Zero is often cited as one of Miike's most commercial films. While this is hardly true think Koshonin or One Missed Call it certainly is one of Miike's slickest films gaining such international attention to date. The film has a solid budget minimal weirdness and even a pretty linear and welldeveloped storyline. But it is still Miike alright. screen cap of Crows ZeroSetting for the film is a notorious high school where the scum of Japan gathers to gain control over their rivals. Gangs are started and wars are fought without any of the teachers interfering. While this by itself may sound like a streak of Miike weirdness it's actually not an uncommon theme in Japanese entertainment. The film itself is based on a manga for those who haven't read it the film could best be described as a mix of Blue Spring Volcano High and Cromartie High.Helping the setting is a typical Japanese JRock punk look and sound that gives each of the characters it's unique style. The weird dressing sense and crazy hairdos are lifted straight from a manga universe and while a little silly add a lot to the coolness of the gangs. Needless to say there's a lot of posing and looking mean to be admired.The story is pretty simple as newcomer Genji is out to prove himself to his father and is willing to take on the top chief of the school. He impresses from the start and is able to work his way slowly to the top where he will face Tamao to gain ultimate control of the school. There are no twists and turns so you know what to expect from the movie when it comes down to storyline development. screen cap of Crows ZeroVisually the film looks splendid but indeed a lot slicker than earlier Miike films. There is not too much room for visual silliness anymore although there is that bowling scene though Miike makes excellent use of the budget he most obviously received. The action scenes in particular look stunning with perfect use of fast forward and slow motion to increase the impact of the punches. The visual timing is spot on aided by some very solid editing work. It's reassuring to see that Miike should not be limited to working with small budgets only.The soundtrack is a little less satisfying. Though I can live with the JRock sound in a film like this the time spent on concerts and the like is a little too long. The RB intermezzos are probably even worse and make the film a little too smooth in some scenes. A film like this could've done without them and probably would've benefited from it too.Acting is strong all round with Shun Oguri showing off a lot of his abilities. Supporting roles are strong too giving the film that little extra flair. And I'm always pleased to see Kenichi Endo liven things up a bit. Most importantly the actors succeed in keeping a lighter tone throughout the scenes without hurting the gritty feel of the film.Crows Zero is not Miike's best film though it will probably become one of his more popular ones. While the exterior of the film is a little slicker than usual there is still enough Miike weirdness left and some really bone crunching fights to behold. The film never slacks and even gives the viewer a nice look into the whole gang structure in between the fights making it a little more than just another buttkicking action flick.Miike is near perfect in setting the atmosphere for this film only the music can be a little too much sometimes. Apart from that I still prefer Miike as a loose gun director but I can hardly criticize a film like this just because of that. A fun ride intense where it needs to be and solid in all other areas. 4.05.0".

	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike is an extraordinary filmmaker even if he works sometimes in circumstances that other directors might find ordinary such as all of the genres that Miike tackles... which are by a mild estimation almost all of them. Name a kind of movie Miike's probably done it from family movie to samurai epic to just totally fed up waypast Xrated stuff not to mention all of the Yakuza crime movies that by this time should be coming out of his nose from going over so often. But with Crows Episode Zero he found a way to tell a Yakuza story just a little different by making it about the teenage kids some of them anyway of the Yakuza who enroll in an extreme high school where it's basically not about learning anything but fighting and ascending the ranks to become the head of the school's badass fightin' kids. It's the kind of movie that if you are fourteen and watching it it's like a near wetdream of awesomeness. For the rest of us the movie serves as lots of good fun.And as this is Miike even the more conventional things in the movie like the whole 'I'mdoingthistooutimpressmydad' to the 'mygirl'sbeenkidnapped' thing get twisted just a wee bit. And thankfully a great dose of humor is sprinkled throughout with really random moments of hilarity my favorite was when the teen is just talking to his friends on the roof and casually takes a gigantic ball of some kind and rolls it away at a set of other kids all lined up like bowling pins who get knocked down in silly CGI style and little lines and things with the characters another highlight involves a guy trying to impress two girls in a bar with some disastrous results. But when it's not being funny Miike is also an excellent director of young brawny actors who have a lot of energy and talent to burn. And he casts well enough for its target audience the movie isn't quite violent enough i.e. Ichi the Killer level to make it unwatchable for teen eyes so all of the guys like Genji and Serizawa are cast for ultimate badassitude.Indeed there are some scenes and moments that come close to being vintage Miike for this kind of tough and gritty action movie. There's a fight scene midway through for example that is done with no frills and with total excitement as a guy is fighting against a large group of people and as it starts to rain and he looks down and out he gets back up and staggeringly knocks out almost all of them left. It's visceral things like that that work but it's also how Miike taking of course from a comicbook if it weren't a comicbook one would swear a brilliant and ornery teen had written it takes material that has originality and pumps it up to the level of an crazy sort of epic. Why this school exists and the parents don't mind sending them away to get the crap kicked out of them in a caste system is beyond me but why carp? We believe it because Miike does and gets us into the power struggle and the ascension of Genji even if it means he might go crazy or if another teen Tokio possibly may die from a brain aneurysm.Then again the movie also has some problems to it as well. The whole element of the girls being kidnapped could have been cutout or at least given with a little more development with the female characters before they're plucked away as a kind of plot convenience if not contrivance just so there's something else on the plate of 'sweneedtotakecareof' in the story. And the climax of the film imbued with a real epic sensibility with Genji and Serizawa fighting in a big battle with nearly a hundred students on each side to fight stumbles a bit as its moments of raw power and energy are awkwardly cut with images of the one guy getting operated on in the hospital  it lacks tension or focus except that surgery is going on who cares lets get back to the wicked action  and as well a ballad sung by a woman we see her singing on stage too and the fighting done in slow motion. It's almost as if Miike goes too far in his excesses in this whole sequence and ultimately half of it is really great and the other half is just... lame.But for any fan of the director's or anyone looking for a kooky take on rebellious youth in Japan who are only a couple of steps removed from a Battle Royale scenario it's a good ticket to take. There's tight acting and mostly hardrocking Japanese punk tunes and the action is often creative and engaging.".

	schema:headline " A violent teen action film that is surprisingly very good...";
	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite Japanese movie series of the 80s was Nasu Hiroyuki's absurdly violent BeBop High School which was based on Kiyuchi Kazuhiro's popular manga series which ran in Weekly Young Jump from 1983. It was outrageously violent and portrayed high school life as a battlefield where personal combat was a means to prove a teen's worth and masculinity. Enter Miike Takashi's recent Crows Zero which almost plays like an updated version of BeBop High School albeit with his own unique flourishes and stylistic nuances. Based on Takahashi Hiroshi's gritty comic series Crows which runs in the Monthly Shonen Champion magazine the movie follows the exploits of Takiya Genji the son of a high ranking Yakuza ganglord who has transferred into the notorious high school Suzuran.Suzuran's student body has the unique distinction of being the most violent lawless and brutal. Formal education is the least of the worries at the school as daily classes are almost nonexistent and students spend most of the time either fighting with each other or allying themselves with the various factions that control the school.The top A class comprises of allies of the current king of the school Serizawa TamaoYamada Takeyuki who is the socalled Hyaku Jyu Oh King of the Hundred Beasts for his ferocity and strength in fights. Despite his baby faced good looks and somewhat goofy personality he is ruthlessly determined to keep his top position at whatever costs and beats down all challengers to his throne.A new transfer student Genji Takaya Oguri Jun has just entered the school and begins to make a name for himself first by beating up a group of Yakuza who had a run in with Serizawa and then by beating a leading school warlord Tamamura Chuta Suzunosuke to take over his class. One of the Yakuza thugs sent after Serizawa Katagiri Ken Yabe Kyosuke himself a former dropout from Suzuran takes Genji under his wing and offers to teach him how to become the new king of the school an achievement that Genji hopes will eclipse his father's reputation and give him lasting fame.Together with Chuta they begin to unite the other warring school factions in an effort to strike at Serizawa's class. Genji's allies include the dimwitted yet fiercely loyal Makise Takashi Takahashi Tsutomu and the brutal and calculating Izaki Jun Takaoka Sousuke.Genji's ambitions bring him into conflict not only with former schoolmate Tatsukawa Tokio Kiritani Kenta who has become Serizawa's right hand man but also endangers the life of beautiful hiphop singer Aizawa Ruka Kuroki Meisa a childhood friend who is in love with the bad boy.While Fudo Shugo's lively and energized script clearly draws inspiration from Takahashi's manga it seems to also draw heavily from other similar high school delinquent mangaturnedfilms like BeBop High School Rokudenashi Blues and Sakigake! Otokojuku. There also seems to be elements reminiscent of Walter Hill's rocknroll fairy tale Streets of Fire 1984 particularly with regards to the romance between Genji's character and Aizawa.Miike's direction is wickedly entertaining in its outrageousness and eyecatching style. Miike never fails to make visually interesting films and Crows Zero is no exception. Make no mistake Crows Zero is a guy's film and it is filled with testosterone pumped action and showy machismo almost to a comical level. Yet Miike surprisingly also inserts some genuinely nice and moving moments particularly involving the complicated relationships between the various characters.Miike's young cast is superb and does an awesome job as bringing Takahashi's exaggerated characters to life.Oguri Jun GTO TV Series Azumi RoboCon is mesmerizing in his role as Genji. His action scenes are terrific and he brings a devilish charm to his character. Yamada Takeyuki Dragonhead Maiko Haaan is also very charming in his role as Serizawa. He is not your typical villainous thug and in fact is quite likable despite his character's actions very similar to Russell Crowe's Ben Wade character in 310 To Yuma. The stunning Okinawan beauty Kuroki Meisa Camus Nante Shiranai Vexille does terrific work in her small part and also gets to showoff her talents as a singer. Yabe Kyosuke Sukiyaki Western Django Kids Return Dead or Alive is another standout as the bumbling Yakuza Katagiri. Yabe brings much heart and sympathy to his character and one can't help but feel for him as he tries to live his life's dream of conquering the Suzuran vicariously through Genji.The punk rock soundtrack is appropriately loud and infectious as is Kuroki's RB HipHop numbers. Crows Zero is not for everyone and its overthetop story won't win any awards but for your average male moviegoing demographic it is an absolute winner which is sure to please.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of my favorite Japanese movie series of the 80s was Nasu Hiroyuki's absurdly violent BeBop High School which was based on Kiyuchi Kazuhiro's popular manga series which ran in Weekly Young Jump from 1983. It was outrageously violent and portrayed high school life as a battlefield where personal combat was a means to prove a teen's worth and masculinity. Enter Miike Takashi's recent Crows Zero which almost plays like an updated version of BeBop High School albeit with his own unique flourishes and stylistic nuances. Based on Takahashi Hiroshi's gritty comic series Crows which runs in the Monthly Shonen Champion magazine the movie follows the exploits of Takiya Genji the son of a high ranking Yakuza ganglord who has transferred into the notorious high school Suzuran.Suzuran's student body has the unique distinction of being the most violent lawless and brutal.

	schema:reviewBody "This is fully based on style. It's an exploration of what it means in a certain moment in time in a certain culture arguably global... to be cool.Everything here is designed to look cool. In fact whenever we hear about wanting to 'rule' the school what's in fact at stake is being the coolest there. The fighting is a fundamental issue of that coolness the best fighters gain admiration not for their physical skill but for the coolness with what they get out of the situations  even when Genji is defeated after fighting dozens at the same time he falls in a cool way. To underline this we come to understand that in fact the strongest guy in the school was in fact away from the main disputes all the way probably because he is not cool in the notion of the cool guys he is cool in his uncool way.This is a thin notion which probably will appeal to a teen mind with 24 i'm not quite sure yet if i've ever been a teen. This film gets away with that single thin notion because it is able to support it visually. The director knows a few things about framing and pace even though he doesn't take many risks or none at all in how he shoots the fights.In a way this is no different in root of series like Rambo the filmography of Chuck Norris or the urban hiphop acting pose. Different moments in time and different places on earth and an important element this film doesn't take itself seriously as the others do. This is all staged and that's clear to us and it's OK. The comedy bits exist to underline this. Also the parody of the Yakuza as inferior guys who get beaten up by the school kids.My opinion 35 httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	schema:headline " Just about every teenage boys dream";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a teenage boys fantasy where the school has no teachers but individual clubs or gangs. And the only goal is to become top by fighting their way up. This has been a popular concept for a while and there is quite a bit of comics and even movies that portray this. Movies like Volcano High Go and Blue Spring comes to mind. But this movie is strictly about fighting and building reputation and number of gang members. The story is like a war happening in school and the only education is to build a reputation and be notorious for being the best fighter in Suzuran High. While having a bit of rivalry going between to gangs. One is Serizawa's gang which starts off as a notorious gang in Suzuran High for being close to the top gang and the other is this new guy named Genji. And Genji's main goal is to best his own father who is a boss in the yakuza and to do that he must become the top fighter in Suzuran High. But instead of showing both sides of the story this movie focuses just about only on Genji and how he builds his reputation and gang members. And makes a group called GPS in order to take over the school. I guess there is more meat to the story when it comes to a character that starts from nothing than a character that already has a big reputation and a large number of gang members. But the thing is personally liked Serizawa more than Genji since he doesn't try to be overly cool all the time. A bit dorky and bright while being cool and having a code of honor. And would liked some of his backstory as well. But that isn't the case and it only focuses on Genji's gang. This has all the rival gang in high school elements in this movie and can sometimes come of just plain ridiculous and senseless even if this flick is based on a manga. In fact when it comes to the characters and such it sticks really close to the manga although this movie is a prequel. The fight scenes are nothing special everyone has only one style of fighting which is brawling and that is understandable but it doesn't have memorable fight scenes. Except maybe the final battle where Serizawa's gang and GPS gang face off with three different things going on. Overall if you like high school teenage rebels style of movie with a lot of fights than this one is a sure watch. Meisa Kuroki is also in this but doesn't add much to the story besides being the very few female in this flick and also adding to the teenage boys fantasy of winning the girl at the end.7.510".

The key to understanding this movie I believe is not the search for the reincarnation of an important Buddhist teacher nor is it the life of the Buddha up to the time he achieves enlightenment but the way a child or children and an old man come to understand together something of the connections that may exist between themselves. We don't see through a character's eyes we watch the effects of the characters on each other. In particular Jesse the 9 year old American who may or may not be the reincarnation holds our attention because we watch him absorb the lessons that are being taught and as he learns them he grows in ways we can expect a 9 year old to grow. We also watch his father whose character becomes more sympathetic as the movie progresses who has even further to grow than his son because he has already learned too much.The movie is also beautiful to watch. The cinematography the editing and the direction combine to provide just the right dramatic tension to a movie whose pacing is deceptive in that it seems slow but is not. The ultimate result is that a viewer who allows it will find him or herself transported for a little while to unexpected places.".

Both Chris Isaak  Keanu Reeves may seem like odd choices for their respective roles but somehow it really works well with both of them lending credibility if not excellence to their roles.As for the story it's very... charming for lack of a better word. Again mixing the two stories of a boy who might be the reincarnation of a Tibetan monk and the life story of SiddhartaBuddha might seem odd but somehow it does work and the two storylines complement each other nicely.By the way isn't it nice to have a movie with a great story or even two at that with absolutely no violence whatsoever in it?

Having seen it at least a couple of times and being the proud owner of a DVD I have to wonder why?Maybe the trick is to watch this movie with an open mind... Both Chris Isaak  Keanu Reeves may seem like odd choices for their respective roles but somehow it really works well with both of them lending credibility if not excellence to their roles.As for the story it's very... charming for lack of a better word. Again mixing the two stories of a boy who might be the reincarnation of a Tibetan monk and the life story of SiddhartaBuddha might seem odd but somehow it does work and the two storylines complement each other nicely.By the way isn't it nice to have a movie with a great story or even two at that with absolutely no violence whatsoever in it? Kind of refreshing.On another note pun fully intended note another magnificent musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto.";

It took a more mystic version than what many Western Buddhists prefer myself included but that was entirely appropriate for this kind of film.The life of the Buddha was about half or a little less of this movie. The othermain plot was fairly interesting and nicely put to screen as well. However that section in isolation wasn't quite as good in terms of entertainment plot or education.Reeves actually did a great job playing the young Buddha I should mention. This is hard to believe having seen him in Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure and The Matrix but he is a good actor when the stakes are high.In particular I thought the scene where SiddarthaBuddha K.Reeves faces Mara was an awesome moment in film history. I wish we could clarify the symbolism... make it clear what Buddhism at least of the Western and Zen varieties deems as fact what bits are symbolism for something internal and reject the mysticism which evolved after the initial fall of Buddhism...then make a new movie around that one scene. One telling the life of Buddha and how dharma  the psychological aspects of Buddhism describe and affect us all.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was actually not that bad in fact it had some good parts to it. One major problem though was Keanu Reeves. They are also other glaring and not so glaring problems with this movie.The acting was adequate throughout except for of course Keanu Reeves. He was not the only one I was not happy with though. Bridget Fonda did not exactly show off anything special either. She was just there nothing great nothing to horrible just there. Why does she continue to get roles? Is it her name? Her looks? Her acting ability? That is pretty easy its her name. The only thing does she does share with Henry Fonda Peter Fonda and Jane Fonda is their name definitely not her acting ability.Then of course there is Keanu Reeves. It is really hard to think of a worse casting move than the casting of Keanu Reeves as Buddha. For action roles or even comedy I do not mind him but for serious roles he is about as bad as you could get. His performance at the beginning I do not have a problem with because Buddha is not yet Buddha he is even less than a narrow minded person. At or towards the end though he is supposed to portray Buddha with depth and meaning not with superficiality and narrow mindedness. That though is exactly what he does though he stays an idiot from start to finish. As the movie progresses so does the character of Buddha but not the performance of Keanu. In here he appeared about as selfish and superficial as Buddha was selfless and deep.The directing should be great after all Bernardo Bertolucci is directing this. Well at times it was spectacular but it was not consistent. Some of the scenes especially toward the end were great the sceneries of the Buddhist temples and ceremonies and one particular conversation involving a monk were amazing. It was like watching the Last Emperor again. Then the scenes with Buddha were just horrible and annoying. That part of the story did not seem to get anywhere they just seemed to go on and on. That is what should have succeeded not failed especially Bertolucci being the director. That is where Bertolucci failed and failed miserably.The cinematography was amazing at times as mentioned before. Certain scenes were done very stylistically and well. It did provide some sort of educational importance which is the one thing I was really with this movie. The editing was also pretty bad it was one of the reasons why some of those scenes felt like forever to get by and why whenever the story was just becoming engaging it had to jump right back to the story of Buddha. The writing was pretty bad but not completely horrible.. The one scene with the monk was great in terms of writing but other than that nothing really memorable. The way the Buddha story was written really made me determine this was a bad script and brought down most of the movie.This movie should have and could have done better but it did not. Cinematographically wise and directing wise some scenes were down right spectacular and other with Keanu Reeves were just down right horrible. Yet the cinematography was just too amazing even in the story of Buddha that I have to say that this an above average movie. It is a good family movie and a little educational but if you want to watch this alone I would not really recommend it. Very easy on the eyes but just a little to easy on the mind.".

But I finally managed it. Rewatched it today. and trust me all the waiting and the search were more than rewarded...It's a Bertolucci movie. That alone should say all. It's a beautiful story told in an unique way. It made me ask myself a lot of questions. Gave me a few basic insights about Buddhism  and I feel so ignorant now must start reading upon this  very soon... In a simple and beautiful way reminded us that there are so many thoughts and things in life that we aren't aware of... Some posters compare this movie with The Matrix. not a fortunate comparison I'm afraid. Instead I would compare it to Linklater's Waking Life. And no it's not a 'Sunday School Buddhism. It's one of the most important stories of mankind. A story told in images. A story that matters. That could change our way of thinking relating to everything around us.It's one of the movies I would take with me on a desert island . PS.

The movie actually made me look for info about Tibet and the lamas and I had to realise how dark their fate became having the actual lamachild kidnapped from Tibet.We see this culture challenging an average western family which gives another great perspective to explain Tibetian culture to us and how important for these people their beliefs is.I think the cast was excellent I liked the Tibetians communicate with the unbeliever western people their infinite calm and understanding and the children are good and pretty annoying where they have to be.The end was a bit hollywoodish but it didn't wreck the movie since the story it tells have no end at all and without getting into politics probably this was the best the screenplay could have done.Some people may go and watch the film seeing star Keanu Reeves and end up being disappointed by not seeing a usual carcrashshootrunkilllove movie.

In Little Buddha Bertolucci attempted to tell the story of Siddhartha Buddha himself but somehow I felt it was a bit too little as this film also told a separate story about a reincarnated Lama.Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak star as the Conrad couple Lisa and Dean whose son Jesse is believed to be a reincarnation of a Lama from Bhutan. This led to a visit by the Lama's disciple Lama Norbu who introduces Buddhism to the Conrad family. However he's not sure if Jesse is the one but indications have made the case strong. The tale takes all of them back to Bhutan where they meet up with another 2 potential candidates and contemplate just who was the actual reincarnate.At the same time the story of the origins of Buddha is weaved into the narrative which was what appealed to me when watching this movie. I am not an expert in Bhuddist studies but I felt that the story was well told and the cinematography for this segment just wondrously majestic. I believe many at that time balked at Bertolucci when he casted Keanu Reeves in the role of Siddhartha as he was better known for his surfer dude image. But I thought Reeves did credibly well and suffered for his art in making a credible Prince though some would cringe at this attempt to speak with an accent.Buddhism doesn't get shoved down your throat so for those who are staunch in their respective religions no worries this movie doesn't attempt to be preachy. It makes interesting the journey to Nirvana and Enlightenment through the Middle Way and I would say it would make interesting general knowledge I am not vouching on the accuracy as I can't in which to build upon.Perhaps what I felt was a let down was the other major segment on the search for the Lama reincarnate as there were minor subplots which got introduced but not further developed. I would be more interested to learn about Siddhartha's path to Nirvana in more detail through film but probably that's another story for another filmmaker to make.".

When the cup is broken the tea remains tea for ever. And the same for the spirit. A spirit never die never!And remember this only dictatorships criminals and psychiatrists oppress the spiritual nature of man like China does.So a movie like Little Buddha is a masterpiece necessary in our troubled world.In the same way Matrix shows the power of the spirit and the will of the machines to prevent people to reach spiritual freedom. And remember what Morpheus says to Neo Free your mind!And the better way to trap a mind in our current society is in using drugs like heroin or psychiatric drugs. So we are trapped in the Matrix too!

Well  it's not great that was my previous review of what I thought of the movie way back in the day when I saw a few scenes on TV. However taken as a whole it's actually a much better film than I expected and is very good despite what Weinstein did to the cut which does appear from seeing the film to have been cut by a good few minutes  maybe for the better I don't know.All I know is Reeves who shouldn't have any place in this film gives an astonishingly moving and even at times soulful performance all things considered and Bertolucci and writer Rudy Wurlitzer of TwoLane Blacktop! are very thoughtful about the nature of Buddhism and what the Siddhartha means today. There's context for what this little boy happens upon earlier in the story and it all gets connected well any thoughts I had of perhaps in a silly way of mocking Reeves' performance went away as soon as I saw what the director and actor did with it.And of course Vittorio Storaro is the man this along with Bulworth is one of his late masterpieces as a cinematographer. Again not one of Bertolucci's top masterpieces or whatever and for kids this was meant technically as a children's film it can be a bit mawkish and eh.

It was a beautiful Indian myth talked about the 'reincarnation'. From the beginning of the movie there was a touching story about a little goat and a high priest which pointed out the main theme of that movie. In this short story the priest killed goats for sacrificing to the god. The goat died for 500 times and could be reborn as human being. And 500 lives ago that goat was also a priest who sacrificed goats to the god. Keanu Reeves starred as handsome Prince Siddhartha inside this Indian myth. Siddhartha was born with special gifts. He could walk and talk since he was born. Indian thought and believed Siddhartha was a miracle. After he grew up he did good things and nice to people even sacrificed for them like the mission of Jesus! Bridget Fonda Chris Isaak Alex Wiesendanger starred as the Conrad family who believed in reincarnation. They were interested in learning and pursuing for the truth of reincarnation with the Tibetan monks. The religion 'Buddhism' from it the Buddhists believe in reincarnation and teach people to do good things being a good human being. Reminding that there is no need to sacrifice your lives like Siddhartha it just tell people to be good in their behavior. I suddenly remembered a movie called Dead Again which starred by Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh. It also talked about reincarnation. It awoke people not to do bad things. I has almost missed this good and meaningful movie Little Buddha lucky I am finding the movies starring by Keanu Reeves recently. Thanks god!".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people believe this movie to be simplistic. Many people also believe that the two story lines are unrelated. Both couldn't be further from the truth.The story is about a young boy who is thought to be a reincarnation of an important teacher. Tibetan monks make a journey from their homeland to Seattle in order to make the determination if the child is in fact their teacher. The parallels between the boy's journey and the story of Buddha are amazing.Here's a few to check out...When Lama Norbu asks Jesse's father to come to Bhutan he reacts by getting very angry and controlling just as the Buddha's father reacts when told his son could be the greatest teacher in the world.When the Buddha decides to leave his village in order to understand suffering the entire world is dreaming. Everyone in his village is sleeping under some strange mist. When Jesse leaves Seattle everyone on the airplane is sleeping in very much the same way.When the Buddha learns about death he finds out that the person's ashes are given to the river in a bowl. The image is of a bowl that is washed away downstream. When Jesse's father finds out about his friend's death he pulls over and walks outside to see the cars on the highway the cars moving just as the bowl on the river.Those are just a few of the MANY parallels between the story of the Buddha and Jesse. It's interesting to watch for them because each one makes a great point. Also watch for the use of color in the shots to let you know where the wisdom will be coming from. Many shots are dark with the use of blue and red but when a character begins to let go of himherself you'll notice a much brighter light around the person's face or even a total clarity of the entire shot itself.There are many other things to watch for that could easily be missed too such as Jesse's father building these beautiful buildings but each one is always empty.On first glance this movie does seem simplistic because it is told in a way that a child can understand. Look a little deeper though and you'll see that it carries much more than meets the eye.".

OKthe direction by Redford is fantastic with the portrayal of the characters done and acted extremely well. Will Smith and Matt Damon play the roles brilliantly especially Smith. Perhaps Damon seems a little young to be a veteran at times though but all the sameflawless. Theron physically looks perfect for the role but like Damon not a woman assumedley in her midthirties. I only wish more money could have been spent on this film and it would have been made into the epic it deserves to be. Far more than a simple soft inspirational story.

Rannulph Junuh.. pronounced Arjuna.. meaning The warrior Arjuna... in the geeta...the Hindu mythology reads such Arjuna does not have the will to fight his own brothers in a dispute over a kingdom.. though he is a supreme archer.. he has lost the will to fight....Krishna... advises him over i think 14 days the logic of war and why he has to fight and make things right..the movie rannulph has lost his swing or the will to play golf... though being highly talented... bager vans aka god... teaches rannulph the meaning of golf and helps him find his calling and rest as they say is history...wow... never knew mr. redford was so influenced by Hinduism...good movie.. very well shot...and a southern movie to boot.. too good.hallelujah.";

	schema:headline " Will Smith and Matt Damon playing golf for two hours much better than it sounds";
	schema:reviewBody "The thing you have to bear in mind when watching The Legend of Bagger Vance is that sports movies by their very definition tend to match the atmosphere of the sport they depict. Football or Ice hockey movies for instance tend to be loud bombastic and flashy just like the games themselves. Basketball movies meanwhile often rely on the streethip hop connection and are just as loud but with a slightly more gritty edge to them provided you completely forget about the atrocious Space Jam. Bagger Vance on the other hand revolves entirely around golf and consequently is a lot quieter slower paced and gentle than its brash genre cousins but it nevertheless possesses a charm and subtlety that is quite endearing.Told completely in flashback the film's story involves Matt Damon's depressed World War One veteran Rannulph Junnuh taking part in a highly publicised golf tournament against two established real life professionals  Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones. At first things don't look good Junnuh hasn't played the game since getting back from the trenches and is a slovenly drunken washout and despite having the support of the townsfolk nobody really expects him to win. And then he gets a new caddy in the shape of Bagger Vance Will Smith.At this point I imagine alarm bells are ringing in your head. Will Smith must mean wisecracking oneliners and the word 'damn' being stretched out so that it consists of two syllables right? Well you'll be relieved to know that Bagger is a pleasant change of direction for the normal Smith stereotype. Relaxing on his heels and working his acting muscles instead of his action hero ones Smith is the undeniable soul of the movie. His eminently likable charm is still there but he relies more on home spun wisdom and gentle prodding to help Damon back into his game rather than calling him a honkey and effecting a cocky swagger. Playing off against him Matt Damon is suitably vulnerable and insecure but is overshadowed a bit and with the exception of Junnuh's two rivals the rest of the cast might as well be superfluous. Thankfully Junnuh's redemption and Vance's easy going friendship is enough to carry the film and the story while corny is just as charming as the title character.Elsewhere director Robert Redford once again shows off his knack for beautiful cinematography. As most of the film takes place on golf courses you're never too far away from some gorgeous scenery and the contrast between the vibrant green vegetation and stunning blue sky makes Bagger Vance a feast for the eyes. Given the film's somewhat slow pace it also makes this an ideal choice for a wet Sunday afternoon where you'd like to go for a walk and appreciate the countryside but are unable to thanks to the rain.That said Bagger Vance still has its faults. The writing is a bit hackneyed and anyone who doesn't like cheese would do well to stay away. Junnuh's love interest subplot with golf promoter Adele Invergordon Charlize Theron meanwhile feels tacked on and unnecessary as though somewhere along the production line someone decided that if Junnuh was to fully come to terms with himself he'd have to get it on with a sweet country belle. The positives outweigh the negatives though and if you're in the mood for a relaxing slow paced movie with a lot of subtleties that not everyone will appreciate you can't really go wrong with Bagger Vance. This is a film to watch with your feet up the house clean and a big mug of hot chocolate in your hand. And refreshingly enough for a sports movie it doesn't feature a scene where a big crowd begins cheering wildly while overthetop power ballads play in the background that alone should be enough to raise an eyebrow or two.".

	schema:headline " This movie is about Redemption";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie as much as I did this one. We all watch movies for a lot of reasons besides the obvious reason of entertainment. While THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE does it in a most charming and entertaining way it is all about Redemption. Each of us faces adversity in our daily life and how we face it marks the quality of the life that we live. Junuh has faced personal demons for more than ten years since he fought in WW I. The Loss of his swing is more than an athletic loss that he refers to. He has lost his faith in himself and his ability to face life after his return from the war.The role of Bagger Vance ably played by Will Smith was not as God like as the character described by Steven Pressfield in his book from which this film was adapted. In the movie Vance had the ability to help people think beyond the obvious and to reach back for something special. In Junuh he helps reinstill a personal belief and an appreciation of life. In the Pressfield book Vance WAS a God.All of the roles were well played and the young boy playing Lemmon in his youth stole the show. It was also good to see Jack Lemmon in his final movie role. I thought it was an interesting coincidence that Lemmon's final role was in a mystical movie just as Burt Lancaster's was in THE FIELD OF DREAMS. The score was also especially moving and the music fit the movie to a T. This is a different kind of movie but still qualifies as a feel good movie. We don't always have an opportunity to go back and take a second stab at life and that is the beauty of this movie.It is a wonderful thing to be able to go back and make amends for mistakes we have made in our lives and to come out on the other side as a better person. That is what Junuh was able to achieve and that made me feel very good when the credits rolled. For those of you who thought this was a golfing movie that is not the case. It is a movie about life and the chance to make a fresh start which is always important for those who struggle to overcome adversity.".

They both show the hero overcoming adversity through a sport's golden age which is what makes this movie great. If you showed a golf or baseball movie today it would not be as believable because they no longer play for the love of the game but for the money. This was set in a time when the game was more dignified.  I never though much of Will Smith thinking of him mostly as a comedy type actor but I think his greatness hit its peak when he started doing these drama type productions.  Smith is sensational in his roll.  If Redford had a mental picture of Bagger Vance before this movie started I think he actually saw how Will Smith performed in this film.  Matt Damon was good also. Overall a great feel good film.  910".

	schema:reviewBody "I usually like fantasy movies and I really enjoy sports films. Combine the two well  like Field Of Dreams and like this movie  and I am sure to rate this extremely high. I've seen it three times and enjoyed it immensely each time.It reminded me a bit too of The Natural but instead of baseball this one features golf and reallife legends Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen playing the local guy Rannulph Junuh Matt Damon. Like The Natural this is beautifully photographed has a wonderful feelgood ending a variety of characters a beautiful lead woman and good acting.The noname child actor in here J. Michael Moncrief who plays Hardy Greaves narrates the film as an older man looking back on this story. The kid is a fine actor too and I really enjoyed his Georgia accent. Charlize Theron is the beauty playing Adele Invergordon a woman who organizes this famous golf match between the greatest amateur player of the world the best professional and Junuh who is the focus of this story. Theron's known for her dramatic roles but she exhibits a nice comedy touch in here. Damon does his normal fine job of acting and Will Smith as the angelic caddie Bagger Vance is uncharacteristically lowkey which I found nice to see. Bruce Magill did a good as Hagen and Joel Gretsch likewise for Jones. Magill is obviously the best reallife golfer here among these actors. Damon had to learn the game from scratch and did a fine job with his swing.The only part of this film that went a little overboard  but it's the fantasy part of the story  was the New Agetype preaching by Bagger. However some of his speeches were simply golf visualization which has always been taught as a means to concentrate better on one's shotmaking. I didn't think hearing the Lord's name in vain a half dozen times was necessary in here either but what are you gonna do? Other than those things this is great film and I one I throughly appreciate every time I see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know there's basically only two ways you can watch movies. You either use them as food for the thinking mind or you simply sit back and see where it takes you as if it's the first thing you've ever seen.In the first way your mind generates expectations of what it will get to consume. Then it will be presented its food for consumption and it will start up its filters in order to judge whether the food is good or bad. And every time you think you can fit it with a negative label you will gladly make known that you made that recognition.In the other way you enter the movie fully and openly without expectations. And as the experience unfolds you feel into the characters and relate it to your own being.From the first perspective this movie is not very good. It's slow a bit airyfairy and the plot quite boring. Your mind will probably already know what's going to happen all the time and find plenty of negative labels it can paste onto the movie. On to the next one the next thing to consume it will tell you.From the other perspective this is one of the best movies if not the best ever created in the history of humanity if you ask me. It gradually unfolds into showing how R. Junuh Matt Damon becomes more present in where he is as he makes crucial steps in his mind and lets go of the baggage that remains inside of it. By following this process and relating to it ourselves this movie is a wonderful tool for becoming more present and being masterful in whatever we happen to be doing in our own lives.Bagger Vance Will Smith basically tells that the only thing that Junuh can do in order to win this game of golf is let go of his thoughts. The thoughts that tell him who he is or should be in relation to others what he feels about the present 'situation' or what he needs to do in order to succeed. He learns that he needs to simply drop that selfcenteredness essentially that whining child inside and let the moment that is already there take him over instead of his mind.By doing so ourselves during the movie we might become more present too as our thoughts fade to the background and as we become more aware of what's going on around us instead of being absorbed only in what's going on inside the screen behind the electronic window. We can get into that state where we feel our environment where we drop all mental baggage and where we can simply excel in what we do whatever it is that apparently wants to be done through us. We can remember how it was before all the mental conditioning started somewhere in our childhood and become present again. That's the real potential of this movie the experience it can drag you into. Which is much better than a temporary pleasure if you ask me.And is that not the only thing to do in this game we call life? Is that not the ultimate teaching that the Bhagavad Gita and ultimately the mystical branches of all religions point to? In this movie it's not Bagger Vance that awakens R. Junuh it simply all happens pretty much independently of anything in the true experiential recognition of itself. And that's really all we need to know and the limit of all that we can really get from any type of immersion in media content.".

Still I regard it as a pretty good film for a number of reasons.First it is very well made and artistically shot with some highly memorable scenes such as the one where Will Smith first appears out of the dark.Second it is very well directed by Robert Redford.Third and finally it has a smashing cast with Will Smith and Matt Damon carrying it beautifully. Surprisingly Charlize Theron who I don't tend to like very much in general is very good as Damon's love interest. Another surprising thing about this film is that the kid J. Michael Moncrief is fantastic in his part as young Hardy Greaves kid actors with the exceptions of Rupert Grint and Haley Joel Osment tend to have very poor acting skills. Yes Daniel Radcliffe I'm thinking of you. Also look out for Jack Lemmon's for some reason uncredited role as the old Hardy Greaves it was one of his final roles.The Legend of Bagger Vance is a good watch but it does get a bit monotonous after a while. Still if you love golf you're bound to enjoy it. I give a respectable 810.".

The casting of the supporting actors who play Jones  Hagen as well as the young Hardy is top notch.Cinematography etc. is also very well executed.I thought that Damon did a very credible job as Junuh although his character is a Redford clone right down to the haircut and whispery delivery of his lines and Will Smith was surprisingly quite good as Bagger Vance. I must admit when I read the novel I had a hard time imagining Smith playing this part but he carries it off with Morgan Freemanesque style.I completely disagree with every reviewer who enjoyed Charlize Theron's performance. Her character is little more than a footnote in the book and in this film they greatly expanded her role to have a romantic subplot that frankly has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and bogs down the story. Ms. Theron is very beautiful but her accent is TERRIBLE!!!! Watch her first few scenes with the town elders and tell me how you could ever believe that is a real Georgia accent.Similarly the young Hardy who has a much more credible Southern accent seems to lose it completely by the time he's grown up to become the narrator Jack Lemmon. Little continuity errors like that drag this film down.All in all Bagger Vance is not a bad film but it's not great either.Best suited for golfers and fans of the Great Gatsby.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Redford is a good actor but as a director I get the feeling he has never had a real human conversation in his life. Take The Legend Of Bagger Vance.It's about a Georgian named Rannulph Junuh Matt Damon who marches off to World War I one of America's greatest golfers but comes back without his swing. Coaching him back is his exlover Adele Charlize Theron a boy named Hardy J. Michael Moncrief who won't stop believing in him and the title figure a mysterious caddy Will Smith who tells Junuh that golf like life is a game that can't be won only played.As with other Redford films there is no real dialogue in Bagger Vance. There are a lot of speeches as various characters wait for their turn in closeup and for the music to swell before unloading some great profundity. Your Dad stared adversity in the eye and he beat it back with a broom This is my last 18 holes Junuh and I can't think of a better way to end it. I like the way we danced. It was only a moment ago. Those last two lines are each repeated in case you missed them.I get the feeling Redford treats his actors the way his directors treated him telling Damon and Theron Do that again only blonder this time. Beauty is everywhere in Bagger Vance and the camera and lighting work here are exceptional but there's never a feeling of real life creeping into the corners of the frame.What's good in this film is Moncrief the one real Southern accent in the cast who has fun and a disarmingly nonprecocious way about him. Joel Gretsch showcases a convincingly authentic swing as golf legend Bobby Jones one of Junuh's celebrated opponents in a big match at the end. Smith is enjoyable too making an otherwise annoyingly trickedup character amusing at times with his sly subtle delivery about the only subtle thing in Bagger Vance. It's a shame Redford couldn't have made Bagger's true otherworldly nature more of a mystery but then Redford isn't one to let a point go by without beating you over the head with it.Jack Lemmon narrates and appears in a cameo role as the adult Hardy. While obviously showing signs this would be his last film role he makes his bad club swings as fun here as he did on TV at Pebble Beach. Redford's focus on actors does pay off with this old pro and in some other cases. Everyone acquits themselves decently anyway with nice moments evenly distributed here and there among the chaff. The golf action when it happens is shot prettily as is the Depressionera costumes and set design.But everything moves so slow especially when the game is underway. You've got an answer for everything Bagger Junuh says and so he does. Or else Adele's got an answer. Or Junuh's got an answer for Hardy. These aren't people but fortune cookies with preformed messages when you crack them open.Meanwhile you wonder why no one zaps Junuh with a penalty stroke for all his oncourse ruminations. Never mind. It's not really golf they're playing. It sure looks pretty though and that's the point.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie I very much like and last evening as I was watching it for maybe the 4th time I tried to focus on why it wasn't more popular. I think what it comes down to is that there's an awfully lot of time in the movie spent on the course...so if you're not a golfer or not into golf that might bore you. And I tried to compare that in my mind with films about other sports and it seems to me there is much more time spent on the links here than might be spent on the diamond for most baseball films or on the field for most football films.Having said that there are few things I would complain about regarding this film...but then again I like gold. It does seem to me that some hint of Bagger in the climactic WWI scenes would have helped tie the film together. And visually realizing at the end of the film that Bagger has not aged even though it is 60 years later would have been helpful...again to tie the beginning and end of the film together.In terms of performances here I was impressed and here's why yes we can get a sense of whether someone is a truly good actor in an action pic but what can they do in a serious film? And with the exception of Six Degrees Of Separation in which he had a supporting role this was Will Smith's first serious film...and he comported himself very well. Matt Damon had less to prove here having been in a number of serious films but he also does very well here in a role where in various scenes he has to be very up or very down...and he balances it all pretty well. Similarly Charlize Theron continued her series of fine performances here...certainly one of our most stunningly beautiful actresses. Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen is wonderful and he is a supporting actor I have come to have a great deal of respect for. Joel Gretsch is equally good as Bobby Jones and I'm surprised we don't see him in more feature films although he is quite active in television. J. Michael Moncrief as the young Hardy Greaves...well I had mixed feelings here...a little uneven...but pretty good. And of course it was nice to see an ailing both in the film and in real life Jack Lemmon. Lane Smith a newspaper man was also a welcome addition to the film although his role was not overly substantial here.My guess is that if you really get the psyche of golf you'll love this movie. If you don't there may be parts that bore you but you can still enjoy some very fine performances. But make no mistake...this is a serious film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the best of the best. Many will disagree but for me its my favorite movie of all time behind the dark knight and the lord of the rings trilogy. This movie grasps the essence of film making as an art form. In other words great and beautiful cinematography. When people first judge this movie they will probably see it as just your normal sports movie and in this case its golf. I am a golfer but you can absolutely hate golf and still enjoy this movie. Being a golfer really only helps with the technicalities of the sport which the movie minimally shows. The movie is just one big metaphor for someone who is need of faith. In this movie that person is Junah played by Matt Damon whos performance is excellent Junah was one of the highest praised upcoming golfers in the 1920s but after serving in WWI and becoming a war hero he suffers from memories of battle and has lost his faith in just about anything from his old girlfriend Adele played by Charlize Theron another great performance his faith in talents and especially his faith in life which the movie centers on. Just when Junah's faith is nearly gone for good while horribly swing golf balls in his backyard Bagger Vance played by Will Smith greatest actor today and a legendary performance comes out of nowhere like an angelWINK WINK and immediately tries helping Junah. This movie is just one big metaphor of an angel who is disguised as a golf caddy and is uplifting the faith of a person in need. Golf is just the format or stage they use to translate this message in a different way. You know Bagger is an angel because he never receives nearly any of the rewards he should receive after all the help he has given Junah his spiritually perfect advice like an angels would be and at the end there is a clear give away when Hardythe little boy the narrator and the old man in the beginning and end of the film dies from a heart attack on the golf course and wakes up in heavenwhich is still the golf course he was playing on to see Bagger waving to him in his ageless form. This is also showing that the movie suggest heaven isn't this big epic white scenery of clouds but instead a place that you are the most happy. I'm not a very religious person but this movie is a religiousspirituallife experience that is great in all areas from storyline scriptacting directing and cinematography. You will be moved after watching this.So for the people who haven't seen it....watch it. For the people who have but didn't realize the real story behind it...watch it again and my mind blown....and for the people who have watched it and did get the memo....watch it again and still be blown away and entertained like I am every time.1010 obviously.".

	schema:headline " Can you say Will Smith for best supporting actor this year?";
	schema:reviewBody "There are really only two reasons why you go to a movie.  One is to be entertained and the other is to be informed.  Sometimes being entertained is all we ask as is the case of most summer movies.  Then at times we are lucky enough to be entertained and informed.  Films like Malcolm X American History X Saving Private Ryan are a few that come to mind.  Films like that dealt with important historical and social issues.  They opened my eyes to injustices of the past and the present and they did an excellent job of keeping me entertained in the process.  The Legend Of Bagger Vance on the other hand informed me in a different way.  It taught me a great deal about golf and some of it's history.  And it entertained me a great deal.  You see for me golf is now a great interest to me just as it is for a great many new fans.  Since Tiger Woods has transcended the sport and became iconoclastic my interest in golf has multiplied exponentially.  Toss in a good Canadian prodigy named Mike Weir and I am now hooked on the sport.  I was even fortunate enough to see Tiger and Mike play at Glen Abbey this year where Mike had a difficult weekend and all Tiger did was win the triple crown for only the second time in the history of golf.  It was quite an event.Golf is different than any sport and that is because it is a gentleman's game.  There is a level of integrity and honesty to it.  You are responsible for keeping your own score and you are expected to uphold the rules of the game even when no one is there to govern you.  Could you imagine in hockey if you hooked a man from behind and the ref didn't see it you then went up to him and said  look I just took down Joe and I deserve two minutes in the box for that?  Or if in football you told the ref that you didn't really make the catch that the ball touched the ground first?  It is unheard of.  But not in golf.  Not only is it your responsibility it is your oath to do so because if one wins the game of golf without integrity then one is not a real man.  I realize how surreal that sounds but it is so true.  Your victory would be tarnished and that would stay etched in your mind forever.  That is one of  but certainly not the only  the beauties of golf.  Such is one of the themes of this film.  Golf is the back drop and it deals with issues such as these but it is a film about much more.Critics have criticized the film for being too shallow and not containing enough substance but I vehemently disagree.  You have to look for what this is about at times but believe me it is there.  Will Smith plays Bagger Vance in by far his most in depth performance.  Smith is known more for his comedic roles and his propensity for box office success where as Matt Damon has had success box office wise as well but not nearly the kind that Will has.  Yet he is known more for his great layered performances in films like Good Will Hunting and The Talented Mr. Ripley.  However in Bagger Vance Smith steals every scene he is in with Damon.  This is a performance that is worthy of an Oscar nod as best supporting actor thus far.  He is that good.Bagger Vance is a character that comes into Rannulph Junnah's  Damon  life just as he's entered into a golf tournament against the two best golfers of their era Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones.  Junnah was once a revered golfer but then went to WWII and came back a scarred man.  He never regained his swing and now he flounders in a sea of confusion and drinks his life away. He is given this one chance at greatness again because of a young boy's belief in him.  The town is sponsoring a 10000 dollar golf tournament in the middle of the Great Depression but it will only back it if one of their home grown talents will compete.  Hardy Greaves is a young boy of maybe 12 and he remembers when Junnah was the best golfer the south had ever known.  He tells the mayor and all the other town folk that he can get Junnah to play.  He doesn't disappoint.  He convinces Junnah that he can get his swing back again with a little practise.  One night as Junnah is attempting in vain to regain his stroke Bagger Vance comes walking into his life out what seems to be nowhere.  Somehow a conversation is started and Bagger Vance ends up being Junnah's caddy for the big match.  Now where did this man come from? How did he get here and why is here?  These questions are never answered but most people that I know and have talked to about the film think he is a guardian angel of sorts.  Was he sent here just so Junnah could regain his stroke?  Perhaps.  Maybe God really does love golf that much.  But maybe he was sent here not only to help Junnah with his game but to help him with his life.  Golf is like the art of Zen to some people and in here it is spoken of in the same reverence.  If Junnah is to regain all that he once was he is going to have to get rid of all his inner demons.  And sometimes inner demons are a bitch to ostracize.Bagger Vance is very laconic in his approach to things.  He only says what needs to be said and the rest has to be learned.  In all of the teachings about golf that are preached about in this film the same can be said for life in general.  This film captured me and filled me with a sense of....life.  It did to me what American Beauty did in some ways.  It is one of the best films to come out this year and it is steeped with rich and wonderful performances.  This should go down in the annals of film as one of the best sports films ever made.  And of course Will Smith is wonderful.  I really think he will be looked upon differently in some circles after people see what he is capable of.But more importantly this film taught me something about sport golf in particular but sports in general.  Even though Tiger has changed golf and there is a bit of swagger to it now with 5 million dollar purses and such just take a minute sometime to take it all in.  Golf really is different than anything else.  In days when soccer fans are rabid enough to kill each other hockey has people like Marty McSorley and one of the Niedermeyer boys head hunting with their sticks football players celebrating voraciously and classlessly by slicing their throats with an imaginary knife basketball players trash talking each other to the point of verboseness and the list can go on and on.  Fans of these sports can become rabid with their cataclysmic fanaticism and yet you watch the gallery in golf and you get a perspective of what it is all about.  When a golfer is about to take a shot there is utter silence.  No one wants to disrespect any player whether his name is Tiger Woods or a guy that is just hoping to qualify for Qschool. You have fans that will not touch a golfer's ball when it goes out of bounds they all understand the integrity of the sport.  Then there are the players.  They play side by side and wish each other well.  They want to play the game to the best of their ability but not at the expense of someone's integrity.  Player's respect one another that can not be said in any other sport not on the same level as golf.  As Bagger Vance says in the film Golf is a game that can never be won only played.  Words to live by. 9 out of 10.  This is one of the films to see this year.  Look for it to get some well deserved notirity in March.".

Fans of these sports can become rabid with their cataclysmic fanaticism and yet you watch the gallery in golf and you get a perspective of what it is all about.  When a golfer is about to take a shot there is utter silence.  No one wants to disrespect any player whether his name is Tiger Woods or a guy that is just hoping to qualify for Qschool. You have fans that will not touch a golfer's ball when it goes out of bounds they all understand the integrity of the sport.  Then there are the players.  They play side by side and wish each other well.  They want to play the game to the best of their ability but not at the expense of someone's integrity.  Player's respect one another that can not be said in any other sport not on the same level as golf.  As Bagger Vance says in the film Golf is a game that can never be won only played.  Words to live by. 9 out of 10.  This is one of the films to see this year.  Look for it to get some well deserved notirity in March.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most common criticisms of Thirteen is that it is 'unrealistic'. However Thirteen never claims to portray all thirteen year olds hell it doesn't even claim to portray a significant number of them. This film is about the select few who choose to take a certain path in life. They have no true parental figures their lives are in shambles and they are making a quick and painful transition into supposed adulthood. Notice the other people in the school scenes they're normal they're just studying hanging out with their friends and going through the motions of school life. Those aren't the people that are being portrayed here.Nikki Reed an immense young talent plays Evie Zamora the hottest and arguably most popular girl in school. Evan Rachel Wood plays Tracy a girl who still keeps her stuffed animals and Barbie dolls on her bed and whose parents have divorced recently and whose mother works as a hairdresser out of her home to support the family. Tracy goes to junior high completely oblivious of any of the social pressure that's present and begins to idolize Evie obviously a terrible role model. In an outstanding early scene Tracy follows Evie into a shopping mall and is initially appalled at the idea of shoplifting but in a desperate attempt to fit in with the 'cool' crowd she steals a purse from a woman who sat next to her and finds Evie again at which point she is accepted. Sooner rather than later Tracy is drawn into a terrible depression which she deals with by using drugs cutting herself and being sexually promiscuous. She does all this completely uncertain of whether she wants to and mostly because she's following Evie's lead. To say that no 13 year olds have experiences similar to this is pure ignorance and if you're a parent who thinks this is unrealistic think again and think hard. In today's world narcotics are available as easily as candy bars and pop stars are more like porn stars putting pressure on today's teens to become promiscuous sooner in life.Wood is a terrific terrific actress who has made some questionable career choices before and since this but I hope to see her continue to star in films like The Upside of Anger and Down in the Valley. However in this particular film even her tremendously powerful performance pales in comparison with Holly Hunter's Oscarnominated supporting role as Tracy's mother and by Nikki Reed who in her first ever acting role is nothing short of stunning. This role is very very racy for any 15 year old to take on and Reed who also cowrote this film's terrific script with Catherine Hardwicke takes it on with maturity I've never seen before from an actress of her age. First time director Catherine Hardwicke does a great job here her work is inventive and adds real grit to this tale.The bottom line is Thirteen is a great realistic disturbing urban drama that you should watch with an open mind and with knowledge that it is based in fact. This is a challenging and brave film and everyone involved has gained immediate respect from me. One of the best of 2003.810".

Now for a more intellectual look toward the dystopic view of adolescence and the loss of innocence.Now that I've thoroughly confused old and young alike here's the meat and bones of why I think you should see this movie.  The movie captures the creation of the emotional rift between an adolescent girl and her mother. While the rift is eventually healed the impact on the viewer is anything but easily forgotten about.  The movie is shocking don't assume that it won't shock you these kids do more insert ANY shocking noun here i.e. sex drugs etc. in a day than an average college student at least a college student like me would SEE much less do in an enitire semester. Evan Rachel Wood who plays Tracy gives a dare I say it about someone so young? Oscarworthy performance in her portrayal of an emotionally troubled juvenile.  She captures the mood swings the dark brooding the joy of being that age perfectly.  If there was ever a reason for being scared of having a child much less a daughter having a daughter like Evan Rachel Wood's character would be it.Nikki Reed the cowriter of the script deserves notation for her breakout performance.  Her acting was very good considering that she has never had any experience in the field ever.  Rather than detract from her performance her inexperience in selling her character to the audience only added to the dark manipulative side of her character.  If she studies the art and craft of acting she will be a presence in Hollywood for years to come.Holly Hunter gives another stellar performance.  Her character's balance or lack thereof between the enforcer of parentalrules and her desire to be involved in her daughter's life perfectly captures the connundrum of every parent.  The climax of the film featuring Hunter and Wood reminds the viewer of the intensity that raw emotion can create when you put two amazing actresses together and set the pressurecooker on Nuclear Meltdown.Thirteen is a mustsee if you are entering middle school or if you have a daughter entering middle school.  Better yet go see it with your daughter you will both be talking about it for a long time.  I give it a wholehearted 10 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Occasionally goes to extremes but is very convincing with great characters in the hands of three actresses all giving great performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Tracy is a normal thirteenyearold girl dressed in bright pastels bedroom full of soft toys and with giggly thoughts of boys. Starting school in the new term she finds everyone in awe of Evie Zamora and her friends  all of who have suddenly turned into sexy young ladies over the summer. With her goofy kid look Evie blanks Tracy until she impresses her by stealing a purse to go shopping. As Evie gets in with Tracy's mum Mel she also takes Evie into her own world of rebellion involving stealing drink disobedience drugs and sex. Mel struggles to hold on to the small parts of her daughter that she still recognises.At many points in our lives we all change and perhaps the first time it happens is the hardest to deal with. The stage where everyone seems to go from just being kids to suddenly being a peer group is a major one and this film for all its extremes does justice to the difficulties for everyone of the period in a story that is well written cleverly directed and really well acted by the whole cast. The plot builds well on minor changes to Tracy and makes it totally clear where the pressure is coming from and how it affects her in this regard the script is spot on and is totally convincing. When it goes to extremes it does show signs of stretching and almost breaking but it never does  while it is extreme it is still convincing and only two or three moments seem like they are going too far. Certainly I can't imagine many parents will be able to watch it without worrying about how they and theirs will handle the change when it comes.While the writing is great there does come a point where it needs to end and while unconvincing the film does at least draw to an end on an ambiguous ending and only the final shot of a 'isn't life hard' scream from Tracy struck a duff note and was too clumsy. As cowriter Reed shows a real awareness of the world around her and she deserves the praise she got for that role but also her performance as Evie is praise worthy but perhaps not to the extent that Wood's is. Wood takes us from a child to womanhood and never hits a duff note in her portrayal of a girl just trying to fit in.She is excellent and her dynamic with Hunter is a perfect fit and also convincing in my mind she is better than Reed because Wood had a more complex character to develop  Wood had to change her character Reed played a character who was already there. Hunter deals with some minor clutter in her character but generally she is as good as her teenage cosstars. Minor support roles for people like Sisto Unger and Clarke all add to the film but really the film belongs to the lead trio. Director Hardwicke directs with style and with an eye for the clever shot  at times using fast camera motions while in one key scene just letting the camera frame the front room like it was a stage. She also uses a clever touch in tainting the film stock a washed out colour when Tracy's bubble finally bursts  we immediately go from bright colours to washed out blue and even with the conclusion we only return to dark browns and not the highs of the main story.Overall this is a very good film that is hard to watch if you have preteen kids. It has extremes in there and it won't apply to every teenager out there but to just call it unrealistic is to ignore the reality of peer pressure and the sexualisation of youth generally. The script is convincing frightening and moving and is greatly helped by three great performances from Reed Wood and Hunter.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tracy is a normal thirteenyearold girl dressed in bright pastels bedroom full of soft toys and with giggly thoughts of boys. Starting school in the new term she finds everyone in awe of Evie Zamora and her friends  all of who have suddenly turned into sexy young ladies over the summer. With her goofy kid look Evie blanks Tracy until she impresses her by stealing a purse to go shopping. As Evie gets in with Tracy's mum Mel she also takes Evie into her own world of rebellion involving stealing drink disobedience drugs and sex. Mel struggles to hold on to the small parts of her daughter that she still recognises.At many points in our lives we all change and perhaps the first time it happens is the hardest to deal with.

It is one of the first movies that I have seen where a cutter is not looked down on and where the ending does not leave the viewer with false hopes. It is an excellent movie that gives everyone a real insight into a teenage girls life. It shows very well how Tracy has a hard time coping with life drugs and things at home so she turns to drugs boys sex and cutting to comfort herself. This is sad to say but this is how many teens today are learning to deal with there pain by cutting themselves and loosing themselves in drugs. Very excellent movie that will open anyone eyes and leave u sitting in your seat wondering about yourself and your children if you have any.".

I know it's glamorized for Hollywood but it's as real as movies get okay. I honestly think that Thirteen is a very well filmed movie one thing I noticed was that the movie began in full color correct? but as her life got darker and darker so did the movie. By the end it was nearly in black and white but when Tracy woke up after her mom found out about her cutting it was back to color. The language used the actions of the people everything...just so realistic or as I said before as real as Hollywood would let it get. Basically I loved Thirteen and recommend it to any teenager who isn't impressionable enough to want to do drugs and have sex because Evie seems so cool. There's a post by a girl who tried that. What a mad mad world we live in. Thanks Bianca".

Before you start bashing me for the 'believable' comment  I'd like to address something.  Unlike many detractors of 'thirteen' I won't say the things portrayed in the movie dont happen.  They do.  However what I found INCREDIBLY unbelievable was how Tracy transformed into a bad ass selfish mean bitch instantly immediately after meeting Evie.  She didn't evolve into a badass selfish mean bitch.  She immediately became one in the scene right after meeting Evie.  One scene she was the sweet smart 'nerdy' girl the VERY NEXT SCENE she was the selfish angry bitch.  The transformation just wasn't shown.  Also I felt the bulk of the movie was trying to shock us by constantly oneupping the stakes and shocking us.  The two things that show the movie's true intentions of shocking us is 1the movie's opening scene which has absolutely NO reason to open the movie and 2 the provocative poster showing the girls' tongue rings. However I thought it was a promising performance by Evan Rachel Wood.  While it is impressive that she cowrote a screenplay at such a young age Nikki Reed's performance is nothing special.  On the other hand Holly Hunter gives perhaps her best performance ever as Tracey's mother.  And I thought the final few minutes were very true and heartfelt it almost made me think I liked the entire movie.   I know noone will agree with me because it seems like everyone either LOVES the movie or HATES it but I thought 'thirteen' was a fair movie with a few very good aspects.".

Rather than being an insider view telling a story that needs to be told to the world it feels like an outsider trying to imagine the most horrible things they could and then directing in the similar fashion of 'imagining' what it's like and that is impossible to do well. Sorry if that was confusing.The directing is too clich and at times all too 'obvious' I know that sounds ridiculous let me explain. I was expecting a gritty realism to the direction and instead I got a slow motion montage of 3 gothpunk chicks walking very stylishly down a corridor in time to a very average punk rebellion song to emphasise their new rebellion awesomeness. Then when Tracy commits self harm in the bathroom there is no sense of desperation or attempt at really understanding. You're just told 'LOOK AT THIS GIRL SELFHARMING'.I could go on so I'll end now.

Despite this there's nothing much there. Personally I experienced my first roaring hangover at age 13 and learned quickly the wonders of moderation. Some kids just have a natural inclination to give in to peer pressure and don't exactly learn the first second or third time around.

Holly Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood have great chemistry in this picture and their performances are topnotch Holly should've won the Oscar. For a firsttime actress Nikki Reed's performance is also amazing. This film is probably the most real look at adolescence because it shows what teens go through and how far we teens are willing to go to fit in.

	schema:reviewBody "What do you get when you throw a 13yearold girl and a fifty something old lady in a room together and tell them to churn out a script? Apparently it's Thirteen which is in my opinion one of the biggest cinematic abominations of all time.This garbage heap of silver screen melodrama tells the story of a 13 year old girl named Tracy who over the course of what seems like a week is turned into a drugusing selfmutilating hussy when she befriends a popular girl named Evie is it just me or is there too much business over who's popular and who's not in films about adolescence?. Throughout the course of all this she begins turning on her mother and her family who seem kind of unshaken by most of it until the last 15 minutes of the film.Perhaps my hatred for this film comes mainly from the way the girls at my school talk about and how it was Just like real life. Keep in mind that these girls are rich white suburbanites not povertystricken kids in the ghetto like the ones in the movie. But putting that aside I'd say that the film's biggest problem is it's script in that it is entirely unrealistic and melodramatic. I watched this movie with people who said they loved it and at times even they laughed at some of the dialog. Apparently for the girls at my school Guys I totally just stole all this! I don't think I've ever seen this much money in my life! Let's go shopping! Hell yeah! is realistic dialog. The next major problem is the acting. Evan Rachel Wood's Tracy is entirely irritating and ridiculous and while watching this film I found myself not feeling sympathetic but annoyed. I grit my teeth every time she speaks.Most of the praise for this film moves towards Holly Hunter's performance as Tracy's clueless mother. I know a lot of moms in real life who are like her in that they try to be hip and let their daughters do whatever they want but I can't see playing that role as much of a challenge. Tell me when was the last time someone won an Oscar for acting stupid and clueless? Lastly we move on to Catherine Hardwicke's pretentious style. The look of this film is mainly grainy steady cam shots that inter cut with one another. Granted there are some sequences that look and sound pretty alright but for regular scenes it's just annoying. This should be studied by filmmakers who want to make up for their abysmal storyline and acting with fake arthouse cinematography that will land them a spot at that superindie underground film festival Sundance. You know the one with it's own cable channel.I'd say avoid this one at all costs and if you hear someone say something nice about it don't take their phone calls.".

She gets one friend who's a really nasty bad influence and slowly she turns into a slutty mean b!tch. sorry for my language She simply loses interest in her good friends and joins the cool kids. You slowly watch her do drugs Sex stealing all the things that could go wrong with a teen.The movie IS NOT FOR TEENAGERS! This is not a teen flick in anyway. Its a very well done DEEP movie. The events aren't Corny and blatant. Most of the acting is very realistic and well done.To start with it made me angry how bad she was. Stealing is wrong But especially the way she treated her parents Telling her carm mother to fck off. But slowly i began to feel emotion for her. We are keeped very hidden from her real emotions because thats what b!tchy teenage girls do. All teenagers for that matter. They keep there 'I don't give a sh!t' attitude.This is the only real movie i have ever liked that contains teenagers. The last thing i thought i would like is a movie about mean Sluty teenagers. But the movie is just so realistically done.Its not trying to say Oh my god poor girl is doing drugs' 'Wow look at what she has to go through' It is what it is. And its a great movie. The acting at times never gets hugely deep But most teenagers like her act very simple. It may confuse some people. Its not a diehard movie Or 007.But its a really really good movie witch shows how bad a teenager can go. Swearing at parentsDrugs Acting like prostitutes drinking Smokeing A lot of us teenagers like to act like we are way older than we really are. I see so many girls my age and way younger smoking Drinking Getting it to lezzy sex acting like a b!tch. The more good looking you are the more likely you will be like that And i think this movie shows it in the most artistic and realistic way possible.Please watch this movie Its really good. Don't mind the bad reviews they just don't get it. No matter how good of a movie there will always be one or more reviews named Probley the worst movie ever made.I have seen a few comments saying. 'Should i let my daughter watch this movie??' Thats a hard one. First off its a VERY VERY mature movie. I would be careful because in this day and age its cool to be a bich. Another thing the movie covers is girls cutting them self. A lot OF TEENAGE GIRLS DO THIS. I would be careful that your girl doesn't decide 'Im such an hurt individual i need to cut my self' 'Or they can see cutting them self as cool Please hire this movie out. Judge for yourself. It may not be your cup of tea But no one can watch it and state its a bad movie. You just cant.Great heavy Deep movie 1010".

I know I had my Evie back in the '60s and nowadays it is just a bit more dangerous. Tracy's innocence is portrayed so well as she keeps looking at Evie for hints of how to behave.  She sneaks peeks at her in the sex scenes and will go to all lengths to be cool. A proper home life is not a guarantee to good behavior.  Some teenagers behave exactly as Tracy and Evie and some do not.  For most they act out but not as extreme.

As THIRTEEN the new film which in the words of my thirteen yearold little nephew we're all supposed to go oooh oooh about wishes to stress that all dysfunctional families ARE the same.

Both the leads are good but the material requires a lot more setting up which means you can often see the gag about a mile away and it takes away form it a little.  The support cast are all pretty ordinary but perform their tasks adequately as really we are watching the lead two. Kennedy's contribution is easily the best as he does battle with a foot bandage and an angry dog.Overall this is an enjoyable short despite the fact that the humour is very staged and doesn't flow as easily as much of their stuff.  The punchline is good but some of the material just seems to be lacking that spark.  That said it is still worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "An excellent short featuring Laurel and Hardy during their first year of doing 'talkies'Stan Ollie their wives Kays Deslys and Isabella Keith and their Uncle Edgar Edgar Kennedy are off for a family picnic. Uncle Edgar has terrible gout in his foot which isn't what you want with Stan and Ollie around. In the house Stan and Ollie drop all the sandwiches on the floor. Yet they all get in the car and get ready to set off. But then there is a puncture followed by a fracas with a neighbour. Will they ever get away...This is a great film I think with so many good routines. Uncle Edgar's gout created the best comedy in it for me.

Then there are several more incidents in the car the funniest being when the car runs over Edgar's foot.

	onyx:emotionText "An excellent short featuring Laurel and Hardy during their first year of doing 'talkies'Stan Ollie their wives Kays Deslys and Isabella Keith and their Uncle Edgar Edgar Kennedy are off for a family picnic. Uncle Edgar has terrible gout in his foot which isn't what you want with Stan and Ollie around. In the house Stan and Ollie drop all the sandwiches on the floor. Yet they all get in the car and get ready to set off. But then there is a puncture followed by a fracas with a neighbour. Will they ever get away...This is a great film I think with so many good routines. Uncle Edgar's gout created the best comedy in it for me.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of several LH comedies I'm familiar with where the film ends with the boys and sometimes others in a car that sinks into a large waterfilled hole in the road usually where road work is being done. I would say this is an average LH talkie comedy short. Edgar Kennedy also has a fairly important role as Uncle Edgar who lives with the Hardys and is suffering form a severe case of gout and has his foot well bandaged to minimize contact with other objects. Despite this protection innumerable times during the film  he howls with pain from a physical assault. Even the dog at one point takes pleasure in using the bandage as a plaything pulling at it........Kay Desly plays Mrs. Hardy while Isabella Keth plays Mrs. Laurel. While they are included in many takes they really have little to do as the men monopolize the action and dialogue.........The film begins in the dining room. The boys have made a pile of sandwiches and Ollie is bringing them into the dining room on a tray. Unfortunately the swinging door between the rooms hits Stan from behind shoving him into Ollie who drops the tray. A fight breaks out between the two throwing sandwiches pushing  etc.. The girls tell the boys to make up. On the surface they appear to acquiesce but they're soon at each other's throats again. The changing expressions in Ollie's face are priceless.......But their major difficulty in getting to a country picnic spot is the car. Optimistically they wave goodbye to the neighbors about 100X which gets wearing. But the car immediately runs over a nail and the back tire goes flat. As you can imagine the boys have a heck of a time changing the tire. Several times a cloud of smoke emanates from just in front of the driver usually accompanied by a bang. Ollie tells Stan to throw out the clutch. Of course he undoes the clutch and throws it on the road. When Stan forgets to let the carjack down Ollie takes it and throws it far going through a neighbor's window. The neighbor takes it and throws it through the windshield. Ollie throws it through another house window of the neighbor. The neighbor thows it through a window in Hardy's house. They stop when a minister walks by. The boys try to put their jackets back on but keep inadvertently putting one arm in the jacket of the other. I've seen them do this gag in another film and for example Harold Lloyd did it back in 1920 in High and Dizzy. ......I saw the colorized version at YouTube.".

They left behind a large body of work a vast majority of it being entertaining to classic comedy at their best they were hilarious and their best efforts were great examples of how to do comedy without being juvenile or distasteful.Although a vast majority of Laurel and Hardy's previous efforts ranged from above average to very good '45 Minutes from Hollywood' being the only misfire and mainly worth seeing as a curiosity piece and for historical interest and even that wasn't a complete mess. 'Perfect Day' is not one of the best and funniest Laurel and Hardy short films up to this point of their output but it is still great fun. Their filmography apart from a few bumps along the way was getting better and better and 'Perfect Day' exemplifies this.Not a lot to criticise here though the story is slight and takes time to get going.Once again 'Perfect Day' is nonstop funniness all the way when it gets going. There is insane craziness that doesn't get too silly a wackiness that never loses its energy the lack of vulgarity that is a large part of 'Perfect Day's ' memorability and the sly wit emerges here some of the material may not be new but how it's executed actually feels fresh and it doesn't get repetitive. Laurel and Hardy are on top form here both are well used both have material worthy of them and they're equal rather than one being funnier than the other before Laurel tended to be funnier and more interesting than Hardy who tended to be underused. Their chemistry feels like a partnership here too before 'Two Tars' you were yearning for more scenes with them together but in 'Perfect War' we are far from robbed of that. Their comic timing is impeccable.'Perfect Day' looks good visually is full of energy and the direction gets the best out of the stars is at ease with the material and doesn't let it get too busy or static. The supporting players are solid.Overall great fun. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "It was a perfect Sunday morning when the Laurels Hardys and grouchy Uncle Edgar decide to go on a picnic. What's the worst that could happen? If you have to ask that then clearly you don't know who you're dealing with. So it all began with the wives planning a lovely picnic even insisting that Uncle Edgar come along despite him having a terrible case of gout. Then the boys stroll merrily out of the kitchen boasting a big beautiful tray of sandwiches and fruits. Well when stooping to get a dropped sandwich the kitchen door swings and hits Stan making him headbutt Ollie in the groin and making him drop that lovely array of food all over the floor. The boys start pushing and shoving and throwing food at each other before the wives break it up and remind them that this is the Sabbath. A day of peace. So Stan and Ollie laugh and make up then help pick up the food only Stan accidentally slams Ollie in the head with the tray then the dog attacks Edgar's gouted foot and once again all the food ends up back on the floor along with the damaged thermos. So anyway now it's off to the picnic as everybody climbs into the iconic yet clunky Model T Ford...and before any auto enthusiasts come after me with pitchforks let me assure you that I agree the Model T was very revolutionary for its time and introduced many innovations in the automobile that improved operation and maneuverability and paved the way for the types of vehicles we have today. I get that however let's be honest the Model T could be very problematic when it wanted to be and this is one such incident. After getting in the car they all bid repeated farewells with the neighbors and suddenly acquire a flat tire. So they all get out Edgar has a few accidents with his foot and Stan accidentally puts the jack on the wrong side of the wheel making it impossible to remove the tire but when he manages to pull it out the car comes crashing down on Edgar's foot! Ouch. Gout or not that foot is now broken. Forget the picnic and get that man to a hospital. But don't worry in the world of Laurel and Hardy nobody is ever seriously hurt but I like how the wives treat Edgar like a crybaby which he has every right to be in this instance.Finally after changing the tire i.e. inadvertently putting the flat back on the car they're finally ready to resume their picnic but oops they forgot to remove the jack. Exasperated Ollie grabs the jack and throws it... right through nextdoor neighbor Baldwin Cooke's window. Baldwin retaliates by throwing it through the boys' windshield. Now anybody who has seen Big Business knows that Stan and Ollie's specialty is property damage so they chuck a brick through Baldwin's other window and he returns the favor now stuff is about to get real... but uh oh everybody needs to hide. Why? A passing parson. So after Stan and Ollie accidentally swap coats and get stuck in them they're ready to go again only this time the car won't start. Ollie gets out to crank it and narrowly avoids getting hit by another car when Stan pulls a lever and the Model T blasts him into the street. He even tries to help by literally throwing out the clutch. Ollie beans Stan in the head with it and orders keep your hands to yourSELF! So finally the car cranks to live... and the engine explodes. Stan grabs Baldwin's hose to put out the fire and drench Ollie in the process. Enraged Ollie strangles Stan who then strangles him back then he shoves Stan against the car which finally starts up so NOW our picnic can finally begin right? Unfortunately not as the moment they hit the road they underestimate the depth of a puddle in the road.Classic Laurel and Hardy showing that bickering with one another will not accomplish anything and when the odds are against youin this case their car constantly breaking downyou're pretty much going to be stuck in the same place all day unless you band together and work against the problem. A very valuable life lesson. Anyone who has ever had gout will certainly wince at the scene where Edgar has a car fall on his foot. Moments before that is a scene where everyone seems to gang up on Stan after accidentally sitting and bumping Edgar's foot a few too many times which is probably why he put the jack on the wrong side of the wheel. This film also has a nice callback to Big Business where the boys try to sell James Finlayson a Christmas tree. Man that was some epic property damage! You gotta see that one and you've got to see this one too. Hard to believe both films are almost 90 years old. How time flies. New Laurel and Hardy fans should definitely see Perfect Day diehard fans should see it again it's just a fine example of how a simple premise perfectly timed jokes and gags and a terrific team of performers can bring together a strong viable product. And to think they might have saved a lot of trouble by just having a picnic on the front lawn.".

But of course given the year when this was made it is still a bw film. Storywise I personally felt it just wasn't enough not even for such a brief work. The 2 protagonists' wives added almost nothing except random waving at the camera that got repetitive at some point and Edgar Kennedy had no material either after the 10minute mark. You could of course say this is realistic that he hasn't suffer even more from the lead duo's shenanigans but well.. I don't know. To me he felt a bit wasted. I mentioned the repetitive waving already and in general they tried to stretch some joke here for too long also everything involving the tire. Anyway on a final note the right path for Laurel to shine is in my opinion the clumsy clown like Lloyd maybe Keaton but scenes like the brick window smashing scene should certainly be written for Hardy. Overall this sadly is not the duo at their very best and it's really only worth seeing for the very biggest fans of the two. I give it a thumbs down.".

The film also benefits from appearance of the always reliable Edgar Kennedy a frequent and hilarious foil.

At the sidewalk Laurel throws a piece of metal at Hardy misses and it goes through a neighbor's window. The neighbor picks it up slowly walks to the car and throws it through the windshield. In the shots that follow the windshield has magically fixed itself. Laurel deliberately takes the brick Hardy hands him and throws it through the neighbor's window. The neighbor retaliates in kind. We've seen it before so we know what's coming and some of the humor is drained from it.What I found most enjoyable was Edgar Kennedy's foot. The unhappy Kennedy has gout and his foot is wrapped in so many bandages it resembles a soccer ball. Now gout is an extremely painful condition. The joints turn red and swell up. I couldn't count the number of ways that gouty foot is traumatized. In the first instance Laurel unthinkingly yanks a chair out from under the proppedup foot. The foot falls with a thump to the floor and is savagely attacked by the family dog. After that the foot is stepped on sat on has a door slammed on it and has the tireless metal rim of a Model T Ford run over it. Pretty inventive stuff.".

After this pickle and another goodbye to neighbours the jack was left on and Ollie chucks it away crashing through the neighbour's window and they have a little bit of a fight. So after this getting their coats back on in a muddle and yet another goodbye the car needs the starting handle winded and there is a quick blow then overheating which Stan sorts with a hose. So finally the car is ready to go and the film ends with the goodbyes to the neighbours and ignoring the road they drive into a closed part of the road and as result end up sinking into the large puddle possibly wet tarmac. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian.

It is a good thing that Exectutive Decision does not direct its attention towards Seagal. Instead it chooses to focus on suspense and thrills which is exactly what it offers. It is slow and ominous even claustrophobic at times. The plot stays consistent never getting too thick and it keeps you focused Which is good enough for me.It will be hard to watch Executive Decision today and not think about 911. Islamic terrorists from Algeria highjack a 747 flying from Athens to D.C. they have loaded a nuclear weapon on board and they are giving the US government until landing time to free one of the leading Islamic terrorist they have in custody or they blow Washington. A small team of soldiers are sent out in a small aircraft which will latch on to the jet and allow them to board in secret. With them is intelligence consultant David Grant who knows that there is a bomb on board and what it is capable of. confined to the labyrinth of tiny corridors and storage cabins our heroes have only a few hours to find the bomb defuse it and take out the terrorists without being seen.This is the directorial debut for Oscar nominated editor Stuart Baird and he does a sensational job of crafting tension. It is not until the climactic twenty minutes where Executive Decision lets out all its energy. Baird really takes his time and just occasionally it feels like the story could use a little tightening but not too much.The movie is not meant to be mind enriching but in a way it does make you realize how much we took freedom and safety for granted before 911 occurred. If that disturbs you than perhaps you should not see this movie. Anyone else who wants to be thrilled and on the edge of their seat should watch this one for sure".

But at the same time it downplays the oneman heroism that is often a big part of them looking at you McClaine!. The movie refers to this with the character played by Segal.The most important part of this movie is the team. Early on people tries to break with the team but mostly everyone is on the same page throughout the movie. At the end of the movie one character kindof goes against his team but the focus is also on trusting one's teammates something that the other guys does during this moment.If you want a quintessential 90s action flick this is a good pick!".

But at the same time it downplays the oneman heroism that is often a big part of them looking at you McClaine!. The movie refers to this with the character played by Segal.The most important part of this movie is the team. Early on people tries to break with the team but mostly everyone is on the same page throughout the movie. At the end of the movie one character kindof goes against his team but the focus is also on trusting one's teammates something that the other guys does during this moment.If you want a quintessential 90s action flick this is a good pick!";

Even Steven Seagal does a creditable job mainly because this isn't a Steven Seagal movie. His supporting role permits him to do what he does best which isn't acting. He doesn't have to pretend to be witty there's none of that awful smirking he does in a vain attempt to show emotion the camera doesn't caress his body and there's not one speech about how goldang good his character is. He even manages to enunciate his lines clearly!The plot might have seemed a little farfetched when the movie was released but not anymore.I'm not even much of an action film fan but this one is really a lot of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and seriously a heavy spoiler followsFirst Seagal dies some 30 minutes into the film. Of course I as a certified Seagalhater salute that fact and award a point to filmmakers. They couldn't escape catering to his ego though so his character was given an inappropriately high rank in his other films he also always has some fancy title exCIA exSeal whateversoundscool... oh vanity. But still... what a refreshment to see him off. Indeed I would never have seen this movie had it not been for a film critic who had given away the main spoiler. For me it wasn't a spoiler it was a glimmer of hope. The fact that in the same accident that killed off Lt. Colonel Austin Travis chorus Haaaalelujah Joe Morton's character is left crippled which in turn crippled Morton's notorious overacting tendencies is worth another full point.Second Seagal is actually very decent inside those 30 minutes. Luckily he was given mainly procedural dialog so his range of acting skills wasn't challenged. That way I was able to acknowledge that the man indeed has a screen presence somewhat akin to John Wayne. It would be actually nice to watch him if he was any good. Too bad that he probably felt discouraged for being killed after giving his only decent performance so after this movie it was business as usual for him.Third Killing off what the audience supposed would be the main character may have been an amusing gimmick may have been a nod to Hitchcock but was foremost a strategic element in building up a proper suspense. Now you knew you weren't in for a typical shootemup flick that would see Seagal slapping bad guys around and spewing unfunny one liners. You were instead wondering how the hell was Kurt Russel's character a snobby analyst despised by fellow rescuers gonna save the day and wouldn't he also buy the farm in the process.Perhaps another gimmick was casting of David Suchet. His fame mostly rises from portraying somewhat geeky and benign detective Poirot and it presented such an effective and eerie contrast to make him the chief villain. He proved extremely convincing as charming intelligent and brutally determined terrorist.Another thing convincing is the plot. It may have felt a bit outrageous and farfetched in 1996. but not unfeasible. It certainly doesn't feel that way now no need to say why.These elements along with good but not exceptional direction and presence of beautiful Halle Berry is enough to recommend Executive Decision. I wonder how it will fare some 50 years from now on its own merit free from the context of audience knowing the cast and having expectations based on the knowledge. Perhaps not that bad as it doesn't have that many flaws. Of all the Die Hard clones which this movie is this is one of those that captured the spirit of the original well in terms of putting an involuntary and unfit hero in this case a group of them to utilize what ever he's got and overcome the adversaries in a closed space.".

All the characters are cool and the only beef I really had with it was it was a tad overlong plus Kurt Russell is simply amazing in this!. It's pretty well made and written and the finale is especially tense plus it was surprisingly unpredictable throughout. I will admit I disappointed that Steven Seagal got killed off right away however I give him a lot of credit for taking this type of role and Robert Apisa played a very good villain here and was menacing plus it has quite a few shocking moments as well. All the characters are very likable and Halle Berry has a small but cool role here plus it has a decent amount of violence too. I was quite pleased with the ending and a lot of the tense scenes were when Oliver PlattCahill and Joe MortonCappy are trying to stop the bombs plus I would have loved seeing Russell and Seagal work as a team throughout the film. This is a great action film that's quite effective and rather tense with a pretty solid story and excellent performances I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Stuart Baird does a great! job here with very good camera work solid angles and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent!. Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable funny makes a very effective action hero brought life and humor to his potentially boring character and just did an amazing job overall! Russell rules!!!!. Steven Seagal is very effective in his role but we didn't get much time to know him because he gets killed off pretty quickly sadly however I give him credit for taking this type of role just wished he stayed alive Seagal Rules!!!!!!!. Halle Berry is very good in her role here she was charming and made her part look bigger then it actually was she's also gorgeous. John Leguizamo is pretty good here actually he convinced me and was likable enough I rather dug him. Oliver Platt is great in his role I'm not usually a big fan but he was great here. Joe Morton is great as the bomb specialist I really liked him. Robert Apisa is excellent as the main villain he was quite menacing you will really hate him. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Like my review of Air Force One the counterpart of this movie which came out the following year this movie takes on a whole new element in the post 911 world. When released a terrorist taking control of an airplane and using it against American Citezens as a bomb seemed the stuff Hollywood would make up and produce. After those shocking events however the movie takes on a quality of realism that it didn't before and unlike the aforementioned Air Force One is superior in many ways. First off the cast Kurt Russell Steven Seagal and the startobe Halle Berry star. Russell proves himself as a versatile Character Actor. Afterall his previous role was that of a Special Operations Soldier in the SciFi hit Stargate and in this movie he plays an intelligence analyst whom Special Operations Soldiers despise and pulls it off well. Seagal completely convinces you he is the Soldiers Soldier that he is supposed to be. And Halle Berry well she deserves that Oscar she later won and her abilities are showcased here. She was not the star then that she is today and this is perhaps one of her many breakout appearances. Second all branches of the Armed Forces save the Marine Corps have a chance to shine in this movie. It shows a true devotion among the men who serve the United States. The Special Ops guys are Army the delivery pilot is Air Force and the Tomcat Pilots are Naval Aviators along the lines of Maverick from Top Gun. In conclusion this is a good movie that is underrated and in the wake of 911 seems that much more real.".

Seagal completely convinces you he is the Soldiers Soldier that he is supposed to be. And Halle Berry well she deserves that Oscar she later won and her abilities are showcased here. She was not the star then that she is today and this is perhaps one of her many breakout appearances. Second all branches of the Armed Forces save the Marine Corps have a chance to shine in this movie. It shows a true devotion among the men who serve the United States. The Special Ops guys are Army the delivery pilot is Air Force and the Tomcat Pilots are Naval Aviators along the lines of Maverick from Top Gun. In conclusion this is a good movie that is underrated and in the wake of 911 seems that much more real.";

	schema:reviewBody "Most of this movie is simply one extremely long suspense scene as a team of Americans try to board a passenger jet disarm a bomb and capture terrorists. After a 1015 minute opening to set the story up the rest of it two hours is the constant suspense of whether the mission will succeed and what happens along the way. With that much tension for so the movie would have been more effective had it been cut 1520 minutes.However it was never boring. It was farfetched however but many action movies are just that and this story wasn't stupid by any means. I expected such with Kurt Russell and Steven Segal in it but those two were much more subdued than usual.Oliver Platt Halle Barry John Leguizamo and Joe Morton rounded out a very diverse and solid cast. This is one of those films that really grabs you the first time you see it but after that loses its appeal since the suspense is over. Definitely recommended for those who like to sit on the edge of their seat and be entertained.".

	schema:headline " Underrated Action Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Executive Decision is an underrated action thriller that should have done a lot better at the box office. The movie itself is very neat with several twists to keep everyone in suspense and the movie interesting.The movie begins with a US Army Commando Team led by Lieutenant Colonel Austin Travis Steven Seagal who raid a safe house in Italy where it is believed members of the Chechen mafia are in possession of a stolen nerve agent DZ5 which turns out to be unsuccessful. Dr David Grant Kurt Russell is later informed that a passenger flight from Athens to Washington D.C. has been hijacked by Nagi Hassan David Sutchet and several other terrorists. The hijacking is in response to the capture of the world's most feared terrorist El Sayed Jaffa and Nagi Hassan want Jaffa to be released. It is also believed that the hijacked plane is carrying the stolen DZ5 with the intention of detonating the bomb over U.S. airspace wiping out the entire Eastern seaboard. A plan is made for a midair transfer of the commando team onto the hijacked airliner using an experimental F117 stealth aircraft. Lt. Col. Travis's commando team includes Rat John Leguizamo Cappy Joe Morton Baker Whip Hubley and Louie B.D. Wong. Also attached include aerospace engineer Dennis Cahill Oliver Platt who is responsible for the plan and Lt. Col. Travis insists David Grant comes along.The midair transfer is almost successful however the mission runs into a few problems. Cappy is seriously injured and rendered paralyzed leaving him unable to disarm the bomb. Lt. Col Travis sacrifices himself as he closes the 747's plane hatch and the boarding sleeve tears and sucks him out to his death. In a movie first and a shock to Steven Seagal fans worldwide the invincible Steven Seagal has died in an action movie not even making it half way through the film. Also other equipment vital to the mission including communications were lost in transit. Now it is up to the remaining members of the commando team David Grant and Dennis Cahill to disarm the bomb neutralise the terrorists and save the passengers on board the plane as well as millions of innocent lives below. Also assisting the team as the eyes and ears on the plane is flight attendant Jean Halle Berry.Kurt Russell was excellent as intelligence officer David Grant who is thrust into the middle of the action. Kurt Russell is normally well known as the action hero in such movies as Escape from New York 1981 Tango and Cash 1989 and Stargate 1994. Here he is seen as more brains than brawn much similar to a Jack Ryan movie. Steven Seagal was surprisingly good in a supporting role as the leader of a commando team. You'd be forgiven for thinking that Steven Seagal was the main actor of the movie but his death surprised a lot of audiences. David Sutchet as the leader of the hijackers Nagi Hassan was good value. The supporting cast including John Leguizamo Joe Morton Oliver Platt Halle Berry and J.T. Walsh were also excellent.There is not a dull moment in Executive Decision and there are plenty of plot twists and a neat plot that keeps the movie interesting. Executive Decision was definitely underrated on release and it seems like it was dismissed an an implausible movie but in this day and age particularly after the events of September 11 2001 it seems like a potential scenario that could occur. That aside Executive Decision is still an enjoyable movie.810".

It makes for a perfect flipside companion piece to the littleseen Paul Greengrass film United 93. In the world of Exec Dec the heroes save the day and America wins. In United 93 and the real world life isn't that simple. But since this was made 5 years prior to 911 it should be judged purely as entertainment and not as any political statement.Kurt Russell plays David Grant a United States Naval Academy graduate who works as a counterterrorist expert for Army Intelligence who is called into the Pentagon when a group of Muslim extremists taken over a flight from Athens to Washington DC. After blowing up the restaurant of the London Marriott they demand that their recently captured terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa think O.B.L. be released and that they be given millions of dollars in gold bullion. Grant suspects that this is merely a ploy to get into US airspace to set off a massive bomb rigged with huge supply of DZ5 poison gas.Their only apparent option is to blow the plane up over the ocean killing everyone onboard and sending any evidence that they might have straight to the bottom of the Atlantic. But Colonel Travis that's Steven Seagal folks! suggests hooking up the 747 with a modified F117x Remora stealth bomber while it's still in the air so he and his commandos can kick some terrorist ass. Dragged along for the ride Grant and computer nerd Dennis Cahill Oliver Platt are to supervise the linkup and identify Cell Leader Nagi Hassan David Suchet from the Remora. But the linkup falters and only 4 commandos plus Grant and Cahill make it onboard. Travis is killed and the Remora is destroyed along with most of their equipment.With only a few hours before the plane reaches US airspace and the bareminimum of equipment the group have to sneak around in the crawlspaces of airplane attics cargo bays and elevator shafts searching for the bomb and spying on the terrorists.It's highly intense superbly photographed and expertly edited entertainment. What first attracted me to Exec Dec was obviously the casting of Russell and Seagal but linkup with the Remora and the 747 is definitely one of the most unique action scenes in the past two decades and was the major selling point of the film for me.I do realize that Seagal has many critics and most of them judge him far far to harshly and play up his character's death in this film claiming that the only good thing about Exec Dec is 'the death of Seagal 10 minutes into an extended cameo'. Which is a totally foolish and untrue thing to say. Seagal is in the movie for a full 45 minutes before he dies. Which was done to shock the audience into believing that if Seagal dies then any of the cast could be next. And even if you're a Seagal hater understandable considering his recent poor output don't let that overshadow the rest of the film which is in it's final halfhour so exciting that you'll be so on the edge of your seat that you won't actually be sitting on it.It does lose some of it's power when compared to the horrorshow that is United 93 but like I said they are either side of the same coin. In the world of Executive Decision the terrorist attacks of 911 would never have happened. And if 911 was an always inevitable event then I guess the film IS farfetched. But it was made pre911 for entertainment nothing else so I guess I can forgive it for being so.".

	schema:reviewBody "EXECUTIVE DECISIONAspect ratio 2.391 PanavisionSound formats Dolby Digital  DTS  SDDSNormally the name Steven Seagal would be enough to send any selfrespecting movie fan screaming from theaters in a state of advanced colonic distress but he makes only a brief appearance in this barnstorming blockbuster as the leader of a crack commando unit who is unceremoniously dumped literally from a great height during a botched rescue mission leaving terrorist expert Kurt Russell to save the day for Humanity and the American Way. David Suchet Hercule Poirot himself! is the villain this time out a fanatical Arab assassin who hijacks a passenger plane and threatens all manner of unpleasantness if the US doesn't release a fellow terrorist from custody. Russell manages to sneak on board the plane with Seagal's commando unit now led by John Leguizamo but they find themselves sharing space with a deadly nerve bomb which Suchet intends to detonate over Washington DC come what may...Former editor Stuart Baird THE OMEN SUPERMAN makes his directorial debut with this gung ho potboiler which looks decidedly hammy post911 and which could never be accused of enriching our understanding of the Human Condition. But the melodramatic script by Jim and John Thomas twists the screws for its papiermch characters before reaching a frenzied boiling point during the climactic confrontation between slimy foreign upstarts mown down like skittles without a second thought and AllAmerican good guys invincible in triumph martyred in defeat. Baird directs with surefooted economy the film doesn't feel padded at all despite the 132 minute running time and while some of the early scenes threaten to submerge viewers beneath a wave of unbridled testosterone matters improve when Russell takes centerstage playing the Everyman hero who proves every bit as resourceful as his militaristic companions. Halle Berry plays a terrified stewardess who helps save the day while the main cast is bolstered by dependable talent in secondary roles B.D. Wong Joe Morton George Coe Len Cariou etc.. Overblown stuff and morally dubious to boot but mindlessly entertaining nonetheless.".

	onyx:emotionText "EXECUTIVE DECISIONAspect ratio 2.391 PanavisionSound formats Dolby Digital  DTS  SDDSNormally the name Steven Seagal would be enough to send any selfrespecting movie fan screaming from theaters in a state of advanced colonic distress but he makes only a brief appearance in this barnstorming blockbuster as the leader of a crack commando unit who is unceremoniously dumped literally from a great height during a botched rescue mission leaving terrorist expert Kurt Russell to save the day for Humanity and the American Way. David Suchet Hercule Poirot himself! is the villain this time out a fanatical Arab assassin who hijacks a passenger plane and threatens all manner of unpleasantness if the US doesn't release a fellow terrorist from custody. Russell manages to sneak on board the plane with Seagal's commando unit now led by John Leguizamo but they find themselves sharing space with a deadly nerve bomb which Suchet intends to detonate over Washington DC come what may...Former editor Stuart Baird THE OMEN SUPERMAN makes his directorial debut with this gung ho potboiler which looks decidedly hammy post911 and which could never be accused of enriching our understanding of the Human Condition. But the melodramatic script by Jim and John Thomas twists the screws for its papiermch characters before reaching a frenzied boiling point during the climactic confrontation between slimy foreign upstarts mown down like skittles without a second thought and AllAmerican good guys invincible in triumph martyred in defeat. Baird directs with surefooted economy the film doesn't feel padded at all despite the 132 minute running time and while some of the early scenes threaten to submerge viewers beneath a wave of unbridled testosterone matters improve when Russell takes centerstage playing the Everyman hero who proves every bit as resourceful as his militaristic companions. Halle Berry plays a terrified stewardess who helps save the day while the main cast is bolstered by dependable talent in secondary roles B.D. Wong Joe Morton George Coe Len Cariou etc.. Overblown stuff and morally dubious to boot but mindlessly entertaining nonetheless.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw EXECUTIVE DECISION soon after its first release and remember being disappointed by the experience. I was a teenager back then and hoping for a ton of DIE HARDonaplane style action which I didn't get even worse the film was missold to me as a Steven Seagal movie and the poor guy gets bumped off half an hour in. I wasn't impressed and spent the rest of the film sulking.Watching it some twenty years later time has been kind to this film. It's actually better for NOT being another DIE HARD clone there's a ton of suspense inherent in the premise of the guys having to hide from the terrorists and stay hidden for much of the running time. Sure the bomb plot is done to death and Oliver Platt isn't a great actor but everything else works nicely particularly the direction which maximises every drop of tension from the narrative. Stuart Baird is best known for his work as an editor but also did U.S. MARSHALS which I loved as well.To say too much about this film's plot would be to spoil it but it works nicely. Kurt Russell isn't bad as the hero but is outshone by almost everyone else apart from the poor Halle Berry. David Suchet's villain is a scary one but I liked the characters of the special forces team best. Joe Morton does injured very well again after TERMINATOR 2 John Leguizamo supplies attitude and a good tough guy demeanour B.D. Wong has more screen time than JURASSIC PARK. Even J.T. Walsh is present in a minor role. The action when it hits is exciting stuff and the film is only occasionally cheesy which is a surprise  it was the 1990s after all.".

I hate that selfworshipping pile of martial arts tricks. Luckily Kurt Russel showed up a few seconds later so I decided to give it a chance.Lucky me after about 15 minutes Segal gets sucked into thin air and there was no miraculous survival trick. Needless to say I watched the rest of the film through rosecoloured glasses and with a big grin on my face. And was it any good? Well it was a bit standard fare and predictable but a decent thriller nevertheless. It amused me for an evening. 8 out of 10 extra points for Segal's early death ".

A team of American special forces commandos led by an intelligence analyst rushed to the scene while he's still in his tuxedo Russell board a plane in the most fascinating way after it has been hijacked by terrorists in order to take out the terrorists and defuse the dangerous gas planted on board.This is a movie jampacked to the gills with heartpounding suspense tension and excitement. One of the best things about Executive Decision is its offbeat casting in the commando department energetic quirky John Leguziamo Oliver Platt as a nervous wreck who is borderline nervous breakdown for most of the time and Joe Morton as a wounded bomb expert who manages to keep his sense of humor. On the villain side David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame proves again he is one of the best actors around  he's no fussy little Frenchman here but a steelyeyed violent and committed terrorist. Kurt Russell does a terrific job and boy is he great to look at. Halle Berry is a brave flight attendant  she has very few lines but does a lot of reacting. Marla Maples Trump looks very pretty.In some of the film's tensest moments there is some humor making for a very entertaining film beautifully directed by Stuart Baird. I really didn't mind Seagal either.This is a pre911 movie and one wonders even then how these terrorists could have gotten so many weapons on board not to mention that gas. Today of course watching the action on the plane it doesn't seem all that fictional. Next time I fly I won't silently curse when I have to take off my shoes. I just hope the security is actually better.".

The script by producers Jim  John Thomas is your typical Hollywood action fare the patriotic American military charge into some dire situation  save the day the hostages  America. Don't get me wrong because this is a perfectly decent  entertaining action film although I would lean towards describing it as more of a thriller as most of it's running time is devoted to the disarming of a bomb  the race against time before the terrorists get a chance to use it on America. It's just that it makes for strange viewing after world events the plot of middle Eastern terrorists who hijack a plane  intend to use it to create widespread destruction  death cuts a little close to the bone these days don't you think?

Executive Decision is pretty good for it's type actually you could do a lot worse.Making his directorial debut Baird does OK he keeps the oneliners  wisecracks down to a minimum although I did think it went on for about 15 minutes too long  I think a two hour duration would have been better.

The violence isn't overly excessive there's a fair amount of gun play  gory gunshot wounds but not much else. The action scenes are quite well done with the climatic landing of the 747 probably the best sequence although some of the model shots look a bit fake.With a supposed budget of about 55000000 Executive Decision had enough cash spent on it so it goes without saying this has the look  polish of a big budget Hollywood flick it's well made with a good star studded cast including Kurt Russell who I've always liked Steven Seagal who apparently at first refused to film his death scene because he thought his fans wouldn't like it I wish he was that considerate regarding some of his latest films!

	schema:reviewBody "Is it possible that one of the weakest entries in the PINK PANTHER series contains one of the funniest scenes ever committed to celluloid? And is it possible that it's a scene in which Peter Sellers does not appear? Believe it or not yes.As you may or may not know the premise of REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER is that Inspector Clouseau Sellers is believed to have been killed but has survived the attempt at his life. He is now investigating the case under the covers as he says.The movie has its share of great comedy moments but is much more uneven than any of the previous entries. Some of the jokes are falloffthechair funny such as Sellers donning a pirate disguise and getting his pegleg caught in a hole or his schtick as a phony mafia Godfather but others are shockingly flat. The movie has a rushed sloppy feeling to it as if neither director Blake Edwards nor Sellers's hearts were in it and they simply hurried to deliver another movie to satisfy the public's demand. There are many moments when Sellers appears to just be going through the motions. To be fair however his performance does shine occasionally.But the real star of this movie is Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Dreyfus. Lom's halfcrazed quirkiness and barely contained mania is sidesplittingly funny throughout. And Lom also delivers what is not only the movie's funniest scene but the funniest scene in all of the series.Lom is talked into giving a eulogy at Clouseau's funeral. He doesn't want to because he hated him so much but the speech was written by a highranking politician's wife and he finally succumbs. At the funeral Lom struggles to get through the speech but repeatedly breaks into laughter. The scene is painfully hilarious.Overall REVENGE is far from the best of the series. It's better than the ghoulish TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER and about on par with the postSellers CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER but it lacks the spunk of the earlier movies. Definitely recommended for fans others should check out RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER or THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN.".

	schema:headline " It's Clouseau Once Again...";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Sellers returns as Chief Inspector Clouseau in this fifth and final installment of the Pink Panther' series in Revenge Of The Pink Panther' directed by Blake Edwards.  This time around Clouseau becomes the target of a drug lord Douvier Robert Webber who finds it necessary to prove to colleagues that he is still strong.'  When the assassination attempt is summarily pronounced successful it affords Clouseau the edge of pursuing the criminals through the use of disguise and the deft application of stealth as only Clouseau could effect.  Meanwhile former Chief Inspector Dreyfus Herbert Lom is pronounced fit and returned to his position at the department.  And as would be expected it all adds up to a bad time for the criminals as well as the hapless Dreyfus. Edwards does a good job with this film though it's not on a par with the previous outing The Pink Panther Strikes Again' which was arguably the best and funniest of the series.  There are scenes involving behindcloseddoor meetings of the criminal element that seem to bog things down a bit but with Sellers on hand they seem almost insignificant for as soon as Clouseau arrives on the scene they're up and running once again. And Sellers has some classic moments in this one  Trying on new disguises at the establishment of Dr. Auguste Balls Graham Stark a veritable haberdashery for undercover surveillance posing as a rotund Godfather' and insinuating himself into the mob and a foray as a peglegged pirate with an inflatable parrot on his shoulder.  The story line in this one may be considered thin Edwards gives it just enough to serve as a setting in which to showcase the talents of his star but there's nothing wrong with that it's funny stuff and watching Sellers work is worth the price of a ticket alone.  One of the most memorable moments in the film however is courtesy of Herbert Lom as Dreyfus gives the eulogy for the late' Chief Inspector Clouseau and can barely contain his mirth with his tears of joy construed of course as grief.  And for the first time in the series Clouseau's faithful manservant Cato Burt Kwouk accompanies the Inspector during his investigation which adds to the merriment but is not necessarily a boon to getting the case as Clouseau would say solved.' The supporting cast includes Dyan Cannon Simone Legree Robert Loggia Marchione Tony Beckley Algo Andre Maranne Francois Charles Augins Vic and Douglas Wilmer Police Commissioner.  With  Revenge Of The Pink Panther' Edwards delivers an above average comedy that is good for a lot of laughs and he finishes it off with an extended slapstick finale that really gives some sock to the overall movie.  What will stay with you forever however is the image of Clouseau and recalling his antics will provide you with some chuckles for a long time afterwards.  In the end this film stands a tribute to the great Peter Sellers as proof positive that NOBODY does it better.  I rate this one 810.".

Chief Inspector Dreyfus Herbert Lom who tried to take over the world and was disintegrated in the previous film is now not only alive and well but is reinstated to a position of responsibility in the police force.But the Pink Panther series isn't about continuity anyway. It's about humor. And Sellers and crew serve it up in generous quantities. While some routines are recycled from previous films there are a few new bits that make the movie worthwhile.There are two especially hilarious scenes. One is a trip through the insane asylum during which Clouseau has a runin with a jealous Hercule Poirot you'll see. It's subtle clever and very funny. The second is a sequence in which Clouseau finds out his manservant Kato Burt Kwouk believing Clouseau to be dead has turned the detective's apartment into an Oriental brothel.Then there's wacky disguises Clouseau's ridiculous accent crazier here than ever and the comic action scenes involving shootouts and car chases. Kato is given a bigger sidekick role than usual here and Sellers' final moment as Clouseau is perfect walking off into the moonlit night arminarm with a beautiful woman explaining what made him decide to become a policeman in the first place.

This slightly works against the comedy however and Blake Edwards falls foul of his one most consistent problem in paying more attention to the dramatic aspects instead of letting us indulge our funny bone. What makes the movie work is the cast. Peter Sellers is fantastic in his final appearnce as Clouseau. Finally he has given us the character he was striving to. It is apety this is his last Panther film although Romance of The Pink Panther was in the works and Trail of the Pink Panther was completed after his death. Burt Kwouk is given more to do this time around and it is a pety allso that he wasn't allowed this much time on other and subsequent films. He shows real talent as a light comedian and an able comic foil to Clouseau. Dyan Cannon and Robert Loggia are well cast and that final work off into the sunset by Clouseau is heart breaking.

The second half comes to an almost screeching halt while the final third wraps up in Hong Kong in a desperate attempt to liven things up.  Nothing works and if star Sellers hadn't died so soon afterwards this film series most certainly would have anyways.     One of the biggest problems here is that it's predecessor THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN was so good that this by comparison seems like a major letdown.  Lom as the villain in the predecessor was both lively and campy. Webber as the villain here seems very wimpy and boring.  Even a silly comedy needs a villain that is somewhat threatening.  There is also some glaring loopholes.  One involves the presence of Lom himself.  He supposedly got evaporated in the previous entry and yet here is looking perfectly healthy and no explanation.  He is also diagnosed as being 'cured' and able to return to his former job with no loss in status despite having tried to destroy half the planet.       The addition of Cannon is the only plus.  She is older than most of the past female leads and yet  is still gorgeous and distinctive.  She has a lot of energy and personality and doesn't seem used just to help the scenery.     The formula of having a blundering idiot that is considered brilliant by everyone who doesn't know him is still a good one despite the weak script. The genius of Sellers manages to still get a few laughs.  His characterizations and timing are impeccable.  The Closeau character is a joy to watch all in itself.  The part where he dresses up like a Marlon Brando type Godfather is hilarious and should have been played out more.".

And there are moments in Revenge that feel like it is going to be great. But it eventually fizzles out midway and turns into a standard chase film with a few laughs but not many guffaws.If you have read any of my other reviews you'll notice that when Edwards makes a disappointing film I usually say the same thing that he pays too much attention to the plot and it weighs the film down. The same thing applies here. But in addition to that the film doesn't even have a fun villain like in Return and Strikes Again Dreyfus. Instead we get bogged down in a plot about a drug lord Robert Webber who was wonderful in 10 and S.O.B and a Mafia don Robert Loggia who can be fun when he's allowed to be see S.O.B. and Trail of the Pink Panther. The cardinal rule of comedy is that there shouldn't be a serious villain. Just imagine if Clouseau had to battle a serial killer. There's not many chances for laughs there and there isn't here. The ending is a real problem as well. In all of the previous entries Edwards always has a wild anarchic ending usually involving Clouseau and Cato. Here SPOILER it ends quietly. Much TOO QUIET if you ask me especially for a Panther film.But all that aside Revenge is still miles better than the original. At least Edwards keeps a brisk pace and provides a few real laughs especially from Herbert Lom as Dreyfus and we like the main characters enough that we are willing to forgive its' major flaws and let it flow in one eyeball and out the other. out of 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Incorrectly pronounced dead after his car crashes and explodes Inspector Clouseau goes undercover to investigate whether an attempt was made on his life in this fifth Blake Edwards 'Pink Panther' film. As with the previous entries everything is buoyed up by Peter Sellers perfectly playing a bumbling fool completely oblivious to his own incompetence. Sellers has a deliciously absurd array of disguises this time too including a pirate getup with inflatable shoulder parrot and Burt Kwuok nicely has a chance to add dimension to Cato who helps Sellers in his investigation this time rather than just randomly attacking him. Promising as the film may sound it sags more often than its predecessors with lags between jokes. Herbert Lom also has too little screen time not appearing at all for over half an hour despite second billing his looks of disbelief wondering if he has gone mad as he keeps seeing the supposedly dead Sellers alive make for an excellent running gag that is not used often enough. The film is also let down by its most effectsdriven scene in a fireworks factory paling by comparison to a very similar bit in 'Thoroughly Modern Millie'. With Sellers solid as ever another lot of great animated opening credits Dyan Cannon's name appears on a cannon here! and Lom and Kwuok giving it their all in their all when on screen 'Revenge' is still a worthwhile film especially for fans of the series. Sure the formula begins to wear thin this time but 'begin' is the operative word as this entry is really not as far below par as one might expect from its reputation.".

In fact one of the problems of this film is that Lom is underused  usually when he appears on the screen he sees Clouseau popping up out of nowhere and he faints. And talk about underused it was a genius piece of casting getting the buxom Valerie Leon as a whipwielding dominatrix  so why did they make her part so tiny? At least the gorgeous Dyan Cannon's role is bigger and the final 15 minutes feature some good multiplevehicle chases  stunts in the streets of Hong Kong. 12 out of 4.".

While I don't think it was the funniest film of the series it certainly has more than enough laughs to make it worth watching.The film opens with a meeting where Philippe Douvier the leader of France's criminal community is told by the American mob that they think he is past his prime and not worth doing business with. In order to prove that he still has what it takes he decides to eliminate France's best known police officer Chief Inspector Clouseau. The first attempt to blow him up fails but a later attempt to gun him down appears to have succeeded... however the assassins hadn't counted on Clouseau's car being hijacked be a passing transvestite who stole his clothes shortly before their ambush.Clouseau now wearing a dress is arrested and dragged off to a lunatic asylum while his erstwhile boss Chief Inspector Dreyfus is being released to investigate his murder. Clouseau escapes from the asylum and goes home where he discovers that his manservant Cato has turned it into a profitable Chinese brothel. The two of them set off to find out who wanted to kill the chief inspector. On their way they accidentally rescue Douvier's secretarymistress Simone who he was planning to have killed after his wife ordered him to get rid of her. The three of them set off to intercept him when he meets the Americans in Hong Kong.While Seller's is very funny as Clouseau it is Herbert Lom who has the most amusing part his attempts to read the eulogy at Clouseau's funeral without bursting into laughter are hilarious. No Pink Panther film would be complete without seeing Cato's attempts to ambush his master and we get a particularly funny fight here were the two of them do battle while covered in paint. If you enjoy slapstick comedy this film should be a joy to watch and as there is no swearing or crude jokes it is suitable for all ages.".

Certainly it is the least of the Panther films made with a stillliving Sellers with a rickety plot strange detours and a weakened Sellers.Unscrupulous French businessman Philippe Douvier Robert Webber is counting on a big heroin shipment but suddenly his Mob supplier thinks he's lost his control. To prove otherwise Douvier decides to kill the one man whose death would most impress the underworld a man his assistant puts it who has survived 16 assassination attempts including two by his own boss. Target Who else?For those like me who think Pink Panther Strikes Again is the funniest comedy ever made the concept of Revenge can't help but please. Global criminals trying to kill Clouseau? Yes thank you! For a while the film delivers in a softboiled way. Director Blake Edwards weaves in a semiserious subplot featuring Douvier and his mistress Simone Dyan Cannon and runs Clouseau through his usual paces with his Chinese manservantsparring partner Cato Burt Kwouk. Even Dreyfus Herbert Lom is back raving about his social benefits package. That's one helluva life insurance policy he has for sure as Strikes Again viewers will note.Revenge is lightweight entertainment without hint of substance. Its jokes work best with some forbearance or franchise loyalty from the viewer. Clouseau dresses up as ToulouseLautrec. Now you can work the Left Bank and Montmarte in complete anonymity his dresser tells him.Yes yes the old anonymity ploy Clouseau replies.Actually Clouseau discovers the old fake death ploy works even better and with the help of Simone takes on Douvier disguised as the Godfather which gives Sellers a chance to do Clouseau doing Marlon Brando for a while. The results are some occasionally amusing moments Clouseau chokes on the cotton stuffed into his mouth and some pointless plot stretching this time in Hong Kong so no rickshaw gag can go unpulled.That's really the film in a nutshell amusing moments followed by routine ones. There's little of the true inspired zaniness that marked Strikes Again except for a moment when Dreyfus is forced to give a memorial speech for the dead Clouseau and fights back his laughter to the point of tears and another when Clouseau returns to his old apartment to find Cato has turned it into a Chinese nookie factory.Sellers is listing apparently dogged by the health complaints that would kill him two years later but his partner in crime Edwards is most at fault. There are pointless comedic scenes like one with Clouseau disguised as a salty Swedish sea dog that feels like an outtake and pointless serious scenes like when an assassin is hired to kill several other assassins in order to prove his worth. Even potential madcap moments like Clouseau in the disguise shop assisted by Sellers' old friend Graham Stark come off punchy.But it's still really Sellers in his signature role alive and reasonably well in 1978 not body doubles and Rich Little and old scraps of discarded footage. With Sellers you still get the odd funny line delivered in that subtle clever singular way.Why do you suppose he wanted me killed? he is asked.Elementary. He wanted you dead Clouseau replies.Maybe you had to be there. But the point is in Revenge Sellers IS there. If Revenge is still a failure its less of one for that.".

Casting of the leading man was a big mistake causing a contender for classic status to fall short.Central character is played by Monique Alexander in what I consider her best career performance. It's a role right out of classic '40s film noir a doubledealing femme fatale. Credits sequence offers ambiguous foreshadowing as we hear a voice say Change of plans followed by a gunshot before the film proper begins.Alexander is with a creepy guy Marcos Leon seriously miscast who picked her up that night. First reels have them locked in a sex tryst each alternating having the upper hand with a sinister hopeless In the Realm of the Senses mood created. Leon is a former child star with a Gold Record hanging on the wall proving his 1hit wonder fame and considers Alexander a groupie he has picked up at a bar to hump and discard like a used condom. In this Vivid release we have condoms optional with many scenes shot bareback while Monique gets humped by guys wearing protection.Push comes to shove when the rough sex between the two leads to Leon getting offended and anally raping Monique as the climax to their 2character segment. Leon is wearing one of those magical rubbers it appears out of nowhere on his cock for the anal penetration closeups right after being missing in the prior shots harming the credibility of this crucial scene.MANY SPOILERS AHEADTony G's script is quite ingenious at this point effectively dividing the film into three parts with different leading men. Leon phones his pal Mr. Marcus to come to the rescue reminiscent of The Cleaner character invented by Luc Besson for his classic La Femme Nikita. When Marcus arrives the film's mystery and suspense thicken as Thomas presents the next few scenes in variable order including many flashbacks. Leon tells Marcus about his wild night with Monique and that she's threatened to go to the police crying rape which would scandalize him and cost him morals clause his lucrative reality TV show. He owns up that he's got her imprisoned and Marcus frees her from bondage.What gradually develops are two intriguing plot threads we find out that one month earlier after banging two girls in his bar Marcus got picked up by Monique and they began a romantic and torrid affair. Coincidence or is it? hence the suspense has the same girl here locked in Leon's apartment. Next plot twist is a stunner as we see Marcus's own mixed motives instead of buying off the pesky Monique to keep her from going to the authorities he suggests to Leon that he off the girl instead!The shot rings out we heard from the beginning of the film and Marcus is carrying her body downstairs wrapped in a blanket for some Hitchcockian corpse removal. This plot thread is soon resolved as a red herring as the film launches into Part 3.It begins with Marcus's back story he's an excon who killed two guys who were gunning for him and has started a new life. But his past as a drug dealer catches up with him in the form of film's final protagonist Steven St. Croix an egotistical misogynistic drug kingpin.This is where the Vivid girls' roster of endless busty beauties starts to fill the screen 12 in all as Steven delights in ordering around his drugworn women as slaves not merely to serve him but to do ridiculous things culminating in a memorably nutsy game of Leon Says  St. Croix's character is named Leon  Marcos Leon's character is named Roger.St. Croix insists that Marcus pay back a huge sum of money to cover the drugs he lost when busted and sent to jail years ago. Marcus seeks to meet his payment deadline by extorting the cash from rich Roger. Twist is that he is now in on a scam with Monique he faked her death. In an important side note Steven had assumed Monique's body as collateral in case boyfriend Marcus can't pay.The duo succeed in their con getting enough money in the form of a check yet! from Roger and pay off St. Croix. But the next twist is mellow Monique decides to go to the kingpin on her own enjoy the decadent sex he and his girls provide in virtually orgy fashion including plenty of lesbianism and convince this bad guy to facilitate her revenge against Roger.Much to Marcus's dismay her revenge is humping the tieddown ballgagged Roger in the posterior with a big strapon dildo. This being a mainstream Vivid release P.T. pulls his punches and does not show this act in XXX explicitness but rather as a soft core climax to the movie.Very interesting coda has moralistic Mr. Marcus virtually the only admirable character in the film more or less chagrined when both Monique and Roger come to his bar and confront him with the fact that they are now a loving couple not schemers all along but rather the result of Roger digging getting it in the butt from a dominating woman so both are happy with their new relationship. Roger even declares to clueless Marcus I'm so glad you didn't kill her a line that would have been fun to hear as a switcheroo in a vengeful classic '40s film noir.It's a wellacted and performed wellshot movie. The girls supporting tourdeforce Monique are all hot but the weak link is Marcos Leon. He is bland and unconvincing in a complex role and either ironically or deservedly disappeared from the porn biz soon after this film was released.".

I'm really surprised they canceled the critics' screenings for this because I honestly think it would get good reviews from quite a few critics. Maybe I'm wrong.Either way it starts off in postScream slasher mode before kicking things into gear. It quickly takes on the trappings of the urban legendparablewhatever that the title is derived from with a group of spoiled rich kids deciding to trick their private school into thinking there's a killer on campus. Trouble is...there actually might be.The two leads Julian Morris and Lindy Booth are both actually very good. Booth who did almost nothing in the Dawn of the Dead remake shines brightest mixing girlnextdoor charm with a lying manipulative alterego. And it makes sense because her character uses the former so she can accomplish the latter.Another surprising standout is...Jon Bon Jovi? Yeah the guy can actually act. He skirts the line a few times but he's definitely believable as an English teacher. His story arc is also kind of funny when you consider his career and what that likely entailed during the '80s. So once again not a stretch.The only flaw I could see with the movie is that it seems a little calculating. At points it seems like it's intentionally trying to avoid teen horror clichs. For example a victim is being chased and instead of running out a door he tries to trick the killer into thinking he has. Smart. Probably too smart for a high school student but at least it's a change from the same run scream hide run again knife to the throat routine.Speaking of that tired old routine and the rating it usually causes this is probably the first time in years where I actually felt a PG13 rating was warranted. Making this an R horror movie would've killed any semblance of logic. Here the violence isn't necessarily what's supposed to frighten you. Human nature is. Their lies are what bring about the conclusion which is infinitely darker than anything Jason Vorhees has ever done.".

Though there were some annoying chatters that I wish could have been eliminated from the theater.Working with a minimal budget and a noname cast except for Bon Jovi and Gary Cole director Jeff Wadlow has shown us just like last year's Saw did that when your ambition is bigger than your pocketbook then you can still create an extremely entertaining film. This isn't quite as frantic and intense as Saw but I have no problem admitting that it sucked me in and forced me to thoroughly enjoy it.Get ready to bait your pole for a little red herring fishing because this movie's teeming with 'em. If you don't mind being manipulated as you try to guess who the killer is then you should have a fun time. I thought I had it figured out several times and within the last 10 minutes I finally did guess what was going on ... somewhat. There was another small twist at the end that kind of caught me off guard. The movie is constructed slickly enough to convince you that you've got the mystery solved but the twists are just subtle enough to throw you off the trail and reveal that you're not as smart as you think you are.I get tired of people complaining about PG13 horror movies.

I want dialogue that doesn't rely on ye olde f bomb as an uncreative crutch. I don't want to be seething with anger over a stupid plot twist that makes no sense in retrospect to the rest of the movie.CryWolf succeeds on each of these points and if you keep in mind the limitations that come with such a small budget and remind yourself that there are no Oscar winners in this cast then you should get your money's worth. If you're looking for a goresoaked bloodbath with topless women running all over the place then you're probably just going to troll the message boards and complain about how horrible this movie is so just save us all your whining and go watch a Chucky movie instead.THE GIST CryWolf is not a slasher movie that is focused on how many deaths the killer can pile up. It's more of a mystery that is concerned with keeping the audience guessing for 90 minutes. I would've liked a little more tension and a few more scares but I tip my hat to director Wadlow for a fine effort on such a small budget.".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable and clever underrated film due to poor and misleading marketing";
	schema:reviewBody "A group of friends at Wesley a rich upscale high school play a game called cry wolf every night. The game was created by the group's leader Dodger Lindy Booth who marks one of her friends as the liar with a red marker and it's up to the rest of the group to figure out who is the liar. One day Dodger and the new kid at the school Owen Julian Morris decide it will be fun to make up an entire lie about a murdering serial killer loose on campus. Owen and Dodger go along with the idea and send a mass email to everyone on campus letting them know that a killer by the name of The Wolf is murdering people on campus. But it isn't long before this little joke turns into a real threat that might cost everyone involved in the joke their lives.Three words can be used to describe this film clever suspenseful and enjoyable! I really enjoyed this film and I didn't see it coming at all I expected something mediocre at best when walking into the theater. While the marketing for this film is misleading and makes this movie seem like another brainless teen horror slasher flick I assure you it's not like that. While I wouldn't call this movie 100 percent original I would say that this movie is a pretty fresh idea with a lot of originality. This movie is great for a few reasons the first reason is because the idea behind it is pretty new the second reason is that the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense and lastly the film keeps you guessing. I love movies that make you keep you thinking and just when you think you know what's going to happen your proved wrong. This film contains a lot of twists! And I haven't seen a movie that kept me guessing all the way till the end in a long time.The acting for this cast of newcomers is actually pretty good especially for the genre at hand. I really enjoyed Julian Morris's character Owen he played the part very well and he was very believable. I also really enjoyed Lindy Booth who was excellent as Dodger she had such a controlling power about her and she really brought it out on screen. Also I have to mention that she was incredibly cute! Also the other surprise here was Jon Bon Jovi who actually can act and sing which is always an incredible pair but he was good as the sleazy journalism teacher. There are several others to mention here and that would probably take far too much time to list them all but they were all good at the roles they played.CryWolf was directed by newcomer Jeff Wadlow a recent USC film graduate. I must say that I liked what he did with the film. He knew how to build the suspense and capture the character's fears and excitement. I really liked some of the camera shots especially the whole collage thing when all of the people started to read the email about the serial killer on campus. Nice work there! Also Jeff cowrote the film with Beau Bauman and I must say the film was a pretty fresh idea and I loved the whole idea behind the film considering it seems like an idea that could happen now with computers and cell phones everywhere.So to sum it up CryWolf is not what the trailers lead you to believe instead it's a suspense thriller with good acting a semi original story and a great ending. The movie contains several twists that keeps the audience always on the edge of their seats asking the question What's going to happen next? It might not be an Oscar worthy film but it's a damn good thriller to say the least. It keeps you guessing and interested from start to finish and what more can you ask for from a mainstream Hollywood film? MovieManMenzel's final rating for CryWolf is a 810. Buy the big popcorn and sit back and enjoy the suspense.".

Also Jeff cowrote the film with Beau Bauman and I must say the film was a pretty fresh idea and I loved the whole idea behind the film considering it seems like an idea that could happen now with computers and cell phones everywhere.So to sum it up CryWolf is not what the trailers lead you to believe instead it's a suspense thriller with good acting a semi original story and a great ending. The movie contains several twists that keeps the audience always on the edge of their seats asking the question What's going to happen next? It might not be an Oscar worthy film but it's a damn good thriller to say the least. It keeps you guessing and interested from start to finish and what more can you ask for from a mainstream Hollywood film? MovieManMenzel's final rating for CryWolf is a 810. Buy the big popcorn and sit back and enjoy the suspense.";

At first Cry Wolf seems like it's going to be a traditional straightforward slasher movie but soon you begin to realize that there are layers within layers and the result is a movie that's increasingly suspenseful and intriguing from beginning to end. It would be highly unfair to give away the plot. It's appropriate only to say that each of several of us was surprised by the ending. Most of the actors are talented unknowns with a couple of established actors Jon Bon Jovi Anna Deavere Smith artfully used Bon Jovi in a major role Smith in a minor one. The movie cleverly weaves in current technologies especially instant messaging in a way that heightens the suspense and is sure to enhance its appeal to young audiences. Great production values cinematography and editing  all elements contribute to a movie that's one of the best of its genre.".

Needless to say that the characters and the performances are as flat as the story itself this is after all a cast that includes Jon Bon Jovi.

	schema:reviewBody "A group of high school students hatch a plan to scare other students by creating a mock serial killer called The Wolf to see if anyone solves the lie but soon victims start showing up killed in the ways described in the game and then they themselves become prey to the killer.It's obvious that Cry Wolf is pretty much a rip off of April Fool's Day but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Despite bad acting and an unoriginal story Cry Wolf still offers up enough suspense and thrills to keep the viewer entertained. It's not really that scary of a movie but there are a few moments that could shock you and it does offer up a bunch of nice twists. Usually a PG13 horror film is done to make extra money yet the rating doesn't affect this film too much. It still gets the job done and it shows that a horror film doesn't have to be extremely gory or violent to be scary and entertaining. As mentioned above the story is pretty unoriginal and some of the twists are predictable. I think they should have spent a little more time on the script because sometimes it felt like you had seen it all before.For the most part the acting is pretty bad. I know this isn't a surprise or anything but they could have casted some people that were at least going to try. The worst one is Julian Morris who plays the leading character Owen. His performance is so unconvincing and his accent is so annoying. Lindy Booth plays Dodger and she actually does a pretty good job. The only other actor to give a decent performance was Jared Padalecki. Bon Jovi also has a small role and he should stick to singing. He's not as bad as one would expect but he doesn't need to be appearing in low budget horror films either.This film is not for everyone though. People who like their horror films bloody and violent should skip Cry Wolf since it contains none of that. Also there isn't really one likable character so it's kind of hard to like these people and feel sorry for them. The ending is pretty good and not completely predictable. You will probably figure out who the killer is early on but the motive is not as obvious. After seeing so many bad horror films from 2005 its nice to see one that actually entertains. In the end some may find this film too generic but I thought it was a nice little horror film. A fun way to spend 90 minutes. Rating 710".

	schema:reviewBody "The failure of this movie in the public's eye is yet another case of poor advertising. I rented it expecting a bad slasher flick but was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be much more intelligent though somewhat reminiscent of that other incredibly played out genre.The plot twists are actually fantastic as well as the score throughout the movie. There is even some pretty nice cinematography here and there.The acting is superb which was also very surprising. I couldn't believe that the corny jerk character was actually likable as a character because he was played so well. That's just one example. This cast deserves more credit for pulling off what could have been a very bad movie but they turned it into an entertaining suspense thriller of sorts.Of course it's not perfect and there are some cheesy slasher movie elements but I felt that wherever those points were present they were somewhat outweighed by the rest of the movie.Honestly I wish they would have had the setting in a college rather than a high school as most of the characters look talk and act like they're in college rather than spoiled rich kids at a prep school. Yet that's just one of those minor points that you get over further on into the movie as it wouldn't change much of the plot at all anyway.Overall I was quite impressed with this film. Though it's not the best of it's kind it's a very entertaining popcorn flick and I only wish it would have been advertised a little differently though I'm not sure how you could draw the right crowd to it. Yet giving this the guise of a slasher flick was a huge mistake on somebody's part as fans expecting gore would be sorely misled and disappointed Does anybody actually look at that PG13 rating?.".

This cast deserves more credit for pulling off what could have been a very bad movie but they turned it into an entertaining suspense thriller of sorts.Of course it's not perfect and there are some cheesy slasher movie elements but I felt that wherever those points were present they were somewhat outweighed by the rest of the movie.Honestly I wish they would have had the setting in a college rather than a high school as most of the characters look talk and act like they're in college rather than spoiled rich kids at a prep school. Yet that's just one of those minor points that you get over further on into the movie as it wouldn't change much of the plot at all anyway.Overall I was quite impressed with this film. Though it's not the best of it's kind it's a very entertaining popcorn flick and I only wish it would have been advertised a little differently though I'm not sure how you could draw the right crowd to it. Yet giving this the guise of a slasher flick was a huge mistake on somebody's part as fans expecting gore would be sorely misled and disappointed Does anybody actually look at that PG13 rating?.";

The movie plays like a bad episode of Scooby Doo mysteries because besides the cast there's only one or two other characters in the movie. The movie has terrible acting  just makes you laugh rather than jump from fright. First off the movie begins with a classic slasher movie scene young blonde being chased through the woods trips breathing heavily making odd noises while trying to hide etc. The killer finds her by calling her cell phone then shooting her in the head. From there we are taken to a boarding school where we supposed to be sucked into a prep school world filled with dull lifeless characters. The story goes nowhere as it drags along at a snails pace. You never see the murders either. Why? Because you find out there are no real murders it's all a game set up to scare the main protagonist. In the final part of the movie Bon Jovi who plays a teacher is killed for real by Owen. But at the end Owen realizes it has all been a set up by the girl dodger. Wow what a twist. Watch this one night while your drunk andor with friends  just laugh at this pathetic movie. I'm willing to bet I could pick a person off the street who could make a better movie.".

A group growing illegal drugs are sprayed with a toxic herbicide which turns them into bloodthirsty zombies. After this a lot of stalking around the forest and occasional gore follows. None of the characters are particularly interesting and you won't feel any sympathy when they die. The decent bits are when a man gets his hand severed complete with spurting blood and a few splatter scenes such as when one of the zombies is killed at the end. I wouldn't recommend watching it for this as you can find ten times as much gore in a Lucio Fulci flick. It has a typical synth score and a woman gets her breasts out. I would only recommend Forest Of Fear if you're a backwoods slasher fan. It's not really for zombie fans as the zombies just look like regular people with makeup and dark circles round their eyes. It's a rare title too  unavailable on DVD but old VHS copies appear on ebay from time to time.".

	schema:reviewBody "And to think I was actually looking forward to seeing this film! Forest of Fear is a Video Nasty zombie flick and if that's not enough to put you off the fact that it's really boring might. The plot looks like it might give way to a fun little flick as it follows the idea of a field full of weed being sprayed by chemicals which turn everyone who smokes it into zombies. However the film can't capitalise on this plot base I'm not sure if it was because of the budget constraints or merely a lack of talent on the writer's part but most of the film is made up of tedious sequences and even the parts where the zombies get to munch on human flesh aren't up to much. I've got no idea why this film was banned as while there are gore sequences in the film none of them are particularly gruesome and I reckon that whoever made up the actual 'Video Nasty' list decided to take this film out of circulation because it's a zombie film. Not that I particularly have a problem with a ban on this movie it's not worth seeing anyway.Despite being rubbish however Forest of Fear marks a personal achievement for Charles McCrann. McCrann apparently a movie buff has credits on this movie for acting directing editing producing and writing  and that's no small feat even for a movie of this low calibre. However despite McCrann's personal achievement Forest of Fear is a zombie movie of the lowest order. Movies like Dawn of the Dead took the idea of zombies and moulded it around a substantial social commentary and later films such as The Evil Dead worked in spite of a low budget thanks to a constant stream of entertainment Forest of Fear lacks both intelligence and interest and it very much just another zombie movie. Ironically had the film have been Italian I may have been more forgiving given all the glorious trash that they've given the world of cult cinema but unfortunately this is just a really bad film and unless you're planning to see everything on the Video Nasty list like me  I can't recommend going out of your way to find this.".

I've got no idea why this film was banned as while there are gore sequences in the film none of them are particularly gruesome and I reckon that whoever made up the actual 'Video Nasty' list decided to take this film out of circulation because it's a zombie film. Not that I particularly have a problem with a ban on this movie it's not worth seeing anyway.Despite being rubbish however Forest of Fear marks a personal achievement for Charles McCrann. McCrann apparently a movie buff has credits on this movie for acting directing editing producing and writing  and that's no small feat even for a movie of this low calibre. However despite McCrann's personal achievement Forest of Fear is a zombie movie of the lowest order. Movies like Dawn of the Dead took the idea of zombies and moulded it around a substantial social commentary and later films such as The Evil Dead worked in spite of a low budget thanks to a constant stream of entertainment Forest of Fear lacks both intelligence and interest and it very much just another zombie movie. Ironically had the film have been Italian I may have been more forgiving given all the glorious trash that they've given the world of cult cinema but unfortunately this is just a really bad film and unless you're planning to see everything on the Video Nasty list like me  I can't recommend going out of your way to find this.";

When the government hears about this they drop a load of extremely toxic chemicals on both the marijuana and the people the government apparently did not care about the condition of the people. These chemicals end up turning the group people into zombies hence the name Toxic Zombies. The rest of the movie involves zombies killing and eating people.The plot may not sound that bad to some but what the director did with it is what made the movie so bad. There is not a large amount of gore unlike what the box lead me to believe and when gore is inserted it is extremely fake. The acting is very bad as is the dialogue and the plot. The only good thing about this movie is the unintentional humor derived from the script and the bad acting.I recommend this movie for nobody. My rating 2 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Prior to watching this movie I was not aware that it had gained most of its notoriety from being banned in Britain. Neither was I aware that it went by several different titles other than Toxic Zombies. Be that as it may and in all honesty this is not a good movie. I hate to be so blunt but that's just the way it is. The acting was pretty bad the script was awful and the zombies didn't look that impressive at all. However compared to a few other GradeZ lowbudget zombie movies this one at least makes an effort to overcome its obvious lack of funds and talent to try to produce something worth viewing. It doesn't succeed but at least it tries. Essentially the movie begins with some DEA officials who decide to spray a heavily forested area with a new chemical called Dromax in order to destroy marijuana cultivation. They make this decision without regard for any potential damage this new chemical might cause. As it so happens the chemical powder descends upon the people growing the marijuana and turns them into zombies who attack and kill everybody they come across. So much for the plot. But having said all of that what I liked about this film was that the director Charles McCrann put in an honest effort and tried to make a good zombie movie rather than cop out and try to deliberately make a film that's so bad it's good like several other directors have done. Of course those specific movies weren't that good at all. They were just plain awful. And while this one wasn't good either it's at least better than those just mentioned. For that I applaud the effort.".

Forget Romero this thing doesn't even manage to muster up half the entertainment value of Bill Hinzman's laughable though oddly enjoyable 1988 ripoff REVENGE OF THE LIVING ZOMBIES aka FLESH EATER. About a half dozen marijuana harvesting yahoos camping out in the woods are sprayed with a toxic chemical called Dromax by a passing helicopter sent out by some corrupt federal agents well aware of what they're doing. Most of the pot growers start getting sick by the next day cough up blood and then become raving lunatics who kill random people for their blood. A man played by Charles Austin McCrann the director writer producer and editor of TOXIC ZOMBIES going on his annual fishing trip with his very whiny and irritating wife Beverly Shapiro and his brother Phillip Garfinkel end up getting caught in the middle. There's also a family of four husband wife teen daughter and retarded teen son on a camping trip that get attacked as well as a hermit a trucker the copter pilot his wife and a couple of others. The drug enforcement agents including John Amplas star of Romero's MARTIN show up at the very end to complicate matters.For starters the enticing rerelease moniker TOXIC ZOMBIES is a bit misleading. This was originally filmed under the much more accurate title BLOOD EATERS. In other words if you like your zombies to look like zombies you known with rotting flesh makeup applications or even a coating of blue or gray or white or green paint to give them an undead appearance you're sure to be disappointed by the minimal look of the ghouls here. They basically just look like dirty people. Dirty unshaven hippies with a few boils on their faces to be exact. They grunt use weapons basically a machete in one scene and a rock in another and even burn down a shack with torches at one point. The fact there are only a few of these bloodhungry maniacs lurking about at any given time doesn't really help the fear factor any. None pose much of a threat and are easily disposed of when the time comes. As far as gore is concerned there are a couple of cheap effects such as a hand being cut off a head shot and an eyeball stabbing but the gore quotient is almost as minimal as the blood eaters makeup.So sadly fellow zombie fans all we're really left with here is an inept film that not only looks ugly from an aesthetic standpoint but is also dull from an actionguilty pleasure stance. The first five minutes which should be attempting to capture our attention consist of two camera changes of a car driving down a dirt road followed by two guys walking in the woods carrying rifles. The acting is terrible there's an irritating generic and repetitive piano score silly dialogue not worth listening to one outofnowhere topless shot of a woman sitting by a bucket of water scrubbing her breasts and lots of scenes of people running through the woods... and out of the woods onto the road... and then back into the woods again... It's probably worth a single watch for cheap movie lovers and zombie film completists some parts aren't too bad and others are amusing in a bad movie kind of way but most will want to rightfully steer clear.The writerdirectorproducereditorstar was an ivy league graduate Princeton Yale Law employed at Marsh  McLennan Company in the World Trade Center and sadly was killed during the September 11th terrorist attacks.

This film was not nearly as bad as I thought it would bealthough it's no masterpiece either. The film is padded out has terrible wooden acting a ludicrous scriptawful zombie makeup and yet somehow it doesn't fall flat on its face... well not entirely. On the plus side there is a small but decent amount of gore effects severed limbs bullets through head and neck guts seeping out of a dead body and the soundtrack similar to John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is actually quite eerie and effective rendering the film a tad more suspenseful than it has a right to be. The zombies not truly being undead but just drugged out homicidal maniacs are the result of being sprayed by a secret government herbicide and thus die all too easily as any normal person would. The film needed more zombies more victims more gore and more action. It has its moments and a certain creaky campy charm but suffers mightily from its amateur cast and crew and is paced only slightly faster than your average snail and has about as much intelligence. Not a bad rental if you're hard up for zombie fare. I give it a 3 out of 10 stars.".

But no matter because it doesn't really make a difference what title this movie has it's not going to improve it any. Its story is about a group of marijuana farmers who are sprayed with a toxic chemical by renegade federal agents. They turn into homicidal maniacs and terrorise various people in a forest.Sadly despite being an honest enough effort this is a pretty boring movie. It's amateurish in every conceivable way. Its video nasty credentials are somewhat questionable too. It's one of many films from the notorious list that have no right being in any grouping of films that were considered a threat to society. The very idea of someone sitting through this and then being either traumatised or inspired to commit acts of violence is patently an insane one. The only thing anyone is in danger of is in falling asleep to be perfectly honest. Acting is universally amateur despite the presence of John Amplas who was so impressive in George Romero's excellent film Martin. While the music is a very poor man's Halloween score. The only thing truly of note has nothing to do with the actual film and that is the fact that the director Charles McCrann was one of the poor unfortunates who perished in the World Trade Center attacks back in 2001.".

Inside are two Federal Agents James Hart and John Kuhi. They stumble across a hippies camp site. Jackie Debbie Link is bathing less than three minutes on the clock and we get some naked breast shots I'm almost impressed. Realizing that this is camp of a bunch of illegal marijuana growers they attempt to arrest the hippies. Jackie is shot through her throat and killed the other hippies manage to turn the tables on the Feds and kill them both. Back in civilization the Federal Agents are missed. In their boss Briggs Paul Haskin office we know it's a Feds office because there's a big table swivel chair and an American flag he tells agent Phillips John Amplas to spray the whole area with an experimental untested toxic chemical herbicide called Dromax. Back at the camp site the hippies decide to harvest what they can and leave before more Feds turn up. As they start to harvest the crop five of the hippies Bob Hanson Gerald Cullen Ronald Keinhuis Kim Roff and make up effects man Craig Harris get covered in Dromax as it's dumped by a constantly drunk crop sprayer Bob Larson from his plane. They all start to cough up blood and look very sick. The hippie leader Dennis Graber and his girlfriend Debra O'Leary both escaped being sprayed and quickly find out that the Dromax has turned their friends into bloodthirsty mindless zombies! A husband Roger Mills his wife Pat Kellis plus their two children Amy Judy Brown and Jimmy Kevin Hanlon and anyone else the hippie zombies can find are attacked. It's up to the local forest ranger Tom Cole played by editor producer writer and director Charles McCrann as Charles Austin his wife Polly Beverly Shapiro and his half brother Jay Philip Garfinkel who are on weekend fishing trip to try and save the day and put an end to the hippie zombies reign of bloodthirsty terror! Starring in edited produced written and directed by Charles McCrann who according to the IMDb died in the 911 terrorist attacks in New York. Well we know who to blame then. I didn't exactly hate it but at the same time I certainly didn't like it either. Generally quite poorly made with awful acting cheap effects extremely static boring photography and lackluster instantly forgettable music. There's next to no gore or violence in it a chopped off hand cut off leg a few gunshot wounds and a few splashes of blood here and there that's it. The only nudity is the woman taking a bath in the opening scenes. The script sucks it has no excitement tension and very little originality. The hippie zombies have no purpose their bite doesn't turn others into zombies and their never shown eating anyone they just kill for the hell of it. Most of the characters in the film aren't even given proper names which shows how much character development McCrann was interested in. The limp ending is terrible as well it just sort of ends all of a sudden. The dialogue is very sparse and some of the worst I've heard in a long time none of the characters are developed at all I couldn't care less what happened to anyone at any point in the film. This film has various alternate titles including Bloodeaters Toxic Zombies Blood Butchers and it's known as Forest of Fear here in the UK. Poor don't waste your time.".

This is a virtually plot less affair involving a group of hippies who are sprayed with experimental herbicide and turn into weaponwielding zombies although it has to be said that there are very atypical zombies as they resemble nothing more than stoned students wandering around in the woods. Astonishingly this is a film which gained a certain notoriety thanks to its brief appearance on the video nasties list this is incredible when watching a relatively tame film when compared to the likes of Fulci's ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS or the myriad other video nasties around at the time.The entire film takes place in the woods and it has to be said that the location is the best aspect of the film lending the movie a natural atmosphere which even the occasionally sloppy camerawork can't hide. The cast is a largely interchangeable bunch of hippies government agents and holidaying families with plenty of chasing about and action interspersed with some laughable gore segments a man's hand is cut off a severed leg is found in the wood some entrails leak from a torn stomach. The special effects are laughably bad so cheap that they even use those jokeshop plastic flies at one point sticking them to a wound. The zombies just appear to have putty stuck to their faces so don't go expecting any Dick Smithstyle gruesomeness here.The wooden lead is played by Charles McCrann actually Charles Austin who also acted as director writer and producer. In retrospect his actionman persona is lent a touch of poignancy in the discovery that he was killed in the 911 Al Quaeda attack on the Twin Towers. FOREST OF FEAR is Austin's baby and it isn't that bad certainly more atmospheric than the other amateur efforts of the '80s and '90s like ZOMBIE NOSH for instance. The unknown Beverly Shapiro is mildly attractive as the heroine whilst Romero regular John Amplas pops up as a corrupt government official. However it's the supporting characters who are the most hilarious Dennis Helfend who plays a paranoid hermit living out in the woods steals the show with his fleshy edgy performance whilst the acting of the lad playing the boy also gets a few laughs. In the end FOREST OF FEAR is pretty much interchangeable with the other cheap horror efforts coming from America between 1980 and 1983 but it retains a few moments of interest to make it worth a look for kindly fans.".

From then on it's a chase through the woods while the Gman and John Amplas of Martin fame try and cover up the mess they've made.While insanely cheap and in places badly acted and edited and also although it takes a while to build up some steam Toxic Zombies is good for a laugh once it gets going. It's not overly gory but people do get stabbed in the eye have their hands chopped off as the hippies battle the norms.

Notorious for being one of the Video Nasty titles banned in Britain during a public outcry over gory sexually suggestive horror movie videos. Its actually one of the last holdouts which hasn't gotten what would be a highly lucrative DVD revival and there's a tragic creepy reason for it.The premise is basic enough to be easily understood on a sort of Urban Legend sort of level Dumb hippies camping up in the sticks for a summer growing season are waiting to harvest 2 million dollars worth of dope when a team of federal narcotics agents stumble upon their bivouac. They shoot the only good looking woman willing to bare her breasts for the camera and are promptly slaughtered for their efforts by the hippies who aren't all peace  love after all. After the agents are reported missing cynical federal drug officers decide to dust the crop of weed with an experimental defoliant known to have toxic side effects. I actually remember stories about weed being dusted by the government with paraquat that would make you gag blood when I was a teenage troublemaker and always wondered if this movie was a source of that urban myth.So the feds hire a down on his luck loser to do it planning to off him afterward to cover it all up. The hippies get exposed to the defoliant and mutate into ravenous bloodthirsty zombie type maniacs. They go on a rampage murdering and partially devouring anyone they come upon and the film does a good job of trotting a regular supply of fresh victims onto the location sets. Meanwhile the hero writerdirectorstar Charles McCrann and his girlfriend happen upon a young girl and her mentally handicapped brother as they wander through the woods looking for frogs or whatever. The four flee the toxic zombies and take up with a survivalist hermit living in the woods who must have been Ted Kazinski's next door neighbor even though the film was made in Pennsylvania. They fight a losing battle against the toxic zombies  find themselves on the run again only to come face to face with the scurrilous drug agents who plan to murder everybody and cover up the event. All we need is that cigarette guy from the XFiles and we'd have a nice little modern day post Vietnam era paranoia parable here.That's the movie in a nutshell. What works are the zombie attacks and the low budget middle of nowhere locations that were chosen. There's also a decent pulsating electronic musical score that suggest somebody had seen a couple of Lucio Fulci movies  And it turns out directorstar Chuck McCrann was indeed a horror movie buff and sort of made this on his own with some friends  business contacts one of whom was George A. Romero actor John Amplas himself a native Pennsylvanian known to work on risky low budget projects.There's certainly a home movie sort of quality to the proceedings which I say works in the movie's favor. Mr. McCrann was apparently something of a financial entrepreneur and likely raised the funds for the project himself giving the film a nice independentregional edge to it. There are no big stars the zombie effects and gore makeup are effective yet minimal and the biggest bill for the project was probably the lab fee for the print. Most of the actors are nonprofessionals it was likely filmed on public land with a modest crew and was indeed apparently so independent of a production that there wasn't anyone to stick up for it when British authorities outright banned the film in or around 1984. Its legend as a barfbagger epic banned by assorted heads of state grew far out of proportion to anything the movie actually delivers resulting in some of the confusion amongst the ranks of my fellow reviewers here.Today the film exists in a sort of limbo. Not public domain but the legal rights to the film are probably undetermined since they likely remained with Mr. McCrann who it turns out was one of the victims of the 911 terror attacks on the World Trade Center which is where his offices were located. Until the legalities are sorted out the film will remain slipped through the cracks and overlooked with only its bizarre legacy to recommend it. The only DVD versions kicking around today are sourced from old home video releases. There's an R rated North American DVD and an unrated print from Japan that shows the complete 89 minute assembly rejected by the MPAA.One offbeat tangent of intrigue here is that the theme of government conspiracy and indifference to public wellbeing runs through TOXIC ZOMBIES right up to a paranoid survivalist hoarding guns  MREs up in his cabin. Of course its just a coincidence but it adds to the film's aura of seediness and cynicism. I actually kind of like it too. I adore low budget regional horror and this is probably one of the pinnacle efforts. It deserves to be resurrected and restored both as a legacy to McCrann's vision and a great object lesson on how to make a cheap sleazy endearing little horror movie for peanuts.610".

A lot of what you see is the aftereffects of a zombie hippie attack such as some strewn about flesh or internal organs. You don't see much in the way of on screen carnage as it happens. Although you will see a hand chopped off but that ain't much.The basic story of this film and yes it's pretty basic is that the evil government decides to ruin a fun time for some hippies by spraying their hidden pot crop with an experimental crop poison. Yes this idea has been done before and better. Anyway some of the hippies get the dust on them and turn into zombies. To their credit they take a cue from Burial GroundNights of Terror and utilize weapons and even torches! That's pretty much the plot with some dummies running around trying to avoid being killed and partially eaten. The acting is nonexistent but I was somehow able to get over that. I was disappointed by the level of gorearen't I always?. The musical score was by and large totally inappropriate for the action although occasionally it was creepy. Often times it sounded like a comedy score.Also the director was killed in the 911 attacks if you didn't know. That might actually give the movie more fame than being on the Nasties list.

I guess having a stiff cast of amateurs playing goodnatured characters in as goofy a manner as possible can do that for a film.The story involves a bunch of hippie criminals who get sprayed with experimental crud when the government tries to eradicate their marijuana crop. The crud turns them into mindless zombie killers who mostly go in for hacking and bludgeoning violence using any tools or lumps of stone they find lying around. This is the wilderness so there's no shortage of the lumps of stone especially.Caught up in the action is a noble government ranger guy with a cute sense of humour who's fishing in the woods that weekend. He brings along his equally cute girlfriend and his wacky brother. There's also a dumb mum'n'dad couple camping in the woods and their conscientious daughter who shepherds around her mentally handicapped brother such shepherding prompting minor swells of earnest and sentimental piano music on the soundtrack. The crankiest character is a governmenthating survivalist holed up in a woods cabin.All of these folks are put upon by the zombies and due to the smallness of the cast you can't really be too surprised by discovering who survives and who doesn't but you can be a little surprised.This will sound sappy but the niceness of the main characters is the neat thing about this film. I really like the ranger and the little gags he swaps with his girlfriend all woodenly delivered. She Beverly Shapiro comes across as perhaps the poorest actor of a poor bunch what with all her eyerolling and drawling exasperatedness and yet this is why I like her too. Plus she has cool hair very much of the time. The sentiment of the handicapped brother subplot is corny but again in an earnest way that is strangely neat in the end.There's a decent amount of limblopping and blood in the film but the overall dynamics are so leisurely that it's not too effecting. The film has themes concerning government corruption and the goodcrushing nature of civil service plus a strange penultimate shot offering a message of the kind horror films like to deliver. I think to describe it as 'twist' would be a bit much.This was enthusiastic director Charles McCrann's one film and a labour of love apparently. I've watched it twice which is more than I can say about a lot of the video nasties.".

The film has themes concerning government corruption and the goodcrushing nature of civil service plus a strange penultimate shot offering a message of the kind horror films like to deliver. I think to describe it as 'twist' would be a bit much.This was enthusiastic director Charles McCrann's one film and a labour of love apparently. I've watched it twice which is more than I can say about a lot of the video nasties.";

It passes no judgment on the man or his music but documents a phenomenon.  Phillips looks at GG with unflinching honesty and does not try to sugarcoat the reality of the disturbed individual who lashed out at the world around him.

Allin was as legitimate an American folksinger as Leadbelly or Woody Guthrie his material was more ummm...specialized but listen to 'Gypsy Motherfcker' 'LiquorSlicked Highway' or 'Shove That Warrant Up Your Ass' to get an idea of what I'm talking about. But rather than being a balanced portrait Hated is largely a performance. Some people will just respond So? after reading that. But it matters because this film takes itself soooooo seriously. There are serious moments in it of course but there's a lot of humor as well...and a lot of artifice on Allin's part. Did he have a horrible childhood? Yes by all accounts. Was there a time when his onstage antics were more sincere than when Hated was filmed? Yesjust check out the archival footage of his spokenword performance in Boston in 1988 he wasn't kidding around. Actually the excerpts featured in the film don't even reveal all of the embarrassing frightening and nakedly emotional moments of that performance you'll have to track down a bootleg video or DVD to see the whole enchilada. But why at thirtysix or thirtysevenwhen you're out of prison and looking relatively healthy and you've achieved at least some level of notorietydo you still feel the need to cut yourself eat your own sht and beat up your fans? The answer is that G.G. Allin apparently DIDN'T want to do this anymore. Just before his death according to biographer Joe Coughlin Allin said that he wanted to retire from the punk scene and go into country music. And why not? When you're approaching forty you simply can't withstand the kind of selfabuse that Allin's fans had come to expect. But he soldiered on for another couple of years doing precisely what WAS expected of him and died because of it if indirectly. G.G. Allin had a natural genuine talent but he painted himself into a corner pretty early on. He loved his daughter was a fan of Captain Kangaroo and at one time had a damned fine singing voice. The monstrous character that he playedand sometimes becamewas interesting but it's a shame that Hated lets us see only that facet of his personality.".

As a fan of rock music I can understand exactly where GG is coming from when he says that there is a great void in rock music today that there is no soul behind the stars of the music industry. Where is the senseless destruction? Where is the violence? Where is the hyperobscene sexuality that once offended legions of conservative suburbanites in the 1950's and 60's? Feeling that since he is the only one with the guts to do anything about it GG took it upon himself to singlehandedly compensate for all the boring cookiecutter rock stars that anxiously collect royalty checks and live in 10 million mansions. GG willingly suffered to be a martyr for rock music frequently going so far that once warrants were out for his arrest in at least seven states at the same time! One scene that particularly hit me was this GG is shown walking out of a court room after being handed down one of the many prison sentences he received in his life. As he walks by the camera he exclaims triumphantly They're trying to destroy rock and roll but they CAN'T DO IT! It is strange for me to admit that as a touching statement especially when said by a man who is repeatedly shown sprawled out naked on stage smothered in his own blood urine and feces but at the same time you wonder does anyone else out there in that nameless faceless monolith of rock give a damn about what they're doing enough to sacrifice their life for the name of it?This movie is not for casual patrons of rock only a true lover of it will be able to transcend the gruesome appetitesuppressing often vomitinducing qualities of the film.

Taking one of the most seriously committed artists to ever 'grace' the American soundscape Philips turns out a documentary that captures not only the spirit energy and intensity of GG Allin but also provides a very good context for Allin's life and work.GG was a lot of things to many different of people but if there is one thing everyone can agree upon it's that GG was extreme.GG was born in New Hampshire but made a name for himself in the underground downtown NY punk scene of the early 80s. This was around the same time Sonic Youth Swans Cop Shoot Cop Pussy Galore Foetus and Lydia Lunch were making the club rounds. These were the names that influenced American underground culture for about twenty years and GG was definitely one of the most risible and visible members of this scene.Hated is a great film in its own right showing the obvious early talents of Todd Philips who would later grow up to be a Hollywood director in what must seem like another life to him. This is Philips at his most acerbic and the wit he shows is great. He also treats GG with considerable tolerance and respect which almost backfires because you see how GG tries to alienate him at every turn. Despite this smokescreen Philips captures something genuinely human about Allin his misery his sadness and his frustration but also his drive to create art and to challenge a society he saw as essentially hypocritical empty pathologically ill and discriminiatory elements he himself flaunted in his most angry performances.GG had been doing shows and making albums for about ten years when this film was shot. He was no longer a young man and a life of poverty drug abuse and vagrancy had finally begun to take its toll. A stretch in prison also deeply affected him. GG died of a heroin overdose soon after.A lot of this doc consists of very well appropriated footage from various shows readings and performances Allin did during this time. You can find the uncut performances from other sources and its interesting to see what Philips used and what he didn't. GG's performances were actually far more frightening and depressing than Philips shows if you can actually believe that but I think the clips were accurate overall.I once had the opportunity to have drinks with Kembra Phahler of Volumptuous Horror of Karen Black fame and she told me a little bit about her friendship with Allin and made an interesting comment in that Allin's selfdestruction may have had much more to do with his drug addiction than his penchant for extreme performances. A lot of people feel that had Allin lived he would have become a country or blues artist. It's hard to think about what we missed or what GG missed through his early departure. Even if you think you'll hate GG Allin or feel this isn't for you you should really give it a shot. A lot of people I know who hate punk were really fascinated by this entertaining doc. I've probably watched it over thirty times. Whatever your reaction I promise you'll never forget it. Highly recommended.PS May God bless GG Allin and better luck to him in the next world! Live Fast. Die. GG".

GG's performances were actually far more frightening and depressing than Philips shows if you can actually believe that but I think the clips were accurate overall.I once had the opportunity to have drinks with Kembra Phahler of Volumptuous Horror of Karen Black fame and she told me a little bit about her friendship with Allin and made an interesting comment in that Allin's selfdestruction may have had much more to do with his drug addiction than his penchant for extreme performances. A lot of people feel that had Allin lived he would have become a country or blues artist. It's hard to think about what we missed or what GG missed through his early departure. Even if you think you'll hate GG Allin or feel this isn't for you you should really give it a shot. A lot of people I know who hate punk were really fascinated by this entertaining doc. I've probably watched it over thirty times. Whatever your reaction I promise you'll never forget it. Highly recommended.PS May God bless GG Allin and better luck to him in the next world! Live Fast. Die. GG";

	schema:reviewBody "GG Allin was truly something else.  The man had no musical talent whatsoever yet had probably one of the most loyal fan bases in rock music. This is despite the fact that he beat up assaulted and even raped audience members during concerts he gave...and more often than not ended up in jail because of it.  His concerts were more of a war zone filled with bodily fluid violence and musical assault.  As a fan or more an observer of GG's music I was quick to pick up this documentary about the man and I must admit I was thourougly impressed with it.  It contains what probably are some of the most disturbing and utterly disgusting images I have ever seen.  GG was known for performing shows naked and defecating on stage...then rubbing the result all over himself.  I can bet that most people would have a hard time watching a video of this event...which is shown here...and would find it hard to even imagine seeing GG in concert live. GG was also somewhat remembered as the guy who said he would commit suicide onstage for rock only to die of a heroin overdose.Overall this film was a no holds barred look at the life of this infamous rock 'n' roll legend and one that was actually quite revealing into the how and whys of his life through interviews with him friends family and fans.  There is quite a few disturbing and absolutely disgusting images including moments from live shows as well as a scene a fan talks about with a camera there to document it.  This particular scene is just beyond description...and as not to spoil it should you attempt to watch this film I refuse to comment further.GG was definitely one of the outlaws and revolutionaries in the rock and roll industry paving the way for such artists as Marilyn Manson and others doing nasty things on stage and this documentary is worth it to see just what created this rock and roll myth and the legend behind it. Recommended but be prepared for a lot of nastiness going in.".

G.G. was a true punk who really just didn't give a f!ck about anything. Often performing nude defecating on stage and rubbing it all over himself and sometimes eating it assaulting the crowds inciting riots  Allin was the REAL definition of the antisocial drugandalcohol abusing outlawanarchist punk.HATED tells a bit about Allin's upbringing in a small town in Vermont and follows right up until his heroininduced death. There are interviews with previous friends and classmates teachers former and present bandmates a rabid fan named Unk as well as G.G. himself. Of course G.G.'s insane live performances including several shows with him and his band The Murder Junkies are shown along with a few spokenword performances. One truly notable scene is from a party at Unk's house where a girl agrees to p!ss in G.G.'s mouth as he drinks it and then pukes all over himself. The only gripe I had with the film as a whole is that at only around 50 minutes it was too damn short as Allin is such a character that I could watch his antics for hours...I have to say that HATED is definitely one of the most entertaining docu's I've ever seen. It could have been a little more indepth  but it covered most of the topics and origins of Allin and his band in an acceptable manner. Definitely essential viewing for any G.G. fans or fans of subversive punkrock or doculovers in general...910".

He does not try to express himself with words like any animal who can speak would do or to express himself clearly like any human with some sense would do. He uses nearly exclusively body language and in that body language only one side of the picture the gross and the gore the dirty and the bloody. Punk they say? Punk they have the right to say. But G.G. Allin demonstrates if it is necessary to do so that he as a punk rocker with a death wish is an exhibitionist an aggressive and violent person a literal steater a true psdrinker and a self petaster. So what! So nothing. So not much. The death wish is no longer only a death wish in him. It is also a death instinct because he not only wishes death but he is cruelly violent against other people. If he really believes a body is a rock and roll temple his vision of the temple is particularly dilapidated. It is Stonehenge after a gang of looters armed with twenty bulldozers have been on the site for a fortnight. Look at his temple at his body out of shape due to no exercise extreme alcoholism drug addiction of all types and kinds not to speak of his idea that the body is like paper to be scribbled on I guess. There is no explanation in this very superficial film. And there is no real presentation of his music. It is more some kind of selfsatisfying review of this annihilating and nihilistic antiart attitude on what is not even a stage but just a piece of floor in some kind of back room. Punk for sure but without the music or without the political anarchism. Just some scatological provocation as if a provocation was enough to be considered as art in the simple fact that it is a provocation or as politics in the simple fact that is outside all norms. Too bad and what's more he did not even hold his promise to commit suicide on stage. He simply died of an overdose. What a flop! What a let down!

People who were unfortunate enough to go to one of his shows were usually treated to a music set piece for about 20 to 45 minutes and then all hell would break lose and GG Allin would then go around attacking audience members raping women defecating on stage and then throwing mutilating himself with weird and sharp objects and stripping naked and putting all sorts of different things into his anus. There would usually be semiclose riots and chaos with a lot of people leaving within seconds and the shows would end in a mess of blood and feces with GG Allin usually getting arrested. GG Allin had a concert one day that GG Allin had threatened to kill himself on stage during. On the actual day of the concert GG Allin ended up almost getting arrested by the cops when a riot broke out at the concert the wide spread confusion was put aside by GG Allin who ran naked through the streets of New York at twilight. He took shelter at a friend's apartment and overdosed on heroin. He died and was buried in Littleton New Hampshire which is around 80 miles away from my house. This concert has been generously recorded and transfered to this DVD as a bonus feature. This documentary mostly explores the last tour that he was involved with with his then ban The Murder Junkies but the documentary also is about some of his friends and his excesses that usually came with his musical numbers. His concerts are truly a sight to behold. These concerts consist of a true form of chaos that people usually only imagine when listening to songs. What amazes me about GG Allin is that he was able to channel this chaos from his music into a reality. With his acts of mutilation anal penetration feces throwing and his random outbursts of violence GG Allin has been able to transfer all the insufferable confusions that we have as teenagers and express them into totally outrageous facades and events. This documentary is not only able to show us these quirks including one deeply memorable sequence that occurs on his birthday which has also been generously included on this documentary but it is able to give us a kind of music icon that could probably never be translated into a modern day mainstream punk rock band. What the film also is able to give us at the same time is a question that all fan boys of punk rock should ask themselves. Is this what punk rock has come to? Where is the talent? Where is the musical genius that speaks to us? This film is able to show us that all of our expectations of rock and punk rock can be sworn on in new music that will never have half the guts that GG Allin had. I highly recommend this amazing and well crafted documentary if that means anything to you...".

He takes every possible degration and humiliation and makes it his life's blood. The interviews with his brother friends and former band mates are a great source of information but the interviews with Allin himself will grab your attention the most. He reeks of desperation patheticness and anger. He was a man who could actually claim he had no morals and meant it all the while you may find yourself not being able to help but feel sorry for him.

Yes Hatred contains all that but director Todd Phillips doesn't concentrate on those antics but rather takes it as part of the package. His real focus is on the people mainly GG himself his band The Murder Junkies musicians like Dino the naked drummer and supporters like Unk who both come across as bizarre real and unpretentious at the same time.As for GG's music you won't find any hidden classics among Allins repertoire. This isn't a documentary about a forgotten genius like the Roky Erickson documentary You're Gonna Miss Me in fact apart from some song and concert fragments there's preciously little music in Hatred. Allins music was a mix of simple noisy Punksongs with touches of country music the lyrics laden with obscenities and a misanthropy that few other bands have matched.

Film also takes time out for revealing interviews with childhood friends of Allin fans Allin's high school teachers Allin's relatively articulate brother Merle and one humorously disgruntled exbandmate.If you've never heard of or seen Allin before he's basically this punk rocker whose act is a literal assault on the audience. He plays naked cuts himself defecates onstage and rolls in it vomits onstage attacks members of the audience and is attacked. It can be quite jarring to watch a GG show even from the relative safety of one's own living room. There's the twitchy sensation that he is erasing any boundaries between performer and audience and the sense of danger becomes very real and scary.This film presents a somewhat onesided view of Allin I think. We see him in ragemode basically. I used to frequent mondo video in LA a year or two after Allin died and they had practically a library of concert footage on the guy. The people who worked there said he came in often and was just a mellow guy. It was when he got booze or drugs inside him that he became wild.Director Phillips does a very good job of chopping his footage up for maximum potency. And anyone doubting Todd Phillips' bravery need look no further than this footage or to his brilliant incendiary banned HBO documentary Frat House about fraternity hazing.Unfortunately Phillips doesn't dig too deeply into what may have caused Allin's crazed behavior. We hear a little about his abusive dad but not nearly enough.Perhaps the best footage on the DVD is the bonus feature which shows GG's last show in NYC and it truly is disturbing stuff. Allin is frighteningly whackedout on drugs and the camera follows him nonstop as he sings a song then goes berserk when the sound cuts out. He attacks the venue and several people in it then spills out into a NYC street naked bleeding and covered in feces runs around the streets for a time generally being wild. Pretty great footage.Good documentary".

Of course some people will say that Allin was just a freak show without much talent but I'll let the viewer make up their own mind. Some of the stuff that Allin did was very shocking including performing naked as well as pooping himself and performing in it. His final concert has become somewhat legendary in its own ways and that too is covered here.This is certainly a very entertaining film but there's no doubt that it's main goal was to show Allin and expose him tot he wolrd. Who know what would have happened had Allin lived and not died during the postproduction but as it stands this is a fitting look at his life career and death.".

Of course some people will say that Allin was just a freak show without much talent but I'll let the viewer make up their own mind. Some of the stuff that Allin did was very shocking including performing naked as well as pooping himself and performing in it. His final concert has become somewhat legendary in its own ways and that too is covered here.This is certainly a very entertaining film but there's no doubt that it's main goal was to show Allin and expose him tot he wolrd. Who know what would have happened had Allin lived and not died during the postproduction but as it stands this is a fitting look at his life career and death.";

The lack of chain of command team work and camaraderie in the tank is not credible. Tankers do not and cannot work this way. The only realistic moment is when Herzel Oshri Cohen shouts at the rest of the crew that they are going to get him killed because of their inability to function.And for those that thought that peeing in the ammo box was shockingly realistic not so. In a Centurion tank you use a used canon shell casing so that you can throw it out though the shell loading portal without the need to open a hatch.I also served in Lebanon from 19851987 in an IDF tank.".

The mission commander appears to be the only 3D character as a softer side is revealed after the tank's crew hack his communications with HQ.The concept of filming the outside world through the tank's gun sight may have seemed like an innovative concept to the director but I just found it rather annoying especially after the tank gets shot up and the outside world appears to be moving through a massive hall of mirrors.A film that should have pulled the viewer into the claustrophobic tension inside the tank and captured the uncertainty prevalent in the hostile environment outside instead provides brief snatches of tension within the tank that never properly build to a climax and a montage of seemingly unconnected suburban war scenes that fail to convey the true nature and meaning of the Lebanese conflict. Whilst it is possibly unfair to compare any other film against such a fine movie as Hurt Locker I guess one needs a reference point and the two films have after all been mentioned in the same breath.Lebanon doesn't come close to replicating the gritty tensionfilled atmosphere that Hurt Locker creates which is a shame  because I do feel that if the three ingredients mentioned in the first paragraph above had been correct it really could and should have done.".

Anyway it's probably the best war picture I've ever seen as I already hinted in the title.You see the problem with war pictures is that many times they're just not good enough but when they're too good they reach a level of entertainment that makes me as a viewer enjoy the war and find it pleasurable even if it wasn't the director's intention. Take Apocalypse Now for example or Full Metal Jacket  Those movies show the Vietnam War as some sort of a spectacle which makes the viewer enjoy the war when he should despise it.What makes Lebanon so unique is that the movie is impressive and beautiful as a work of art but in the same time it succeeds in featuring war as so horrible that you feel disgusted and amazed in the same time.I don't know. Maybe the fact that I served in the Israely Artillery Corps affects my judgment. When you serve inside a cannon which resembles too much the tank shown in the movie with all the claustrophobia and disorientation involved it might be much easier to relate to such a movie.Anyway this movie is not perfect. It falls to some clichs sometimes and the acting of Oshri Cohen tends to get on my nerves but the camera work is flawless and the direction mostly is superb.I saw another comment here which said that movies like Bofor and Waltz With Bashir which deal with the Lebanon War as well were much better because they show the background stories of the characters shown but I don't thing Lebanon needed such stories. It was good enough to show the traumatic reactions of scared young soldiers who just want to go home in the face of war.This movie is not trying to say what is right or wrong. It simply gives you the sour taste of war as it is. I generally dislike films that feel me with anger sadness nausea or grief but in this case the movie was so good and important I feel proud I saw it.I think everyone should see this movie. Really. It's not an easy one and it's not perfect but it's REAL. Too close to reality I might add. But still. Strong and magnificent cinema.".

This movie is yet another almost shockingly implausible offering from the school of cinema that keeps trying to portray Israeli soldiers as ultrasensitive conscript victims of an uncaring brutal and faceless military leadership in Israel's frequent wars and it's wearing thin. There have been skillful and plausible examples of the Israeli soldier's reality the past such as the animated powerful Waltz with Bashir but Lebanon is so keen to apologize for the ordinary Israeli soldier that it inadvertently makes him into an object of scorn. At least we hope it is inadvertent.The tank crew appear unrealistically to be strangers to each other and to be incongruously devoid of the very necessary tanker's padded headgear they get their heads banged so much inside their tanks that Canadian tankers call themselves zipperheads due to the frequency of receiving stitches in their skulls and the Israeli tank commander falls apart so fast under fairly basic human relationships with his subordinatesnever mind contact with the enemythat we are forced to question the competence of the IDF in putting such dysfunctional and undisciplined individuals and fighting units into battle. After all Lebanon was very much a war of choice for Israel in comparison with the choiceless desperation of the Yom Kippur War you'd think the IDF forces would be both more trained up for the Lebanon incursion and worthier in the eyes of the movie makers of basic appreciation for the military effectiveness of their conquest of south Lebanonquarrels with the political and humanitarian aspects of the conquest notwithstanding.What I find most ironical are the favourable comparisons with Das Boot the claustrophobic and multilayered epic story of a German UBoat's harrowing mission late in WWII. The UBoat crew were never portrayed as anything but trained and disciplined submariners encountering the real tests of warfrom endless tedium to the horror of seeing their victims perish to the basic terror of becoming the hunted. But they always conducted themselves as disciplined military folknot as ideological Nazisand they met their challenges not as damaged or incompetent people but as challenged military personnel. Therein lies a fundamental difference between Lebanon and Das Boot. Another problem I had was the incongruous use of the tank's periscope to provide the only perspective on what was going on outside the tank. I can understand an independent camera operator focusing and dwelling on the civilian horrors going on in a combat zonepresumably to make an antiwar point but to ascribe such focus to a tank gunner in a combat situation verges on the ludicrous and is at the least implausible.I think the movie fails ultimately because it does not do justice to its subjects or its subject. We are left with a feeling of being clumsily manipulated through personality stereotypes and a fanciful interpretation of how soldiers actually behave in war.".

Finally there is a movie that portrays the soldiers as what they really are  human beings. I believe the comment left by the person who was disappointed by the movie comes from a very naive place. It is very easy to think that all soldiers are robotic with one aim  to shoot the enemy but to understand the complexity and the mixed emotions a 19 year old boy who just finished high school and was thrown into this situation with no warning feels as he begins the first day of a war is virtually impossible unless you see it through the eyes of someone who has actually witnessed the horrors of war in this situation. The acting was very good and gave a real feeling of Israeli persona and brotherhood. It is realistic and unbiased  shows both left and right wing behaviors. It is not an easy movie and it really captures the feelings of the characters in a way you can not escape.".

Outside they find themselves out of reach of their own army in hostile territory and inside after taking damage to the tank they lose all training and organization among themselves. Will they survive? Comments A movie that has gotten a lot of praise and good reviews. I can't see why. There is no real coherent story no real understanding of what is happening in the bigger picture but that's not really the point anyway. The point if I might guess is to show that everyone is a victim in a war both and this might sound bad but bear with me those who get shot at and those who shoots at them. In Lebanon we get to see the latter's point of view.The point is to show a crew under extreme pressure and finally cracking under it. But as the movie is rather short and the director is too impatient to get to his point there is no real time to build any pressure to speak of. So when the crew is instantly breaking down mentally without much pressure instead of showing the horror of war it just gets annoying. At best the crew seem poorly trained at worst I won't say. I can't sympathize with the or the movie.Unfortunately there are some annoying details as well. One is the water inside the tank. They must ration water but the tank is almost flooding at the same time. Also am I really to believe that the grenade that heavily mutilated the driver left all his chickens undamaged? And their tank seem easier to get into than checking into an hotel  and that is in a supposed war.Unfortunately the final verdict is that I just don't buy it. The ambition is commendable the idea is good. But ideas are not enough.Rating Four damaged tanks out of ten.".

However Das Boot seems like a 4000 square foot condo next to Lebanon's 600 square apartment so much more room does the sub seem to have with walking and just standing upright. Comparisons also have been made with last year's Oscar winner The Hurt Locker. Their minimalism has much in common but Hurt Locker gives richer characters and more breathing space.The conflicts in Lebanon besides the grubby grueling tank interior include the choice of shooting the enemy or not. The Solomon choices of blasting or not a car with passengers a farmer's truck and a young boy are dramatically intense. Also when a Syrian prisoner is taken the choice of how to treat him is not so easy because a supposedly helpful but devious Phalangist Christian Arab may want to torture him unbeknownst to the Israelis.The close up camera work is expertly done as it invites the audience to look while being repulsed at the same time not an easy cinematic feat. The first and last shots of a sunflower field are another ironic touch.This is a film to help us understand the harrowing life of soldiers and the ambiguous morality of war.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would have given this a one star but in the end I don't want to discourage someone from making a real movie about this genre. This has got to be the worst tank crew in the history of armored warfare. Now I know some IDF tankers personally. They consider themselves elite. The general IDF conscripts are sometimes bad but not the Armored Corps or their paratroop units. Their bravery and skill defended their borders against much larger and desperate tank assaults from Egypt Jordan and Syria. Sometimes simultaneously. This crew couldn't hold back a team of boy scouts armed with slingshot. I am going to see if they'll comment on this but this movies is an insult to that bravery.First off this no one obeys orders. The gunner is a coward who follows his own troops with his gun sight camera trick use d to film the action I know but it totally fails in that it is not what he's supposed to be doing at all and searching for targets. When he is presented with a target not once does he actually fire on command. I am not debating his target opportunities those were so clich and predictable I wanted to turn the movie off.A commander is supposed to be looking for targets and leading the tank. Two things he does not do during the entire movie. The loader is insubordinate to the point where I was hoping someone would just shoot him or at least kick his ass.After a while I wanted the Captain Jamil to just shoot them all and I could not blame him in the least for what he did.Too many other unbelievable things going on here. What tank commander allows just anyone to open the hatch. First off you can't unless someone inside unlocks it. You can't just walk up to a tank on a battlefield and open it like a car. Second. I want to be in that tank. They had enough room for a prisoner interrogator and at one point a dead body? Who allows that?! Put it on the outside in a Body bag or under a blanket. Jeez. They had so much extra room they could put a bloody body in there ? That had to be the biggest turret I've ever seen. I actually felt like moving in they seemed to have enough space. I did not feel claustrophobic at all. The crew's treatment of the tank should have been a court martial offense. Throwing trash on the floor rounds lying in the oilwater mix crap everywhere. You don't leave junk or trash lying all over your Armored Vehicle. A There's no room and B you don't want that junk to get in your way when your fighting.Finally the reflective or contemplative camera style of just leaving the lens on an object for 510 minutes at a time especially at the beginning was sooo annoying I had a hard tome not hitting the FF button just to get through it.Bottom line see a movie like The Beast if you want to see tank crew action. Even Denzel does a good job in his Courage Under Fire movie. Skip this it has not point no action and no logic. This was not anywhere near and accurate representation of the war of fighting men in a tank of anything really. What a waste of a great topic for the sake of Art.".

And at the very least they would turn you over to the Military Police for court martial which I assure you would be equal to prison time and kicked out of the forces in disgrace! Also the tank turret is so small there is no room for casualties or prisoners so that is a bit of BS. Further the ready load ammunition for a typical tank is around 20 rounds with another 20 to 30 rounds stored in other ammo bins around the tank so having only nine rounds avail is crazy and could put your lives in danger! The squabbling and philosophizing would not occur with a highly trained tank crew! To compare this laughable attempt at the portraying of a tank crew to the one of the most definitive and outstanding movies of any war every produced Daz Boot is totally laughable and downright stupid!

	schema:headline " Vivid and visceral but not the best of the Lebanese war films";
	schema:reviewBody "The film presents a concentrated and specific indictment of war through presenting innocent and unwilling young men who are unquestionably brave under fire but virtually helpless in a dicey and deteriorating situation. Such an antiwar arc is more effectively used in Bernard Wicki's extraordinary 1959 German antiwar film Die Brucke also about a doomed squad of young men because the latter provides fuller backstories for each man. Maoz's young actors are vivid and believable. Shmulik Yuav Donat Assi Itay Tiran Hertzel Oshri Cohen and Yigal Michael Moshonov the crew Jamil Zohar Staruss their arrogant and hitherto unfamiliar superior officer or their Syrian captive Dudu Tassa and the several others are all good. But they only appear to us in the tank as the operation begins it all takes place in a few hours and there is no time to provide backstories they are appealing but somewhat generic.Despite his personal experience 25 years ago in the 1982 war some of Maoz's writing falls prey to clichs of the oversensitive rookie the brusque superior officer the insistence of bodily needs and so on. A lot of the dialogue seems stagy even though this staging trumps anything you could do in a theater.'Lebanon' is nonetheless a superb piece of filmmaking and no mere tour de force because it all takes place within a tank but DP Giora Bejach as Maoz puts it was two photographers depicting the events inside but also shooting through the tank's sights so we see the world outside as the crew sees it including several devastating scenes in which Lebanese civilians are ravaged humiliated and killed  in particular a mother Raymonde Ansellem keening over her dead little daughter whose dress catches fire leaving her naked. This is far more shocking than any of the provocations in Lars von Trier's 'Antichrist' which seem contrived and calculated in comparison. Lebanon is very fine in its resolution of the problem of the claustrophobic setting. The film exposes the Israeli violation of international law. The tank crew is told that a town has been bombed and their job is to accompany troops who are going in to wipe out anyone left alive in it. The commander repeatedly orders the bomber to use white phosphorus bombs but says they're illegal so they will call them flaming smoke. Action in the tank is specific and compelling. These guys are little more than boys. The newest member is the gunner. He admits he's shot only at barrels before this and when the time comes to shoot he can't pull the trigger with disastrous results. What happens when you're in a tank and can't leave it but it becomes disabled in enemy territory? In 'Lebanon' you find out.I differ with Derek Elley's view in VARIETY that this film is superior to 'Beaufort' and 'Waltz with Bashir.' Both provide a a larger context on the war the visceral vividness of the young men's experience doesn't compensate for this lack. I'm also surprised VARIETY says this film has the least to do with Lebanon per se and could be set in any tank any country. Mr. Elley seems to have forgotten about the Lebanese civilians as well as Arabicspeaking terrorists the IDF term for the enemy who are very vividly seen in this film and not in the two others both of which however are excellent films. They're all good and all have severe shortcomings as views of the Lebanese war.Maoz won the Golden Lion in Venice for this directorial debut. Sony will distribute the film in the US. Seen as a part of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Lebanon' starts in a beautiful endless sunflower filed under a scorching sun. It is the last time we see open space and sunlight until the very end of the film.The rest of the action happens in the close space of a tank in the first days of Israel's war in Lebanon in 1982. A team of four soldiers is sent in action with a paratroopers company and we soon realize that they are not really heroes stuff. The commanding officer lacks experience and he will crack psychologically under the stress. The driver dreams only to his parents and how to return home and does not really master his mechanical devices. The gunner never saw action before and he freezes at the first encounter with the enemy causing the death of a paratrooper. The most experienced soldier is the gun loader he is two weeks before discharge but we know that he will spend many more months and maybe years in the army as this war lasted long.Soon things go wrong. The company officer is the typical army brute speaking in slogans hiding information giving controversial orders. They soon lose completely their sense of orientation and find themselves in enemy controlled territory. The tank is hit they hardly escape death and the only meaningful order they get is 'you can improvise'.The film is a beautiful exercise of cinema and this is the main reason it got the Golden Lion in Venice and may gather more trophies in the future. The whole action happens in the claustrophobic environment of the tank which somehow resembles the fortification in another Israeli film inspired by the Lebanon war  'Beaufort' but is more sordid dirty unbearable. The outer world is permanently seen through the lens of the targeting optical device it looks like a target and is indeed a world of destruction ruins and death but the balance of forces is not clear as the the threat comes for the soldiers in the tank from outside so to some extent they are also a target in a game that can turn deadly at any moment.In the original aesthetics of the film lies its quality but more was needed to make this film a full and consistent work of cinema. What is missing is a more clear delimitation of the psychology of the characters. The director and the actors intended to show a team of normal young men put in impossible situations in a place where they do not want to be and where no normal human beings want to be. However they could not fill appropriately the 90 screen minutes that our heroes spend in the enclosure and they resorted sometimes to clichs dialog and character stereotypes that do not match the expressiveness of the few good minutes of wonderful camera work.I liked less 'Lebanon' in comparison with the other two Israeli films made in the previous years about the war. It certainly does not have the novelty of language and genre of 'Waltz with Bashir' and not even the crisp quality of the cinema and characters building in 'Beaufort'. It has a powerful antiwar message which can be read as not only opposing a specific war but any war that obliges people face impossible situations. The concept and cinema language are original but characters development does not completely fit the ambitions.At the end of the film the tank finds somehow its way out of the encirclement. For the first time we see the tank filmed from outside all over the film we saw only the interior. One of the soldiers rises out in the light of the sun. He finds himself in the sunflower field that we saw in the first sequence of the movie. The cinema exercise is over.".

I literally was on the edge of the couch I usually lay back on while watching movies and it takes a fair amount to get me on that edge.Lebanon may not be perfect but it's perfectly good. I could find no fault with it and didn't even try. It sucks you in from the minute it starts. The very fact that you NEVER LEAVE THE TANK is amazing. If you are even remotely claustrophobic maybe you shouldn't watch this movie. You might be in your own home in a spacious room with windows and everything but once you get into this movie you feel like you're with the crew and they won't let you out until the end.I won't say more primarily because as simple as the story line is it's a complex movie and to say much would say TOO much.".

The first question was whether there are any autobiographic elements in the film and the very simple modest and direct answer was that the director was itself part of the tank crew the gunner maybe the most tragic figure in the film!".

	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Samuel Maoz has created in his film LEBANON a statement about war we are not likely to forget. Based on his own experiences this film about the Israeli Invasion of Lebanon in June of 1982 the first Lebanon war internalizes the responses of young soldiers sent on a mission that should have seemed simple but became anything but simple. The reason the film's message is so strong is that it forces four young virginal soldiers in a tiny enclosed atmosphere where they must by proximity depend on each other to confront the whole question of the validity of war. It is exceptionally powerful. A solitary army tank and a small platoon of paratroopers are sent to assure that a hostile Lebanese town bombed by the Israelis is secure. In the tank are four soldiers  Shmulik Yoav Donat Assi Itay Tiran Hertzel the exceptionally handsome and brilliant Oshri Cohen and Yigal Michael Moshonov. They are not seasoned soldiers and what lies outside their protective tank is terrifying to them. Inside the tank is a claustrophobic filthy smoky and foul smelling space where the four soldiers are able to view the effects of war and their tenuous grasp on reality through only the periscope of the tank. Occasionally the lid of the tank is opened to drop in a casualty along with a moment of fresh air to breathe but basically these four men must grapple with the horrors of killing and destruction outside their tank. The aspects of human frailty that war exposes appear like autopsies on the minds and gradual mental deterioration that overtakes each of these vulnerable and emotionally unprepared young men. They may attempt humor but it is thwarted by the gore outside their iron shield of the tank where Lebanese soldiers attack and mothers suffer the loss of their children in the bombings and shootings of the little village. Maoz wisely places enough of the battle scenes outside the confines of the tank making the audience as shocked by the atrocities of war as viewed from the exterior as the restricted glimpses of that war available to the tank crew. This is most assuredly an antiwar film but rather than waving flags of attack and endless scenes of gore Maoz keeps it distilled and in doing so makes it even more horrific. The cast is brilliant delivering performances so well crafted that they linger in the minds eye long after the film is over. The haunting musical score is by Nicolas Becker and Benot Delbecq and the almost impossible cinematography is by Giora Bejach . In Hebrew Arabic French and English with subtitles. Highly recommended.

For another Romany family living close by the murder only serves to confirm their latent carefully repressed fears. Far away in Canada the head of the family decides that his wife children and their grandfather must join him as soon as possible. Living in fear of the racist terror that surrounds them and feeling abandoned by the silent majority the family tries to get through the day after the attack. By nightfall when darkness descends on the village the family pushes the beds closer together than usual. Yet their hope of escaping the madness proves illusory. Based on an actual series of killings in Hungary that claimed the lives of eight people in less than a year Bence Fliegauf portrays the pogromlike atmosphere which breeds such violence.

	schema:reviewBody "Some people seem not to have liked this film. After seeing it myself I read a strange halfsentence by a renowned film critic writing for an even more renowned international newspaper I will not give away the name of the person in question for his own benefit! declaring that Just the Wind was accompanied by an unbearable sluggishness and confusion.Such apparent misjudgment made me speechless at first but then I simply recalled my own viewing experience. Although very far away from the screen sitting just below the roof of the sumptuous BerlinalePalast there was never a second in which I was not absorbed by the action of the movie feeling actually very close to the characters and by no means indifferent or confused. After the screening was over I remember walking through the streets without a purpose just lost in thoughts and overpowered by a feeling of extreme sorrow for the fate of the protagonists and sheer helplessness against the ugly faces of racism.Csak a szl is a very quiet drama that slowly turns into a shout. In a little Hungarian village the last day in the life of a small Romani family is shown a family that only consists of the mother her two children and the grandfather because the head of the family has already emigrated to Canada a place to which the others will follow as soon as they have raised the money. They all try to live a fairly normal and discrete life at least the mother who is working as a cleaner in two different job places and the girl who is conscientious about the necessity of attending school whereas her younger brother is playing truant and prefers to play video games in the house of a neighborhood family or simply to roam about in the forest.The film was inspired by an authentic case of racist attacks in Hungary which took place a few years ago and in which eight people lost their lives in less than a year. But it tells a fictitious story in which the artist decides to concentrate on the chronological events however unimportant they may seem of an entire day from dawn to dusk. Soon we learn that a neighbor family has been killed without apparent motive just for racist reasons. The authors of the crime have not been found and the police is not much of a help either. On the contrary in the one scene where police agents are present we witness that at least one of them is a racist himself. It is therefore not surprising that the whole place is dominated by a pogromlike atmosphere manifesting itself by ugly little incidents such as when a bus driver obliges a Romani member to run a few extra metres because he did not stop the bus at the exact spot where she was waiting.However there is but a quiet rebellion against these visible signs of discrimination. It may be a climate of lingering fear that impedes action. For example when a girl is raped on the school toilet Anna the Romani girl will do nothing but silently steal away without denouncing anybody. Has she been raped too? When a little later her father asks her in a video internet conversation whether she is pregnant she leaves the question unanswered and can only speak about the fear that has invaded her.In another key scene a suspicious looking black car is slowly following Rio the boy. Rio halts and tries to hide behind some bushes unable to do anything else. His violent reaction comes out a little later when he is in the deep forest running alone cutting himself an aisle through the undergrowth. It seems to be something like a shout of despair an outcry against the overwhelming menace which sadly can only be heard by the film audience.As in Bence Fliegauf's previous film Womb nature symbolism plays an important role. But instead of the boundless sea we find here the forest as an area of limitation for the human spirit of which to break free seems to be an almost impossible task. And nobody on this planet should claim that he does not consider himself concerned. Speaking of Germany there is a recent series of neoNazi attacks against Turkish citizens whose swift clearing up was apparently impeded because of sheer negligence of the authorities so that Chancellor Angela Merkel had to publicly apologize.But then of course there is also the wind. When the family members are huddling against each other in bed at the end of the day and some noise is heard outside the mother tries to comfort them by saying that it is just the wind. And me in my cinema seat have got the strange thought that if the film ended just now everything would be just fine. But the world is not like that not even in the twentyfirst century in which the wind of racism is still around arbitrary and blind destroying the good nature of life and all the ambitious dreams that go with it.".

In addition to that I would recommend this film to all those who are fond of European cinema and who like to to feel something deeper while watching. If you're in search of a film that would merely entertain you then Just the Wind might not be the best solution.The thing I liked best in the film was the atmosphere. From the very beginning to the end I constantly felt as if I was near the main characters  sensing their steps in the fields their paths through the forest their thoughts while being quiet the uncomfortable fears of what might happen next. Although the film atmosphere is mostly awkward and unpleasant it makes you feel as if you were in the Roma family's shoes. It seems more realistic than artistic but also makes you think afterwards!I also have to refer to another review on this site I don't think anybody would gain a negative image about Hungary just because of watching this film. Every country has its crimes and its dark side and let's not forget this is a Hungarian film after all. It's courageous to shoot a film about the issue that still isn't solved in a society.Instead of portraying the Roma as a group which would probably bring up a broader debate to the plot the director focused on 3 individuals making you sense their humanity. I believe this is the strongest and the most realistic message he could include. Direct political comments are left out there are many silent parts of the film which leaves every conclusion up to the audience.".

	schema:headline " From Dawn to Dusk A Deterministic Tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Benedek Fliegauf's Just the Wind has divided its audience to lovers and haters. Some accuse the film for demagogy or creating black and white illusions while others praise the director's style and social sensibility. In all its simplicity Just the Wind tells what happens to a Romani family during one ordinary day the mother works as a cleaner in two shift works her daughter gets bored at school bench and her son skips school building a safe house in the woods. The only way out seems to be the father of the family who already lives in Canada. The children are anxiously waiting for them to move although there is really no reason to believe why things would be any better on the other side of the globe.The film begins with morning sunlight sparkling through treetops into dim space. In fact images of dawn fields woods water and dusk do reign the visual world of the film. To my mind it is astonishing how Fliegauf has managed to make everyday realism so utterly beautiful. There is even something neorealist in the camerawork. But as the film dazzles with its aesthetics it also horrifies with its content. The gloomy darkthemed mood of Just the Wind isn't however merely due to the shadow cast on the remote village by racist murders but also a consequence of efficient sound design and long takes that are framed in a distressingly narrow fashion. With his documentarylike approach Fliegauf not only highlights the authenticity of the milieu each scene takes place in natural setting and lighting but also the fact that this has actually happened. In addition the film manages to create such a tension which keeps in its grip and coerces the viewer into identifying with the bleak reality portrayed. The viewer must identify with the characters and experience for an hour and a half what they go through every single day. This mood which exhales misery is at times quite hard to bear but fortunately broken down every once in a while by lyric landscape shots which are both serene and soothing. In the cinematographic depiction created by handheld camera and deliberately improvised composition nature plays an integral role. It's an active part of the drama and especially the colors of green and yellow are continuously recorded to the spectator's consciousness. As an essential element in the film's aesthetics nature is however counterpointed with architecture of degradation which enhances the emotion of the beginning of an end. People live in shattered ruins where grownups are practically living dead. Trash rotten food castoff objects and flat coffee infiltrate through the screen to the sense organs of the viewer. In Just the Wind only the children are capable of brief moments of joy in this stark environment but at the same adultlike responsibility is constantly required.Noteworthy is also that Fliegauf doesn't idealize the Romani people not to the least extent. This is not a onesided portrayal. Fliegauf depicts a certain regression of alienation  the final stage of exclusion where people have been divided into friends and foes. After this guns talk. In a detailed manner the film shows how the society has itself created such conditions and furthers the worsening situation with its disregard action. Hence the darkness of the film is directly due to social reality and the circumstances emerging from it. The film doesn't answer nor preach. It only agitates and shows. The film asks why. As ominous elements culminate the film begins to show its true deterministic nature how the darkthemed drama inevitably leads to an uncompromising disaster.".

Of course the integration of the gypsy minority is a big problem here but Benedek Fliegauf's film has got nothing to say about it. The director doesn't have a message he just portrays the life of a family he doesn't want to deal with any issues regarding the gypsies or racism. I mean for example Crash was able to show 67 sides of racism Fliegauf doesn't even wants to show one. The Hungarians majority are racist in this movie for no reason but in one scene there are gypsies attacking innocent people also for no reason so I wouldn't say it's one sided but the main problem is that everything happens for no reason revealing how shallow this film is. And because there are no thoughts to fill this movie with most of the scenes are a bit overdrawn. The lighting and the acting seems amateur but the overall quality of the movie is good.So by shallow I don't want to mean it's bad that's why I gave it a 7 out of 10 but this movie seems dumb compared to movies like Crash or Tropa de Elite.".

The handlers decide that Steven should support God and Country next. This leads to among other things a rock version of Onward Christian Soldiers and the inclusion of a Nazi salute to make it clear to the viewer how far the British population will be taken for love of God and Country under Steven's guidance.

His managers know this and there is no organization they will not sell him out to.The Church' in an act to attract more young members into its congregation hires Steve to convince the nation's youth to become Godfearing Christians. But this does not sit well with Steve who is becoming more cognizant of his surroundings through the help of a young artist played by sixties supermodel Jean Shrimpton. Privilege even though rarely shown is a surreal motion picture every film fanatic and music historian should seek out. With teenybop stars like Britney Spears Christina Aguilera Mandy Moore Jessica Simpson and NSYNC sprouting up like so many invasive weeds Privilege is very worthy of a second look.

Though nothing beats a free movie the guy running the whole thing introduced it as one that had been totally panned by critics never released on video etc. which didn't make it sound very promising. They also showed the short film Lonely Boy just before Privilege it's funny to hear Paul Anka's manager saying how no one will be as famous as Paul Anka ever again knowing that only two short years later The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan. The film society also said that the director of Privilege watched Lonely Boy repeatedly to get a feel for the mass hysteria and hero worship of teen idols.Privilege is about pop star Steven Shorter who has the teen population of Britain in the palm of his hand. Behind Steve however are the corporations and investors using him to control teens which is pretty scary to think about considering the same is very nearly true today. They decide everything for him his appearance what products he'll endorse the songs he sings and when he tries to break away and become an individual that's it. The investors withdraw their support and the show's over. Steve controlled the public so well that with just one speech he is able to turn the teens against himself.I liked this movie. Perhaps the reason it did so poorly when originally released is because it didn't seem relevant. Today it certainly is. The futuristic British society portrayed seems a bit of a stretch at one point the crowds chant We must conform! We must conform! but then so does the society shown in 1984 in my opinion. Find this movie if you can it's a great one and should be released on video!".

Paul Jones gives a wonderful performance as Steven Shorter possibly the most famous man in Great Britain. We watch his daily exploits as he's followed by a documentary crew that also narrates. Although Shorter is clearly in the vein of a mod from the mid1960's the film has aged quite well. The original songs are great PrivilegeSet Me Free was covered by Patti Smith in 1978 and the scenes of Shorter leading a fascistlike rally are still eerie perhaps an influence on the film PINK FLOYD THE WALL?. Another great scene deals with Shorter being conscripted into writing a Catholic rock song which anticipates how the organized Christianity of today tries to use rock as a way of converting people. Definitely worth watching. Hopefully it will finally get a proper home video release.".

	schema:reviewBody "The formerly preposterously rare two extant prints in the universe 1967 film Privilege has just been digitally restored in its original color and is now available on any DVD sales site.This matters for several reasons. Firstly because the film was as prescient as many consider Nostradamus to have been. Its plot considered so farfetched at the time that the film was oft labeled science fiction centers around an increasingly totalitarian government in a first world country that attempts social engineering at all levels including utilization of pop culture. It's hit on the formula to control youthful rebellion and dissent in general by investing a young pop idol with statesponsored power more in a minute as centerpiece of national obsession. EVERYONE cares about this particular pop idol and what happens to him every week since his act has been designed to attract universal sympathy and diffuse caring about one's self and one's own troubles. I'll not reveal how because the strange design of the first tour of his that viewers see is a revelation within itself.What he says what products he endorses and how he steers the populace into statesponsored trends and philosophies is a fait accompli in the film. The government notes a surplus of apple crops idol Steven is immediately shown eating lots of apples as now will the general populace. Got religion? Steven now does and you will too. It always works. You buy what he wears what he endorses. But what sort of personality would go along with being such a figurehead? And what sort of actor could even pull this messianic stardom off realistically since the film is made in documentary style? Luckily the answers are pretty good. The plot centers on the gradual breakdown of this personality as no one but an insane megalomaniac could keep this up forever his world of his every action micromanaged by others and every creative output predetermined for him. Not like....now in 2008! This person hired to quell all rebellion eventually starts to rebel against the statesponsored love. And the actor hired to be both this convincing a pop star and soul tormented practically to torpor was an actual rockgod Paul Jones the tall goodlooking blond singer of the Manfred Mann group of the mid60's if you recall the hearty voice on classic Brit oldies Do Wah Diddy and Pretty Flamingo. Privilege's director Peter Watkins known for terrifying all of Britain with the first realistic ultraviolent post nuclear apocalypse film The War Game knew how important casting is despite tradeoffs. Paul Jones was of the minute modern and could convey this fantastical idea of Orwellian government control through a pop star by being a credible pop star known at the time. His costar 1960's icon Jean Shrimpton playing the instigation of the star's rebellion was the most beautiful and famous model ever at that particular moment in history. The tradeoff was you believed them in their roles even if you didn't believe them as trained actors.It's not so much that they can't act more that both leads were directed to be underplayed a la Garbo you put your own reflections of the proceedings on their visages in contrast to the freneticism of Steven's fans and the steely controlling of his handlers. Suffice it to say their roles and performances well hold up today they are who they play and they look perfect.Jones is actually a compelling performer and great vocalist singing real as opposed to movie rock songs in this film. Pretty good rock songs too one was covered 25 years later by Patti Smith and Paula Pierce and The Pandoras which then sounded as modern as ever. Punk legends Chainsaw based their one ballad on the opening scene of Privilege. And Shrimpton! Even with purportedly wooden acting she remains a focus you cannot take your eyes off of. You instantly understand her visual domination of the first half of the 1960's and her incontrovertible allure.In fact it all holds up pretty well today and the film appears far more tellingly intelligent than it did when it was released and reviled enough to force its director to move abroad. It's been a lost cult classic ever since 1967 and with the recent release of Brian Wilson's lost Smile album finally completes gaps in the best of pop culture from the 1960's ironically so with its very indictment of pop culture manipulation gone totalitarian. Privilege feels more real and works better today in 2008 than when it was released forty one years ago. Check this treasure out! Her photographer mentorlover David Bailey and she were heroes to my generation for being their own personae and successes to boot the one of ours syndrome. A wrongly ascribed shyness was assigned to this her one acting role. In front of the still camera she was as extrovert as you can get confident dazzling and compelling. I'm a still photographer and I know what it takes for model to project something from within beyond the interaction of mere direction.She was ultrasuccessful but not well remunerated as the book Model which explored the various decades of the profession pointed out only models after the mid70's became millionaires as the business changed along with the agencies and licensing practices. She even verifies this without bitterness. Folks question why she seemingly dropped off the face of the earth Cornwall actually. Lastly people who were successful in their aspirations but not necessarily in finances oftimes think in terms you might not suspect I've done it all firsthand I was at the center of the hurricane's eye I don't need to continue immersing myself in this business anymore and pretend to go along with the changes in fads I can happily go away and be at peace. This just makes heroes like Shrimpton and little known photographers like me artists not artiste manques.".

It was pretty ratty with a constant hiss on the soundtrack but at least it was shown. The idea of a pop singer turning into a national icon that transcends his commercial status is even more relevant today than in '67. The one major flaw of the film is Paul Jones' performance as the Singer Steve. He's just too dull and boring to be believed as the greatest Rock Star of All Time. See it if you can. And write those letters to Universal Studios and hope this gets released on video soon.".

A voice over announces it's Britain in the near future and Stephen Shorter messianic rock god is thrown over a barrier  dragged into a cage and harassed by sadistic warders much to the disgust of his captivated female audience of all ages . The background music of discordant guitar feedback changes to one of a synth with a guitar rift and Stephen bursts into a song that will have you playing air guitar and tapping your toes . In short the music is by far the best thing about the movie So what's wrong with the rest of the miss en scene ? Peter Watkins insists on directing in the Italian Neorealist style which while very popular amongst European film makers in the late 1940s and early 1950s  And not to mention amongst European film critics in the 1960s  is a style of film making that didn't catch on in mainstream cinema . It worked fine in Watkin's previous work like CULLODEN and THE WAR GAME but these were precursors to what we now call  docudramas   the only time we see a natural home for the Italian neorealist style . It should also be mentioned that the shots of weeping teenage girls gnashing their teeth and running their hands through their hair could only have come from the 1960s and isn't there something laughably ridiculous having women in their late middle age drooling over a music god ? Do the words  Monty  and  Python  and  Sketch  spring to mind ? As the story continues there's something of a lack of internal continuity to this scene . You see both the state and the church want to use the popularity and charisma of Shorter to control the population for their own end  in short to make popular music in general and Stephen Shorter in particular the new opiate of the masses . If that's the case then why have Shorter portray himself as the angry young man and rebel in the start of the film ? Wouldn't that give rebellious youth a few ideas that the state would prefer them not to have in the first place ? There are a few more ridiculous scenes in the movie with pride of place going to the monks recording Onward Christian Soldiers . You can't help thinking this movie influenced Palin  Cleese  Chapman and co to start up a comedy troupe These criticisms are noticeable but shouldn't be used as a weapon to attack the film as being a schlock movie or meaningless . Let's not forget if Bush and Blair want to be seen doing good in the world then all they have to do is call a press conference and have Bob Geldof and Bono talk about AIDS  starving babies and third world debt and the link between Nuremberg rallies and present day rock concerts is presented very well  it's just that you're never entirely convinced an Illuminati would never need to pull strings in order to bring about fascist regimes or fundamentalist theocracies because these type of societies come about via more obvious methods PRIVILEGE was a film that was supposed to make a star out of Paul Jones and put Watkins on the map as Britain's most important film director . Unfortunately due to the rather heavy handed story which suits the director's style it caused a lot of distributors in both Britain and the United States to either refuse to show it or confine it to very limited release which meant very few people saw it . It's also a film that very rarely crops up on network television either  to my knowledge Channel 4 last showed it 20 years ago which is a great pity because this deserves to be at least a cult classic whatever its flaws and for music fans who have bought Patti Smith's Easter album just wait till you hear Jones perform the original Set Me Free".

Well what she was saying is that real acting has real energy  which the acting in Privilege lacks. There are some very good scenes however the ultimate being the outdoor rally which comes off as something from Hitler's Germany at the height of his political power. The rock versions of Onward Christian Soldiers and Jerusalem are great.Jean Shrimpton at one time was a worldfamous supermodel and a spectacular beauty. However her lush hair perfect bones enormous luminous eyes and leggy stature could not help her  she would have easily flunked out of the Copacabana School of Acting. Paul Jones is actually a very good actor and gets to show it in a couple of scenes but he was directed to have that empty vessel syndrome  where you're such a blank that an audience can infuse anything they want into you. It's a good true phenomenon  Greta Garbo was one such empty vessel  but it doesn't come off here.For people who remember the British mod era this will be of great interest.".

Steven Shorter is a charismatic pop star with mesmerizing influence over his young impressionable audiences. His stage performances use violence and brutality to cast him as society's victim and with powerful background music he whips devotees especially female into a frenzy. The emotional impact is not unlike the Beatles who coincidentally were at their peak in 1967 when the film was made. Shorter's opportunistic handlers however want to influence the youth of Britain with his cooperation and in an unholy alliance with the established church undertake a campaign to promote conformity and traditional values. However the campaign's launch coincides with Shorter's awakening desire to break free of his burdensome role and become an individual. In this struggle he is encouraged by the young artist who is painting his portrait.The original songs by Mike Leander and rock versions of Jerusalem and Onward Christian Soldiers are catchy and provide the movie's best moments. Unfortunately the film's stars do not match Watkins's ambitions. Paul Jones lacks a charismatic presence and fails to convince that he could move millions with his voice and image. Although Jones is only adequate as a dramatic actor the former lead singer of the group Manfred Mann manages the stage sequences quite well. However his nonsinging dramatics lack depth and are largely expressionless. Although Jean Shrimpton is astonishingly beautiful as Vanessa Ritchie the portrait artist her talents as an actress are woefully lacking.

Even the presence of two wellknown figures of the time did not seem to help this piece these being Paul Jones famous as front man for pop group Manfred Mann and Jean Shrimpton who is said to have been the world's first supermodel.Steven Shorter Paul Jones is the most dangerously loved entertainer in the world. Arriving back to the UK after a successful tour of America it is decided by the collection of his entourage that they need to change Steven's image from anguished rebel who in the opening song is beaten by prison guards locked in a cage and pleading to his hysterical fans to set him free to a bornagain Christian. That is to repent all of his sins to his adoring fans changing their attitudes making them fit for society. This culminates in a Riefenstahllike rally.Shorter walks through the film in a childlike way petulantly giving short answers and looking to the floor. In public and in photo shoots he visibly winces screwing his face up as if in severe distress or pain. He is utterly and helplessly controlled. A puppet used by the state by the Christian church. Vanessa Ritchie Shrimpton is commissioned to paint a portrait of Steven. So begins a dialogue between the characters as Vanessa attempts to break through the closed Steven and to teach him that there is more to the world he doesn't have to be a prisoner. The portrait we see later we are unaware if the piece is completed is haunting. Like Jones' character it is not complete the surface of the canvas marked but not whole.Directed by British filmmaker Peter Watkins it was a progression of his experiments mixing documentary and drama. Whilst working for the BBC Watkins made such a realistically and horrific 'docudrama' about a possible nuclear attack on Britain and the visceral effects of this that The War Game 1965 was immediately deemed too dangerous and horrible a programme that it was not shown until 1985. Later in 1971 Watkins released the Americanset Punishment Park which again plays with the conventions of both dramatic and documentary cinema to tell of a nottoodistant dystopian future where subversives are rounded up in detention camps and made to either surrender or to undergo major physical and mental forms of torture in the heat of the desert. Watkins is quite often particularly his earlier films prescient in the political landscape of the western world. Punishment Park could be seen to mirror recent events in our history Guantanamo Bay 'detention centre' springs to mind. Many would have to make this similar decision.Watkins has subsequently blurred line of drama and documentary further. His film La Commune 1999 about a collective of radicals during the FrancoPrussian war Watkins has the film crew interviewing the 'character's'. Whilst Privilege is not a perfect movie it certainly has it's charms. The film is also very funny at moments. This is provided by the eccentric cast of the popmachine entourage. British cinema was receiving a lot of international attention as the beginning of the 'summer of love' made the UK a focal point for fashion and popular culture. Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow Up 1966 and Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 also 1966 only perpetuated the 'CoolBritannia' philosophy of the time. I believe Privilege should have its place along with these and other BritishEuropean films of the time and remembered for being a wildly interesting and important British film  both sociologically and politically.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Although beset with production difficulties  traumas including the near death of the leading actress the film was an eventual triumph. Rarely seen today it still packs a punch if for no other reason than its splendid performances and the undeniable impact of its onlocation filming.Harry Carey giving one of the first great performances of the sound era is perfect in the title role. So well does he inhabit the character like a second skin that it is nearly impossible to imagine anyone else playing the part. Having already starred in innumerable silent Westerns he brings enormous physicality to a movie which made great demands on its actors. Carey looks  sounds like someone who's spent years in the veldt. The slouch of his hat the grim set of his eyes the rough growl of his voice are all just right.Handsome Duncan Renaldo as Horn's earnest young Spanish companion and exquisite Edwina Booth as a white tribal queen are both admirably suited to their roles. The sparks of their budding hesitant romance lightens the end of the film.Olive Golden Carey the star's wife is radiant in her very small role as a tough determined but saintly missionary the image of her seated in a sedan chair being carried through the jungle on her endless quest remains in the mind. Special mention should also be made of Mutia Omoolu as Horn's gun bearer  friend adding dignity and strength to his role he was rewarded with rare recognition alongside the other performers during the opening credits.Movie mavens will recognize wonderful old Sir C. Aubrey Smith appearing uncredited for a few moments at the end of the film in the role of an Irish trader.Director Woody Van Dyke liked working on location if possible and so MGM went to the greatly added expense of sending the entire company to Africa. Filming would take place in the Territory of Tanganyika the Protectorate of Uganda the Colony of Kenya the AngloEgyptian Sudan  the Belgian Congo. This proved a great boon to the picture giving it an authenticity not replicable in any studio back lot. The scenes of the actors beside a tremendous waterfall floating down a swollen river infested with hippos or interacting with native Africans are still sensational today.However the cast and crew were forced to live and work under appalling conditions for many weeks. Miss Booth one of the most beautiful actresses of the day caught a jungle fever' which left her deathly ill for years and effectively ended her film career. The attempts of the Studio to shut down the film after the company returned from Africa and lawsuits  demands for more money on the part of illused performers only added to the acrimony at the time. However from a vantage point of more than seventy years distance TRADER HORN has emerged as one of the great adventure movies and a prime example of the sort of film they just don't make anymore.'".

	schema:reviewBody "This early 1930s talkie is a fine jungle adventure in spite of its dated pedestrian look. A great white hunter takes his protg in tow and leads a safari through the African wilds braving wild animals and savage tribesmen in search of ivory. A major angle is a missionary's search for her longlost daughter who is now a white goddess living among a savage native tribe. Conflicts arise between Horn and his protg over the girl who has a wild feral animal attraction. The film has a great deal of exciting realistic footage of wild animals in search of prey and the attacks are recorded in detail. The hippos and crocodiles in the rivers make for some tense moments during the safari's canoe crossings as the party races for safety from pursuing natives. Harry Carey Sr. Duncan Renaldo and Edwina Booth star in this fine but unpolished feature which is introduced by a music score that is not heard again for the entire movie. The only other instruments of note being the foreboding percussive native drums during a juju when the tribes work themselves into a wild killing frenzy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woodbridge Strong Van Dyke 18891943 directed the MGM motion picture TRADER HORN in 1930 and later wrote a book about the production titled HORNING INTO Africa 1931. This was the first major Hollywood picture to shoot on location in Africa which in this case meant Kenya and the Belgian Congo. Van Dyke hired professional big game hunters Sydney Waller and Dicker Dickenson to provide both the action footage and the meat required for the film crew's daily rations.HORN starred Harry Carey Edwina Booth Aubrey Smith and Duncan Renaldo. Miss Booth who bravely agreed to wear the horrendous makeup required for her character ultrarealistic when you compare it to later lost white princesses like Sheena and the woman in JUNGLE GODDESS nearly died from a severe case of malarial fever caught while in the Congo. Van Dyke produced so much stock footage of African crocodiles wildlife and scenery that it was recycled for years in Hollywood films about the Dark Continent including the great MGM TARZAN movies starring Johnny Weissmuller and the incomparable Maureen O'Sullivan.TRADER HORN has been remastered and is an amazing document of Old Africa providing footage of local cultural life and a longlost wildlife paradise. Much of the natural history information given in the film the lead character gives his protg sort of a guided tour of the Serengeti is more accurate than that contained in most hunting books of the time. There are also some authentic hunting sequences as well as numerous staged battles like that between a pair of leopards and some hyenas.Incidentally the crew of TRADER HORN was widely blamed for disrupting the local economy at least by the colonials and at least as far as visiting photographers and filmmakers were concerned. The story goes that the production unit wanted footage of a particularly impressive East African tribal chief and offered him the sum of 40 pounds for the privilege. That amount was many many times the going rate and the local people immediately realized that they had been getting ripped off for years. MGM set the new price even twenty years later Masai and Samburu warriors were often demanding as much as 1 for a still photo and the colonials were still complaining about it.A remake of TRADER HORN was made in 1973. Starring Rod Taylor and Anne Heywood it was so bad that the studio almost canceled its release. It is particularly remarkable for Taylor's performance as an Englishman judging from his accent he was born in a quaint English cottage on the South Side of Chicago.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and you can see why this film caught the attention of the Academy at the time. For the same reasons that viewing live musical performances from 1970's TV don't excite in the age of the Ipod anyone who views this from the perspective of someone who has 247 access to Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel won't get what the big deal is of seeing Africa's wildlife on film. From today's standards the wildlife isn't even that clearly photographed. In 1931 though most people had never seen such sights.When I first saw the year this film was made and that it was a startling 123 minutes long for a film made in the early 30's I somewhat suspected I was going to be subject to some preposterous maudlin melodrama in the MGM tradition that went on forever but it is packed with action and has a very good story. The story involves seasoned African adventurer Aloysius Trader Horn Harry Carey taking Peru Duncan Renaldo 23 yearold son of an old friend on his first big adventure into Africa. Along the way they run into a missionary also a friend of Horn. She has been preaching among the natives and seeking the daughter that was stolen from her by the natives for twenty years. Soon thereafter Horn and Peru are captured by a group of natives led by a young white woman  presumed to be the daughter of the missionary woman. Horn Peru and their native gun bearer are slated for a horrible execution by the natives unless the young white girl intercedes on their behalf. If she does will the other natives even listen? And if they do listen how will our protagonists get back to the closest trading post without their guns which have been confiscated by their captors? Some of the language tossed around such as Trader Horn calling the African villagers monkeys will likely cause you to cringe but  again  you must remember this dialog is a product of its time. The film did show a surprising and touching camaraderie between Horn and his native gun bearer Rencharo.Also note the precode element in this film. Native women are plainly shot unclothed from the waist up which is probably very much based in reality. If this film had been made five years later that would not have happened. Of course even in the precode era this might be OK for the native savages but not for the grown white girl raised by them. She has a kind of makeshift fur top on that still shows a great deal but not everything.The film elements on this one are somewhat shaggy the contrast is poor and it cries out for restoration. In spite of all of this I still recommend it to fans of this era of filmmaking as a unique cinematic experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I took a chance on this with a purchase from one of the internet companies manufacturing DVDs from long out of print movie sources. This is a leisurely black and white film of two hours that peaked my interest on several occasions and kept me watching avidly for the entire course. The cast is great with Carey playing a tough huntertrader who nevertheless displays his tender moments as well. Renaldo apparently a Romanian at birth later became the Cisco Kid star of the television serial plays a likable young man. The lovely Booth who first appears as little more than a blonde animal slowly begins to get in touch with her feminine side as the movie progresses. I liked these people along with the stoic and dependable gunbearer. Filmed over seven months in just the right locations in Africa the crew was plagued by the hostile elements Booth became extremely ill as a consequence and two extras actually died one to a crocodile and the other to a charging rhinoceros. The movie therefore touched me personally and brought back old memories. In 1978 at the age of 23 the same age that Renaldo plays in the movie I spent six months in Africa first crossing the Sahara north to south then from north Nigeria into Chad and into the Cameroon Central African Empire Zaire and out through Uganda into Kenya. Judging from my experience I believe that much of the film took place in the Cameroon Central African Empire and northeastern Zaire Congo. My troubles were not with marauding tribesmen but with killer bees various revolutions sundry criminals millions of army ants bad water and scorpions etc. I personally attest that these are real Africans real African villages real animals and this authenticity including the native drums brought me back to my youth and life living on the ground in a small tent through similar villages and terrain. Three exciting phases in the film hit me hard all while in the native villages. When you are vastly outnumbered on somebody else's terrain and they are armed with spears and growing excited from the relentless throb of the drums you might count your life in seconds. Ah but it beats dying slowly behind a desk! You will flinch at several of the racist words in this film but will also recognize the love and respect between Carey and his gunbearer. Such emotions come easy between men who have each other's backs. Grab this film and sit back and enjoy without distraction!".

These stories by H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs as well as dozens of others now forgotten seem to have had a surprising and lasting life in early talking pictures TARZAN THE GREEN GODDESS SHE and countless serials all featured these mythic adventurers forgotten white gods and goddesses and black 'savages' both noble and bloodthirsty. Seeing TRADER HORN reveals that it was among the first and most influential of these movies so it's unfortunate that it is so little known today.That's no doubt due to its casual racism as well as the precode nudity on the part of the African women filmed on location. But TRADER HORN's naivet and breathtaking political incorrectness make it a rather fascinating primitive. There are other marks against it an overlong running time tooleisurely pacing wildlife photography that is often dull or in the case of the slaughter of a rhino and a lion sickening.But on the plus side Harry Carey's direct natural and gruff performance has been noted by others. I was far more interested in Duncan Renaldo and Edwina Booth. Renaldo was so personable and extraordinarily handsome  he looked like a prettier Don Ameche and from certain angles seems a dead ringer for a blackhaired Brad Pitt  that I was astonished to have never heard of him. He was certainly no great actor and yet he had a definite physical presence and was highly photogenic. His Hispanic accent must have been the primary impediment to a career in 'A' pictures. The in some ways legendary Edwina Booth turns out to have had a strong facial resemblance to Marlene Dietrich and like Dietrich she's not a very expressive actress. And yet she throws herself wholeheartedly into her portrait of a wild willful and childish White Goddess spitting out all of her dialog in unintelligible movie African. It's camp for sure but also a gutsy performance.And the scene in which Carey and Renaldo first meet Booth is memorable after appearing in their hut wearing only a monkey fur bikini and showing the kind of long lean cut body that contemporary taste demands she proceeds to have a shrieking tantrum while flogging every African in sight. When confronted by the gorgeous Renaldo she proceeds to whip him as well in a scene that obviously inspired a similar one in Clara Bow's CALL HER SAVAGE a year later while he simply smolders and hardens and she becomes aroused. It is a provocative scene of real sexual tension and something of a revelation.A bigger one is the fact that in plot and iconography TRADER HORN was an obvious influence on the far more famous and evocative KING KONG. Having grown up with Kong and Fay Wray I was shocked to be watching TRADER HORN for the first time only to note that Carey begot Robert Armstrong as Booth begot Fay Wray and Renaldo begot Bruce Cabot. Such are the random ways that imitation can sometimes unintentionally inspire great folk art.".

	schema:reviewBody "I note a number of misconceptions about this great old flick or maybe some viewers are missing a few things. Sure Harry Carey refers to some of the tribespeople herein as savages. But look on a daily basis they will kill you cook you shrink your head and eat what's left. If that isn't savage I'd like to know what is. The tribespeople pictured here aren't the Dead End Kids waiting for a weekly visit from their case worker. Yes Carey refers to his man Friday as a black soandso but the soandso comes off looking highly noble in the script and Carey pays him due tribute. As for Carey playing the part of a hardened Congo guide he does a mighty fine job of rendering a realistic character just as would John Wayne Charleton Heston or Clint Eastwood. In the War on Poverty days I could see some misguided soul casting Anthony Perkins in the role but it seems to me Mr. Carey does a superb job. Another reviewer remarked Carey falls in love with the rescued captive I disagree. Carey had pledged to protect her and return her to civilization. One person from whom he tries to protect her is the naive erotically smitten Duncan Renaldo Peru whose character is the opposite of Trader Horn's. Trader Horn knows what's out there and what to watch for Peru is a total newbie whose missteps could get everyone killed and cooked including himself. I think this film's characters story and production handily outdo any jungle flick made since then. Kinda scary too. So scary in fact and so real I wouldn't recommend it for the kiddies. Revisionist historians stay clear in 1931 this is really what Darkest Africa was like.".

For example the two whites and one native are about to be crucified upside down till the White Goddess steps in to save them. That would get an 'R' rating today! Vintage footage of Natives and wildlife in Africa is very real because it was filmed there. And the 'National Geographic' style topless natives are there too.Toward the end the white adventurer saves his wounded native helper and carries him away from danger. I mention this because I don't think we would see this in an American film in the 1930s. Also we see the native looking back like a spirit up in the clouds near the end. Interesting movie.I would like to see this film restored.".

So much so that for 20 years no American film company ever went back to Africa for location shooting until The African Queen and King Solomon's Mines. But so much footage survived that MGM was able to stock a series of Tarzan films and not put its players at risk the way Harry Carey Duncan Renaldo and Edwina Booth were.The plot is a skimpy one. Carey is your basic white hunter who is taking along a young friend Renaldo into some unexplored country in search of missionary Olive Carey's daughter. When they find her she's now the princess of a savage tribe. But one look at these two especially Renaldo makes her realize there are others who look like her. After that it's the three of them plus Carey's gunbearer on the run from the tribe and without weapons in the jungle.While American companies avoided Africa colonial powers like Great Britain shot films in Africa and did it because they knew what the hazards were and took precautions. The goring of a young native by a rhinoceros is real and captured on film and frightening. Director Woody Van Dyke kept his cast and crew loaded with gin and quinine. It still did not save Edwina Booth from a rare tropical disease which many thought killed her. I've always believed that was a deliberate publicity stunt by MGM because Ms. Booth was through with show business after this shoot. Who could blame her?The first half of the film is a travelogue on safari. At the time this was great stuff for the American moviegoing public. Still no studio wanted to face the expenses MGM had during Trader Horn's shooting.".

The Pygmy Efe segment is from the Ituri Forest in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo and besides being very remote and hazardous was and still is an unhealthy area. As recent as 2003 marauding rebels were seizing Pygmy hunters and eating them according to the U.N. Uganda Tanganyika Tanzania and the southern Sudan were rampant with Malaria and a number of production crew fell ill with it. The Tse Fly was the bearer of Sleeping Sickness and prevalent in these areas as well as the Kenya Colony where some filming took place.Although the plot is lacking by today's standards the commitment to film in these areas was a major attempt to show the real Africa of its time along with footage of it's indigenous Flora and Fauna. Due to this diligence today we have a timed photographic encapsulation of these areas available to the general public which is not readily accessible elsewhere.".

Booth is almost scary as the tribal white girl twisting her angular features into grotesque shapes that few Hollywood glamour girls would dare risk. However the makeup man feminizes Renaldo with enough eyeliner to embarrass Estee Lauder. I realize he needs to be attractive enough to turn the white goddess around but in the process he's been made pretty rather than safari handsome.One thing to note is the centrality of sound to the drama. The roar of that spectacular waterfall impresses as do the native drums and tribal hubbub. Perhaps the sound track is heightened because of the newness of the technology 1927 but it does add a lot.As a Third World document however the movie's very much a creature of its timethe casual slurs the buttkicking the girl's sudden preference for the white world.

'Tarzan the Ape Man' is not among the best of the Weissmuller Tarzans nor can I say of 'Trader Horn' that in itself it is a great movie by any standards.Trader Horn is an experienced trader on the African savannas and takes his young sidekick Peru on an extended journey to show him the wildlife and the fauna of his home in the wild. After being caught by a hostile tribe they escape with a white young girl who was abducted when she was a baby and both Trader Horn and Peru fall in love with her.Yes it is very simplistic no more than a pitch for a cartoon really. Trader's education of his young proteg is much too didactic to bring any kind of life into any work of fiction but we do get to see a lot of exotic animals which in 1931 would have been more than enough point. The film overall is brought down by Harry Carey's strangely unsympathetic portrayal of Trader. It is not so much his racism that was a given in Western movies at the time no escaping it but Carey's Trader is sullen and meanspirited and condescending to each and everybody you tire of him quickly. And I got very severely fed up with his way of always addressing Peru as 'lad' or 'boy' in this fake Irish accent. Peru played by dazzling young Spanish actor Duncan Renaldo is nothing if not sweet transcending matinidol cuteness and you forgive him his delighted outburst They are not savages they are just happy ignorant children! So watch it and appreciate its historical impact. Just don't expect a serious contender to any of the later and infinitely better adventure yarns.610".

I suppose if you want to see stereotyping you can but I saw both the good and the bad exhibited by these tribes. To know that they traveled in 1930 to do all this on location is quite amazing. The wildlife footage is the main focus of our films beginning. It feels very nature show but feels a different reality than the nature shows of today. The brutality of nature and of mans very real slaughter of creatures in this film may bother the squeamish. Truly ground breaking film for 1931.".

Obviously it was made under difficult conditions for the filmmakers not only were on location in Africa but also had to haul around all that bulky new sound equipment. Under the circumstances technically it's pretty impressive. It's so casually racist and sexist it might have come from another planet not just another time and place. Showing barebreasted native women a la National Geographic is no problem since evidently they were considered subhuman and if there's no way to convincingly fake shooting a rhino by God they shoot a rhino. The first half is part leisurely Wild Kingdomstyle travelogue some nice footage though and part exciting action pieces the second half gets bogged down in of all things a conventional love triangle. At least it's a motley triangle Harry Carey is ruggedly and unpretentiously likeable even when spouting pronouncements like Aye that's Africa for ye lad  one man dead two beasts dead and none the better fer it! Duncan Renaldo manages to keep his lipstick and eyeshadow intact even while being pursued across the veldt by savages and Edwina Booth as the obligatory white goddess does some nostrilflaring and lipsnarling that would do Elsa Lanchester's Bride of Frankenstein proud.The story of its making  technical mishaps drunken director reshoots in Mexico eventual Oscar nomination  is hilarious and well told on TV Guide's Movie Database.".

Showing barebreasted native women a la National Geographic is no problem since evidently they were considered subhuman and if there's no way to convincingly fake shooting a rhino by God they shoot a rhino. The first half is part leisurely Wild Kingdomstyle travelogue some nice footage though and part exciting action pieces the second half gets bogged down in of all things a conventional love triangle. At least it's a motley triangle Harry Carey is ruggedly and unpretentiously likeable even when spouting pronouncements like Aye that's Africa for ye lad  one man dead two beasts dead and none the better fer it! Duncan Renaldo manages to keep his lipstick and eyeshadow intact even while being pursued across the veldt by savages and Edwina Booth as the obligatory white goddess does some nostrilflaring and lipsnarling that would do Elsa Lanchester's Bride of Frankenstein proud.The story of its making  technical mishaps drunken director reshoots in Mexico eventual Oscar nomination  is hilarious and well told on TV Guide's Movie Database.";

This portion of the film is highly reminiscent of the later film The Naked Prey with Cornel Wilde.While the film is exciting and has a lot of great action location sequences the film also is very tough to watch. Because the film was made in the PreCode era where rules about film content were rarely enforced the film is amazingly violent. In fact MGM didn't like the final product so they took a bunch of animals probably from circuses or zoos to Mexico and had them kill each other or killed them outright and stuck this into the movie!! There was no PETA or American Humane Association to oversee the project and it is tough watching animals actually die. In particular there is a scene where a lion is impaled on a spear and it appears that they really did this for the entertainment of the audiences! Uggh. Additionally being a PreCode piece Nina spends much of the movie wearing very littleand all the native women are toplesswhich was not a problem in 1931. However with the toughened Production Code of 1934 this film would have been heavily edited to be shown in the States or not at all. Because of all this it's a film you definitely cannot ignore!! Exciting location shots lots of action and a bit of trashall make for a very exciting but unsavory film.".

But once the threat is over she becomes a safari mate and the two men fight over protecting her as they make their way through some dangerous turf.Most of the wildlife footage is seen at a distance and is the sort of footage that would later adorn the Johnny Weissmuller films at MGM whenever a Tarzan film needed some extra background shots.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie took six months on sites in Africa. That was about three times the usual for the time. Upon return to the States some of the film was deemed unusable. So a crew went to Mexico and reshot some scenes. Edwina Booth plays Nina lost daughter of white missionaries. She is queen of an African tribe when she is found. To me she looked scared the whole time she played the queen but I think she was suppose to be looking savage and mean. While she runs around almost nude the entire time she is on screen there is nothing that shows. This was a ground breaking role for her and it also was basically the end of her career. She contracted malaria and it took her six years to recover. By then she had been all but forgotten. Harry Carey is the experienced older white hunter who is chaperoning the son of an old friend around. Captured by Nina's tribe all the bearers are tortured killed and I guess eaten. When it becomes their turn Nina saves the two whites and their gun bearer. They escape with the girl and lead all on a merry chase. Then Carey separates from the pair to lead the trackers away. The end of the movie has Carey starting out on an expedition to find the two but just as he is leaving they show up. Filmed in 1931 when animals were shot or otherwise miss treated for movie scenes there are several times when this appears to happen here. The rhinos that shot and killed the lions and leopards that attack the other animals were reportedly starved so they would attack. I don't think a lion who was not starving would go after a warthog they are very formidable opponents. While did not care for the needless killings and such this is not a bad movie for 1931.".

What fills those minutes? This movie hits the trifecta racism sexism and homo eroticism.1. Trader Horn spews racist epithets like 'boy' and 'monkey' at every turn while Peru refers to the Africans as children. Not quite as offensive as virulent stateside racism but equally as clueless.2. The movie is laughably sexist as well portraying the White Goddess although having lived in Africa nearly her entire life and is apparently a figure of authority as completely useless. Worse than useless actually because Trader Horn and Peru alternate between carrying her and saving her while she makes kissy faces to Peru. They should have left her in Africa and saved themselves the headache.It should be noted that the White Goddess apparently never goes outside either because although she runs around in a bikini she has no tan or sunburn but rather white as a maiden. 3. Finally we have the single most hilarious aspect of the film the homo erotic subtext between Trader Horn and his Spanish boytoy Peru played by Duncan Renaldo. Horn and Peru spend the first half of the film holding hands and sweettalking each other I'm not exaggerating here until the useless white chick shows up. The story would have been more interesting if Horn got upset with the white chick for upsetting Horn and Peru's relationship but Horn apparently decides to give a token effort at appearing heterosexual.Besides Horn has his other boytoy Ranchero his native guncarrier to fawn over. It truly is sad when Ranchero bites it at the end. Peru and the useless white chick leave leaving Horn all alone in darkest Africa. What's a repressed homosexual to do in a continent where the men run around halfnaked all day and jump at your every beck and call. I'm sure Horn will survive somehow.The final shots of the White Goddess sailing away are apparently supposed to be uplifting the brave European men rescuing one of their wayward daughters from the clutches of Africa but frankly it was depressing. You just know she's going to be forced into illfitted dresses and made to sip tea and clutch her pearls at the blandest of offenses. They're shipping her off to slavery and she doesn't even know it. Imagine all those depressing scenes of Pocahontas after she has been taken to England from The New World  that's this woman's fate.Great message for the girls. Be a strongwilled and independent until you meet a man. Then do what he tells you.Although I absolutely loathed this movie and everything it stands for a zebra does head butt a lion.

	schema:reviewBody "Allegedly photographed in Tanganyika Kenya Uganda the Anglo Egyptian Sudan and the Belgian Congo. Some of the picture actually was. Most of it however was either secretly photographed in Mexico or in good old MGM's Culver City studios. Producer Irving Thalberg.Copyright 26 March 1931 by MetroGoldwynMayer Distributing Corp. New York opening at the Astor 3 February 1931. U.S. release 22 January 1931. 13 reels. 11109 minutes. 123 minutes.SYNOPSIS A trader and his partner rescue a missionary's daughter from African cannibals.NOTES Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture losing to Cimarron.Number seven at U.S.Canadian ticket windows Trader Horn also figured in the year's top ten most popular films in Australia. Oddly the movie was never reissued in Oz nor has it ever been aired on Oz TV.A sequence in which Cecil B. DeMille introduces the real Alfred Aloysius Horn to the audience has been removed from the video print under review.Only film of Mutia Omoolu. Also film debut of Edwina Booth who teamed up with Harry Carey again for the 1931 Mascot serial The Vanishing Legion. Suffering from jungle fever acquired whilst filming Trader Horn she then retired from the screen after successfully suing M GM for a large sum of money. She was still alive in the late 1980s.COMMENT Wow! Probably the most exciting African adventure ever made Trader Horn retains every one of its thousand thrills in these more sophisticated nineties. A pungent script allied with Van Dyke's driving resourceful direction overcomes some primitive sound recording occasionally choppy film editing and players that vary from the absolutely wonderful beguiling Edwina Booth and surprisingly personable Mutia Omoolu through the thoroughly if somewhat offhandedly professional Harry Carey to the downright awful Duncan Renaldo who seems as out of place in the Kenyan veldt as a slug on a geranium.Trader Horn was so successful it spawned MGM's Tarzan series which uses the same exotically atmospheric theme music plus De Vinna's outtakes and stock footage.OTHER VIEWS Van Dyke piles thrills upon thrills in this savage stingingly authentic jungle marathon in which not a split second is wasted on anything but socko entertainment.  Photoplayer.".

U.S. release 22 January 1931. 13 reels. 11109 minutes. 123 minutes.SYNOPSIS A trader and his partner rescue a missionary's daughter from African cannibals.NOTES Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture losing to Cimarron.Number seven at U.S.Canadian ticket windows Trader Horn also figured in the year's top ten most popular films in Australia. Oddly the movie was never reissued in Oz nor has it ever been aired on Oz TV.A sequence in which Cecil B. DeMille introduces the real Alfred Aloysius Horn to the audience has been removed from the video print under review.Only film of Mutia Omoolu. Also film debut of Edwina Booth who teamed up with Harry Carey again for the 1931 Mascot serial The Vanishing Legion. Suffering from jungle fever acquired whilst filming Trader Horn she then retired from the screen after successfully suing M GM for a large sum of money. She was still alive in the late 1980s.COMMENT Wow! Probably the most exciting African adventure ever made Trader Horn retains every one of its thousand thrills in these more sophisticated nineties. A pungent script allied with Van Dyke's driving resourceful direction overcomes some primitive sound recording occasionally choppy film editing and players that vary from the absolutely wonderful beguiling Edwina Booth and surprisingly personable Mutia Omoolu through the thoroughly if somewhat offhandedly professional Harry Carey to the downright awful Duncan Renaldo who seems as out of place in the Kenyan veldt as a slug on a geranium.Trader Horn was so successful it spawned MGM's Tarzan series which uses the same exotically atmospheric theme music plus De Vinna's outtakes and stock footage.OTHER VIEWS Van Dyke piles thrills upon thrills in this savage stingingly authentic jungle marathon in which not a split second is wasted on anything but socko entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "This powerful film follows the journey of three young aboriginal girls who are taken from their family and forced to assimilate into an empty culture by the white settlers of Australia. This is known as the STOLEN GENERATION a dark period in Australian history which the current prime minister of Australia refuses to say sorry for the past atrocities. But this is not to say that this film preaches or manipulates emotions for political gain. No! It just tells the story with powerful images that allows the viewer to enter the torment of the stolen generation. Dialogue is minimal as our heroes are taken from their family and driven to the other side of Australia. But their will and instinct to be with their strong culture has the girls escape the camp prison and follow the rabbitproof fence back home. The rabbit proof fence was built down the centre of Australia to contain the plague of rabbits from entering farm land. It was this whiteman built fence that lead the girls back home.As for all journeys they are filled with internal conflict and confrontations with strangers. These confrontations with certain people show the diverse group of settlers in Australia. Not all were ignorant but most were repressed and abided to the harsh cultured laws. For instance the girls arrive at a farmstead and are given clothing and food by a white woman. The motherly instinct of this woman understood that the girls had to be with their mothers. But at the same token the farm woman could not jeopardise her own family by looking after the girls or else it would have brought trouble. It was wonderful scenes like these that was played out visually without having to dumb it down with words. As human beings we understand these actions and need no explaining.The most interesting relationship was the one between the aboriginal tracker in search of the girls. He could sense the persistence of these girls to get home by making it difficult for him to track them down. This he respected and slightly dropped his guard. Once again a string of images tell of this distant relationship between tracker and girls.The images also became so strong during the scene when the girls were taken from their mothers in a horrific manner. I doubt there will be a dry eye during that scene. This hooks you in as you then become the spirit of their journey back home.Only by the performances of the girls do these scenes work because they are so natural and heartfelt. Children who overplay their role just become cute but those who underplay and rely on emotions of  the situation deliver a powerhouse performance that a trained actor may sometimes find difficult to achieve. At first the name of a high calibre actor  such as Kenneth Branagh  in an Australian film warns you where the limelight will shine. But Kenneth just took a step back and become another important confrontational figure in the journey.A bonus is the music  by Peter Gabriel. It is a mixture of his famous trademark of world music infused with that of the Aboriginal. It soars and plays with the emotions maybe a little too much but when you are dealing with a thousand year old culture that has music as its central universe then you may be able to understand that the overpowerful music is just an extension of that.Congratulations to all who were brave enough to bring a project of this strength to the screen. And for those who may wonder how I saw the film prior to its release lets just say I was lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time. And No! I'm not tied to the project in any way because I don't sell out that easily.".

	schema:reviewBody "And miles to go before I sleep And miles to go before I sleep  Robert FrostSet in Western Australia in 1931 RabbitProof Fence a new film by Australian director Philip Noyce The Quiet American Clear and Present Danger is a scathing attack on the Australian government's eugenics policy toward Aboriginal halfcastes. Continuing policies begun by the British the white government in Australia for six decades forcibly removed all halfcaste Aborigines from their families for their own good and sent them to government camps where they were raised as servants converted to Christianity and eventually assimilated into white society.Based on the 1996 book Follow the RabbitProof Fence by Doris Pilkington Garimara Molly Kelly's daughter the film tells the story of three Aboriginal girls 14year old Molly Kelley her 8year old sister Daisy and their 10year old cousin Gracie. It shows their escape from confinement in a government camp for halfcastes and their return home across the vast and lonely Australian Outback. It is a simple story of indomitable courage told with honest emotion. Abducted by police in 1931 from their families at Jigalong an Aboriginal settlement on the edge of the Little Sandy Desert in northwest Australia the three girls are sent to the Moore River Native Settlement near Perth. Here the children must endure wretched conditions. Herded into mass dormitories they are not allowed to speak their native language are subject to strict discipline and if they break the rules are put into solitary confinement for 14 days. Followed by the Aborigine tracker Moodoo a great performance from David Gulpilil the girls make their escape. Using a rabbitproof fence as a navigation tool they walk 1500 miles across the parched Outback to return to Jigalong. The rabbitproof fence was a strip of barbedwire netting that cut across half of the continent and was designed to protect farmer's crops by keeping the rabbits away. The girls walked for months on end often without food or drink not always sure of the direction they are going using all their ingenuity and intelligence along the way just to survive. The stunning Australian landscape is magnificently photographed by Christopher Doyle and a haunting score by Peter Gabriel translates natural sounds of birds animals wind and rain into music that adds a mystical feeling to the journey. The performances by amateur actors Evelyn Sampi Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan who had never seen a film before let alone acted in one are authentic and heartbreakingly affecting. Though the white officials and police are characterized as smug and unfeeling they are more like bureaucrats carrying out official policies than true villains. Kenneth Branagh gives a strong but restrained performance as Mr. Neville the minister in charge of halfcastes. RabbitProof Fence is an honest film that avoids sentimentality and lets the courage and natural wisdom of the girls shine through. This is one of the best films I've seen this year and has struck a responsive chord in Australia and all over the world.  Hopefully it will become a vehicle for reconciliation so that the shame of the Stolen Generation can at last be held to account.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has quite a few remarkable features.  First of all is its title which is rather unusual and immediately grabs one's interest.  Next there is the fence itself which runs for thousands of miles to protect what few green plants there are in these desert regions from the voracious appetites of millions of wild rabbits.  This fence plays an important role in this true story.  Then there is the diector who not only scoured the continent to find three suitable aboriginal girls to play theleads but moulded these inexperienced beginners into the believable characters of Molly Daisy and Gracie.  The director Phillip Noyce has achieved remarkable success in creating three good little performers and should be given full credit for his difficult task.For those who do not know the desert regions of Australia it must be said that the outback country is harsh and cruel and can only be crossed by those with experience...those with a knowledge of the land.  I think the camera makes it clear that the hostile environment is very much like a fence in itself...almost impossible to cross.   All the more remarkable therefore that these girls accomplished what they set out to do.  May be it was a reckless decision they made but thanks to the fence they found their way back to family and friends.The film is largely a record of the long trek  and the manner in which the children are able to survive.  There are not many dramatic moments on their journey south.  The children are mainly concerned with avoiding the blacktracker who is following them.  The most unforgettable scene comes early in the film when the children are forcibly torn from their mothers. This is truly heartwrenching stuff.This thoughtful presentation is worth watching.  It is part of Australian history.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film has quite a few remarkable features.  First of all is its title which is rather unusual and immediately grabs one's interest.  Next there is the fence itself which runs for thousands of miles to protect what few green plants there are in these desert regions from the voracious appetites of millions of wild rabbits.  This fence plays an important role in this true story.  Then there is the diector who not only scoured the continent to find three suitable aboriginal girls to play theleads but moulded these inexperienced beginners into the believable characters of Molly Daisy and Gracie.  The director Phillip Noyce has achieved remarkable success in creating three good little performers and should be given full credit for his difficult task.For those who do not know the desert regions of Australia it must be said that the outback country is harsh and cruel and can only be crossed by those with experience...those with a knowledge of the land.  I think the camera makes it clear that the hostile environment is very much like a fence in itself...almost impossible to cross.   All the more remarkable therefore that these girls accomplished what they set out to do.  May be it was a reckless decision they made but thanks to the fence they found their way back to family and friends.The film is largely a record of the long trek  and the manner in which the children are able to survive.  There are not many dramatic moments on their journey south.  The children are mainly concerned with avoiding the blacktracker who is following them.  The most unforgettable scene comes early in the film when the children are forcibly torn from their mothers. This is truly heartwrenching stuff.This thoughtful presentation is worth watching.  It is part of Australian history.";

	schema:reviewBody "1931 Australia.  The state has passed a law that facilitates the collection of mixed race children to boarding camps where they are trained in their white side of their blood and to be home help as adults.  The eventual aim is to prevent the growth of the aborigines as a race by watering down any mixed blood.  A small group of children Molly Gracie and Daisy are taken from their mother and transferred across the country to one such camp. However Molly leads the trio in an escape from the camp and follow the rabbit proof fence that divides the country to return to her home.I managed to fluke free preview tickets for this because the tickets I had come to collect were all gone!  I must admit this film hadn't really appealed to me when I saw summaries and the poster but I'm very glad that I did.  The plot is based on fact and is a period of history that I admit I knew nothing about.  I was surprised that this cruel and immoral practice carried on till as late as the seventies.  The fact that the current Prime Minister of Australia refuses to apologise for it to this day shows that it is important that this story be told.The film is told in a steady unsentimental tone that allows the film to be powerful without the typically Hollywood use of sweeping music or other such lazy tools.  Instead the circumstances of the story create the emotion.  The story is a little weak at some points  once the children escape the film has a touch too many scenes of nearcapture and escape to sustain the drama. Also the film understandably lends a lot of respect to the Aborigines  giving them a sense of mysticism that they maybe don't deserve.  This is a slight problem when a key action involves a hawk that is supposedly summoned by their mothers or something!.  However these are minor complaints given the sweeping emotion of the film and the sheer power of the story.The production and direction are excellent.  Noyce has created a beautiful vision of the Australian Outback that really feeds the film.  However the sound is also superb.  Rhythmic footsteps ring out crunching and banging of the landscape  it works best in a cinema I guess but it adds to the dramatic feel of the film even if some sudden noises caused me to jump without any reason in the scene to do so.The cast are mixed but are important where it matters.  Sampi is amazing as Molly.  She carries the film with her strength but also little facial expressions that reveal that she is a child reveal her strength and tell so very much.  Both Sansbury and Monaghan also do well but not as well as the lead.  Branagh is also perfectly pitched.  Neville could easily have been overplayed as a hammy villain of the piece but here he is played just right  he is a real man and we are left to decide for ourselves what to make of him.  Some of the cast are average  some of the children in the camp can't act and the majority of the white police officers are maybe a shade too much caricatured as evil men who dislike the blacks.Overall this film may struggle to draw the Friday night crowd just looking for a bit of escapism of a weekend but it is still well worth a look.  It is beautifully shot and uses the Australian landscape to great effect complimenting the enormity and emotion of the terrible terrible true story. Not exactly cheerful or uplifting but a powerful story that deserves 90 minutes of your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a true story and set in Australia in the 1930s RabbitProof Fence is about three halfcaste aboriginal girls Molly Craig Everlyn Sampi Daisy Tianna Sansbury and Gracie Laura Monaghan who are taken from their mother and shipped 1500 miles across the country to the Moore River Native Settlement where they are to become more integrated into white Australian culture. Molly the eldest and most experienced of the three initiates an attempt to return home on foot.There is some controversy over just how factual the film and its bases are including the book by the reallife Molly Craig's daughter Doris Pilkington and there were some interesting parallels to the situation depicted in the film and behind the scenes facts about star Sampi and director Phillip Noyce. I won't get into that here because it's irrelevant to the question of whether RabbitProof Fence is a good film. It is. It's an excellent inspirational film that should leave nary a dry eye whenever it's shown.On the other hand there is a politics present in the film that is not ignorable. The aborigines in the film are abused and pushed around by a culture that misguidedly wants to protect them from themselves. A segment of historical white Australia is portrayed as the bad guy. Noyce doesn't paint a picture completely without ethical nuance however. The chief villain of the film A.O. Neville Kenneth Branagh keeps talking about his good intentions and such claims do not come across as insincere. This all sets the backdrop and motivation for the heart of the film which is a story of just what conviction persistence and a bit of resourcefulness can do.RabbitProof Fence is mostly a combination of an adventure and a suspense film. Set primarily in the breathtaking Australian wilderness magnificent cinematography goes without saying. The suspense is realistic and comparatively subtle.As for the cast Sampi is simply enchanting and Branagh is as good here as I've seen him in any other film of his even though his role is a relatively minor one. The tracker Moodoo David Gulpilil managed to be very effectively complex all while uttering barely a word. The music by Peter Gabriel is also worth noting. It is very unobtrusive but elegantly emphasizes mood throughout the film.I also had extra personal interest in the film as an avid hiker who has done a number of longdistance hikes and who plans to do more in the future.".

It's disgusting to know the mixedrace Aboriginal children continued to be removed from their families until only about 30 years ago.I suppose there is potential for this film to be quite important given the debate in recent over the Stolen Generation with some including the Prime Minister questioning whether it could be called a generation and whether they were stolen or just removed.  The film doesn't demonise the white people who take the kids away not even the Chief Protector of Aborigines A.O. Neville played by Kenneth Branagh he is shown as someone who honestly believes he is protecting the Aboriginal from himself.  It's interesting they decided to portray him this way.The scenes where Mr Neville gives a slide show on how the halfcaste can be simply bred out are very disturbing  I just thought how can someone say these things?  And the women just watch on attentively.It seems miraculous that Molly and Daisy are still alive.  The courage they showed to get home was really something extraordinary.The film is very good but there seemed to be something missing.

The movie doesn't even come close to portraying the harshness of the terrain and weather conditions the girls would have encountered. The pain and hunger these girls must have endured goes beyond belief and is a testament to the courage one can summon to attain a goal held firmly in belief. I was not aware of the history of the Aborigines Control Act or of the suffering imposed on a race deemed inferior by the colonials. In some small measure this film helps both educate and inspire and is one of those pictures that's not easy to let go. I encourage anyone to view Rabbit Proof Fence to witness just how far the human spirit can go to attain freedom and dignity.".

Kenneth Branagh was convincing as the racial purity zealot who manages the whole forced removal scheme. I also really enjoyed the subtle changes we see in the mysterious character of The Tracker played with wonderfully restrained power by David Gulpilil as his dogged pursuit of the girls eventually gives way to a dawning admiration. And to cap it all off the closing reallife footage and text postscript leaves the audience feeling simultaneously devastated and triumphant. Wow.".

	schema:reviewBody "MILD SPOILER AHEAD This is the 200th film I have reviewed for IMDb and one of the most satisfying. Phil Noyce has produced here a piece of cinematic poetry when it could have easily been tendentious agitprop. The story from the 1930s of three halfcast aboriginal girls walking 2000 km of Western Australia to escape the clutches of white assimilationists is seen through their frame of reference. We see the harsh beauty of the countryside as they do not an alien landscape but as their back yard. They have all been brought up in the desert and together know how to survive a point eventually realised by their pursuers who then lie in wait at their destination.The three young girls Mollie Grace and Daisy are stunningly portrayed by Everlyn Sampi Tianna Sainsbury and Laura Monaghan. Molly at 14 the oldest has the largest part but the three of them function together as if they really were sisters. Their mother and grandmother  played by Ningali Lawson and Myana Lawson daughter and mother in real life are equally convincing as is David Gulpilil as the relentless black tracker.The most difficult role in the film is that of A O Neville Mr Devil as the aborigines called him Chief Protector of Aborigines a sincere and energetic advocate of the monstrous policy which resulted in a generation or more of halfcast children being removed from their families. It would be easy to pillory Neville as a monster but Kenneth Branagh manages to give us a rounded picture of a man who was not inhumane who tried to advance what he saw as the welfare of his charges despite lack of money and enormous logistical problems not to mention an uncooperative police force. Had it not been for these obstacles the aboriginality of Australia would probably have been reduced to a few scattered reserves in the deserts run as freak shows for tourists.Some critics of the armchair lefty variety have criticised the movie as not being political enough and its true there's plenty of room for righteous or leftist indignation on the topic of the stolen generation but I think a more overt political message would have diminished it. Imagine say if John Pilger had made this film. Instead we have a nearclassic. Never I have I seen the visual power of the Australian landscape better depicted and seldom have I seen a better celebration of the human spirit. And this is a true story. The real Molly and Daisy take their bows at the end. Things didn't quite work out for them the way they might have but they survived and stayed with their people.".

However I find the story not so well told. It concentrates on the girls' escape in the scorching desert and lacks excitement and suspense. There could have been so many subplots to make it exciting and engaging such as facing wild animals in desert running out of water not being able to find food etc. There could also have been more humanistic side portraying the girls' inner emotional turmoils. It would have been great if there were more people helping them even more passionately. As none of these happened in the film we are only left with three girls wandering in the desert. The film ends up being dry and monotonous.".

The majority of the comments describe the movie as brilliant moving and a real 'tear jerker' however when I watched the movie the only tears I would have been likely to cry would have been tears of boredom. I really disliked this movie partly because it was not created as well as it could have been . The way in which the story is presented is quite disappointing. It is a story that had the potential to be interesting thought provoking and cause a real sense of empathy for the girls but I feel that this was not done adequately. Despite this there were some bearable scenes however these were far outnumbered by the boring uninteresting feel of the entire movie. This made a story that could have been a compelling and interesting journey for viewers a boring and painful form of torture.The other reason that I dislike this movie is its failure to address the other point of view for want of a better word the white persons point of view. It makes out the white Australians of the time were racist and only trying to harm the aboriginals when this was not the case. While in retrospect we can clearly see that what they did was wrong the people at the time could not. They had good intentions and were only doing what they believed was right. What this movie and unfortunately the majority of people who see it fail to recognise is that in a lot of cases removing these aboriginal children from their homes was actually beneficial in many cases. Many of the children were living in absolute squalor and were rescued from that and offered the chance at a decent life. To those people who deem this to be wrong I ask them to take a look at Australia's current welfare and foster care system. Is this really any different?As a senior school student in Australia we are currently studying this movie and the 'Stolen Generations' in English. And I am afraid that this is not giving the right message to international viewers. It does not give them the full story something that is definitely needed to understand the complicated and controversial issue of the Stolen Generations. It paints a racist almost evil Australian society that was never in existence. It also unfairly prejudices them to believe that white Australians are evil and Aboriginies are innocent victims as well as subjecting them to a boring story and ninety minutes of torture.".

	schema:reviewBody "RABBITPROOF FENCERabbitproof fence 2002 is an adventuredrama film set to the 1930's in Australia. It is starring Everlyn Sampi Laura Monaghan and Tianna Sansbury as Molly Gracie and Daisy. The movie is based on a book named Follow the rabbitproof fence which is based on a true story.The story is about a halfcaste aboriginal girl happily living with her mother in in a small place called Jigalong. Along with her halfsister Daisy and her cousin Gracie they are taken from their homes and put in Moore River Native Settlement. Here they are supposed to get raised as white children. Molly takes the first chance she gets and runs away together with her sister and her cousin planning to walk the 1500 miles home to Jigalong. The movie is mainly about the trip that lasts over many weeks while they're struggling with the heat the hunger and the pain from their feet. On their way they meet many different people.The emotional soundtrack by Peter Gabriel was truly amazing. His way to translate natural sounds like wind and rain into music is very effective. He succeeds in blending the aboriginal instruments together with the modern ones. The final outcome of the musical use is that the emotions in each scene discreetly gets elevated without disturbing the storyline.I think it was a very good film. The plot was good the music caught the viewer. The way the three girls acted was truly amazing. The fact that the film is based on a true story makes me even more interested in the film. I really enjoyed the clip at the very ending where we could see the real Molly and Daisy as old people. I would recommend this movie to people that are about 13 years or older because a younger audience will perhaps not understand the content of the movie neither the grave emotions involved. To enjoy this movie fully one should also have some knowledge about the story of the aboriginals.".

The motion picture is stunningly directed by Phillip Noyce  an Australian director who emigrated Hollywood where achieved successes such as Patriot games  Clear and present danger  The Saint. He is an expert on action and suspense as proved in  Dead calm  Bone collector  Catch a fire  Salt. He returned his country and filmed this sensible drama of escape and survival well titled Rabbitproof fence or The Stolen Generation . Rating  very good  better than average  well worth watching .";

	schema:reviewBody "It's nigh on impossible to watch RPF and not be strongly effected by it  it is one of those films that shouts courage  it both the fact that someone was willing to make it and in the story itself. This true account of three aboriginal halfcaste girls going home after being removed from their mother is wrenching and simply one of the great films of Australian cinema.Told simply the camera work in particular augments the film throughout its use of longshot and sweep is exemplary. The casting of the girls is spot on and Kenneth Branagh gives his role a superb pomposity without braggadocio which drives home how bureaucratic the abuse of human rights can be.Above all this is an extraordinary tale that moves the heart. I have seen it four times now and every time I cry. That Australia could do this up until the 1970s seems almost incomprehensible but that this film could then be made is a start to acknowledge and heal that wrong.An excellent moving movie.".

Halfcaste Molly Daisy and Gracie are hauled away from their mother and kin by the white authorities to train for a life of servitude to the colonials. Defiant and proud Molly leads her siblings 1500 miles through the desert back to home aided by the rabbitproof fence that splits the country.The eponymous fence symbolic of the division between natives and whites is countered with the symbol of a soaring bird that reminds the girls that they are free. The journey across the country through harsh terrain is episodic graceful and fraught with danger. The longer the girls stay on the run the greater their notoriety becomes and the more inclined the people they encounter are to help them on their way.Everlyn Sampi is brooding and charismatic as leader Molly ably complemented by the confused Tianna Sansbury and delicate Laura Monaghan as her two charges. Kenneth Branagh as the face of White Australia never lets the didactic tone spill over remaining oafishly but menacingly sincere.Noyce tells this devastating tale in simple but moving fashion. The Englishlanguage trailer pitches the film as a journey of survival and endurance which it is. The Japanese trailer simply asks Are there tribal differences in the feelings of children torn from their mothers?  pitching the tale as one of searching and belonging which it is. Noyce fuses all these elements into a superbly moving deeply satisfying film. A film that deserves a wide audience and demands repeat viewing.".

Three girls Molly Daisy and Gracie are what is known as halfcasts which means they have black and white blood in them and there skin is somewhere inbetween. The politician Mr. Neville who was in charge of the Aboriginal department of Australia decided on a treaty that stated that all halfcasts are to be removed and put in camps where they will have the black culture 'bred' out of them. All three girls are taken from there home of Jindalong and taken something like 1200 miles away to one of the camps called More River. No child has escaped but they manage to and set back home 'ON FOOT!' This is horrific as it is brilliant as it shows Australia's true 'dark' aboriginal history. I wouldn't want to ruin the movie but it is all fact! 1200 miles is a long way for three kids between the ages of 6 to 14. None the less it shows the power of human spirit.".

Instead what we got was the tired old fallback of the man in a monkey suit waddling bowlegged around some highly unconvincing sets.Its such a shame because this film actually has a lot going for it. The screenplay is sprightly goodhumoured and faithful to the original while updating it with some then topical issues like fuel crises feminism and even pornography. The makers also have a whale of a time with endless phallic imagery and selfreferential quips more common to movies of the 90s than 70s.The characters are far more quirky and idiosynchratic than you normally get in this sort of fare a hippie academic a starstruck dipsy blonde and a buttonedup corporate shark. Lange has gone on to become one of the most honoured and respected actresses of her generation yet her career almost died right here. She was actually so good at playing the shallow Dlist airhead that critics and public alike thought it a reflection of her real self and dismissed her out of hand. Yet looking at her performance in hindsight she just oozes skill and star quality.The film hardly puts a foot wrong until Kong appears. The production is smooth the photography impressive the locations superb and the story and characters engaging. But a fantasy adventure stands and falls by the suspension of disbelief achieved at the crucial moment. The first act of the 1933 Kong drags interminably until the King himself appears  then it soars. The reverse happens here Rick Baker turns up in his ape suit knocking down plastic trees and fighting a big rubber snake and the spell is shattered  in fact it was never even cast. The problem is also compounded by the screenplay's only serious error making Kong sympathetic and pitiable far too early. The original Kong was always awesome and scary even when he began to become sympathetic. Here he is just a bit too likeable to quickly.That the film remains just about watchable after this point is a testament to the performers and the strength of the story but ultimately this effort has to go down as a missed opportunity to make a quality remake of a legendary film. Lets hope Peter Jackson doesn't make the same mistake next time round. You can't imagine him getting the film visually wrong but it would be ironic indeed if he fell into the modern malaise of neglecting other key elements like story and character. Indeed he could do worse than give the first hour of this movie a peek before he puts pen to paper.".

It might have been the first movie to get that treatment. With a production cost of 24 million it was the most expensive movie ever made at that time.Promotional material offered for sale dwarfed anything that had been done in that area before. A fastfood joint offered King Kong collectible glasses I still have a set. And you could find posters Tshirts and a 'Making Of King Kong' book.I very much enjoyed 'King Kong' as a 17yearold high school senior but not so much later as an adult. The romance between Dwan and Jack seemed contrived once I got older. Other aspects of the film struck me as just dumb. Like the ship's radar being able to pick up Kong when he was walking around the island. Or the SUNNY aerial shot of the people walking on the allegedly fogshrouded island. Or Jack's theory that the fog was produced not by a huge supply of crude oil near the surface but by 'animal respiration.' As if King Kong's breathing caused the fog bank. Give me a break!Yet there's something about movies one enjoyed as a youth that makes them special for the rest of one's life no matter how bad they really are.But 'King Kong' had it's good points too. First of all it was funny. Charles Grodin's portrayal of the greedy desperate oil company executive is scenerychewing at its best. For years after I watched in vain for Grodin to play a similar character but everything else he has done is nothing like his work in 'King Kong.' Nothing as good either I might add.Speaking of singular performances you won't recognize Ren Auberjonois if your frame of reference is his work on 'Benson' and 'Star Trek Deep Space Nine.' The voice he uses in 'King Kong' is nothing like the gravely voice we're used to hearing.Jeff Bridges is perfect in the role of Jack Prescott. His long hair is a nice touch although it probably turned off some of the older people in the theater. Jeff has a way with a sarcastic line that few actors can equal.Jessica Lange comes off worse than any other actor in the film. Not because of her performance which is fine but because her character is an airhead who is only there to be protected and rescued when that doesn't work from Kong. The fact that her costumes were chosen for their ability to showcase her body and that her breasts are briefly visible when Kong undresses her has got to make the actress cringe nowadays when she thinks about this movie.I'll close by noting that John Barry's score of 'King Kong' was terrific. Twentysix years after the movie debuted and I can still remember the title tune.".

Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin playing a bad guy for a change are acceptable in their roles. Jessica Lange didn't exactly hint there was a two time Oscar winner present but she looked awfully good.

It does well enough in its own behalf.The music grabs you right off John Barry did aces with his pounding dramatic score.  And you couldn't ask for a better cast Lange does okay for a first role Bridges makes linearthought acting look easy and Grodin is about as slimy a baddie as you could ask for.  The bit parts are also filled with familiar faces Bernsen Piscopo Auberjoinois Lauter Randolph and Lone who acquit themselves quite well.A lot of people blast the monkey suit.  But I think Rick Baker did a good job with it.  Of COURSE it's a guy in a monkey suit but it's a guy in a WELLDONE monkey suit.  It still gets me when Kong blewdry Dwan Lange after her waterfall shower those puffedout cheeks especially in 1976 were high tech enough for me remember this was before Star Wars came out.But we all know how the story works any of us who have a rudimentary knowledge of the original that is.  The new twist was having the emotional connection between Lange and ape.  More enlightened than having her scream endlessly.  The Twin Towers scene near the end was not only exciting but quietly moving as it showed just how much the beast cared for his beauty.There's plenty of corn in this one no argument but it's corn for a good cause.  I loved King Kong and if I had a chance I'd buy a copy!  Anyone have John Guillermin's phone number?Seven stars for Kong long live the King!".

I won't argue about any of that. It's all true. And so what? I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I love the flaws and the notsospecial effects and all of the silly stuff. I enjoyed Dwan's comment about telling Prescott's sign by his ears and all of her silly lines to Kong. Jessica Lange is beautiful lovely and wonderful. Jeff Bridges is excellent too and how can ya not hate Charles Grodin in this? He's the character I most love to hate! Great work! King Kong himself is always entertaining in this even if he is incredibly goofy at times depending on which special effect they used. The giant robot Kong just kills me! LOL! I loved it! When they use an actor in a costume it works better and dammit this Kong has got the most soulful eyes! My heart strings were tugged by this sweet and silly movie. POOR KONG! HE'S JUST LOOKIN' FOR LOVE! WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE?! I guess if they did there'd be no movie. No this isn't a perfect movie but I agree with the poster who said this movie is an old friend. All of the flaws are part of it's charm and I've had a wonderful time with this Kong.".

Now admittedly it also had a huge pr campaign which undoubtedly helped it garner a lot of that dough but there was a lot more to the flick than just the hype. And it could have probably been an even bigger hit if the filmmakers had played it safe and hadn't gone out of their way to make a film so stubbornly odd. I mean this thing stomps over a gigantic swath of styles panoramic spectacle high adventure pathos romance social commentary absurdist comedy thrills and occasionally outright goofinessall comprised in a slyly satiric package designed to tweak the noses of Kong purists. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s Papillon  screenplay is all over the place when it comes to style and tone borrowing from whatever and whenever almost as though it had been patched together from several different treatmentsyet it still remains incredibly tight in terms of interesting welldrawn consistent characters witty dialog exploration of theme and the forward momentum of the plot. King Kong 76 is a great example of anarchic postmodernism being perfectly wed to the staunch formalism of good storytelling. A contemporary example of this approach would be Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films.The direction by veteran John Guillermin was absolutely fearless pushing each of Semple's concepts to its limit even at the risk of seeming silly. And he had a great cast to work with especially young Jessica Lange in her first film role. Unfortunately Jessica played the role of the vivacious childlike kinda dimwitted bubblehead blonde Dwan so incredibly well that most people wrote her off assuming she was just a dumb blonde playing herself. But in actuality it is a bravura performance one of the best in her career and certainly a more individual more fullyrealized character performance than we get in most movies these days.As big a hit as the disco era Kong was however there were a lot of people who were put off because they weren't expecting anything as freewheeling and insane as what they were given. They weren't expecting weirdness and satire. They weren't expecting to see Kong blowing a hot wet blonde dry after a dip in a lake metaphors anyone? a scene simultaneously erotic and ridiculous. They weren't expecting to see the captured Kong turned in to a corporate shillis there any scene in mainstream 70s cinema more surrealistically satiric than that of Kong being presented to the masses encased in a thirty story replica of a gasoline pump? They also were not expecting to see a big budget adventure film with a downer endingthe romantic leads ending up emotionally separated by their experiences instead of united. And they didn't expect to feel bad when the monster died.So I put it to you all that not only was the 1976 Kong a financial success it was also an artistic success. But you can't watch it as a remake of a classic film. It is no more a remake of the 1933 King Kong than Quentin's Kill Bill is a remake of Sonny Chiba's Streetfighter's Revenge. Watch the film for what it is not what you think it should have been or what you wanted it to be and you will be better able to appreciate its cracked brilliance.".

For movie purists the thought of remaking a landmark film is always touchy territory. Thus they rip the remake.

Yes the black and white ape is more believable and scarier looking and more lovable and inarguably the star of a better movie. But when you're 5 years old a man in a monkey suit is just as realistic as a stop motion model because suspension of disbelief is not just easy for you it's a way of life.

	schema:reviewBody "After recently rewatching King Kong '76 I was able to reconnect with why this movie haunts me to this day. True I do LOVE both versions being a bit of a MONSTER JONES but it's Kong '76 that pushes buttons for me that other monster movies don't. It's something that goes beyond awkwardly dated special effects and trespassing upon classic cinema. By God it IS Rick Baker in that ape suit lumbering along to John Barry's emotionally moving music. Kong is more of an oversized misunderstood pet than a marauding monster. He is loyal to the death to the one who fulfills his emotional need Jessica Lange. We like her because she looks and sounds like a Marilyn Monroe clone. He likes her because she tries to talk to him and doesn't try to hurt him. Kong is not really the source of the fear though he does some terrible things. What really scares you is the almost overwhelming power and destructive force of the movie's true monster modern civilization. No matter how loud Kong roars the machine guns of three helicopter gunships are louder. Kong transformed from classic movie monster to symbol for nature and the environment in this movie and that didn't set well with critics. Lange's Dwan Jeff Bridges' Prescott me and anyone else who watches events unfold in this movie with an open mind is rooting for Kong but ultimately there's that stomach turning feeling deep in our gut that reminds us that despite our best efforts and intentions it's not to be. The Powers That Be have decried that Kong is too big to live it's too much trouble to capture him he's gone too far and has to be put down. To view Kong '76 as a MONSTER MOVIE is something of a mistake by everyone concerned. True Kong is a monster in that he is monstrous but like Mary Shelley's Creature in Frankenstein Kong is that freak that nobody wants and everybody fears He is the truth. The authorities knew that Kong had no place in a bustling city like New York but instead of trying to right the wrong of their own exploitive nature they cut the Big Guy down in a hail of bullets and make him fall to his death. Kong's death in '76 was even more pointless than in '33. In '33 it was like trying to escape a wild Grizzly bear. In '76 it was like watching your beloved pet get run over. It's a helpless sadness that transcends tears cuts deep and somehow stays with you awhile. I sometimes stop the video of Kong '76 just as the Big Fella turns to face the choppers. So I can remember him large and in charge on top of one of the majestic World Trade towers and giving the proverbial finger to the modern civilization that screwed him over. I let myself wonder if had I let the movie roll this time would the helicopters have those damn nets and would they get him back to the island. But movie memories take over and I remember exactly what happens and know that it will happen again and again. King Kong '76 is a hopelessly sad movie even for a monster flick. But for some bizarre reason it's always a pleasure to let Kong make me sad for a little bit...and for me not a guilty pleasure. Sorry naysayers. Like Dwan and Jack Prescott I'll stand behind Kong '76 to the bitter end.".

I let myself wonder if had I let the movie roll this time would the helicopters have those damn nets and would they get him back to the island. But movie memories take over and I remember exactly what happens and know that it will happen again and again. King Kong '76 is a hopelessly sad movie even for a monster flick. But for some bizarre reason it's always a pleasure to let Kong make me sad for a little bit...and for me not a guilty pleasure. Sorry naysayers. Like Dwan and Jack Prescott I'll stand behind Kong '76 to the bitter end.";

It stands on it's own as a cool monster movie and a love story. The musical score in the film is haunting and evokes memories of the mysterious island. Jack Prscott's explanation of the legend of the great beast of the island sets the pace for the film. Jessica Lange floats in on a raft wearing a tiny black cocktail dress and is rescued by the womanstarved sailors. She plays the role of Dwan breathlessly a la Marylin Monroe. She parades around on deck looking like a dancer at a Gentlemen's club care for a dance? wearing a pair of Daisy Dukes she appears ready to burst out of and a succession of minishirts! The film goes on to carefully modernise the original story and Rick Baker in a monkey suit is the best Kong on film to date. Even Kong gets carried away by Lange's incredible sensuality and physical perfection!".

Nothing more than a man in a gorilla suit. Just as ferocious as the 1933 version only a a lot of change were made there. I did take notice that they blurred Jessica Lange's areolas in the movie. Very discreet of the people there. And this Kong was a bigger horndog primate than the original version. There were no other creatures in the remake only the big snake. And that scene was a bit too short for me. That snake didn't stand a chance when Kong popped it. The cast in the movie were indeed great. Charles Grodin as the greedy oil magnet Jeff Bridges was the most levelheaded one in the movie. And Jessica Lange in her debut did a spectacular job playing Dwan. Though I was living in New York at the time I would worry about Kong heading around Long Island. Of Course who would come here? There's nothing more than houses and a few parks. Then it would be total pandemonium! This movie was all right not the greatest remake now but back then it was. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.".

While far from being a cerebral movie the script by Lorenzo Semple Jr. is far more smarter and wittier than most of todays soulless big budget monster on the loose flicks ie. Independence Day Godzilla 1998. Compared to silly big budget fodder like Starship Troopers or Armagheddon Kong 76 is Citizen Cane. Has anyone here seen the three hour version of this film that was originally broadcast on NBC in the seventies and early eighties. This is the version that I basically grew up with. When watching the film some years later on video tape I was disappointed to find that many scenes I knew were no longer there. I recently acquired a copy of this rare version on video. Overall I think a good deal of this footage helps out the movie. The battle with the snake is much longer and actually a bit more violent. The snake while still not the most realistic looking creature is at least a bit more menacing appearing. Overall I give the remake of King Kong seven out of ten.".

	schema:headline " Different approach to the 1933 Kong generally works welleven if it's definitely no classic like the original";
	schema:reviewBody "The reputation of this 1976 version of King Kong seems to have improved since it's initial release. It's nowhere near as good as the 1933 versionbut who would really expect it to be. That remains the greatest of giant monster movies and a milestone in filmmaking. Howevertaken on it's ownthis one is not bad at all.Rather than replicate the originalthe filmmakers take a different approach. Some things worksome things don'tbut kudos for trying. The updating of the characters for 70s sensibilities now seems as dated as the ones in the original movieand Jessica Lange's heroine just comes across as an empty headed bimbo. The environmentalist message is still pertinent thoughand the filmmakers stop short of labouring their issues.Kong himself is a lot less fearsomein fact the maninsuit creature seems rather cuddly. Scenes when he attacks people almost seem out of place and compare badly with similar sequences in the original. Look out for the brief appearance of the robot Kong prop during the scene when he breaks out of his cageit looks nothing like the Kong of the rest of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "The reputation of this 1976 version of King Kong seems to have improved since it's initial release. It's nowhere near as good as the 1933 versionbut who would really expect it to be. That remains the greatest of giant monster movies and a milestone in filmmaking. Howevertaken on it's ownthis one is not bad at all.Rather than replicate the originalthe filmmakers take a different approach. Some things worksome things don'tbut kudos for trying. The updating of the characters for 70s sensibilities now seems as dated as the ones in the original movieand Jessica Lange's heroine just comes across as an empty headed bimbo. The environmentalist message is still pertinent thoughand the filmmakers stop short of labouring their issues.Kong himself is a lot less fearsomein fact the maninsuit creature seems rather cuddly. Scenes when he attacks people almost seem out of place and compare badly with similar sequences in the original. Look out for the brief appearance of the robot Kong prop during the scene when he breaks out of his cageit looks nothing like the Kong of the rest of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "A trilogy of films titled King Kong span the history of sound film making. The first released in 1933 just after the introduction of talkies set new standards for both monster films and dramatic special effects sequences  so much so that it has become an unquestioned classic which still sells well on DVD and is listed as 'essential viewing' for most College film courses. All three films tell essentially the same story but by Peter Jackson's 2005 version its duration had doubled from 100 min. to 200 min. What makes this trilogy so unique is the 30 year intervals between the successive films which means all three use completely different technologies for creating their special effects even though the stories presented vary very little. A comment elsewhere on this database notes another very significant feature they share. Apparently when correction is made for the changing value of the dollar all three had roughly comparable budgets and all three achieved comparable modest commercial success  this seems to point to the fact that the quality of the film was not a major factor in its appeal to prospective viewers each film was supported by a similar proportion of the movie going audience presumably electing to see it primarily on the basis of its story. Such similarities make it particularly difficult to discuss any of these films in isolation but I felt the 1976 film was on balance the most satisfactory to watch  the exact converse of the assessment made by most critics and other IMDb database users. I am prejudiced against remakes of well respected classic films particularly where the remake 'pirates' the story of the original too closely and will therefore attempt to explain this preference.Great filmmaking earned the original version its place as an essential film for students  I can rewatch it repeatedly but only to admire and enjoy the craftsmanship with which it was created not its story. All three films share this by now famous story about an isolated tribe of savages who periodically sacrifice one of their young maidens tied to some fancy timber altar and offered to a gigantic mountain gorilla like creature they worship. They capture a white girl from a ship for the same purpose. The monster takes a fancy to this new offering grasping her in its hand and protecting her fiercely. Eventually the ship's crew rescue her and capture the monster which is taken back to New York for public exhibition  it escapes and climbs a skyscraper on top of which it is killed by gunfire from aeroplanes. This choice of monster  not a mutation alien or some primeval slime but a gorilla  provides a firm and welcome link with reality. Gorillas are the most totally vegetarian large primate  they are also unusually gentle and even lovable creatures Watch Gorillas in The Mist. The story as written by Cooper in 1933 may have been inspired by a powerful but very brief sequence in Demille's 1932 The Sign of the Cross which showed a Christian girl tied to a stake in the Roman Arena in a very similar way waiting to be ravaged by a silverback gorilla. But there is no way in which a 30 foot monster could attempt to sexually ravage a normal size girl so Cooper's film abandoned everything known about the natural history of gorillas by implying that the native maidens offered to the monster were all killed. It even featured an introductory prophecy to the effect that the moment the monster shows pity and fails to kill its victim it becomes doomed itself. Later at the point where the viewer is left wondering where such an oversize monster could have come from whether Skull Island could support a breeding population and how many like King Kong could exist other greater travesties of acceptability follow. Long extinct creatures from the dinosaur era appear leading to dramatic battles in which King Kong defends his new toy from tyrannosaurus like creatures extinct long before any mammals larger than a rodent had evolved. Presented in this way it is hard to recognise the filmscript as that of a classic work however brilliant the visual sequences created. The film's ultimate success is largely due to its final sequences featuring the death of King Kong on the Empire State building in New York. These emphasise his near human qualities and engender the sympathy that he could never command as King of the Jungle.My preference for the 1976 film arises partly because the ship here is exploring for oil not carrying a filming expedition. This expands the story to become a parable extolling the significance of understanding and affection over empty corporate greed measuring everything only by its dollar value. Made in colour almost essential for many modern filmgoers it very wisely eliminates the totally incompatible Mesozoic sequences featuring dinosaurs  the only hint of other forms of savage life on Skull island comes when a snake similar in appearance to an Anaconda attacks Kong's new toy and arouses his ire. Most important the monkey suit worn by Rick Baker when playing King Kong had lenses in the eye sockets through which his own eyes were seen. The King's soulful eyes give the impression of being able to look into his mind as he faces his various achievements and failures  a filmmakers triumph which for me raises this film above either of the alternatives. Admittedly Peter Jackson's 2005 film features CGI sequences with visual appeal dwarfing anything in the two earlier films. Unfortunately in the process the coherent story is lost largely because its duration becomes twice what can be supported. It resembles a child's scrapbook full of colourful and dramatic but unrelated imagery that provides little to take away with one after viewing.".

I always tried to avoid this remake knowing that it could very well ruin the original for me and possibly even spoil my love for the King Kong movies. I owned the first three Kong films on VHS King Kong Son of Kong and Kong Kong Vs. Godzilla and never really considered this part of the series and decided it was just a rehash to be avoided. But one time my mom told me that this film was deeper than the '33 original and made you actually cry when King Kong died.She thought this movie was better! Now I know that wasn't true but I took my mom's advice and checked this movie out when it came on TV a few years ago. I wasn't blown away but I must say I really enjoyed it and had a great actiondramaromance rollercoaster with this fun movie. This movie did have better action and emotion than the original I actually did get sad when Kong died as I never did before there I said it! but I just lacked something. The absence of the dinosaurs was a major downfall and the realistic take on the character was something I never liked as even though he looked more like a giant gorilla than the old Kong he wasn't even half as fun to watch. There were things about this movie I liked better than the original but when it all adds up there is no comparison. King Kong '33 wins by a long shot. It is hard I might add not to compare the two films but even as a stand alone movie this 70s remake was not completely what I wanted. The new characters were actually modern versions of the old ones just with different names Jack DriscollJack Prescott Carl Denham Fred Wilson Ann DarrowDwan and so on and I appreciated them on a certain level although this version of CarlFred was more sleazy and all I saw was his jerk side. He deserved being flattened by Kong's foot. Jessica Lange was better eye candy then Fay Wray and made for an intriguing love interest to Kong. She also brought the whole beauty and the beasthis love for women is his downfall theme to a slightly greater level. Everyone did their part well but my favorite was Jeff Bridges as Jack Prescott. He was a true heroic nature lover and the exact opposite of Fred Wilson I just bought it on DVD today along with King Kong Lives 1986 and added them to my collection of Kong Kong DVDs King Kong Vs. Godzilla and King Escapes will be joining them in four days!. In all fairness King Kong '76 is definitely a worthy entry to the huge Kong series and has remained one of my favorites for some time now. Can't wait to see the second remake of King Kong in a month it will be the motion picture event of the year for me and probably a lot better than this movie but not the '33 original. King Kong '76 is a great remake but not as good as the original! I give this great attempt at a modernization of a classic tale an 810!".

	schema:reviewBody "Mostly talkie that's part silent a goat gland this film boasts solid performances by the stars Richard Barthelmess and Betty Compson. He's a smalltime gangster who gets framed by a rival and goes to prison. She's the moll with a heart of gold who waits for him.This early talkie also boasts a few songs including the wonderful title song sung by Barthelmess but really Johnny Murray. Not just a gangster picture this one shows how Barthelmess reforms and goes out into the world only to be called CONVICT at every turn. He almost goes bad again but a visit to the old warden William Holden sets him straight. Of course the rival gets bumped off anyway.This film garnered a lot of bad publicity in 1929 because even though Barthlemss a major star of his time signed statements that the singing voice is his rumor had it he was dubbed. It's obvious he's not singing live but whether the voice is actually his we may never know. Still Barthelmess gives a solid performance as does the beautiful Betty Compson check out those closeups!as the loyal friend.WEARY RIVER may be the first early talkie where there was a controversy over possible dubbing. It almost doesn't matter now but Barthelmess got caught in a lie stating he did his own singing when the songs were dubbed by Johnny Murray. Watch this one for Richard Barthelmess and Betty Compsonboth early Oscar nomineesin solid performance in a very early talkie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mostly talkie that's part silent a goat gland this film boasts solid performances by the stars Richard Barthelmess and Betty Compson. He's a smalltime gangster who gets framed by a rival and goes to prison. She's the moll with a heart of gold who waits for him.This early talkie also boasts a few songs including the wonderful title song sung by Barthelmess but really Johnny Murray. Not just a gangster picture this one shows how Barthelmess reforms and goes out into the world only to be called CONVICT at every turn. He almost goes bad again but a visit to the old warden William Holden sets him straight. Of course the rival gets bumped off anyway.This film garnered a lot of bad publicity in 1929 because even though Barthlemss a major star of his time signed statements that the singing voice is his rumor had it he was dubbed. It's obvious he's not singing live but whether the voice is actually his we may never know. Still Barthelmess gives a solid performance as does the beautiful Betty Compson check out those closeups!as the loyal friend.WEARY RIVER may be the first early talkie where there was a controversy over possible dubbing. It almost doesn't matter now but Barthelmess got caught in a lie stating he did his own singing when the songs were dubbed by Johnny Murray. Watch this one for Richard Barthelmess and Betty Compsonboth early Oscar nomineesin solid performance in a very early talkie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Weary River 1929 restored by UCLA and TCM is a great chance to see two silent screen stars Richard Barthelmess and Betty Compson step into the talkie era together warming your heart as they do so. Their characters are so obviously head over heels crazy about one another that you can't help but be endeared to them and their story.Sure we've seen prison films like this before but there is still such a sweetness to this one because of the caliber of stars involved. Other silent stars like the first William Holden who was a character actor of the era and Gladden James who got his start in silents in the 1910's show up too and we get to hear their voices for the first time. Part silent  part talkie makes for an odd mix in most of these early sound films but the very nice Vitaphone soundtrack helps to smooth over any rough spots.I really loved the picture but then I'm very sentimental about these particular stars so please bear with me while I give this wonderful relic a 10 out of 10.And my guess is that Richard Barthelmess is NOT singing here. The lip synching is off and besides it doesn't sound like his voice at all. I wonder who the real singer was?I've since researched the film on the TCM website and found the singer dubbing for Mr. Barthelmess was Johnny Murray.".

	schema:headline " A Real Achievement in Sound Recording";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot of Weary River is a peculiar amalgam of gangster movie love story and musical centering around a sensitive hood played by Richard Barthelmess who after being sent to jail for a crime he didn't commit discovers his true passion for music and becomes a radio star based on a true story believe it or not!. As an entertainment I give this film 7 out of 10 stars. It's dated but wellpaced and amusing without being particularly outstanding.This review is about Weary River's soundtrack which is an astonishing achievement for its time but overlooked by film music historians... possibly because the recordings were only rediscovered and restored to the film in 1997.Film music historians often talk about Max Steiner's 1933 score for King Kong and Franz Waxman's 1934 score for The Bride of Frankenstein as if Steiner and Waxman magically invented synchronized music for film out of thin air... which is preposterous. Due to the success of The Jazz Singer early talkies were mostly musicals. But it's one thing to have people burst into song in the middle of a scene as if they were on the stage as in Ernst Lubitsch's superior 1929 film The Love Parade... it's something else entirely when the music has to synchronize with action and dialogue over the course of multiple shots and scenes as in Weary River.You see in early talkies all the sound had to be recorded live simultaneously. If you were going to have music under dialogue or sound effects or dialogue looping it all had to be recorded at the same time. They didn't have multitrack recording in 1929.Weary River has musical underscoring in virtually every shot of the picture. If you wanted underscoring in 1929 you had to have the orchestra and conductor on the set with the actors. But Weary River has music that flows from silent sequences into talking sequences. To allow that to happen the composer had to write music for the entire film after they had shot the silent sequences and edited them together but BEFORE they had shot the sound sequences. The composerconductor Louis Silvers who certainly deserved the big screen credit he got for his work would then have to record all the music for the edited silent sequences. Where the silent and sound sequences were to join together the conductor would have to record the music to a metronome beat this would allow the yettoberecorded sound sequence to join seamlessly with the silent sequence musically.At some point in this process the composer and director would have to collaborate in order to preplan the shot list for the sound sequences... because Weary River has a very sophisticated editing scheme for the visuals. There are a lot of different kinds of shot sequences leading into spoken dialogue. You don't just go from a silent sequence with musical score into a static shot with dialogue on a soundstage. There are many cuts pieces of business scene changes sound effects or synchronized spoken words all of which had to flow seamlessly into a spoken dialogue exchange in the film with unbroken music playing under it. That means a lot of planning charts diagrams. There is nothing spontaneous about the synchronized sound and music of Weary River. It's a choreographed dance of visuals and effects and music and dialogue all recorded live on a soundstage with actors on a set waiting for their cue. Did they have the conductor in a soundproofed booth with glass windows containing a metronome so that the click didn't get onto the sound track? Did they run edited film behind the orchestra with punches flashing the tempo while the actors waited on the nearby set for their cue to speak? There was clearly one sequence I saw where an actress had to sit with the orchestra and deliver her line in time to her own actions on a film playback which then flowed into a sequence shot live on a set with other actors. This is not a typical early talkie. The fluidity of the shots and the way the music synchronizes with them and works with the dialogue to create an integrated whole all recorded in one pass... mind boggling. Things flow together so seamlessly that you don't even realize what you're looking at.Compare Weary River with a 1929 film like The Vagabond Lover its shots and music integration are simplistic static nothing more than 2 or 3 cameras pointing at a band playing and singing. 1929's The Broadway Melody is exactly the same primitive camera positions and static shots and nothing very complicated.Weary River on the other hand is a much more sophisticated production... to achieve that fluidity that seamless integration of music and sound and imagery required some really extreme measures on the part of the production team given their technical limitations. I'm surprised it's not more highly regarded. In terms of technical achievement Weary River rates 10 stars.Unfortunately the music is not as memorable as King Kong or Bride of Frankenstein. But Weary River makes sound film look like silent film WITH a synchronized musical score and dialogue which is an amazing feat. Director Frank Lloyd won the Oscar for best director that year and he deserved it. In 1929 the team at Warner's was the best in the business when in came to sound films and Weary River is a technical tour de force. You won't see anything more fluid with background music until 1932's groundbreaking Love Me Tonight.".

	schema:reviewBody "This halfsilent halftalking film is a combination gangster prison and love story with some music thrown in as well and it handles this combination of disparate genres with great skill. No static longwinded film is this in fact it is full of both action and tenderness that kept me quite engaged throughout. Richard Barthelmess stars as gangster Jerry Larrabee and Betty Compson is his best girl Alice Gray. The two have great chemistry together but they are torn apart when Jerry is sent to jail for wounding an innocent bystander during a shootout with a rival mob. Inside prison Larrabee turns to music he composes the title song Weary River and is soon known as The Master of Melody. However once released he soon finds that people are more interested in his prison record than his musical abilities and he quickly loses his heart for reforming. All the while Alice who still loves him keeps her distance. She does this after having been convinced by the prison warden that Jerry will only be able to go straight if he stays away from the people in his old life including women like herself. Plus witnessing a hanging inside the prison rather drives the point home that Jerry's life itself may depend on it. Instead she waits patiently and admires his progress from afar. When he is released she buys tickets to his performances sits in the back out of sight and is heartbroken when she hears the audience mutter convict during his recitals rather than marvel at his talent.The end is a sweet one that even has the warden changing his mind about Alice as he enables their final reunion after she and the warden work together to keep Jerry from making a wrongheaded decision based on pride that could end with him going to the gallows.This all sounds like a conventional gangster tale and many parts of it have been done before but this one really has heart masterfully using both the mediums of sound and image. Its visuals include some great Jazz Age settings inside the night clubs that the gangsters frequent as well as a hanging done inside the prison where only the shadows of the prisoner the witnesses and the cleric leading the procession of the condemned can be seen. There's also a shootout in the dark with the smoke from the guns clearly visible and the sound of the bullets being heard maybe for the first time by the original audience.I'd highly recommend this one to anyone interested in films of this era.".

The Divine Lady was actually a silent film and Lloyd like everyone else in Hollywood was learning to master sound. Divine Lady was far better.Weary River tells the story of Richard Barthelmess who is a gangster who gets picked up after a shootout with a rival gang headed by Louis Natheaux. An innocent bystander is wounded and Barthelmess gets a trip up a Weary River.In prison with the encouragement of warden William Holden Barthelmess explores his musical talent. He leads the prison orchestra and sings his own song Weary River which becomes a hit. Not too much different from Elvis Presley with Jail House Rock. But it's that same old story about not making it on the outside and wanting to settle scores with Natheaux even with warden Holden and Barthelmess's former moll Betty Compson telling him to walk away and stick with the music business.I'm not sure if that was Barthelmess's actual voice used it wasn't bad but not all that good. He's billed as the Master Of Melody like Russ Columbo in a few years would be the Romeo of Song. Come to think of it in a few years Columbo would have been better casting than Barthelmess.Like so many silent stars Barthelmess was having trouble adjusting to sound and Weary River clearly shows it. It's a film that's not worn well over the years.".

	schema:headline " An Interesting Failed Experiment from the SilentToSound Transition Period";
	schema:reviewBody "Weary River was made in 1929 during that period following the success of The Jazz Singer when the Hollywood studios were trying to figure out how to use the new medium of sound and also trying to figure out what the heck audiences wanted  silents or sound pictures.With Weary River director Frank Lloyd tried to combine the two presumably to see if they would work together in the same film. The movie has a soundtrack with music and sound effects but throughout the film it switches back and forth between silent movie mode with dialogue given in title cards and sound movie mode where we can hear the characters speaking to each other. It's an interesting experiment but it doesn't really work. The story is too melodramatic.In Weary River Jerry Larrabee Richard Barthelmess is a gangster with a platinum blonde girlfriend Alice Gray Betty Compson. After he is framed by a rival gangster Spadoni Louis Natheaux Jerry is sent to prison where he is turned from the Dark Side by a fatherly idealistic warden played by the original William Holden.Jerry forms a prison band made of convicts who are so good they sound like a Hollywood studio orchestra and writes a song Weary River which becomes a big hit when it is broadcast on the radio. After his release Jerry tries to go straight but finds that vaudeville theater audiences are unwilling to accept him as an exconvict pianist. He returns to Alice and then must decide whether to keep on the straight and narrow path or return to the rackets and have it out with Spadoni.If this story had been a total silent movie from beginning to end it might have worked better. Silent movies could get away with more melodramatic stories like this. The problem in Weary River is that the silent scenes work better than the sound scenes.In the sound scenes the dialogue is so awful it sounds as if the characters took their words out of a bad 1920s stage melodrama. For example in a sound scene in the warden's prison office the warden gives Jerry a speech You must turn from your evil ways my son. It sounds very stilted and artificial. The warden does everything but say to Jerry Think of your poor mother and the grief you're putting her through. A later scene in the warden's office in silent mode works better because we can't hear the characters and we get the dialogue in subtitles.Later in the movie Jerry says to Alice Why honey! You're crying!  probably the ultimate clich of movie dialogue. Of course Hollywood writers had trouble with the scripts during this transition period. It took them a while to learn how to write good dialogue instead of writing title cards. 1952's Singin' in the Rain illustrated this problem brilliantly.In Weary River Richard Barthelmess and Betty Compson do okay as the leads but still seem to be doing silent movie acting. Whenever Jerry meets with his gangster friends or gets a lecture from the warden Barthelmess hunches his shoulders down and glowers at the other characters as if to say Okay I'm a gangster now. This kind of acting was necessary in the silent movies where emotions were conveyed through facial expressions not dialogue.The problem with Jerry's character is that he's not really a bad guy or an evil man He's a gangster but in his heart he'd really like to be a musician. He loves his girl too much to slap her with a grapefruit or to seek out other women. He doesn't even fire a gun in the movie although he comes close at the end. In the next few years after this film was made Edward G. Robinson James Cagney and Paul Muni would do a better job of defining gangsters as irredeemable violent criminals who took what they wanted when they wanted it.The movie is welldirected and it gives a good view of the Roaring Twenties with Jazz Age nightclub scenes speakeasy shootouts and some good scenes in the prison. But watching Weary River today it seems more like a movie that paved the way for other better films.".

When the United States joins Europe in the Great War aka World War I Barthelmess doesn't show as much interest in fighting for his country as he does in fighting for fame and fortune. He is told it's better to be a live champ than a dead soldier. Ms. O'Day tries unsuccessfully to draw out Barthelmess' patriotism. Then he is drafted...This film could stand to lose about 30 minutes of its running time during the early to midsections much is superfluous. The battle scenes are fine though except for some initial marching. The end is a flagwaving classic...The Patent Leather Kid is so named due to his slick combedback hairstyle which Barthelmess seemed to prefer for the remainder of his career. This was a big hit for Barthelmess who gets to use his great ability to make faces throughout he won a welldeserved Academy Award nomination in the Best Actor category. O'Day made an impression with her hysterical nursing scene. Stuttering trainer Arthur Stone as Puffy Kinch and romantic rival Lawford Davidson as Hugo Breen lead the supporting cast.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1917 New York City arrogant prizefighter Richard Barthelmess as The Patent Leather Kid is so charismatic he woos pretty shimmy dancer Molly O'Day as Curley Callahan even though she has attended a boxing match to root for Mr. Barthelmess' opponent. When the United States joins Europe in the Great War aka World War I Barthelmess doesn't show as much interest in fighting for his country as he does in fighting for fame and fortune. He is told it's better to be a live champ than a dead soldier. Ms. O'Day tries unsuccessfully to draw out Barthelmess' patriotism. Then he is drafted...This film could stand to lose about 30 minutes of its running time during the early to midsections much is superfluous. The battle scenes are fine though except for some initial marching. The end is a flagwaving classic...The Patent Leather Kid is so named due to his slick combedback hairstyle which Barthelmess seemed to prefer for the remainder of his career. This was a big hit for Barthelmess who gets to use his great ability to make faces throughout he won a welldeserved Academy Award nomination in the Best Actor category. O'Day made an impression with her hysterical nursing scene. Stuttering trainer Arthur Stone as Puffy Kinch and romantic rival Lawford Davidson as Hugo Breen lead the supporting cast.

It's a funny spirited and inventive film.It's nice to see that even swedes were caught up in the sixties and felt the charge of new ways of thinking and being. New ideas about social behavior youth and womens place in society were taken up in the Girls. It's refreshingly shown and not preachy. There's a lot of humour in it and the men get to say their opinions about women too so it's not onesided.Some reviewers here have commented on it as being dated. It is a product of it's time but some of the subjects it takes up are timeless. How much should a woman have to compromise with the male point of view? I think this is still a touchy subject. The film was controversial when it was released. It's not a traditional movie with a straight plot so some people might find it too unconventional. But there are three great performances by some of the best Swedish actresses ever Bibi Andersson Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom who are all so delightfully energetic lively and beautiful. They show different sides being a woman.The film is very much a 1968 film but it's worth seeing for the great black and white photography to see Sweden in the sixties for the actors and for the imaginative direction by Mai Zetterling. I love it!".

The story involves a production of Aristophanes' classic sex satire Lysistrata with the play reality and fantasy bleeding into each other in a series of obvious juxtapositions halfbaked metaphors and heavyhanded social commentary. Subtlety is not to be found here and the film's divebomb approach to the battle of the sexes is often grating and tedious. These actors are usually a joy to watch and they give it their all but they just can't overcome the material which comes off as another naive product of 60's progressiveness. The heart's in the right place but the execution is too irritating. Nice photography and a strong cast aren't enough.".

Mai Zetterling's movie THE GIRLS is an oddity within itself. Too obscure at times too serious for its own good it dissolves into a series of conversations each of its three leads have within themselves and how the play seems to mirror their own lives as well as their own growing dissatisfaction with the way things are in relation to women's position in society. Where the story takes its cue is in welding both the current times 1968 into a play that takes place thousands of years ago and making us the audience clearly understand that attitudes towards women continue to be the same even now. From the eye of someone coming into this movie nearly forty years after its release things have changed quite a bit  the story is automatically dated  but it would be an interesting debate to see just how far women have come since the rise of feminism in the early Seventies. On this note THE GIRLS is worth seeking out  not only because of its three strong female characters all of them uniformly brilliant in their different takes of women coming to terms with who they are. On a minus however are the fantasy sequences filmed in a bleached black and white which become almost impossible to assimilate because of the lack of any depth... it would have been best to make it a Bunuelian experience and leave the viewer wondering what was real or not. Even so for those who appreciate Swedish cinema this is lighter fare than Bergman and less introspective.".

	schema:reviewBody "The production year says it all. The movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. Every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society mainly the role of females in the working community the role of women vs men women as sex objects consumerism politics war etc. Every scene is commented upon by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses or by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no reminiscence of any plot or who the main characters actually were. It is the sort of movie where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers his speech or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act for of course the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience. Then we move swiftly on as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the male blowing of cars horns or rioting crowds and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any male Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasting leads Bibi Andersson Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard about before today. It is hard to believe how especially the face of Bibi Andersson owns the screen every single time she appears. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated bw often revelling in an overexposed ? dimensionless whitishness and you just never grow tired of watching the performers. How absurd that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire has nothing better to offer the 21st century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes. As mentioned I am not complaining. I could rewatch it tomorrow.".

Then we move swiftly on as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the male blowing of cars horns or rioting crowds and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any male Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasting leads Bibi Andersson Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard about before today. It is hard to believe how especially the face of Bibi Andersson owns the screen every single time she appears. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated bw often revelling in an overexposed ? dimensionless whitishness and you just never grow tired of watching the performers. How absurd that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire has nothing better to offer the 21st century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes. As mentioned I am not complaining. I could rewatch it tomorrow.";

Meeting a young man she then finds a plane ticket in her hand and a new life in Sweden a job an apartment and prospects. All is not what it seems. There shall be work there shall be housing and there shall be no escape. This is the stark frank and disturbing vision of the life of a young victim of the underground sex trade and in all its tone of realism of abject poverty despicable actions and of wanting to show that dreaming of a better life is not a crime but that life can shatter the illusion of a happy ending.";

	schema:headline " Lilja 4ever is as good as it gets";
	schema:reviewBody "It is not often that everyone is quiet after a movie at the cinema. Some were crying others did not know how to act ending up staring out in to the emptiness. For me nothing was the same after I did leave the cinema. I know that it sounds like a clich but I tell you it is not. Some of these people were laughing before they sat down but the haunting beginning of the movie did wake everyone up. Every day you do wake up when you are working you do hurry away maybe you take your children with you to leave them at the nearby kindergarten. If it is a holiday maybe you are of to meet some friends. In the evening you come home you are cooking and eating. Maybe you do sit down with your wife and kids watching a good TVshow. When the night comes you are wishing your child's a good night's sleep before you go to bed. It is not easy for you to know what is going on inside the apartment of your neighbour. The time that pass from the beginning to the end is the time the director Lukas Moodysson have to convince you that the reality is not as good as you may think or maybe you already know all to well.The reality of leading character Lilja becomes slowly a part of your reality. You can choose to see Lilja in two different points of view. You can see her as a part of a fairly tale and nothing more than her life story will disappear after the movie in your shower. Or you may see her as she is a picture of what life can do with people who are not as lucky as you a picture of other girls in the same situation as she. The great acting of the 15 year old Russian actress Oksana Akinsjina makes it possible. I did almost forget that she is not Lilja when I did see the movie it is heartbreaking when she is crying and when she is happy her smile is the most wonderful you have seen that day. But a few minutes later you may see pain in her eyes.  If you are thinking about what is happing in the movie you will understand her reactions. When it is painful then she cries without hope when it is too painful she doesn't seems to react at all exactly like you! and you don't need to imagine to feel the pain she have inside.The one that will become more close to her than anyone else is the street kid and male leading character Volodja act by the 12 year old Artiom Bogutjarskij his first movie. I have worked with street children and his acting is very authentic. When everything falls apart for Lilja Volodja becomes her last hope he is never leaving her in her mind he is always close. He is the one who is always there the one that catches her when she falls. Lukas said in an interview that Volodja are a shape of Jesus in the end you will understand. These parts are telling about the dreams of Lilja whom makes it easier to understand her vision of hope. Lukas is the best Swedish director now and maybe of all time. The integrity of his actors is intact that he manages to do it in a movie like this shows how good as a director he is. He has a moving respect for Oksana and the way he cares about her integrity is the thing that makes this movie worth looking. His manuscript is trustworthy and don't have any illogical lacks. Nothing is darker than it could be in the reality. All characters are three dimensional and even the evil characters are human even the victims are not just victims.You may wonder if the reality is this dark. In a article in a Swedish newspaper Lukas Moodyson told that he had spoken with a social worker and he was told that some mothers do sell their own kids for 1  to the sex industry. Though the movie is fictional and not about her many of the memorable things that are happening to Lilja in the movie did happen to Dangoule Rasalaite from Latvia between the 17th September 1999 and the 10th January 2000. Lukas read about her in an article. The reality is always worse than the fiction.The young actors do carry the weight of the movie with grace. Their acting against each other is moving it is a special chemistry between them. Lukas has the gift of finding the right persons for the characters in all is movies and Lilja 4ever is not an exception. Last Monday Lilja forever won 5 out of 6 gold beagles the most important Swedish film award it was nominated to Artiom was also nominated for best performance by an actor. The awards it won were for best movie best picture best manuscript best direction and the most important of them all best performance by an actress. Trafficking is the third biggest illegal industry in the world it makes this movie so important. Lukas Moodysson and Oksana did manage to wake up this nation to show that our reality is not as good as we thought. We can see it in the reactions of the cinema public how people are talking about it afterwards and in the newspapers. The Swedish government are working for the possibility to show this movie in schools all over the former Sovjet Union. Lukas has said that if this movie can convince one girl to make other decisions than Lilja and to many other young girls this movie was worth making.This movie is worth more than all the awards it has won and all the awards it will win. This movie can change your point of view it is that message of hope it brings.Josef Lundstrm".

	schema:headline " It is a lot more than a film concerning human traffic";
	schema:reviewBody "I like films that make one think. They don't answer one's questions but rather help one find the answers for oneself. Such films are so valuable because they explore the human mind and personality. Everyone has been involved in situations when one needs to know what the person in front of him or her is thinking. Lilja 4ever is a film that leads us in the dark world of a beautiful girl who has not yet grown enough to face the hardships of life let alone the hardships of life in a place like that she lives in. Although the film is much acclaimed because it raises the problem of human traffic it achieves much more than that. It raises the problems of human selfishness betrayal dignity hopelessness lie. It explores love and friendship. It conveys a simple but incredibly important message  we are those who are responsible.What fascinates me about European cinema is that it explores in great depth the human personality. Lilja 4ever employs an ordinary script and is directed in a way that at the time of watching one does not at all think about the director's work. Thus one can concentrate entirely on the plot on the development of the characters and their stories. For that I congratulate Lukas Moodysson.Critics acclaim the film because it concerns the problem of human traffic. However much of the film focuses on Lilja's life before she is forced into prostitution. During that time Moodysson carefully explains why many people end up leading such terrible lives. She is an innocent girl who knows almost nothing about life. In an unbelievably short period of time she is abandoned by her mother thrown out by her aunt betrayed by her friends cynically humiliated by her teacher. The only hope she has is her dream that one day she would be able to go to a beautiful country where she would meet hospitable people and have many opportunities. She is striving for happiness and tries to find it anywhere she can. Unfortunately the only people who offer their help are little Volodja and a deceitful man. Volodja is the little boy who finds the angel inside Lilja. Ironically the only person who truly likes and wants to help her is incapable of doing so. His life is as miserable as hers.Lilja is abandoned left to starve raped forced into prostitution and yet not one of these moments disturbed me as much as the smile on her face when she is lied by a person in whom she sees hope and salvation. In my opinion that is the single strongest and most substantial moment in the whole film.Lilja 4ever is a masterpiece in its own way. It changes perspectives ... It manages to explain how innocent and pure a prostitute's mind can be. How many of us relate words such as pure and innocent to prostitution? It urges us to be concerned to feel responsible and to believe in the importance of GOOD ...".

Different than Tillsammans and Fuckin ml in style but still absolutely fascinating. I could find only one minor flaw which is Lilya's makeup after the fall. But everything else was wonderful. I hadn't heard of Oksana Akinshina before but I have a strong feeling I will in the near future. She's really good. I was also amazed by the acting of the little boy.The frames come so strong that you start to empathize with Lilya after some point. By the end of the film I was feeling like she was my sister and I wanted to knock those procurers' heads off. I've heard the plot is based on a true story of a Lithuanian girl. I think it's not based on one single true story it's rather a blend of several true stories. There are many Lilyas Natalias Annas out there who are suffering a similar fate. It's so very sad to see how those innocent girls grow into prostitutes just because they're born in some particular country.Anyone with a heart will be touched and anyone with a taste on movies will be stunned by this movie. I'll buy the DVD as soon as it's available. It's a must have for any collection. One of the rare films I would watch more than once. Total 10.".

There is a marked distinction between prostitution and childadult sex slavery. The former is a transaction between 2 consenting parties who understand the implication of the deal what is known as the world's oldest trade while the latter is a crime of utmost human grothesqueness. It is almost in total contradiction to the thought that modern world has achieved civilised behaviour.The film portrays this to a very effective end. Kudos to the lead actress who brings out the desperation and tragedy of the Lilja's life with such depth. There were indeed many memorable scenes 2 which affected me deeply were when Viktor methodically asked Lilja for her fake passport and when Lilja was raped in the bathroom by Viktor the very next morning. Contrast this to the optimism and happiness she felt in the DutyFree area in the airport no means by a shopaholic and just when she woke up in the apartment in Sweden although it was as about as dreary as her home in Estonia. The methodical way Viktor asked for Lilja's passport is astounding. Lilja's obviously not his first prostitute and definitely not his last Viktor is also one of the many pimps who participates actively in this form of slavery. It is unimaginable the magnitude of this crime.The music as well as the way the camera was handled added very much more to the film. In the opening the music came on so loud and the camera so shaky you almost know the film would be unbearably painful in more ways than one.Powerful as the film is there are some parts which are admittedly over the top. Having Lilja and Volodya play ball with wings on the roof top is quite whimsical actually. But all said this was definitely a film worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lilja 4ever is an excellentlycrafted film created by and for Swedes to help stimulate public debate and redress the issue of the vulnerability of immigrant children. It's a cruel enlightening compelling watch for anyone in the West but it's most definitely not a movie for escapism it's not an After School Special and it's a world away from the endless contemporary assaultinsult of bald neocon propaganda on AngloAmerican screens.Unless you're very very dead inside Lilja 4ever will horrify you move you to tears and leave you speechless...at least in its immediate aftermath. And if you are dead inside the implicit subject is inexorable capitalist alienation and trauma so why not catch a representation of your own inner life on film? Maybe you can work it into a drinking game.Based on actual turnofthe21stcentury suicides of escaped postSoviet child prostitutes in the suburbs of Sweden Lilja 4ever is a welldone drama featuring terrific actingespecially by Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky. It presents moody and stark cinematography fine scriptwriting and solid direction. Lilja 4ever is not a documentary but its subject is relentlessly grim and real the tragic personal results of the continued desperate corrosion of Eastern European society and its tacit rapaciously opportunistic exploitation in the isolated commuter highwaybound suburbs of the West. For its success in making these links visible and cinematic Lilja 4ever is outstanding.I saw Lilja 4ever when it was released in Stockholm in 2002. You can't watch this particular movie waiting for some good oneliners to repeat to the guys around the water cooler. You may not be able to identify with Lilja. You don't need to feel like she could be your girlfriend. For this movie to work and to grasp who Lilja is you need to be able to feel human compassion sympathy and empathy and to recognize and appreciate the drama in our socioeconomic connections.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Lukas Moodysson has achieved a film that is so moving that it is hard to forget it after leaving the theater. Images come back into one's mind about this story about this girl. The tragedy of her life is something to be shocked and alarmed.To think there are out there in the socalled civilized world people that take advantage of girls like Lilja is mind boggling. Lilja's mother has to be one of the worst monsters ever presented in a film. This woman abandons her 16 year old daughter because she has found a meal ticket with a man that will probably end up leaving her as well.Lilja is beautifully portrayed by Oksana Akinshina. The actress and her character disappear in front of your eyes. The story is very true as thousands of naive girls are exported from what it was the old Soviet Union to other countries in order to force them into prostitution. This story is constantly in the news yet more and more young girls are duped into going abroad with the promise of highly paid jobs that exist only for the people who exploit them.Her only friend is Volodya also a very sad boy who is thrown out of his own house by an abusive father. Volodya and Lilja form a bond as they cling to one another. The little boy is street wise he knows the fate that awaits Lilja in Sweden. Their friendship is the only thing they both have.The sad part of the film is the realization that so called normal and perfectly respectful people are the same ones that brutalize these children. They use Lilja to satisfy their sexual appetites then discard her like yesterday's trash. To know that there are people like that in our society is a very sad commentary about our world.Contrary to what many people have commented about the film I thought that in spite of the tragedy of Lilja's and Volodya's lives it had a very positive ending because both are free to run around in a better place together which is not a luxury most of us have on our time in this planet.Mr. Moodysson gives us a film that will shock he dares to go where others wouldn't. A job well done..".

	schema:headline " Its story is completely devastating but I wouldn't want to miss a second of it";
	schema:reviewBody "I've said it before and I'll say it again the best movies never get the attention that they deserve. Take for instance this Lilja 4ever. It has never been in any large movie theater and is only shown on festivals or on specialized TV stations that broadcast more noncommercial movies. That's also how I got to see it. I knew about this movie but had never been able to give it a try until two days ago when it was finally shown on national television.Lilja is a 16 year old Estonian girl who will move with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend to the USA. But when it's about time to leave her mother tells her that she can't come with them right now. She will have to stay for a while following them to the USA afterward and until then her mother will send her money. But once they are gone it quickly gets clear that they have abandoned Lilja and don't want to see her ever again. She doesn't really have anyone to take care of her and has only one real friend the young boy Volodja. Completely out of money she decides to sell the only thing that she has left her body. She picks up older men in a disco until one day she meets Andrej a nice boy of her own age. She falls deeply in love with him and when he tells her that she can come with him to Sweden to find a wellpayed job and a beautiful apartment so she can start an entire new life far away of all the misery she is convinced that for once and for all her luck has changed...Just after I saw the movie I went to bed to get some sleep but the entire movie just kept spooking through my head all the time keeping me awake for hours. Even now I'm still thinking about the horrible faith of that poor girl. That has a lot to do with the excellent acting of course. Oksana Akinshina is a complete stranger to me but her performance was so incredibly good and so believable that you might easily forget that you are watching a movie instead of a real life documentary. Artyom Bogucharsky as Volodya Pavel Ponomaryov as Andrej Liliya Shinkaryova as Lilja's aunt... None of them is famous or has played in many other movies but one by one they play their roles as if they have never done anything else in their entire lives.Lilja 4ever isn't exactly a movie that will make you happy. I would even say that its story will leave you behind completely devastated but will also keep you thinking about Lilja for days after you've seen it. That's what happened to me and that's something that I haven't experienced too often yet. If you are strong enough to cope with the hard reality then you should definitely give this movie a try. In my opinion there is only one appropriate rating for a movie like this one and that is 1010!!!".

The men who sell and buy her are not concerned with who she is or why she is there. They don't want to know. They do their business and don't ask questions.There is not much doubt this could be a true story. Moodysson wrote the script after reading about a young girl an eastern European refugee under strange circumstances throwing herself off a bridge in Malm. Sex slavery trafficking is out of sight out of mind for most of us but is still very much in effect. And most of the people on the planet live very hard lives. The buying and selling of people is something that we all live with. We all sell ourselves to anonymous corporations we have to do it it is in the fabric of our societies. Liljas sale is on another scale of exploitation of course but it is also an extreme of what capitalism effectively means. Everything is a commodity.The movie tells the story of of a young girls destruction by brutal socioeconomic and individual forces both objectively and subjectively. While there is no big drama the story is told from the perspective of Lilja. There are a few weaknesses the portrayal of Lilja starts with things going bad and then they turn even worse. We don't get to know Lilja outside of hardships which probably enables us to differentiate ourselves from her. Also its a bit overexplicit in the depiction of the adult betrayal of Lilja. What if for example Liljas mother hadn't disappeared the way she does in the movie would that make the story much less tragic?Otherwise its a film that people should see there should be a 100 of these kind of movies made for every new strained meaningless J.Lo is pretty and wants romance or Arnie is strong rightfully angry and wants to kill somebody film.

	schema:reviewBody "Well thats how its ranked according to IMDb although having seen nearly all of the films above it I would have to disagree.Maybeit's because i wasn't really expecting anything special after i had bought the film that it hit me harder. I had liked Moodyson's previous film together but the sleeve did not inspire me at all the tale of a young Russian girl and how she befriends an 11 year old boy nothing to get too excited about there.Then i unleashed the juggernaut of a film into my DVD player. I wasn't really concentrating for the first few minutes but then got drawn in by the scene where Lilya who initially pretended that she wasn't affected by her mother leaving for America pleads with her not to go. She cries hysterically and does not stop. It is X rated emotion and one of the most incredibly powerful scenes i have seen anywhere.We then see Lilya's position go from bad to worse. Nearly every scene is touching and has a purpose. The acting is faultless the character development is amazing. Lilya is humiliated by everyone her teacher her peers the shopkeepers but always tries to maintain her dignity until it gets eaten away bit by bit. Brilliantly exemplified by her looking for the money that she had thrown into the bin as dirty money.This film is about betrayal and power. The betrayal of Lilya by her mother her aunt her supposed boyfriend and her betrayal of Volodya. It is also about Lilya's fight for power and how badly she fails. When she sells her body for the first time and gains some power we are almost relieved at least she can buy some necessities. When she becomes a slave we are devastated. It makes the film far more effective not knowing the ending. I didn't see it coming but like Lilya I should have. She wants her dreams so badly she remains in denial about the reality of her situation. It shows her faith in humankind is so strong that she is not cynical about the boys motives in taking her to Sweden.I was completely shellshocked after seeing this film and i cannot believe people aren't shouting from the rooftops imploring others to see it. Even though i cried for days after seeing this film i'm not actually an emotional person i wouldn't classify this as a depressing film. It makes you realize how lucky your life is and that you must enjoy to the full every moment of freedom that you have.Bad things happen to good people. The world is unfair. Volodya gets one present in his life a basketball from Lilya and that gets smashed by his father. Kids in the west get everything and appreciate nothing. There are psychopaths in Broadmoor who are truly evil who get hours of psychotherapy but Lilya's spirit lives on forever.".

When she sells her body for the first time and gains some power we are almost relieved at least she can buy some necessities. When she becomes a slave we are devastated. It makes the film far more effective not knowing the ending. I didn't see it coming but like Lilya I should have. She wants her dreams so badly she remains in denial about the reality of her situation. It shows her faith in humankind is so strong that she is not cynical about the boys motives in taking her to Sweden.I was completely shellshocked after seeing this film and i cannot believe people aren't shouting from the rooftops imploring others to see it. Even though i cried for days after seeing this film i'm not actually an emotional person i wouldn't classify this as a depressing film. It makes you realize how lucky your life is and that you must enjoy to the full every moment of freedom that you have.Bad things happen to good people. The world is unfair. Volodya gets one present in his life a basketball from Lilya and that gets smashed by his father. Kids in the west get everything and appreciate nothing. There are psychopaths in Broadmoor who are truly evil who get hours of psychotherapy but Lilya's spirit lives on forever.";

	schema:reviewBody "During this movie I felt more and more sorry for Lilja Oksana Akinshina a girl from the former Soviet Union. As the viewer you know what will happen with the poor girl because it seems so logical but from her point of view it is just a great opportunity that turns out to be something completely different. First her mother leaves her to go to America with a new husband. Lilja thinks she will travel after her mother some time later but that is not going to happen. Her only friend is Volodya Artyom Bogucharsky a young boy she hangs out with.Then she meets a boy who says he likes her. He invites her to come to Sweden with him start a life together. She has to go first he will travel after her again some time later. Volodya does not agree with it but she goes anyway. Arriving in Sweden she is picked up by an older man put in an apartment locked from the outside and we understand that the boy will not travel after her. The next day the man brings Lilja another man she must have sex with him. Finally it is clear for her sort of as it was for us all along.I guess there are thousands and thousands of stories like this and realizing that Lilja's story is even more sad. The way certain people use unhappiness of others is terrible and 'Lilja 4ever' shows us in a realistic way how easy it basically is. If you are as unhappy as Lilja every opportunity seems fantastic.There are two scenes that you will remember. The first shows us Lilja's face when the men are on top of her. She just lies there helpless without any reason to live. The second shows us the faces of the men that are on top of her. This montage lets us see the ugliness of those people what kind of animals the world knows. 'Lilja 4ever' is a sad movie but a good movie. Although we probably know that things like this happen it is not bad to realize that from time to time. 'Fucking ml' director Lukas Moodysson makes sure we do that with his movie.".

The only person who cares about her is the boy Volodja. Needing to be a prostitute to live she enters in a sub world that she will only find problems and disasters.The end is pessimistic and has a message of no hope but is realistic and also is the reality of most girls in the same situation.

Lukas Moodysson has made a magnificent and at the same time utterly heartbreaking movie. Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky both deserve awards for their roles in this film. Both give performances that put to shame about 99 of any mainstream actor you care to mention. I have to admit that I was reduced to tears by both of them. And then I felt angry followed by a sense of despair at their fate. Oksana Akinshina should have a great career ahead of her if she gets offered the right roles. So far all she has had is a part in The Bourne Supremacy. Maybe Hollywood is a little reluctant to upset their star system by using a Russian who can actually act as well as being attractive. Lilya 4 ever is not easy to watch but once you are watching it's impossible to look away. Trafficking in children and child prostitution is a serious problem that needs to be addressed by all governments but sadly very few are interested in doing anything about it. Maybe if this movie got the publicity it deserves something might happen. But don't hold your breath. Just watch this movie and cry for these victims of their circumstances and an evil trade.With the votes cast for Lilya 4 Ever it should be in the top 250 why is it being kept out?".

The biggest temptation is to say that Moodysson's first two films were optimistic and this is pessimistic in the extreme. However I am not quite so sure.

I feel like starting again. On the one hand the film is very moving but I didn't feel manipulated like I do with many Hollywood movies. I felt very angry at the way everyone who exploited Lilya acted so much so that I was ready to go out and kill the Swedish pimp if he'd been real. But still I did feel uplifted in a bleak way by the ending. Third attempt This bleak and depressing film will and should politicise you about the situation regarding the exploitation of children in the former Soviet Union and many other parts of the world. Go and watch the movie then do something about it. However Moodysson is still a skillful enough director to make this more than just a depressing polemic.The acting is as near faultless as you will find anywhere. The music as in all this director's films perfectly matches the action. It is an important film and it has an important message but it still works as art and as a movie. It's very hard to write a meaningful review. See it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the former Soviet Union the sixteen years old Lilja Oksana Akinshina is very happy because her mother is moving to USA with her boyfriend. However Lilja is left alone without money or family in a very poor apartment. She spends her time with her only friend the rejected boy Volodya Artyom Bogucharsky. Lilja begins to prostitute in a nightclub to survive where she meets a young man Andrei Pavel Ponomaryov who seduces her and invites Lilja to move with him to Sweden with a promise of a honest job and lodging. When she arrives in Sweden reality is not exactly as dreamed.Lilja is a heartbreaking family drama very realistic and one of the saddest film I have seen. The story of Lilja a needy girl that begins to sell her body to survive reflects the situation of many children in Third World countries. Brazil for example is combating the sexual tourism through campaigns but unfortunately still there are many children prostituting themselves. The way Lilja is treated like cattle and sent from one man to another is disgusting. The impressive performance of Oksana Akinshina deserved a nomination to the Oscar. The metaphor with angels is the beautiful part of this awesome and pessimist movie. Lilja is one of the best movies I have ever seen. In the end of the credits there is an important dedicatory. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Para Sempre Lilya Forever Lilya".

And there's no one in this movie who really tries to save her from being broken and abused as if we all were a part of this perverse system.

Miss Padovani's sequences seem rather abrupt and Miss Loren while startlingly beautiful gives a performance that is rather harsh and monotonous it's true she was only 20 when she made this but she soon showed herself a capable farceur and actress of considerably greater range.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie 'Drag' has nothing to do with crossdressing although there are some elaborate theatrical costumes seen in the later reels. The title reflects the fact that this story's protagonist  I can't quite call him the hero  is dragged down by his wife and his inlaws.'Drag' is yet another of the many many movies which somebody decided to describe as 'lost' without bothering to look for it. Last time I checked this film definitely exists. But it's easy to see how 'Drag' was permitted to fade into obscurity because this film is so very bad even as an historic artefact it's nearly worthless. Frankly many perhaps even most of Hollywood's socalled 'lost' films have vanished precisely because they weren't much good in the first place and therefore weren't much worth preserving. For every genuine cinematic masterpiece that appears to be gone forever such as Murnau's '4 Devils' there are a hundred or more reels of drivel such as 'Drag' that might exist in somebody's attic but aren't worth tracking down.'Drag' is an early talkie and  like several other films from the beginning of the sound era  its most creaking flaw is the underscripted dialogue. Silent films were made from scenarios rather than fullyfledged screenplays the scenarist would indicate the actions and the emotional states of the characters but wouldn't write extensive dialogue. One or two lines of dialogue might be included to convey the content of an entire sequence. Dialoguewriting was considered a separate skill entrusted to titlecard writers after the actors' footage was completed. Many of the early sound films were made in this same way with scenarios rather than scripts ... leaving the actors with insufficient dialogue to carry their scenes. The most notorious example of this was 'His Glorious Night' with John Gilbert desperately improvising variations on 'I love you' through an entire romantic sequence. Several scenes in 'Drag' feature actors speaking generic dialogue and then repeating the same lines a bit more desperately clearly unable to improvise beyond the meagre lines of the scenario. Matters are made worse in 'Drag' by extremely poor sound recording as well as the fact that some of these actors seem to have no experience with dialogue at all. This too was a hazard of the early talkie era.SPOILERS AHEAD. Richard Barthelmess plays David Carroll the publisher of a smalltown newspaper. The small town is Paris Vermont ... and there are some painful attempts to wring humour out of the fact that this hick town is named Paris. David is married to Allie ... but the marriage is a package deal because her inlaws are living with David too and cadging off him. The inlaws are Ma and Pa Parker and their son Charlie Parker who doesn't seem to realise he has the same name as a jazz saxophonist. David feuds constantly with his inlaws but his wife always takes their side.The only sympathetic citizen of Paris the one in Vermont is Dot a vivacious and artistic young lady who doesn't seem to be a native of this hick burg although it's hard to believe she voluntarily came here from elsewhere. Dot moves to New York City inspiring Dave to do the same. He walks out on his wife and her relations and he moves to Manhattan. With laughable ease David writes a play and gets it produced on Broadway! Conveniently Dot is the costume designer for the play so she and David will be spending lots of time together. Actually I've been peripherally involved in a couple of Broadway productions and I've never seen the playwright and the costume designer working together each has plenty of work to do in his or her separate craft without impinging on the other's.From this point the most obvious plot twist would be for David to sever all ties with his wife and the Parkers and start a new life with Dot. 'Drag' does something more surprising here but that's not really a point in its favour. Feeling tempted to dally with Dot David sends for his wife Allie to join him in New York so that he'll remain faithful to her. Even though Dot is a dilly he'd rather dally with Allie. What happens next is no surprise Allie's brother and parents show up too and once again they all move in with David. The payoff is quite dull.Despite the terrible script  really not much more than a scenario  I'll give the makers of this film some credit for attempting a story about a protagonist in an atypical situation. In the real world someone in David Carroll's situation would either stick with his wife or abandon her altogether. Richard Barthelmess showing more acting ability than this story deserves plausibly portrays David as a married man who is attracted to an exciting 'other woman' yet who still feels some love for and loyalty to his dull familiar wife. Barthelmess's attempt to balance his character's conflicting emotions is the only major point of interest in this film.Veteran character actor Lucien Littlefield is briefly impressive as David's fatherinlaw and Lila Lee is attractive and intelligent as Dot. All the other supporting actors are wooden and dull here. I was especially disappointed with Tom Dugan as David's brotherinlaw. Dugan would later achieve a solid career as a dependable character actor notably as the Hitler lookalike in 'To Be or Not to Be' but here he's barely recognisable and shows no glimmer of his later ability.'Drag' isn't the worst film I've ever seen but it's well down there. I'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10 mostly for Barthelmess's creditable attempt to navigate the pitfalls of a difficult role that's badly written. I'll make some allowance for the fact that this very poor talking picture was made at a time when nobody was an expert at making talkies.".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie 'Drag' has nothing to do with crossdressing although there are some elaborate theatrical costumes seen in the later reels. The title reflects the fact that this story's protagonist  I can't quite call him the hero  is dragged down by his wife and his inlaws.'Drag' is yet another of the many many movies which somebody decided to describe as 'lost' without bothering to look for it. Last time I checked this film definitely exists. But it's easy to see how 'Drag' was permitted to fade into obscurity because this film is so very bad even as an historic artefact it's nearly worthless. Frankly many perhaps even most of Hollywood's socalled 'lost' films have vanished precisely because they weren't much good in the first place and therefore weren't much worth preserving. For every genuine cinematic masterpiece that appears to be gone forever such as Murnau's '4 Devils' there are a hundred or more reels of drivel such as 'Drag' that might exist in somebody's attic but aren't worth tracking down.'Drag' is an early talkie and  like several other films from the beginning of the sound era  its most creaking flaw is the underscripted dialogue. Silent films were made from scenarios rather than fullyfledged screenplays the scenarist would indicate the actions and the emotional states of the characters but wouldn't write extensive dialogue. One or two lines of dialogue might be included to convey the content of an entire sequence. Dialoguewriting was considered a separate skill entrusted to titlecard writers after the actors' footage was completed. Many of the early sound films were made in this same way with scenarios rather than scripts ... leaving the actors with insufficient dialogue to carry their scenes. The most notorious example of this was 'His Glorious Night' with John Gilbert desperately improvising variations on 'I love you' through an entire romantic sequence.

This bothered me because the first segment of the film left me wanting more of the same story and I would have been disappointed if the screenplay had never come back to it. However the first few segments that seem at first to be unrelated begin to mesh in a fluid way but never in a way that feels forced and what happens in one begins to illuminate the actions and feelings in another.Because of it's episodic nature the actors don't get a lot of room to flesh out their characters but the performances are still strong.

	schema:reviewBody "In 13 Conversations About One Thing' the one thing' that everyone keeps having conversations about is whether or not happiness is possible in a world that seems to be made up of little more than a series of random events haphazardly strung together.  Just as everything seems to be going your way an unexpected and unforeseen event' may knock you completely off course thereby depriving you of that happiness' you felt moments before lay just within your grasp.  This view of life seems to be rather popular among filmmakers this year having also been explored in some depth in the scifi thriller Signs' this summer.  13 Conversations' takes a more lowkeyed approach providing a series of interlocking vignettes from everyday life that when pieced together provide a possible answer to life's ultimate question.  Writers Karen and Jill Sprecher the latter also directed the film have fashioned a complex narrative involving a number of characters whose paths cross in bizarre and often shocking ways.  In fact the film is rather unique in that the structure actually BECOMES the theme as we discover that events that seem random to us  and indeed to the characters  at the outset actually come together to form a meaningful pattern.  As one character says at the end of the film life really only makes sense when we take the time to look back on it for it is only from that perspective that we are able to discern the overarching pattern and meaning of it all.All of the many characters in the film are struggling not only to define happiness but to attain a measure of it for themselves in a world in which they are made to feel like mere helpless pawns blown about by the whims of fortune' luck' chance' fate' whatever one wants to call the power' that seems to determine the courses our lives end up taking.    Matthew McConaughey plays a handsome and successful public defender who feels that he has achieved happiness in his career only to have it ripped from him when he runs over a young woman at a corner and leaves the scene of the crime. The woman herself Clea Duvall before the accident is a sincere believer in a higher power that watches over us and guides us along the path it most wants us to take.  Yet after the accident she loses that belief coming instead to see life as a chaotic jumble of chance circumstances devoid of meaning and purpose.  John Turturro plays a college professor suffering from the classic symptoms of major midlife crisis.  He abandons his wife Amy Irving conducts a meaningless affair with a coworker and finds no relevance or fulfillment in his teaching job or in the students he could be guiding and helping.  As a Physics teacher he knows that the universe is NOT random that it does in fact operate within a series of finely proscribed natural laws.  Perhaps this is why he is the one character who actually tries to buck fate' and to take proactive measures to change the course of his life.  The problem is that the course change brings him no more satisfaction than did his previous life path.  Perhaps most fascinating of all is Alan Arkin a businessman so unhappy with his own life that he takes pleasure in ruining the life of a coworker who seems somehow to have attained the happiness that has eluded the rest of us.13 Conversations About One Thing' is definitely a movie that grows on you. Like Go' a few years back the makers of this film respect the intelligence of their audience.  They gather the strands of their story slowly thereby allowing us to make connections and to eventually come up with the theme on our own.  As the film's director Jill Sprecher never hurries us along.  In fact much of the profundity of the screenplay is brought out by the elegiac lyrical tone she establishes throughout.  The quiet unhurried pacing of the scenes puts the audience into a reflective state of mind that helps us see beneath the deceptively simple surface of the film's action.McConaughey Duvall Turturro and Irving are all outstanding in this film but it is Arkin who soars in the key role of the disgruntled businessman. His sadfaced understated portrayal of a man so caught up in petty bitterness that he will willfully destroy a harmless fellow human being to make himself feel a bit less miserable is shattering in its brilliance.  He has truly never been better.   Ditto for the other actors for this is a great ensemble cast even though most of the performers never appear in any scenes together.13 Conversations About One Thing' is a film that feels like it has REALLY BEEN THOUGHT OUT ahead of time not thrown together in haphazard fashion as so many other films appear to be.  And that given the theme of the film is exactly the point.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's rare that a film by an independent filmmaker can pack such a lot in the way of human interaction. Jill Sprecher inspired by a mugging she suffered cowrote the story in which her movie is based with her sister Karen. Ms. Sprecher shows an insight that is rare in the young directors starting in the business today.If you haven't watched the film please stop reading.The basic idea for the movie seems to be how interconnected we human beings are. This premise is expanded as we watch how all of the characters we see in the film in one way or another share a moment in their existence where they touch each other's lives without even being aware of the fact. Ms. Sprecher weaves a fine web as she shows the different situations in the movie.Troy the selfcentered lawyer touches Gene's life when both are drinking for different reasons at the same bar. Gene is older and wiser at the time they meet Gene is feeling sorry for himself having being downsized from his job. Troy being in high spirits after having won a case in court looks down to Gene a man who he perceives as a loser. Troy's own life will go through it's own turmoil after the involuntary accident where he injures a young woman in a deserted street. Instead of helping her he flees the scene leaving the girl to what could be a sure death.Gene is the center of the story in many ways. We see him as the man in charge of an insurance claims department. There is a man who works for Gene that is the epitome of good naturedness a real kind person who is always bringing things for everyone in the office. When Gene is asked to reduce costs in his area he fires Bowman the man who according to logic must be let go first being the last one hired. We wonder for a moment if this is just a way for Gene to get back at Bowman because it appears this man irritates him and his coworkers. Bowman who up to that moment has been so optimistic about things immediately becomes a sad man.Walker the university professor is unhappily married to Patricia. We watch both as their marriage comes to an end. Walker is carrying on an affair with another woman from work he ends up living alone in a small room. Not only does he lose his wife but Helen too the woman he was having the affair with. His life and Troy's meet if only briefly when he buys the lawyer's car. Walker is in a way responsible for the death of one of his students who is not doing well in the Physics course.Then there is Bea the young woman who cleans rich people's houses. Together with Dorrie she fantasizes what it would be like to live in one of those fabulous places. Bea who almost died when she was a child is not bitter about her experience. She is a kind soul who is good to everybody no matter who. Her life and Troy's become entwined in a second without realizing or knowing him as his car hits her in the desolate street where she is walking to the house of one of her employers to return the shirt she has just finished resewing for him. After going to her mother's home from the hospital we see a gradual transformation in Bea. She's still a kind person but now she has a different attitude toward life and the bad hand she was dealt.This film brought to mind Arthur Schnitzler's play La Ronde since the idea is basically the same. We humans tend to overlook the relation we have with one another and how in some ways we touch the life of other people the same way they touch ours. The acting is first rate. Ms. Sprecher ought to be congratulated in the way she is able to present her story and get outstanding acting by all the principals and even those in small roles. Alan Arkin as Gene is amazing. We see in his face how everything is affecting him at all times. John Turturro gives a complex reading of this university professor. Clea DuVall brings such a luminous aura to Bea that it's impossible not to feel bad for what has been done to her she gives a subtle performance. Matthew McConaughey's depiction of Troy is good.There are a lot of minor roles by actors of the stature of Shawn Elliott Frankie Faison Tia Texada Rob McElhenney Barbara Sukowa and William Wise who is perfect as Bowman.Congratulations are in order to Jill Sprecher who shows a talent for directing real people in real situations. Judging by this effort she has the potential of going far.".

Bowman who up to that moment has been so optimistic about things immediately becomes a sad man.Walker the university professor is unhappily married to Patricia. We watch both as their marriage comes to an end. Walker is carrying on an affair with another woman from work he ends up living alone in a small room. Not only does he lose his wife but Helen too the woman he was having the affair with. His life and Troy's meet if only briefly when he buys the lawyer's car. Walker is in a way responsible for the death of one of his students who is not doing well in the Physics course.Then there is Bea the young woman who cleans rich people's houses. Together with Dorrie she fantasizes what it would be like to live in one of those fabulous places. Bea who almost died when she was a child is not bitter about her experience. She is a kind soul who is good to everybody no matter who. Her life and Troy's become entwined in a second without realizing or knowing him as his car hits her in the desolate street where she is walking to the house of one of her employers to return the shirt she has just finished resewing for him. After going to her mother's home from the hospital we see a gradual transformation in Bea. She's still a kind person but now she has a different attitude toward life and the bad hand she was dealt.This film brought to mind Arthur Schnitzler's play La Ronde since the idea is basically the same. We humans tend to overlook the relation we have with one another and how in some ways we touch the life of other people the same way they touch ours. The acting is first rate. Ms. Sprecher ought to be congratulated in the way she is able to present her story and get outstanding acting by all the principals and even those in small roles. Alan Arkin as Gene is amazing. We see in his face how everything is affecting him at all times. John Turturro gives a complex reading of this university professor. Clea DuVall brings such a luminous aura to Bea that it's impossible not to feel bad for what has been done to her she gives a subtle performance. Matthew McConaughey's depiction of Troy is good.There are a lot of minor roles by actors of the stature of Shawn Elliott Frankie Faison Tia Texada Rob McElhenney Barbara Sukowa and William Wise who is perfect as Bowman.Congratulations are in order to Jill Sprecher who shows a talent for directing real people in real situations. Judging by this effort she has the potential of going far.";

I have watched it a few times and each time it inspired me and made me think.  The dialogue was economic the shooting exact.  The music was brilliant.  Casting was terrific and acting excellent.  The DP and gaffing work were masterful as the film's colors were so clean and fresh it made you think it wasn't New York City but rather any city  allowing the story to breathe and blossom.  That is a real achievement for a film set in NYC.  In short everything in the film was just as it should be  fitting its own story perfectly representing its thoughts its characters its themes with seemingly effortless grace and poetry.  I am amazed that the Sprecher sisters aren't major household names with six picture studio deals  they are talented filmmakers with a unique creative voice.  It is frustrating today that the lowest common denominator of blockbuster fare seem often to be given more money and coverage than filmmakers like the Sprechers who make true gems.  13 Conversations is intelligent moving and beautiful.  Definitely a film to make sure to see.".

The structure is reminiscent of a John Sayles film but this is top notch writing and character development. Directed by Jill Sprecher who also wrote the script with her sister Karen and has a number of very good actors who help raise the level of the material. The film seems to be about characters who make decisions then have to live with the consequences of their actions. Matthew McConaughey is a lawyer who after winning a big case and celebrating hits a woman Clea DuVall with his car and leaves the scene of the crime. John Turturro is a teacher who decides to have an affair. Alan Arkin gives the strongest performance in the film which is no surprise. He works in an insurance office and must let someone go and decides it will be a man who is always happy. This has always irritated Arkins character. He simply cannot understand how anyone could be happy all the time. Later he feels guilty about his actions and tries to get him another job at another company. Sprecher does a good job of keeping the script simple without going over the top to satisfy a more shallow audience. This is a film that gets more interesting when viewed on more than one occasion. Definitely a film that can be discussed at great lengths considering the realistic and flawed nature of each character.".

They start with the simple question of happiness in a life and come at it from multiple directions surrounding and probing it. The characters are secondary to the writer's curiosity and the 'stories' even more incidental. Sometimes you have a film that works with the viewer to grow a world and ideas here you simply watch as ideas grown on a page are revealed to you. Quite different precious but never close to lifealtering or even viscerally engaging.The film itself superficially resembles a 'Short Cuts' or 'Things You Can Tell' in that many story lines are interwoven. But the differences are profound. Altman's projects are driven by characters and situations that touch because they ramble. The 'Things You Can Tell' project is similar to this one in that its several components are all about the same idea. But 'Things' uses the device of one woman in many bodies each with a different actress. In this project the device is deliberate diversity of the characters each facet having a discernible face.I liked it. Its not highly cinematic rather small theater. Its not the stuff that changes one's imagination. But it is literate refined and well woven in terms of the words.As to the actors and their roles one thing all these multifaceted projects have is the option for the viewer to select a backbone. As a matter of hardwiring we reflexively choose one thread as foreground and the others as background. For me the anchor was Beatrice which probably tells you a lot about me. The resurrection from disillusionment with the opening of the doll's eye! was a bit heavy so far as the character but DuVall as an actor really impressed me. All of these actors played characters with an unrecognized inner life. Some like Turturro work with more selfreferential techniques but with her it seemed true.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

Through this nonchronological connection line the viewer participates of their personal dramas all of them relative to happiness and how unpredictable life is. In a moment each character has a moment of happiness or expectation of a good event in his life which is changed later due to some unexpected occurrence. The question is Can we be happy in a world where our destiny is governed by uncertainties?' This movie is a very bitter and profound story about happiness and unpredictability of life. I saw this movie yesterday on cable television and my vote in IMDB User Rating was seven. However I intend to see this film again maybe on DVD and reevaluate my review. I was not aware of the theme of this complex and almost unpleasant story and maybe my first impression was unfair. The direction and the performance of the cast are outstanding highlighting the acting of the always excellent Alan Arkin.Title Brazil Treze Vises' Thirteen Visions'".

In a moment each character has a moment of happiness or expectation of a good event in his life which is changed later due to some unexpected occurrence. The question is Can we be happy in a world where our destiny is governed by uncertainties?' This movie is a very bitter and profound story about happiness and unpredictability of life. I saw this movie yesterday on cable television and my vote in IMDB User Rating was seven. However I intend to see this film again maybe on DVD and reevaluate my review. I was not aware of the theme of this complex and almost unpleasant story and maybe my first impression was unfair. The direction and the performance of the cast are outstanding highlighting the acting of the always excellent Alan Arkin.Title Brazil Treze Vises' Thirteen Visions'";

Even though the movie seems complicated it has a simple and basic answer to a hard and unfeeling world That faith and optimism are the best reasons to get through life no matter how difficult it is. The movie moves back and forth in time with Gene English Alan Arkin and Troy Matthew McConaughey in the bar scene at the start and end of the film. Gene runs an insurance office that's in danger of being downsized because of a bad rating it got from an research agency. Gene also has problems with his son Ronnie Alex Burnes who's a drug addict and is in and out of court for committing act of larceny to support his habit. On top of all that Gene also has a broken marriage and all those things makes him very unhappy and sarcastic with the people that work in his office especially those who seem to have a better outlook on life then Gene does. When Gene's told by higher ups to cut down on his staff by letting go those who he feels that he can do without Gene cut the most happiest and optimistic person in the office Wade Bowman William Wise. Wade to Gene's surprise take it a lot easier then he expected him to which makes Gene almost wish that he would be more like Wade. Later after Gene's told that there was a vicepresident slot opened for him to fill he himself was laidoff. What Gene saw in Wade and how Wade later in the movie got back on his feet by not feeling sorry for himself and with Wade not knowing it Gene's help Gene's outlook on life changed for the better. Which made him a wiser if less richer person and seemed to help Gene overcome his sarcasm and bitterness that made him almost impossible to get along with. There's Walker John Turturro a collage psychics professor who's cheating on his wife Patricia Amy Irving by having an affair with Helen Barbara Sukowa. Helen is also married and a teacher in the collage where Walker works. When Patricia finds out about Walker's affair she leaves him. Walker also loses Helen when she goes back to her husband to keep him from killing himself after he also found out about her and Walker. Hurt and bitter Walker seems to take out his troubles and frustrations on one of his students Chris Hammond Rob McElhenney who ask for help from Walker because of problems that he has at home as well as in school. Being cold and sarcastic toward Hammond's pleas for help and understanding leads Hammond to commit suicide. This has Walker see what his being so selfcentered and selfish and thinking only about himself and what's best only for himself can do to all those around him. Troy is a hot shot DA who just won a big case. After celebrating in a local bar with a couple of drinks Troy hits a young woman Beatrice Clea Du Vall with his car and leaves her for dead instead of trying to get help. Troy becomes so overcome with guilt over what he did that his whole outlook on him being a DA and putting people away in jail takes a whole new meaning to him. Troy loses his ability to do his job and wants only to find the women that he left for dead and make up for what he did to her.Beatrice the woman who Troy ran over is a sweet and quiet girl who works as a cleaning lady and whatever free time she has goes to church to sing in the church quire. Beatrice always believed that people are good and feels that there are miracles in the world. In a lot of ways Beatrice didn't grow up and develop the cynicism that most people develop by seeing the world for what it or what we feel it is A cold and unforgiving place. Beatrice loses that childlike belief after her accident and later which to Beatrice was even worse after she was released from the hospital. It was then that a person that she worked for accused Beatrice of stealing his expensive watch which to his shock and embarrassment she showed him where she put it in his dresser draw. Hurt and depressed by losing her faith in all that's good in the world and in peoples goodness one cold afternoon Beatrice just wanted to step off the sidewalk and into the dangerous city traffic and end it all. It's then when she saw a man across the street looking at her with a smile on his face and as if he read her mind subconsciously telling her that there's still good in the world and that her life is unique and worth living and not to foolishly throw it away. Like a miracle this man restored her faith and got Beatrice out of her depression that almost drove her to kill herself. Wade Bowman who always saw the good and positive side of life no matter how bad things got for him and not only uplifted himself but also uplifted everyone else no matter how down and out they were who came in contact with him had me thinking. This made me start to wonder who just was that man who's smile cut through all the cold and selfishness that gave Beatrice back her faith in human values and goodness. This when she thought that it was no longer true and valid after what she went through? I just wonder who that man was?".

She and her friend are barely surviving on wages while they reflect on those whose expensive apartments and penthouses they clean. Bea develops a crush on an architect which comes to bear later in the story.The academics is the second category here. John Turturro as Professor Walker a brilliant yet suppressed physics professor. He has an affair and his wife wellportrayed by Amy Irving becomes fed up.The attorneys third segment of story encompasses Matthew McConaughey as Troy a slick and successful Assistant D.A. who at first is arrogant selfassured and impermeable to life. He thinks until he is affected by a random accident.The insurance adjusters another group and the more amusing segment. Sardonic Alan Arkin again delivers as Gene running a department for 2030 years hating his job and resenting those who whistle while they work. He is redeemed as a character however in that he tries to be a good father has been through an egodeflating divorce and bails his son an addict out of prison time and again. Frankie Faison is also a good character here as Dick Lacey another part of Arkin's group who sees the pointlessness of the insurance profession.Each character in one way or another affects the other. Like ripples subtly. Professor Walker realizing the futility of the affair questions one of his students why he wants to be a doctor. This leads to later results which I won't divulge.Arkin fires a man he at first resents then pities. Bea Duvall at first a happy rather naive character changes after an accident. Troy McConaughey at first denies his reality then comes to terms with it under a stark realization.This film written by Jill Sprecher and her sister was written after she in real life had an injury resulting from an accident. It is an interesting and human story. This is also in the rare category of films which the story will stay with you. You will recall its theme as it comes through in dayto day life.The mind is its own place it can make heaven of hell or hell heaven Milton Highly recommended. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing I can say for certain about the folks who love this movie they've never taken a college physics class!Above all an indie film like this has to be true.  Drop in a scene that plays false and you risk losing the viewer for good.  It's a testament to what's good about this film that it manages to survive some absolutely terrible chunks.To say that John Turturro's scenes as a college physics professor are unbelievable if you've ever studied physics is a massive understatement. In fact to say that they bear no relationship whatsoever to anything that might conceivably happen in a college physics classroom is still an understatement.  Moving from acceleration to entropy in the middle of a lecture?  C'mon.  And his final rant about the nature of physics expresses a mindset exactly opposite the attitude any actual physics professor would have.  It is however the mindset you'd expect a physics professor to have if you were a screenwriter who not only had no idea what physics was actually about but were too lazy to have your script vetted by someone who did. This storyline if excerpted would be a C student film.  Making a C student film starring John Turturro and Amy Irving  that's a triumph of awful screenwriting.I don't know whether it's Matthew McConaughey himself or just Jill Sprecher's direction but he gives one of the worst least subtle performances of the last few years.  Did I ever really believe him in either his ontopoftheworld or downinthedumps mode?  Not for an instant.  Of the thousands of human beings I've ever known has anyone telegraphed their emotions so obviously?  No.  Little things too.  Are they any college professors who still smoke?  Would Turturro's obsessivecompulsive neatfreak have an affair with the one in a hundred who did?  Would rich people tolerate their housekeepers smoking in their homes as Tia Texada's character does?  If there's an indie film God He's in the details and so many of the details in this film are thoughtlessly wrong or in many cases forced into wrongness for some desired effect.What's good?  Alan Arkin is terrific.  His storyline thankfully the predominant one is a little cartoonish and credulitystretching but it works great at the level of fable.  Clea DuVall is always worth looking at though her character transformation like McConoughey's is rather too broad. The movie dares to tackle the big issues of Happiness and Fate  Luck the conversations are really about two things it seems to me and can't help being thoughtprovoking  even if most of the talk strikes me as being merely pseudoprofound.And finally of course some of us are suckers for this sort of story structure which Magnolia comparisons notwithstanding was actually perfected by Philip K. Dick in early novels like THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE.  The casual interweaving of the four separate stories is very nicely done.610 and not recommended if you're not a fan of this story structure . . . 710 if you are or if you're a big Alan Arkin fan and you should be on both counts!.".

I noticed that writers of the bad reviews for this movie fall into two categories 1 this movie was too intellectual 2 not intellectual enough.  For the few who wrote about how this movie failed at its attempt to convey its message or was too oversimplified I suggest you relegate yes relegate yourself to reading Hume Schopenhauer and Rawls in between your yoga lessons and trips to the organic grocery store.  For the other group it's understandable to not want to sit through a movie about the challenges in life.  Many want to go the movies to escape and see a story.  I have no problem with that... if I payed 10 bucks and didn't know I was walking into a philosophy lecture I'd be mad too.  This movie is not for everybody.However let's not overlook the fact that the film masterfully accomplishes what it set out to do which is to explore the way people live their pursuit of happiness and how both internal and external forces affect their outlook.  Alan Arkin is magnificent and the technique of opening each sequence with a quote was nice as well though originally done in Hannah and Her Sisters I do believe.See this film and talk about it afterwards.  To me there are two definitions of a great film 1 you have to talk about it afterwards 2 one you can't bear the thought of not seeing again.  This film fit both.".

I believe this is the 'one thing' they were referring to in the title but it probably would take a 2nd viewing to determine what that 'one thing' is. I'm usually a sucker for offthewall unique stories that don't really end up anywhere but with this one you're left shaking your head almost from the beginning to the end and you figure with a unique title like this we ought to be able to figure what that 1 thing was and what the 13 conversations are. Well this is not the case at least not for me. We basically start the movie with John Turturro's story of being a late to home husband with a bruise on his eye that came from some encounter a few days before then we're brisked off to McConaughey's piece about a positive man who runs into some bad luck following a sermon he gives to a man at the bar about him not ever being unhappy. The rest of the stories interweave into each other before it's all done which is an interesting concept but it's been done much better in other films. Alan Arkin's the man at the bar and his story is confusing to say the least. He's a mean boss who can't stand happy people. His daughter ends up being intertwined into another story and another story is about a couple of women who clean houses for a living and one of them gets into an accident that changes her life for the worse. Sorry about the rambling but I thought I should give others all the information and see if they can come up with anything. Good luck if you choose to view this and let me know if you could figure out more than I did.".

I on the other hand watched this movie for the first time expecting the worst and most guilty kind of entertainment and was more than pleasantly surprised by the dark tones and impeccable performances. I'm a harsh critic and if you don't trust me check out the link to Ebert's review of this film via 'external reviews'. Murphy and Fanning are a refreshing duo in a buddy film and like many female buddy films Uptown Girls is unfairly abused and underrated. If you are trying to sound pretentious you probably shouldn't admit to liking this film. However if you honestly found this film entertaining and in some small respect refreshing you should admit the merit of this 'chick flick'. Murphy should be commended for choosing roles like Molly and her character in Little Black Book because in a sea of fantasy and escapism there is an aspect of actual female representation written by women and made for women. Boys if you want to win points with the ladies stop letting your testosterone take over your actual pleasure gauge and attempt to see the positive attributes of films such as this one. Trust me it will do no good in the long run to hide your opinions on the basis of reputation and ornery stoic persuasion.".

Brittany Murphy is an irresponsible girl who suddenly has to face up to reality when she's evicted from her home has to get a job babysitting a pampered rich girl Dakota Fanning who also has to face up to reality and by the end Murphy becomes a responsible mature person and Fanning loosens up and acts more like her age.  Blah blah blah.  There are moments of truth that work despite spawning from cinematic contrivances.  There are in fact a lot of spoiled girls like Fanning's character who get whatever they want simply because the mothers or fathers don't want to deal with them.  That's also why I wish the film could've developed Heather Locklear's character more thoroughly since she's the reason why her daughter acts the way she does.  But the film does have a lot of contrivances that are corny and predictable which is why I give it merely an aboveaverage rating.  Plus Fanning's snooty sarcasm gets terribly annoying at times.  I always hated watching that moment in all the previews where she'd say Newsfelash!  All in all Uptown Girls is a fluffy superficial feelgood comedy that doesn't fail to entertain and I will recommend it for a rental.  My score  6 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Just Another Chick Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Uptown Girls does have its moments but in the end it's a disappointment. Molly Gunn is the spoiled freewheeling daughter of a late rock legend. However when her inheritance is stolen by her manager Molly is forced to get a job. She becomes a nanny to Ray Schleine an eightyearold going on forty who lives with her mother. Ray has grown up with a revolving door of nannies and too little stability. Molly and Ray both feel painfully alone in the world but as they try to make their new arrangement work each discovers in the other a true friend. The plot sounds interesting and with two fine actresses this could have been a really good film. The story turned out to be weak though as there was really nothing new about it. The film was also really predictable and it was really no fun to watch. Yes there were some funny moments and some touching moments but you don't really feel for the characters as most are selfish and annoying. I thought it was going to be a good film as Brittany Murphy is a good actress. A lot of people don't like her but I think she has talent and will one day become a huge star. She did a decent job in this film but this isn't her best performance. Dakota Fanning did a good job of playing a really annoying character and she really is a good actress. The rest of the actors don't really matter as the film mainly focuses on Dakota and Brittany. Though some actresses worth mentioning that have smaller roles are Heather Locklear and Marley Shelton. Boaz Yakin does a decent job of directing again nothing special. I think the story turned out to be a little unrealistic which is okay. But sometimes it would become too much to take seriously. Also some of those serious scenes were actually funny not because of lousy acting but because of cheesy dialog. It really did turn into one big clich film which I wasn't expecting. This movie could have been more then just some regular chick flick but after a promising start it quickly goes somewhere we have been before. At least its short so that help matters but it also means the story is rushed. Despite how much I like Brittany Murphy I just can't recommend this film but it its better then Just Married. In the end this is another chick flick that's only worth watching if you are a diehard fan of Dakota or Brittany. If you're not then just skip this movie. Rating 5.410".

	onyx:emotionText "Uptown Girls does have its moments but in the end it's a disappointment. Molly Gunn is the spoiled freewheeling daughter of a late rock legend. However when her inheritance is stolen by her manager Molly is forced to get a job. She becomes a nanny to Ray Schleine an eightyearold going on forty who lives with her mother. Ray has grown up with a revolving door of nannies and too little stability. Molly and Ray both feel painfully alone in the world but as they try to make their new arrangement work each discovers in the other a true friend. The plot sounds interesting and with two fine actresses this could have been a really good film. The story turned out to be weak though as there was really nothing new about it. The film was also really predictable and it was really no fun to watch. Yes there were some funny moments and some touching moments but you don't really feel for the characters as most are selfish and annoying. I thought it was going to be a good film as Brittany Murphy is a good actress. A lot of people don't like her but I think she has talent and will one day become a huge star. She did a decent job in this film but this isn't her best performance. Dakota Fanning did a good job of playing a really annoying character and she really is a good actress. The rest of the actors don't really matter as the film mainly focuses on Dakota and Brittany. Though some actresses worth mentioning that have smaller roles are Heather Locklear and Marley Shelton. Boaz Yakin does a decent job of directing again nothing special. I think the story turned out to be a little unrealistic which is okay. But sometimes it would become too much to take seriously. Also some of those serious scenes were actually funny not because of lousy acting but because of cheesy dialog. It really did turn into one big clich film which I wasn't expecting. This movie could have been more then just some regular chick flick but after a promising start it quickly goes somewhere we have been before. At least its short so that help matters but it also means the story is rushed. Despite how much I like Brittany Murphy I just can't recommend this film but it its better then Just Married. In the end this is another chick flick that's only worth watching if you are a diehard fan of Dakota or Brittany. If you're not then just skip this movie. Rating 5.410";

The main reason that I enjoyed this movie was because of the incredibly adorable Ms.Fanning who is also an amazing actress. Brittany Murphy is a also a great actress but I think she should stop making sugary sweet comedies they aren't really her thing. She is much better as the troubled mental patient. Anyways even though this movie is sometimes misguided it is still enjoyable and sweet. I would give Uptown Girls 6.510.".

I'm sure there are many people out there that have not yet grown up bc their parents gave them everything and this kind of shows what would happen to those people if mommy and daddy were not around anymore.  As for Dakota she is going to be one of the new Child Star's who make it for a while.  She has yet another movie releasing this year called the Cat in the Hat and I will surely watch it.  Although this is a straight chic flic I really do watch everything and was pleasantly surprised with this film.  If you have a chance check this film out.".

This is not a child's film it is for late teens to adults.  You are warned if you read why it is rated PG13.  I thought that Murphy's part was very good.  I'm sure there are many people out there that have not yet grown up bc their parents gave them everything and this kind of shows what would happen to those people if mommy and daddy were not around anymore.  As for Dakota she is going to be one of the new Child Star's who make it for a while.  She has yet another movie releasing this year called the Cat in the Hat and I will surely watch it.  Although this is a straight chic flic I really do watch everything and was pleasantly surprised with this film.  If you have a chance check this film out.";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film at the age of 5 and it has been my favourite ever since. This led to my following of the greatest actor of all time JOHN WAYNE.

	schema:headline " A Great Classic triumphs over age and minor flaws.";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes today some of it seems campy and jingoistic but Sands of Iwo Jima is such a classic that it can't help being a worthy way to spend 100 minutes.First of all there is John Wayne as Sergeant Stryker.  Stryker was the model on which virtually every screen portrayal of a tough sergeant is based.  The character's angst and intensity also give us a rare glimpse of John Wayne's true acting ability.  In most movies he just portrayed himself but there is no swagger in Stryker just loneliness fear and hope.  He is by far the most convincing character in this movie and one of the top from any war movie period.Next the history.  Ok the actual characters have no basis in fact but the battles certainly do.  The battles for Tarawa and Iwo Jima were very important to the war and tragically costly in lives.  They deserve to be remembered. The production mixed a lot of actual footage taken at the actual battles and mixed it in with the regular film.  The two look fairly similar since both are black and white but you can tell what is real and what was shot for the movie.  One's first reaction to this might be that the production went cheapskate but in a way the use of real stock battle footage was more moving than an epic legion of extras like in The Longest Day.  You just can't beat reality for realism and seeing the real islands and the real marines is an eerie reminder of how many men died in those horrific battles.Finally the supporting cast.  Ok I can't rave about them all but most were entertaining especially Wally Cassell.  Also Forrest Tucker puts in a fine performance the only one remotely close to Wayne's in its depth.Some of the anachronisms are a bit funny but my only real complaint in the whole movie was John Agar's character Peter Conway.  I don't know who was at fault for it Agar or the writers but his character is hard to take.  I think we are meant to like him but for about the first 90 minutes that is pretty much impossible.Otherwise it's a great movie.  See it!".

	schema:reviewBody "For many years this film was the standard bearer when it comes to great war films. For some viewers it may still be though Saving Private Ryan has clearly stepped into a whole new realm. Wayne plays a tough Marine sergeant who whips in some cases literally! his men into fighting shape in order to secure their survival during the deadliest days of WWII. When he isn't pummelling his authority into the men he's drinking his troubles away at night trying to avoid the memory of his wife and 10 yearold son who have abandoned him. He runs into some opposition in the form of idealistic and nonmilitaristic Agar whose own father was a soldier in the same category as Wayne and in Tucker who plays a troublemaking private who holds resentment against Wayne. Other soldiers include smartaleck funny guy Cassell dedicated sidekick Brown tower of strength Webb awkward southpaw Baylor young upstart Milner and dueling but loving brothers Jaeckel and Murphy. The men are shown learning the ropes and then putting their knowledge to the test in some intense battle sequences which are recreated in some shots and interpolated with actual battle footage in others. Along the way Agar meets and falls for New Zealand girl Mara and Wayne in a surprisingly touching and heartfelt scene comes to the aid of Bishop a downonherluck lady who is desperate for income. Of course by now many of the story and character elements have been pilfered or repeated to where they are clich but in it's day this was a roaring success at the box office and it remains entertaining. Wayne gives one of his best performances notably in a scene in which he must allow a favored fellow soldier to risk death in order to save the lives of the rest of his men. His larger than life persona looms over the film creating a heroic and secure feeling in the face of treacherous fighting and carnage. Agar holds his own well and the two share an intriguing chemistry. Tucker is also solid and has a memorable scuffle with Wayne in a wooded area. The cast is peppered with appealing actors who managed to carve out successful careers as either TV stars or supporting actors in film. Jaeckel is young and impossibly blonde. Milner is wet behind the ears and frecklefaced. Though it may displease the Don't Ask Don't Tell crowd it's easy to read a homoerotic subtext into the relationship between Brown and Wayne. Brown is a practical guardian angel for Wayne and his devotion to him is palpable. This feeling is never dispelled by showing him display even the remotest interest in a female. Wayne seemed to continually surround himself with actors he enjoyed working with and being around so fans of his and of his virtual repertory company will probably get added enjoyment out of this. Though it doesn't have the graphic violence of later films it is still disturbing to see characters which have been introduced through the film get gunned down in battle. The surehanded director Dwan had more than 300 films to his credit!".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Clint Eastwood's recent Flags of Our Fathers has told the real story about the flag raising at Iwo Jima it hasn't diminished any of the impact that Sands of Iwo Jima has either back when it was released or viewed today.In fact because the three surviving flag raisers Joseph Bradley Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes all were in this film it's even more proof of how the symbolic flag raising has become mythologized.Of course the real heroism was in capturing the island that was less than a 1000 miles from the main islands of Japan and the airfields on Iwo Jima that could be used by our bombers for land based flights. It took about a month to do that the flag was raised on the fifth day.I read a history of the United States Marine Corps from it's formation during the American Revolution. Over the course of its history it was interesting to learn that the Marines many times were threatened with extinction to be folded into either the army or navy right up to and including World War I.Right after World War I a very farsighted man named John A. Lejeune became the Marine Corps Commandant and he saw that we would be in a war in the Pacific with the Japanese as our foes. He also saw that the survival of the Marines as an entity involved them training for a very specialized kind of mission amphibious warfare. He started training them for that and come World War II they were certainly ready. John Wayne as Sergeant Striker got one of his most memorable parts of his career in Sands of Iwo Jima. Striker is a tough as nails Marine Corps lifer whose got a job to whip a lot of recruits into shape for the later Pacific landings after Guadalcanal. He's also got one lousy personal life as his wife's left him and taken their son.Wayne got his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in this part. There's a couple of other films he should have gotten a nomination for but that's another story. Among his competition in 1949 was Kirk Douglas for Champion Richard Todd for The Hasty Heart and Gregory Peck for Twelve O'Clock High. Note three of the nominees were for World War II related films. But the winner that year was Broderick Crawford for All the King's Men. At least Peck and Wayne both got Oscars later in their careers.John Agar who was trying to carve out a reputation as being more than Mr. Shirley Temple back then plays the son of a former commander of Wayne's who has a problem with his Dad and takes it out on Wayne attitude wise as a surrogate father. Julie Bishop and Adele Mara play women drawn to both Wayne and Agar respectively.Of the supporting cast who play members of Wayne's platoon my favorite is Wally Cassell the wisecracking city kid who finds a tank to help his platoon out during a sticky situation.Flags of Our Fathers teaches us about how the flag raising symbolism became part of the Marine Corps heritage. Sands of Iwo Jima exploits that symbol in the best sense of the word. After almost sixty years it's still a fine film with a grand performance by the Duke.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sgt John M. Stryker is a battle hardened Marine who's job it is to prepare his new charges for the realities of war. With no care for making friends Stryker does what ever it takes to make these men tough and ready for the Pacific conflicts to come. Sands Of Iwo Jima is unashamedly proud in its jingoistic fervour and rightly so. Iwo Jima and the now immortal portrait of weary American soldiers hoisting the flag atop Mt. Suribachi has become a bastion of bravery a beacon of triumph if you will. So it's no surprise to find Allan Dwan's film has no intention if deviating from boasting its colours and hooray to that. Here as Stryker we find John Wayne giving a bit more to his character portrayal than merely some beefcake winning the war. Wayne puts depth and sincerity into Stryker an air of believability shines through as he shows vulnerability we believe he can win this war with his men but we also see tenderness and it lifts Sands higher than your average war picture. Wise old director Dwan 432 directing credits to his name weaves the picture together with admirable restraint. Fusing actual newsreel footage with his own tightly handled action sequences Sands plays out as the tribute and rally call that it has every right to be even finding place in the film for three of the soldiers who hoisted that now famous flag. Ira Hayes Rene Gagnon and John Bradley are the three gentlemen to look out for. The rest of the cast don't really have to do much outside of respond to Wayne's two fold performance but keep an eye out for a fresh faced Richard Jaeckel as Pfc. Frank Flynn while I personally enjoyed the brief but important contribution from Julie Bishop as Mary. Wayne received a nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards too bad for him that 49 contained brilliant shows from the winner Broderick Crawford  a blunderbuss turn from Gregory Peck with other nominations going to the Best Story Editing and Sound categories. Ironically it was a role Wayne didn't fancy doing but some encouragements from war veterans humbled him into starring. Lock and load and saddle up for a top entry in the WWII pantheon. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I once saw a documentary about John Wayne and something surprised me . Not the fact John Wayne never saw active service because we all know that while James Stewart was bombing the heart out of Nazi Germany as a squadron leader and Rod Steiger lied about his age to join the US Navy the Duke decided to help the allied war effort by making films in Hollywood which if one is to be honest had the same effect on destroying fascism the battle of Stalingrad and the atomic bomb combined . In April 1945 when Hitler herd Big John was going to make yet another flag waver he pulled out a gun and blew his brains out . There's no evidence of this but it's an established fact and who needs the Red Army when you've got John Wayne making movies . So no what surprised me about this BBC documentary is that the proud United States Marine Corps show THE SANDS OF IWO JIMA to all recruits as part of basic training ! A bit puzzling but it could be worse and could have shown them THE GREEN BERETS instead . I'm also guessing the marine recruits are a bit thankful to escape beastings for a couple of hours and enjoy some escapist fantasy cunningly disguised as a war drama Sorry old boy but this limey thinks this while not being a bad film doesn't really perceive it as being a good one either . It crams in as much clich as is humanly possible . I suppose the clich of a tough as nails almost inhuman drill sergeant with a heart of gold might have been less unconvincing in 1949 but since it's been used so often since then it's almost seems a war film isn't complete without one . There are also a few jarring scenes where the action cuts from an obvious studio set to real life footage . This jarring quality also extends to real life marines who fought in the battle playing real life marines . Their courage is beyond comprehension but their acting skills are lacking and are every bit as wooden as the Duke . One wonders if the praise this film constantly receives might be down to jingoism . You don't like this film ? Does that mean you hate the USMC  Uncle Sam and capitalist democracy itself ? I don't think it does but I do know a mediocre movie with a wooden film star when I see one and this is one of them".

Wayne is Stryker John M. toughtalking Marine sergeant in charge of a squad of men and determined to keep them alive which proves somewhat difficult as these Marines storm the beaches at Guadalcanal Tarawa and Iwo Jima. Stryker is a man of intense personal longing first for his family at home and then for the men he is charged with leading. And what makes Sands memorable is we see this longing etched on the face of Wayne in every scene where he appears. This is not one of his Bwestern walkthroughs. It helps that the lines are so good. There are the usual clichs in any war movie but the movie also rings true in many scenes. There is an especially poignant one between Stryker and a woman trying to raise an infant son alone. But most of all the battle scenes are believable. The famous flagraising was not one of those scenes however. This was pure Hollywood though it was reenacted by three of the men who did it for real John Bradley Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes. Two memorable scenes 1 Two soldiers talkingFirst This is the poorest soil I've ever seen Second That's war. First What's war? Second Trading real estate for men.Worthless real estate at that. 2 The second scene is of a Jewish soldier who is fatally wounded whose last words are Shema Yisroel. Adonai elohenu adonai echad. This is part of Deuteronomy 64 in Hebrew and memorable because Hollywood is not a place known for its expression of conventional religious spirituality ..".

Nonetheless Sands of Iwo Jima is certainly the definitive John Wayne war movie.  He got his first Oscar nomination for this movie which is enough to make it important just for that he was only nominated one other time winning for True Grit.The movie plot is just straight formula and has the same collection of ethnic types that you find in every war movie ever madethe fasttalking big city guy the farm boy the wisecracking Italian etc.  The battle scenes had to be sanitized for audiences back then and the treatment of the Japanese as the enemy in this movie is outrageously stereotyped by today's standards.  Every time the Japanese come on camera the background music turns sinister and the little Japanese actors have an appropriate villainous and fanatical look to them.  The only war movie I can think of where the Japanese are humanized in any way is Bridge on the River Kwai while there are many movies where the German soldiers and especially General Rommel are portrayed if not sympathetically at least respectfully. Catch the last scene where the three reallife survivors of the Iwo Jima flag raising are given the flag by the Duke to raise on Suribachi.  One of the flagraisers John Bradley was so modest about his exploits afterwards that he didn't even have a copy of the famous flagraising photo hanging up in his home.  It wasn't until after he died that his children learned that he had won the Navy Cross for his heroism in the war.  The book written by his son Flags of Our Fathers is being made into a movie by Steven Spielberg and is sure to be sensational.  No doubt that it will be immediately compared to Sands of Iwo Jima which until Flags comes out is the definitive movie about that battle.".

The battle footage was probably quite compelling coming so soon after the war. If this was mostly about the battle it would be a compelling war movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "While the film itself is pretty formulaic by 1940s standards it's given some honesty and strength by some very capable cast members including Forrest Tucker John Agar Marty Milner James Brown and many othersbut especially JOHN WAYNE. It's directed in rugged fashion by the very adept Allan Dwan by no means a household name and yet a director whose career spanned over 300 films.Ironically it was Dwan who directed one of Shirley Temple's last teen movies YOUNG PEOPLE '40 and here nine years later directing her future husband John Agar in one of his early screen roles as the soldier who despises his sergeant Wayne.The story is given good background treatment in the training of marines under hardedged sergeant Wayne who has to get the men into shape so that he can lead the platoon into battle. Most outstanding in the cast is FORREST TUCKER the husky blond actor who never quite made it to major stardom but appeared in numerous films of the '40s and '50s usually in strong supporting roles. Today most fans remember him from AUNTIE MAME as Roz Russell's Beauregard or the TV comedy F Troop. He acquits himself well in a good supporting role.Wayne has some of his best scenes opposite Tucker who resents him over a past incident but soon comes to respect his leader's courage and determination to make something out of the soldiers under his command. It's one of Wayne's finest performancessteelyeyed with determination in the closeups and always sure in handling his characterization to give it more than one dimension. He's sad tender tough gritty determined and courageousbut a man who admits his own faults and doesn't pretend to be a hero. In short he's terrific. Watch for the subtlety in the scene where he's so drunk he can hardly stand.The flag waving element is understandable given the context of when this was filmed and the final rousing shot of the men raising the flag over Iwo Jima is very effective. The only real drawback I can think of is that we seldom get even a glimpse of the Japanese these men are presumably fightingan enemy that is rarely seen. And there is an overuse of real war footage not always blended in realistically with the studio shots.For John Wayne fans and war movie buffs this is a must see.".

That would be the case for Sands of Iwo Jima as well as John Wayne's hard boiled performance as Sergeant John Stryker is tested along the way by Privates Al Thomas Forrest Tucker and Peter Conway John Agar. Granted the scenarios allow us a glimpse into the mind and temperament of Stryker and the reason for his attempts at solace in a bottle of whiskey. Stryker's one track mind does not allow for slip ups because in battle a slip up can cost lives. That point is demonstrated when Thomas delays bringing back ammo for his buddies during the Battle of Tarawa his buddies wind up dead.On the plus side the battle scenes of the movie are interspersed with actual war footage and though not seamless they are effective. In particular the flame throwing battle tanks are particularly impressive. There are some hand to hand combat scenes brief but realistic that give meaning to a Marine's definition of battle  That's war boy tradin' real estate for men. Put in that context the futility of war as a means to an end seems especially true.I always thought the term Lock and Load! was an overworked clich in modern films but here it is in a movie made in 1949. John Wayne does the honors not once but twice before the story is over. As for the march of time putting things into perspective I got a chuckle out of a line uttered by the bar fly Mary Julie Bishop attempting to cozy up to Stryker  Sixty five cents for a drink too much! With one of the more famous outcomes in World War II history I was looking forward to the climactic action of the U.S. flag being raised over Surabachi. That moment was recreated for the film while honoring three surviving members of the original battle who appear in the film with Wayne in a patriotic scene enhanced by the strains of the Marine hymn in the background. Unfortunately Stryker doesn't live to see victory. With new found admiration for his commanding officer Private Conway offers his men encouragement to continue the fight when he shouts out  Saddle Up!".

Certainly after Stryker John Wayne fights with Thomas Forrest Tucker and Thomas is fine with it the two men talking to each other as if nothing had happened. The film's credibility already stretched to the limit with the typical Hollywood wartime propaganda was thrown out the window with that fight. Yes Wayne is a manly man and I'm sure soldiers fight with each other but this was ridiculous veering into the realm of fetish. I mean if your sergeant drags you in the middle of the forest and starts pummeling your face just because of some disagreement but then once the fight is over the man at the receiving end doesn't complain and is fine and dandy with it well the homoerotic subtext suddenly becomes clear. The fighting btw is not shown as horseplay. Who cares about fighting the enemy with a sergeant like Stryker? This kind of behaviour wouldn't have been tolerated in reality but because this a John Wayne fantasy based on some real charactersevents well the machismo has be flowing in order to keep audiences entertained and what's more entertaining than seeing John Wayne getting his kicks and showing who's on eh top?

	schema:reviewBody "Director Steve Carver! Action star Michael Dudikoff! An action adventure delight!? Throw in actors Donald Pleasance Robert Vaughn both playing Nazis Herbert Lom and L.Q Jones. Sounding good. Set in the Amazon jungle with its many beauties and but also constant dangers. Oh this should be humidly exciting but the cheaply produced Cannon production shortly gave way for complete tedium. Carver tedium? No way. Dudikoff tedium? Can't be. But it's a yes indeed. Well more so the first 45 minutes although within that time we are treated with some midget boxing and the intro is cool enough with its atmospheric score and after that it somewhat picks up in something of a stop and go affair. It took me two sittings to watch it as the first time I could only get halfway through it before dozing off. Lucky I recorded so I could sit there and try to watch it again but it did kind of get better the further along it went.Dudikoff plays Hamilton an adventurer who becomes an Amazon guide for a doctor and his daughter in their quest to find the origins of a deadly disease that's affecting the natives. There they end up at the lost city where the doctor is killed and the daughter captured. Hamilton manages to escape and barely makes back to civilisation. There he recovers gathers a team and heads back to rescue the girl but others in the party have their own motivations gold justice and revengehurt feelings especially the man Donald Pleasance backing the expedition who believes a Third Reich Nazi doctor Robert Vaughn hides out in the lost city continuing his sadistic experiments.The plot is adapted of an Alistair MacLean novel and it comes across as dumb lowgrade pulp. It throws around shadily random developments growing mystic devious twists whom playing whom? and onenote characters who seem to be looking for death in a very muddled paperthin fashion. Very talkie at times sluggishly paced and constantly inconsistent but the action does have its moments. Probably a little too repetitive and not as explosive but there are numerous explosions. Still it's gritty and unpleasant as the party when they not flying hiking or using their riverboat they are thwarted by Amazon pirates aggressive natives and of course evil Nazis led by a mad scientist Vaughn is simply wasted here who just wants to take over the world. Pleasance who masterfully hams it up Hey Wolfie and Vaughn's exchanges are just odd mainly in the opening sequences which do set everything up.

	onyx:emotionText "Director Steve Carver! Action star Michael Dudikoff! An action adventure delight!? Throw in actors Donald Pleasance Robert Vaughn both playing Nazis Herbert Lom and L.Q Jones. Sounding good. Set in the Amazon jungle with its many beauties and but also constant dangers. Oh this should be humidly exciting but the cheaply produced Cannon production shortly gave way for complete tedium. Carver tedium? No way. Dudikoff tedium? Can't be. But it's a yes indeed. Well more so the first 45 minutes although within that time we are treated with some midget boxing and the intro is cool enough with its atmospheric score and after that it somewhat picks up in something of a stop and go affair. It took me two sittings to watch it as the first time I could only get halfway through it before dozing off. Lucky I recorded so I could sit there and try to watch it again but it did kind of get better the further along it went.Dudikoff plays Hamilton an adventurer who becomes an Amazon guide for a doctor and his daughter in their quest to find the origins of a deadly disease that's affecting the natives. There they end up at the lost city where the doctor is killed and the daughter captured. Hamilton manages to escape and barely makes back to civilisation. There he recovers gathers a team and heads back to rescue the girl but others in the party have their own motivations gold justice and revengehurt feelings especially the man Donald Pleasance backing the expedition who believes a Third Reich Nazi doctor Robert Vaughn hides out in the lost city continuing his sadistic experiments.The plot is adapted of an Alistair MacLean novel and it comes across as dumb lowgrade pulp. It throws around shadily random developments growing mystic devious twists whom playing whom? and onenote characters who seem to be looking for death in a very muddled paperthin fashion. Very talkie at times sluggishly paced and constantly inconsistent but the action does have its moments. Probably a little too repetitive and not as explosive but there are numerous explosions. Still it's gritty and unpleasant as the party when they not flying hiking or using their riverboat they are thwarted by Amazon pirates aggressive natives and of course evil Nazis led by a mad scientist Vaughn is simply wasted here who just wants to take over the world. Pleasance who masterfully hams it up Hey Wolfie and Vaughn's exchanges are just odd mainly in the opening sequences which do set everything up. Vaughn's blank coldhearted turn suit's the character but was he really acting. Hard to tell. Dudikoff is acceptable always having that concern look on his face. Maybe info overload. It was better when he stop thinking and went heroic  a prophecy in the making. But it wasn't as funny as his croaky narration please somebody hand him a cough lolly.

He just sort of walks through the jungle for most of the film leading a group of people through treacherous territory and avoiding killer river pirates. I've only seen this one a couple times despite having it on video but I could never really tell what the point of whole thing was. I guess I need to watch it more closely next time. All I know is former Nazi commander Donald Pleasance great as always wants something to do with former Nazi scientist Robert Vaughn and I know the girl who's part of the team wants revenge on Vaughn for killing a relative of her's during World World II. Veteran character actor L.Q. Jones lends his alwayswelcome presence in a small role. Based on a novel by Alistair McLean RIVER OF DEATH is no RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. In fact I would say that it's probably my leastfavorite jungle adventure movie without a whole lot going for it other than Dudikoff playing a different type of character some okay scenes and some nice location shoots. Even jungle adventure movie fans might be disappointed.".

All the characters are pretty cool and the story while uneven was not too bad plus Michael Dudikoff and Donald Pleasence are simply amazing in this!. It never truly bored me and kept me watching however it could have been a lot more then just a decent rental! plus the ending was quite unsatisfying. The opening was really cool and quite unsettling and i thought Robert Vaughn was great as the main villain plus while the ending was unsatisfying it did have a cool little twist in it!. it's no Idianna Jones and far from Dudikoff's best that's for damn sure however it's still a decent time waster and Dudikoff is wonderful as the main lead plus the movie was quite violent at times!. The scenery isn't bad and it had a cool shootout plus the dialog amused me. This is a watchable Dudikoff yarn with fine performances however the uneven pacing sinks it quite a bit! worth the watch. The Direction is Not bad. Steve Carver does a decent job here with good camera work and keeping the film watchable throughout nothing special but he got the job done. The Acting is very good. Michael Dudikoff is AMAZING as always and is amazing here he is very likable relaxed on top of things carried the film had a great presence had some cool lines was fantastic in the acting department and while he is no Harrison Ford he still did an amazing job! in my opinion. Dudikoff Rules!!. Robert Vaughn is great as the main villain he had a blast hamming it up and was very interesting to watch and added class. Donald Pleasence is AMAZING as always and is amazing here he was extremely interesting to watch as always was especially good in the finale added a lot of class and i loved every moment he was on screen!. Pleasence Rules!. Herbert Lom is great in his role he was evil as usual and did a great job. L.Q. Jones does okay but is kinda wasted here. Cynthia Erland is hot and did fine with what she had to do. Rest of the cast do okay. Overall worth the watch. 12 out of 5".

The story begins with a group of explorers in the jungle who are attacked by natives. The group manages to escape but are recaptured apart from the hero who escapes and vows to return to save the group of explorers. The remainder of the film is the hero's trek back into the jungle to rescue his explorer buddies. Sounds straight forward but add in a Nazi scientist and not one but two people out for revenge against the Nazi scientist the plot starts to get too complicated for what's basically an action movie. The hero occasionally narrates parts of the film a la apocalypse now and the river boat action scenes with murderous natives further add to the apocalypse now style. What is very strange however is the heavyweight acting talent in this movie. There's quite a few well regarded actors in this but it's still not a good film. The action scenes are not bad but the ending is quite unsatisfactory. There's no real depth to any of the characters and it's hard to understand what's going on and exactly who some people are. There's basically too many people too much plot and far too many idea for this to be a coherent film. It's not even good from a so bad it's good perspective. I'd say it's entirely forgettable but it's hard to forget when it hasn't even registered.".

Like veteran actor Robert Vaughn playing a demented Nazi scientist. But the execution just doesn't have enough oomph going for it. Its action scenes are fine and the story is a fairly enjoyable one despite its characters not being terribly interesting for the most part.American ninja Michael Dudikoff stars as John Hamilton a jungle guide in the late 1960s who takes a doctor Victor Melleney and his sexy daughter Sarah Maur Thorp through the Amazonian wilderness to a fabled lost city. When he alone escapes the clutches of hostile native tribes he feels just guilty enough to want to go back. And there are a variety of parties who want to make the return trek with him like German businessman Heinrich Spaatz Donald Pleasence and his associate Maria Cynthia Erland each with their own agenda in mind.While it's commendable to see Dudikoff step outside his personal comfort zone and try something different he just isn't enough of an actor to make his character all that compelling. One can hardly fail to notice that his narrator voice is somehow more gravelly than his speaking voice in the rest of the movie. Fortunately heavy hitters like Vaughn Pleasence who absurdly sports a wig part of the time Herbert Lom as a grumpy and officious police officer and L.Q. Jones coming off well in the most colorful role of the picture do their part in keeping the story alive. Lovely Erland is passable in the most tragic role.Striking scenery this was actually filmed in South Africa and photography do help to a degree as well as a fine music score by Sasha Matson. Undemanding viewers may be amused.Six out of 10.".

Twenty years later in 1965 we're introduced to adventurer John Hamilton Dudikoff a guy who knows the Amazon river like the back of his hand and gives tours through the dangerous jungles. In his latest tour group are people that want to find out the origins of a mysterious disease that's been ravaging the local population as well as some Nazi hunters that believe Manteuffel is hiding out in the area. All want to find the legendary Lost City which should hold the key to pretty much everything. But along the way they're going to have to face many pitfalls and challenges  everything from river pirates to the unknown jungle disease. Will they succeed? I guess Firewalker 1986 wasn't enough of an overlong jungle slog for Cannon so they decided to make another one a few years later. Why they thought audiences had such an appetite for jungle slogs is unknown but here's another one. Take the aforementioned Firewalker add some Golden Needles 1974 and maybe some Skeleton Coast 1988 and you have a plot you've seen many times before. If you really want to see a quest for the lost city see Quest For The Lost City 1990. Sure River of Death might be based on a story by the acclaimed Alistair MacLean but it lacks a Zap Rowsdower. Or even a Mike Pipper. So can it really compete? Dudikoff is as cool as ever and his gruff narration adds...something...but honestly this isn't really an action movie it's more of an oldfashioned adventure movie. Why the filmmakers thought that would be better we don't know. It seems like a bit of a copout. Dudikoff doesn't even do any Martial Arts. Due to the length of the movie and the quality cast we presume Cannon was going for some very mainstream material. What they came out with is pretty boring because there isn't really any character development so you don't really care what goes on and even what little bit of gunplay and explosions there happen to be don't help things.Robert Vaughn  yes Control 5 himself!  is on hand as a Nazi. We always love seeing him and he clearly is enjoying himself here probably because he doesn't get too many Nazi roles. Maybe there's a reason for that? Perhaps the good lawyers at Mark E. Salomone and Morelli liked what they saw and decided to give the poor guy a break. We kid Vaughn because we love. We're also big fans of Donald Pleasence and he gets to do a lot more here than say in the entertaining but largely Pleasenceless American Tiger 1990. Herbert Lom is also onboard with the cast of older gentlemen which adds to the Skeleton Coast vibe. Too bad they couldn't get Borgnine.The bottom line here is that this movie should have been snappier with a more vibrant pace and about a half an hour chopped out of the running time. We see what the filmmakers were trying to do but it's all so bloated. Director Steve Carver who only a year previously directed the fun Bulletproof 1988 should have taken a page out of his own handbook and livened things up a bit like he did with that Gary Busey vehicle. He truly shouldn't have been such a Butthorn.We've seen a lot worse and this movie is fine for Dudikoff completists or even Pleasence fans but casual viewers will probably be turned off by River of Death's sluggish ways.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was made and released about 8 years after its source novel of the same name by Alistair MacLean was first published in 1981. River of death was MacLean's 24 novel and this movie was the 15 film adaptation of one of MacLean's stories. It's the first filmed adaptation of an Alistair MacLean to be made and released after the author had passed way. First and only made for cinema filmed adaptation of an Alistair MacLean story to be made and released during the 80s. Final to date made for cinema adaptation of an Alistair MacLean story. I haven't read the book  but I 've heard that it's one of MacLean's poorest books. So it's really no wonder that the movie sucks too. Michael Dudikoff is John Hamilton  a mercenary who leads the expedition into the heart of the Amazon in search of Nazi scientist. It turns out that they all have various motives for searching for a Nazi scientist in a lost city but none of this is believable or interesting. Most of the characters turn out to be someone other than who we thought they were.

Here the pacing is sluggish  the action is lame and there is too much talking.Dudikoff is capable B class actor  but he is lost here. Good actors like Donald Pleasance and Robert Vaughn are wasted. Even the Amazon scenery seems underused. There is no pretty scenery or good photography. It's dull dull dull. It's a cure for insomnia. It's the worst kind of B movie making. It's not even so bad it's good type of B class movie. I give it 110.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was made and released about 8 years after its source novel of the same name by Alistair MacLean was first published in 1981. River of death was MacLean's 24 novel and this movie was the 15 film adaptation of one of MacLean's stories. It's the first filmed adaptation of an Alistair MacLean to be made and released after the author had passed way. First and only made for cinema filmed adaptation of an Alistair MacLean story to be made and released during the 80s. Final to date made for cinema adaptation of an Alistair MacLean story. I haven't read the book  but I 've heard that it's one of MacLean's poorest books. So it's really no wonder that the movie sucks too. Michael Dudikoff is John Hamilton  a mercenary who leads the expedition into the heart of the Amazon in search of Nazi scientist. It turns out that they all have various motives for searching for a Nazi scientist in a lost city but none of this is believable or interesting. Most of the characters turn out to be someone other than who we thought they were.

It is a great pity this film is not more widely available on video as it is beautifully shot in scope with a delirious score that mixes Gotterdammerung with 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourg'!The acting especially from Annie Girardot is exemplary. You can see why this actress gave a such a terrific performance recently in 'La Pianiste'. It was however one of Deneuve's first roles and like all her early films she was not at her best but clearly decorative.A 'mustsee' film for all those film lovers who have appreciated the likes of 'The Night Porter' and Visconti's 'The Damned'.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Although both had been published separately nearly a decade before the Marquis De Sade's Justine Or The Misfortunes Of Virtue and Juliette Or The Prosperity Of Vice were combined in a tenvolume set during the French Revolution 1797 and promptly banned for the next two hundred years or so. In Justine the heroine's resistance to 'things as they are' in her incorrigible unwillingness or her inability to learn the lessons of the world...a world ruled by laws of wickedness where only crime pays where there are only victims and tyrants the latter always right and the former wrong perforce in this the given and the possible world Justine's virtue is unreasonable and unreasoning It is not miscalculation it is aberration. Her tormentors think she's mad and are fascinated by her seeing Justine as something irreducible something insurgent and unconquerable...and even more troubling than all the barbarities she undergoes. Justine's sister Juliette on the other hand is just the opposite and prospers accordingly. In Roger Vadim's VICE  VIRTUE Juliette Annie Girardot the amoral French mistress of a Nazi general assassinated for treason gives herself to his executioner SS Oberfhrer Schrndorf Robert Hossein and together they flee Paris for Berlin as the Allies approach. Juliette's sister Justine Catherine Deneuve meanwhile is married to a Resistance fighter and when he's arrested she's also taken into custody and consigned to the Commandery a remote Austrian chalet used as a secret pleasure palace for the Nazi elite. When Berlin falls Juliette and her lover make their way to the Commandery an Alamo where an unexpected reunion and a date with Destiny await... Vadim's VICE  VIRTUE and Pier Paolo Passolini's SALO have the exact same premise in the final daze of WW II it's anything goes at a Fascist stronghold just before Allied Armageddon but as striking as that is the similarity ends there. Passolini's film remained thematically true to its clinically depraved source Sade's The 120 Days Of Sodom while Vadim's is a romanticized often operatic adaptation of JustineJuliette that ends as a treatise on the wages of sin. Unfortunately this is antithetical to De Sade's tenets and although VV can stand on its own merits it pales in comparison to SALO. Outside of the Comandery the only thing in Vadim's oddly erotic opus faithful to its source is Oberfhrer Schrndorf a Sadean superman until the end anyway and a living embodiment of the Marquis' Do as thou wilt philosophy a creed also adopted by Alestair Crowley for his Thelema religion. De Sade's magnum opus was published during the dark days of the French Revolution and certain parallels can be drawn between that tumultuous time and the fall of the Third Reich so reimagining the tale in that era with the SS elite as a secret society of sociopathic sybarites was inspired and Vadim should get the credit for that. The Commandary in both the Vadim and the Pasolini are the pleasure domes where the elite can indulge their darkest desires but VV only hints at what SALO makes explicit. spoilerUnlike Pasolini Vadim turns De Sade's philosophy on its ear in VV the virtuous Justine is liberated from the Commandery by the Allies and the wanton Juliette is poisoned by her lover but in the books it's Justine who dies and Juliette who's liberated which is probably why there's no mention of the Marquis in the film's credits. Still the subject matter was a fairly daring for its time morality tale even if its depiction was on the tame side. Come to think of it ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS has the same premise as both the Vadim and the Pasolini and I'd say VV falls somewhere between the blatant exploitation of ILSA and the more sober aspirations of SALO.".

	schema:reviewBody "The germination of the Pink Panther series of comedic mystery films is a complicated one. The first film in the series The Pink Panther was actually the second one to be filmed! This film A Shot in the Dark was originally intended to be the adaptation of a stage play but director Edwards and actor Sellers refit the main character to accommodate the persona of Inspector Clouseu which they were developing for The Pink Panther. However when the film was completed it wasn't released and was deemed unfunny. Then when The Pink Panther was a hit the studio released A Shot in the Dark as a sequel and a series was born. This explains why elements from the first film are absent from the second Mrs. Clouseu anyone? and why the second actually first! set the tone for the following films more than the first actually the second! Confused yet? Here Sellers is front and center as the hapless and everclumsy Inspector. Freed from sharing screen time with a higher billed costar David Niven in the previous film and without a particularly coherent plot to follow he is allowed to engage in pratfall after pratfall and scenario after goofy scenario. Today's audiences may not completely go for the subtle meticulously timed method of comedy shown here with emphasis on set up and repetitiveness but patient and observant audience members should still find the film funny. By now so much of the material has been cribbed or expanded upon some of the edge is lost but enough of the humor and situational gags are amusing enough to make the film worthwhile. Sellers insists upon the innocence of curvy stunner Sommer a maid who has been found in a locked room with a dead body and a smoking gun in her hand. Time after time he lets her out of prison and the body count increases. His thorough incompetence drives his superior Lom to insanity. Sommer's employer Sanders a man of great wealth and taste is also appalled by the bumbling Sellers never more so than when he manages to practically trash a billiard room during a friendly game. One famous sequence has Sellers tracking Sommer down in a nudist colony. The modest Inspector navigates the idyllic hideaway using any available object to cover himself as the campers frolic behind shrubs and other props. Reed glams it up but gets little to do as Sanders' bitchy wife. Another memorable sequence has Sellers and Sommer on a date with victim after victim falling prey to an assassin that's after Sellers. It's all a farcical enterprise that one must be in the mood for to fully enjoy. Otherwise it becomes a little tiresome but fans of physical comedy ought to lap it up. The remaining sequels were all sort of hybrids of The Pink Panther mixed with A Shot in the Dark and had fair success until the death of Sellers made it difficult to continue but continue they did using outtakes and other footage of the man! Anything to make a buck! Henry Mancini provided some nice music notably over the animated title sequence.".

The sight of them driving through the streets of Paris completely nude although we don't see anything naughty of course is priceless.If you want to see Pink Panther films do yourself a favor and begin with this one  it's as flawless as Clouseau is incompetent!".

It's almost a oneman show with Peter Sellers Inspector Jacques Clouseau exhibiting his comedy talents most of it the slapstick variety as he constantly runs into things andor falls down. Some of that gets tiresome after a while but most of it works and gives the viewer a lot of laughs.It was nice after these years to see the production in 2.35 widescreen. It made the photography a lot more impressive than the formattedtoTV VHS. I had never realized how nice this movie looked. The sets in here  mainly George Sanders' apartment interior  were good too and Elke Sommer was always nice to ogle back in the '60s.Sellers' boss played by Herbert Lom wasn't that funny but Burt Kwoul as Kato Clouseau's trainee is fun to watch in all his sneak attacks. Sanders was funny too and he didn't have to say a word to get a laugh. Just the deadpan looks on his face as he watched Clouseau bumble around were priceless.This is a bit slow in the beginning but once it picks up it's funny the rest of the way. From a film history angle it was interesting to see how morals had begun to change and how rules were becoming relaxed. In here director Blake Edwards went out of his way to show cleavage of Sommer and there was an implied sex scene you wouldn't have seen a decade earlier. Also in the end  although played for laughs  it turns everyone was having an affair with somebody.".

Well here their wish came true as there are virtually no scenes in the film without Clouseau present and it is all the better as such. There can be no doubt that Peter Sellers is one of the greatest comedic actors of all time and he is the primary reason the film is so enjoyable. Director Blake Edwards is wise enough to latch onto this fact and indeed the entire premise of the film is essentially just a series of opportunities for Sellers to make full use of his brilliant physical comedy skills wrapped around a twisty murder mystery as Clouseau struggles to prove that the prime suspect the beautiful maid Maria Elke Sommer is not guilty despite an increasing load of evidence proving otherwise. Introduced here are also Pink Panther regular characters Commissioner Dreyfus Herbert Lom and Clouseau's lethal assistant Cato Burt Kwouk instructed to attack him when he least expects it to keep his guard up. said instances including when in the bath and in bed with MariaThe storyline is admittably simple with only a few basic twists to conceal the murderer's identity until the end and mainly does exist to give Peter Sellers full reign to do what he is so very skilled at doing  evoking laughs out of the most ordinary situations or what would have been deemed immature and juvenile if attempted by another actor. the primary reason Steve Martin's latest rehash is almost certain to flop  he can never hope to compare to Sellers in his iconic role And of course Henry Mancini's unforgettable jazz theme music is a welcome addition to an already great movie. It may seem strange that the only film in the series without the words Pink Panther should turn out to be the best in the series but such is the case here. The film may seem somewhat dated and perhaps not quite as witty as it would have been back in the 1960s but Sellers' unique comedic talents assure that the entertainment value of the movie remains classic even 40 years on. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "The popularity of Peter Sellers's Inspector Clousseau from the The Pink Panther it warranted the bumbling French detective getting center stage in what turned out to be a series of films. For the rest of his life Sellers was assured of movie profits by just making another Clousseau film.A Shot In the Dark also introduced two new characters to the series Clousseau's supervisor Chief Inspector Dreyfus played by Herbert Lom and his houseboykarate teacher Kato who was played by Bert Kwouk. Dreyfus became almost as popular as Clousseau himself. Herbert Lom's career had been spent playing mostly villains and pretty serious and deadly ones at that. Inspector Clousseau can best be described as a human train wreck. The slightest motion on his part is a recipe for disaster. Best to be about ten feet from him at any given time and even that won't always work. His klutziness drives Lom to the brink of insanity here and in future films he crossed over the line.But he's got instincts which is why I'm sure he remains an inspector of the Surete. He draws a case involving a murder at wealthy baron George Sanders's house and it seems kind of open and shut that the maid Elke Sommer did it. But Sellers listens to his hormones talking and refuses to make the arrest. And as more dead bodies keep piling up around Sommer the more Sellers listens to that voice south of the Equator.With Clousseau Peter Sellers joins the ranks of such great cinema clowns as Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. Sit back and don't eat while watching A Shot In The Dark you won't be able to hold it down.".

Dreyfus became almost as popular as Clousseau himself. Herbert Lom's career had been spent playing mostly villains and pretty serious and deadly ones at that. Inspector Clousseau can best be described as a human train wreck. The slightest motion on his part is a recipe for disaster. Best to be about ten feet from him at any given time and even that won't always work. His klutziness drives Lom to the brink of insanity here and in future films he crossed over the line.But he's got instincts which is why I'm sure he remains an inspector of the Surete. He draws a case involving a murder at wealthy baron George Sanders's house and it seems kind of open and shut that the maid Elke Sommer did it. But Sellers listens to his hormones talking and refuses to make the arrest. And as more dead bodies keep piling up around Sommer the more Sellers listens to that voice south of the Equator.With Clousseau Peter Sellers joins the ranks of such great cinema clowns as Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. Sit back and don't eat while watching A Shot In The Dark you won't be able to hold it down.";

	schema:headline " Classic Peter Sellers comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "A Shot in the Dark saw the great Peter Sellers reprise what is probably his most iconic role as the inept Inspector Clouseau. It's always obvious why Sellers is so well remembered for this role as he's absolutely great in it. His mannerisms and quirks help to add to the personality of the character and despite the fact that this man is overblown to comic book proportions Sellers succeeds in making the role believable and more importantly very fun to watch. The majority of the humour in the film is of the slapstick variety and while that can be very funny if done the right way it's not my favourite type of humour. That being said A Shot in the Dark does many of it's gags correctly and while the film isn't consistently hilarious there's enough good humour to ensure a good time to whoever's watching it. Also abundant in this film is classic Britflick style which is great in my opinion. From Hammer Horror to Ealing comedy I'm a big fan of classic British movies and so this film fits into that nicely.The plot follows the accidentprone detective as he investigates the case of 'a shot in the dark' which resulted in the death of a man at a country house. The facts add up rather quickly to the maid Maria Elke Sommer who was found at the scene of the crime with a smoking gun in her hand. Things are never that simple when Clouseau is on the case however and convinced that she is a decoy to protect someone higher up the food chain he proceeds in investigating this open and shut case. Aside from Sellers this movie also features the talents of Herbert Lom Elke Sommer and George Sanders among others. This makes up a good support cast for yours truly as I'm a big fan of horror and all of these are names in the British section of that genre. The plot of A Shot in the Dark is relatively simply done but it always manages to find time for gags and humorous set pieces and even when it appears to be slowing down you can always count on another laugh being just around the corner. I don't love this movie but it's definitely very good and marks a highlight in British comedy during the sixties.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the French play 'L'Idiote' authored by Marcel Achard and adapted to the American stage by Harry Kurnitz 'A Shot in the Dark' features Peter Sellers in the lead role of an Inspector with such gifted detective instincts that if he says he can solve a case within 2 seconds it requires him to experiment with his profound investigative prowess in a fulllength feature film to solve it.'Give me 10 men like Clouseau and I could destroy the world!' Yes this great oneliner uttered by Chief Inspector Dreyfus in a great deal of dismay indeed outlines the wacky character of 'Inspector Jacques Clouseau' played by Sellers.'A Shot in the Dark' is the second installment of the 'Pink Panther' Series and the funniest of them all. The plot is simple and goes on like this. Inspector Clouseau is sent to the Ballon residence to investigate the murder of Mr. Ballon's Spanish chauffeur Miguel. The Inspector instantly falls in love with the charming maid Maria Gambrelli towards whom all the evidences point a finger. But Clouseau strongly believes that someone else is the murderer who framed her for murder. He thinks she might know something about it. So he releases her from jail and spies on her. Illfated circumstances prevent the Insp from successfully spying her moves and eventually more murders take place. Is she really the murderer? If not who framed her? Why would anyone kill a chauffeur? And finally the most important question.. Will Clouseau be able to solve the case?As the great Inspector along with his assistant Hercule LaJoy solemnly embark on his mission to solve the case peril seems to find its way one way or the other and ride upon his shoulders except for when his boss Chief Inspector Dreyfus is around of course. To Dreyfus just the name of Clouseau is enough to ruin his day. He can't stand sight of Clouseau and hates every little bit of him for every time they meet poor Dreyfus is thrown into the face of adversity within no time and has to undergo tremendous agony.All the actors performed well but it is Sellers who stole the show as the inept detective fumbling and bumbling his way around solving murder mysteries but mostly bumping into furnitures snagging crucial areas of his clothes falling out of windows pursuing Miss Sommer to a nudist camp and what not.There is nothing wrong with the Blake Edwards' direction and screenplay. Editing was also upto the mark. Henry Mancini's music I must also add is as sassy and frivolous as the film.The only few minor drawbacks of this film are Number one Some portions are repetitive. Like for example Inspector Clouseau got arrested more than a couple of times for not obtaining selling license in order to sell stuffs such as balloons paintings etc. Number two few comic scenes were way too predictable. You could see them coming. And number three the ambiguous ending which might leave some audiences wondering who actually murdered whom.810".

The two films are quite different  Strangelove is very much an all round performances whereas Shot In The Dark displays his physical comedy to great effect.  The basic plot is a murder mystery but it doesn't really matter who did what to whom as the focus of the film is the bumbling investigation of Clouseau.  This is as funny as the character got and the material is pretty good.  It depends a great deal on your personal taste as to how much you are laughing at this film.  I found it funny but not as funny as I had hoped I would.  The reason for this was that the film relied very heavily on Clouseau.  The problem with this is that the comedy around Clouseau usually requires a small build up and hence a lag before the laugh  hence the laughs are spaced rather than consistent.Of course basing the film around Sellers is not a bad thing in itself it's just the material that needed to be sharper and funnier.  Although I like Sellers better in other things namely Strangelove and The Goons but he is the only man who could do this role and he does it very well indeed. Sommer is actually pretty good and manages to add to the laughs.  Sanders is a nice addition even if he plays it straight most of the way Lom on the other hand is increasingly funny as he breaks down  he is better here than in other films.  Kwouk is given a small role but he shows that he has a flair for comedy a flair that he has continued to show recently including his series with Harry Hill.Overall those hoping for a riproaring spoof may well be a little disappointed as it is not a laugh a second even if it is still funny. The plot doesn't really matter and the material could have been sharper and more consistent but it still stands out as the best of the Pink Panther films. All in all 1964 and these two films is as good proof of Sellers' abilities as you could ask for and he carries this film here.".

Pink Panther films are about the comic misadventures of Peter Sellers' character never about the plot.With Clouseau finally portrayed as the hero rather than the film's antagonist A Shot in the Dark sets the tone for the rest of the Pink Panther series better than The Pink Panther does though the funniest sequels were still to come.".

He stands by the window.  A door opens and knocks him out the window.   The door was not positioned to do so but we must assume it does. Just so we know what happened as if it wasn't already overly obvious Elke Sommer yells out He fell out the window.'  Then they show Clouseau outside the window on the ground so we can see that he fell out the window. That was supposed to be funny.   It wasn't funny and  was also poorly done. Most of the jokes in this movie were the same way.   They weren't funny to begin with and were awkwardly set up and executed.  Peter Sellers played his part to perfection but the material to work with was very poor.  Poor George Sanders looked bored to tears and Elke Sommer stood around and looked pretty.    That was all her role called for.   I do not understand the other reviews for this lightweight poorly directed and written movie.".

This is the first film to feature Herbert Lom as Dreyfurs and Burt Kwouk as Cato and both do well. The person who very nearly steals the show though is Elke Sommer as the love interest who everybody but Clouseau expects as the murderer of many people. Sellers and Blake Edwards are at a peak here. The funniest moments come when Clouseau keeps getting arrested for not having licences for certain things and keeps getting carted of in a police van. The Laurel and Hardy inspired slapstick is well placed and timed and Henry Mancini's music is splendid. Exorcist writer William Peter Blatty cut his teeth with thi the writing on this movie and one wishes he had done more Panther movies because his script is wonderful fun. An ultimate classic.".

After seeing Dr Strangelove I was ready to declare Peter Sellers one of the greatest comic geniuses of all time but this signature role of his left me very disappointed. Well perhaps the bumbling French detective could be a truly great comic figure if he were the center of a really good moviewhich A Shot in the Dark is not.I think that a lot of problems with the movie lie with the direction. The opening scenes especially are taken at a ridiculously slow paceI expected a fast and farcical comedy but I got a lot of awkward pauses and stagy long takes. The whole movie would be much funnier if it were tightened up and edited with a snappier rhythm.Other aspects of A Shot in the Dark are equally lazy. For most of the movie Sellers employs a light French accent until in the final scene he suddenly acquires a much heavier and more ridiculous accent saying beump instead of bump and other such Clouseauisms. Did no one notice the inconsistency of this? Meanwhile the jokes get predictable by the halfway point of the movie you just know that when Clouseau is asked to put a billiard cue away he'll end up knocking over the whole cue rack and when he tries to do a Cossack dance he'll rip his trousers.I did think that the sequence where Sellers and Elke Sommer go on a date and narrowly escape being murdered several times was rather well donethen again ANYTHING would have to be better than the embarrassingly dated scene that takes place in a nudist colony. This is an example of the worst kind of 1960s winkwink nudgenudge sleazinessthe type of scene that Austin Powers mocked.The plot of A Shot in the Dark is standardissue Agatha Christie stuff with Clouseau attempting to prove that a beautiful housemaid Sommer is innocent of a string of murders despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. But though the early part of the movie is weighed down by a lot of tedious examination of the murders the filmmakers forget the plot as the movie goes on. In the final scene they basically throw up their hands admit they're bored with the story and characters and tack on an arbitrary conclusion. So in the absence of an interesting story skillful direction and a sense of good taste what are we left with? Peter Sellers doing pratfalls and talking in spoonerisms. Which isn't enough for me thank you.".

Peter Sellers has provided me with so much enjoyment through the years with his series of Pink Panther films although I thought that this one was the best of the entire series. The rest of the cast was equally as good in their supportive roles especially Herbert Lom. Elke Sommer George Sanders and Burt Kwouk were also great. The laughs came continuously and the physical humor of Sellers is untouched by todays standards. There have been so many copy cats Steve Martin included that have failed to capture the spontaneity and sense of comedy that only Peter Sellers had. This film to me goes down as the best of the best of comedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Shot in the Dark which followed The Pink Panther is considered the second of the popular series. It focuses not at all on the Pink Panther diamond or the Phantom or on Mancini's original music score but solely on the antics of Inspector Jacques Clouseau. That bungler cannot get through any day without causing some kind of mayhem. Peter Sellers' bumbling but likable inspector always delivers laughs in buckets. In this movie the Spanish chauffeur of Benjamin Ballon George Sanders is found shot to death in Ballon's mansion with the gorgeous maid Maria Gambrelli Elke Sommers literally holding a smoking gun. Miss Gambrelli was having an affair with him. When Clouseau arrives at Ballon's house he falls into a small pond as he exits his vehicle. As he walks into the house we hear the squish squish sound of wet shoes. But he tries to interview folks with his stubborn decorum. All signs point to Maria's guilt so Inspector Clouseau naturally thinks she is innocent! We must have the facts Hercule! We must have the facts! Naturally he feels that she is protecting someone. After Miss Gambrelli is allowed to leave jail on several occasions Clouseau tries unsuccessfully to follow her in various disguises and concludes getting arrested each time. Meanwhile chaos ensues as the bodies multiply and Clouseau's actions unknowingly ensure more trouble. Clouseau's immediate superior Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus Herbert Lom is slowly driven insane by Clouseau's antics. Clouseau even winds up in a nudist colony where Maria and he must drive away without a stitch of clothing! In the film we are introduced to Kato Burt Kwout who is Clouseau's housekeeper. One of Kato's duties is to attack Clouseau using judo when the inspector least expects it to keep his reflexes fresh. So it should come as no surprise when Kato assails Clouseau even in his bathtub! In the confrontation scene in the end the feckless Clouseau summons all of the murder suspects in Ballon's spacious Parisian house to reveal the killers. Either fracturing the English language or being tonguetied Clouseau says a suspect killed ... in a rit of fealous jage! George Sanders plays it straight as opposed to the whackedout Clouseau making for laugh after laugh. When Peter Seller's created Clouseau madness reached a new high! There would be sequels.".

	schema:headline " Screwed on film";
	schema:reviewBody "There's quite an amusing bit in Wrestling With Shadows where a man on a TV panel show earnestly likens Bret Hart to Hamlet  he says both are good men stuck in immoral worlds. Only in Canada and possibly Mexico could such a discussion be televised and it not be part of a sketch show. After all as Bret himself points out for a brief time he was the most famous Canadian in the world.But although I find it amazing that a programme could use wrestling as a means in which to discuss morals and although I'm even more amazed that such a show could find its way on the airways the documentary that features it is superb. Here you have a film that like the excellent Beyond the Mat lifts the veil on wrestling and shows the world how the whole crazy enterprise works. It most certainly isn't Shakespeare and Bret Hart isn't Hamlet but the story that unfolds is riveting.As in Beyond the Mat one of the main themes in this film is the way wrestling blurs lines that are drawn between the real and the unreal. Yes we all know the matches are predetermined and that punches are pulled but that's beside the point. The reality is in the reactions generated by fans. The reality is the sacrifices performers have to make to succeed in the business  many forsake normal family lives. The reality is in the cruelty of the profession  no pensions and no job security. So although the matches are planned in advance there are careers and lives on the line.What the film captures wonderfully is Hart's internal conflict. He wants to be a hero but people are starting to boo him and he wants to stay loyal to Vince McMahon who's almost like a second father but he has a big money offer from WCW. There are lots of things going on almost all of them out of his control. And while that may seem crazy wrestling being almost entirely about control and manipulation of people's emotions it further illustrates how complicated the business is  while he's worshipped like a god in Canada and across the world the reaction in India is hardly phoney he's vilified in America as bland and unfashionable people want something different.And that's probably Bret Hart's problem. As great an athlete as he was he found it hard to adapt to the new attitude that wrestling acquired in the late 90s. He was too emotionally invested in being a hero. If anything he cared too much about the fans. He probably would have adapted better if he had less scruples. But that's what also makes Hart a wonderful subject for this documentary. He never sells out and he never breaks his word  even in such a scuzzy business as wrestling he maintains his dignity. He's also at odds with his new position within the company as the number one heel  he doesn't like insulting the fans. But such is Hart's professionalism that he does and does it exceedingly well. Indeed the whole period of wrestling that the film documents was the most exciting I can remember. Wrestling since has been a pale shadow of what it was back then.Despite my opinion though Hart doesn't like the new direction and openly criticises it. And this is probably what leads to his downfall. His determination to be honest at all times alienates Vince McMahon and may well have inspired the infamous Montreal screw job.And the section of the film that deals with the events in Montreal make for fascinating viewing. First of all you have the way Bret Hart's wife emotionally says goodbye to what she thinks are her friends. Then you have Blade Bret's son sulking in the corner because he'll never see a lot of these people again. And after that you have Bret telling his wife that Earl Hebner the referee is straight he swore on his kids that nothing would happen. It all adds up to betrayal that is like having your family stab you in the back  being the sort of person he is you can more than understand why Hart is so devastated. However you can also kind of see McMahon's point of view. He was fighting a bitter fight with WCW and one of his main expensive stars had been openly criticising his direction McMahon wanted to do the best he could to taint the goods Ted Turner had paid handsomely for. But even though from a cold objective business point of view I can understand why Vince did it he does fully deserve the punch in the face that Hart deals out to him. The whole situation could and should have been handled better.Aside from this you also have a film about a man and his relationship with his father and the one here is unique to say the least. One of the funniest sections in the film is when the Hart's recount the way Stu Hart would 'stretch out' aspiring wrestlers. In one instance you can even hear a kid screaming his head off as Stu slaps him saying 'Have some discipline'. It's here that you understand how and why Bret became the man he is. He was afraid of his father but respected him too. And because of the strict sense of right and wrong that was fostered in him he found it hard to accept the shades of grey that crept into wrestling.But while in a sense this moral rigidity hampers Bret's career it also protects him. Many wrestlers when they retire go off the rails but with Bret despite everything that's happened since the film you feel he'll be okay. At least you hope that will be the case.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good guys. Bad guys. Betrayal. Tragedy. Men in tights.Hitman Hart Wrestling With Shadows is a documentary focusing on the legendary Bret Hitman Hart and his last year with the WWE 1997. The veil of professional wrestling is removed and we get a behind the scenes glimpse of what it was like to be a wrestler in the WWE. What makes this documentary great is that it is about how fake wrestling is while showing us how real it can be. Bret Hart narrates as well as leads us through his hectic life as WWE champion. The film's main narrative is his battle with WWE owner Vince McMahon. Their relationship drives most of the documentary and ultimately becomes that of a Shakespearian tragedy. Once great friends and coworkers these two men eventually clash over several things which leads to Bret considering a departure from the WWE. What Vince McMahon does to Bret Hart at the end is utterly heartbreaking no pun intended. The camera crew did a superb job of capturing the raw moments backstage and in Bret's own home. Characters in the film act as if there is no camera around most of the time. Director Paul Jay is virtually nonexistent in this documentary. He lets Bret take center stage. The point of view is obviously from Bret's corner but the filmmakers lay everything out like a crime scene investigation and allow the viewer to form their own opinion as to the film's main ethical dilemma Bret and McMahon's personal decisions at the end. Bret Hart speaks candidly about his decisions and his belief in them and we see clips of Vince McMahon sharing his point of view as well. This film does not require you to be a fan of professional wrestling but it would not hurt either. Bret explains the intricacies of wrestling and how things work in a very simplistic manner which will make anyone knowledgeable in the world of wrestling and able to enjoy this classic morality tale.Bret Hart comes off as extremely likable and noble. I find it hard to believe anyone not admiring his honesty courage and belief in himself. He believes in heroes and doing what is right. He has loyalty and that loyalty is betrayed. This ultimately ends up becoming what the movie is about. Is Bret Hart a hero? Is Vince McMahon a villain? Is there right and wrong?This documentary is a must see and not just for wrestling fans.".

Whether you love or loath Bret Hart there is no denying that he is a world class wrestler. That is why this is such a brilliant documentary. Bret Hart was THE top guy in the WWF in the mid'90s. Vince was the man behind the character. The onscreen commentator was the behindthescenes ownerpromoter. He signed Bret Hart up to an unprecedented 20 year contract in 1996 to stop Hart from joining the WWF's rival WCW. This documentary follows Bret around for one year. This one year is one of the most interesting in WWF history. It just so happens that the conclusion to this year contained THE most controversial night in recent wrestling history. Bret Hart was on his way to WCW but had a few weeks remaining on his WWF contract. The problem was that he was still the WWF Champion and this resulted in disputes and arguments from both sides as to how this problem would be resolved. This documentary crew was given an all access pass to all WWF events for the year that is covered. They go into the locker room and reveal all of the behindthescenes discussions and debates and the final concluding part to the most controversial night in recent wrestling memory.Watch this tape if you have even the smallest amount of interest in wrestling. See how the evil boss character of Vince McMahon was created on this infamous night in November '97 in Montreal and how Bret Hart finished his 14 year WWF career.".

So when I heard about the documentary I was very interested..........Wow was I in for a surprise!! I was amazed to see things from the inside out rather than the outside in. I learned things that I had never known before.  I knew it was planned out for the most part but I never realized the extent of it.   I read through pervious comments and I was shocked......people said it was funny and exciting to see the underbelly of wrestling but I on the other hand was moved almost to tears.  I was upset to learn about the backstage scenes that go on outside of the ring.  The Montreal incident was appalling and worst of all every one Bret had put his faith into screwed him royally. Today wrestling is very different there are women taking their clothes off and everything revolves around sex.   We need to take it back to when it was a sport not a soap opera.  Don't get me wrong I love WWF but when I see what it did to Bret and his family I feel horrible....The WWF betrayed his trust and his ability and destroyed the audience's faith in him..........Bret is a true champion!!  This documentary gave me a persepective I had never known before...A must see for everyone who thinks wrestling is fake and no one gets hurt....people do get hurt in more ways than one.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Bret Hart i was excited to see this documentary. It took awhile for me to see it but i finally had the chance to watch it. This is definitely a must see for any Bret Hart fan or any wrestling fan in general. The documentary begins one year before the controversial Survivor Series 1997 in Montreal and follows Bret around as he decides whether to jump ship over to WCW or to stay in the WWF as it was named at the time.The Montreal Screwjob is one of the main focuses of this film. Bret who had recently signed a 20 year contract was told by Vince Mcmahon to try and get a deal with WCW. Bret who had been with the company for 14 years was about to leave the WWF for WCW but before he could leave he had to lose the title. Bret not wanting to lose the title in his home country of Canada refused to lose the title to Shawn Michaels. The idea was for the match to end in disqualification and then Bret would forfeit the title the next night on the WWF's flagship show Monday Night RAW. Even with that suggestion Vince was still worried that Bret would show up on WCW's Monday Nitro with the WWF heavyweight title. This is where the ideas of a screw job finish were put into motion.During the match Shawn Michaels had Bret in his own hold the Sharpshooter. The plan was for Bret Hart to reverse the move and then member's of Bret Hart's Hart Foundation and Hunter Hearst Helmsly of DX would come in and cause a disqualification. Instead when Michaels put Bret in the Sharpshooter Earl Hebner who was referring the match and Vince who had come down to ringside called for the bell. It was then that Bret knew that he had been screwed. In a show of anger Bret spit in the face of Vince McMahon and destroyed equipment near the ring. He also spelled the words WCW in the air.The documentary the went on to show footage of Bret asking Michaels if he knew anything about what just happened. Shawn Michaels completely denied knowing about anything. It was soon found out that he was indeed part of it.Reliving this moment 9 years after it happened seems just as shocking as it did in 1997. Bret Hart went on to wrestle in WCW but never had the same success that he had in the WWF. Survivor Series 1997 was truly the end of a legacy.".

But what's it like behind the stage where the stories are created and the matches are planned?  And what transpired during the time in which Vince McMahon planned his betrayal of Bret Hart?  You won't see anything quite like this for a long time!  Hitman Hart Wrestling with Shadows documents Bret's life from his childhood to his relationship with his father his family and his relationship with Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation.  It's never boring and me being a former prowrestling fan I came to appreciate what tasks the wrestlers had to undertake.  I also strongly agree with a lot of what Bret says in the film that prowrestling has become bloodier raunchier and more inappropriate for children than anything simply for the sake of ratings.  You come to feel sympathy for Bret knowing the hardships a prowrestling really does have to deal with.  It's also tragic to know that soon after this film was made his brother Owen Hart was killed in a stunt at the WWF.  Vince McMahon has indeed gone too far for the sake of beating Ted Turner's WCW ratings.  I highly recommend this film for someone who likes prowrestling and wrestler Bret Hart.  If you don't like wrestling this film will make you come to feel respect for the man and the people involved in the wrestling business".

It was sad to see what Bret became in his last year with the WWF He became self absorbed something that was evident in many of the scenes and sadly he was losing himself within his gimmick. His idea of going over Shawn Michaels and vacating the WWF belt the following night would have been a serious blow to the stature of the WWF and Vince needed to protect his interest hence the Montreal Screw job That would have made the WWF look like a lower league to WCW. Bret's own words in not wanting to put Shawn over in his home country showed me that Vince was right Bret screwed Bret or more accurately The Hitman screwed Bret Hart. Despite his upbringing Bret Hartr shows that when it comes to wrestling he only cared about what made him look good. Even when Bret comments how he hated getting hurt in a match against the late Dino Bravo mainly because it was a guy he didn't want to lose to. The film is a great documentary about what happens when fame goes to an athlete's head and the over look everything they have. And also a sad commentary about a man presented as a hero but was as selfish as the common man.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a documentary but if Hollywood bought this story and made it into a movie they don't have to change a single thing. It is about Bret Hart a man that loved the WWF more then anything . He gave his heart and soul to the WWF for over 14 years. But in 1997  Vince just didn't have the money to keep him in the WWF. So he told Bret that he should jump ship to the WCW  World Championship Wrestling and he wanted to get out of there 20 year contract. Bret told Vince if he had to he will join the WCW but his heart is in the WWF. But when he singed with the WCW Bret was the WWF world champion. And he didn't want to lose the title in his home Country Canada. So he asked Vince if he can make his match with  Shawn Michaels a double draw. And Vince said that is fine with him. But while Bret was wrestling Shawn for the WWF world title Vince thought that Bret would go to Nitro the next night and trash the WWF much like former WWF women's champion Medusa did back in 1995. And if Bret would do that on WCW TV that would end the WWF once in for all since WCW was killing WWF over the Monday night ratings. So what Vince did was when Shawn was doing the sharpshooter  what Bret thought was that he will turn around and do the sharpshooter to Shawn and then Triple H and Rick Rude will run down to the ring and double team on Bret and make Bret win by DQ to Bret Vince called for the bell and screwed Bret Hart. This really made Bret mad since  Vince promised Bret that he did not have to drop the title that night.  This movie is a most see for all wrestling fans. But if you hate wrestling it is also a great drama. The ending is great and it really takes a good look behind the scene in the wrestling world.   8 out of ten stars . This is the 2nd best documentary I ever saw. Best is Bowling for Co.".

So I know a lot of the Hart family's history. This is of course THE definitive documentation of went down during the Survivor Series incident in Montreal. It's sort of fun watching the whole thing develop and sort of makes me wonder if the whole thing was a whole elaborate setup since of course the documentary cameras were there to catch it all. It probably wasn't so this is a classic piece of wrestling history caught on tape. This just doesn't cover that moment though as it focuses on the latter part of Bret's WWF days while providing a fascinating romp through the Hart family history. Stu Hart of course even though he was quite cordial to everyone me included thanks Stu for letting me take pictures for my college course of some Stampede Wrestling! he still was a borderline sadist for what he did to people in his dungeon. Of course the REALLY sad thing about this is that this ends at precisely a ridiculous tumultuous downward spiral for the family. What with Bret's marriage falling apart Owen's death followed by Bret getting thumped on the head by Goldberg which led to his stroke..followed THAT by the death of Helen and ultimately Stu. So this is a bit of a sad film to watch if you follow wrestling. But even if you don't this is still quite entertaining.".

It strips the varnish off of the world of sports entertainment by showing that loyalty a sense of right and wrong and giving your word have no meaning in the WWF.  Vince speaks of how Bret screwed Bret and that he had no option but to do what he did.  I say that's bogus.  It was a matter of simple economics and Vince not being as smart as he thinks he is.  He made a deal stood to lose his shirt and then set upon a course of action to undo the damage.  For those who know some of the innerworkings of wrestling I want to state I am not a simple mark who doesn't really know what is what.  You don't have to be a Rhodes scholar to be able to tell right from wrong.  Bret deserved better and in the end he took it in the keyster for being a standup guy.

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed at the peak of the Monday night ratings war the movie takes an inside look at the final year of Bret Hart's career with the wrestling promotion The World Wrestling Federation now World Wrestling Entertainment. Without spoiling the movie too much this documentary directed by Paul Jay not only shows an insight into wrestling's biggest star at the time but also the wrestling business itself and the most controversial non scripted legit incident coined simply as 'the Montreal Screw Job' at the 1997's 'Survivor Series' PPV. While today most wrestlers are more open about talking the inside secrets about the business at the time the professional wrestling organizations worked to maintain the illusion of story lines and characters in a moral code matter called 'kayfabe'. Because of this any performer that broke character would reach farreaching ramifications. So this beg the question how did director Jay and his crew was given unprecedented access toward this secretly world. Well it's because the owner of the WWF Vince McMahon was fighting against an uphill battle against his competitor at the time World Championship Wrestling which already raid some of his company's best talents. He couldn't lose anymore top stars jumping ship in 1996 so he mostly agree to his stars demands when negotiated new contracts. One of those demands was for filmmaker Jay to follow Hart and his family around WWF events because Bret wanted a documentary highlight the legendary of Hart Wrestling Family for their native Calgary fans. Because of this it was the first time in forever outside cameras were allow to film backstage since the mid1980s. However what Jay and Hart didn't know at the time is how bad WWF's financial were at the time and how McMahon couldn't live up to what Hart was demanding from his contract. It was here where the movie change its direction and structure from showing the achievements of the Hart Family to them focusing on the backstage politics of Hart. Accounting to the film's extras Hart mentions that filming had actually concluded prior to 1997's 'Survivor Series' and Bret had suggested to Jay that he may wish to bring the crew to the event as to document his final match with the WWF. Surprising for both of them this added footage became the key ingredient needed for this film. Without that dramatic climax I really doubt the film would had work. However there were a few criticism over the rights of that footage. Since filming rights has ended before that PPV. McMahon felt entitled for that footage as he has claim Jay broke their contract. He sued him as a result. The director went on to state that WCW has contacted him not only to offered to pay for the lawsuit but also offered a PPV deal for the film and long term distribution on the Turner network. Once McMahon became aware of this Vince back down and allow Jay to use stock footage and the use of the names and likeness of the other wrestlers featured in the film. Yet McMahon didn't go all quietly as he used some of his reputation to kill some of the distribution. Having face a backlash with Jay McMahon try to couther the negative prints by allowing another documentary to be made backstage 1999's 'Beyond the Mat'. However that film also made the WWF look bad. Because of that most wrestling documentaries under the WWF banner has been produced by WWFE Home Video since then. While it's easy to view the film and simply think of Bret as the good guy and Vince as the bad guy I think you would had to understand a deeper sense of Vince  Bret's perspective. Both men are very prideful very difficult to work with and equally as stubborn. You see this in a way how Hart outright lies to the camera about being able to work with anybody and not injuring anybody on purpose despite having problems with previous wrestlers like Bad News Brown Jerry Lawler Ric Flair and Dino Bravo in the past that resulted in reallife injuries. Then there is the claim that he never slept with anybody during his first marriage which according to his later book that he indeed cheated on his thenwife Julie. Kinda hypocritical for a man that claims that the WWF Attitude marketing brand which relies on an emphasis on sex extreme violence and the replacing of heroic wrestling characters with disaffected antiheroes was the worst thing to happen to prowrestling. Hart might be the best there is the best there was and the best there ever will be! Yet he's kinda a jerk. This documentary kinda shows that. Yes I'm a huge fan of the man's work but I got a problem on how little Owen Hart Jim Neidhart  Davey Boy Smith are given to talk seeing how the documentary was originally about them. Yes I like the rare look at Hart's family life but it does focus on Hart's business problems a little too much that it became somewhat annoying even if it made Hart a bigger hero than he was without it. For Vince this movie was the best thing to happen to him as he was indeed able to use the reallife heat from the screwjob to usher a great storyline with him as an on screen villain. While most people generally believed that Bret Hart was indeed screwover still there are others that felt that this was truly a work of storytelling fiction and Hart was in on it. Nevertheless based on this documentary there is just way too many inconsistent to believe that was the case. Overall Vince and Bret would ultimately buried the hatchet in 2002 and on aired in 2010 but this documentary would always be a great time capsule essential documentary for both wrestling and nonwrestling fans alike. A tragic betrayal film at its best.".

At least from the WWFWWE Point of View. Here you will see conversations that happened backstage in the hours and minutes leading up to the Survivor Series and then the events after the Survivor Series Pay Per View went off the air  both in the ring and in the back including audio from the private meeting between Vince and Bret after the match.

To call this a biography of Bret Hart's career would be an understatement.To begin with although it features mainly comments from Bret Hart himself it's not actually biased towards The Hitman  it features in fact takes on many of the wrestlers and Mr. McMahon himself. Most importantly though it's a deep journey into the unknown world of Wrestling behind the scenes it doesn't hide the fact that most results are staged but it also shows us why Sports Entertainment is enjoyed by so many people why there are the good guys and the bad guys in the rivalries between the performers and points out that the stigma of wrestling being fake is an overstatement. As Bret said and I quote There is an art to wrestling but people never come up to say 'You're a hell of an actor' they always come and say 'You're a phony!' Naturally one big part of the documentary involves Bret's personal life and endeavors involving family members and fellow wrestlers including the popular and shocking Montreal Screwjob and it does an excellent job at that. However this is not just about The Hitman it's about Wrestling Entertainment itself its performers arduous tasks and lives outside the ring and how the fans define what they do. It's an aweinspiring perspective that makes all sense and without hiding anything portrays the business as something even not only intriguing but also exciting and that has even once defined a rivalry between people from the U.S. and Canada.".

Yes it was unscrupulous of Vince to go back on their agreement  but Bret had already shown himself not to be a team player thinking of his own reputation before making sacrifices to move the company forward. The key word is 'entertainment' there's no such thing as integrity of character in a profession that is coordinated using pre planned results. You look at the rare breed of performer who've had an unbroken run with one company  I bet during their tenure they've had angles they disliked or didn't totally jive with but they've worked it out somehow and done as requested because that's what they're paid for.

He had a family to worry about it and like any good man he did what he thought was best for his family. He did not want to leave Vince highanddry but he was caught between a rock and a hard place. I have always been a pro wrestling fan but I never realized how hard life is for these performers. The amount of politics that go on behind the scenes really is unbelievable. At the end of the day Bret Hart faced a timeless moral dilemma does he stick by the company that created him despite his moral objections to the direction that the company is taking or does he turn his back on them and follow his heart even if it means selling out and betraying friends? It is a decision that we all must make in one form or another and it is this that makes Wrestling with Shadows not a documentary about pro wrestling but instead a documentary about humanity. 11 out of 10 stars.".

It is like a Rembrandt painting which moves with lots of dark muted colors which evoke the medieval setting. The smaller size of the film studio orchestras at this time compared with symphonic proportions later on and the stagebound camerawork typical of early talkies combine with the acting style of Dennis King and the rest of the cast to give the modern viewer a sense of seeing this great musical on stage. In fact a film such as this I believe ought to be compared to stage productions or other films of the period more than to later films. Dennis King's Shakepearian delivery and legitimate baritone singing voice would seem out of place in a later film where subtlety would reign. How fortunate then that we have such a fine document from the Broadway creator of the role. Jeanette MacDonald fairly glows in this her second film and gives a haunting delivery of Only a Rose. As a fan of early stage and film musicals and the 1920s era in general I highly recommend this film in the color version.".

Additionally the chance to see 20th Century Fox's first major Charlie Chan Swedish actor Werner Oland in another perspective entirely as Thibault is not to be missed for any fan of Earl Derr Biggers' famous sleuth.While after the painful Hollywood custom much of the rousing score has been sacrificed in the film's fast moving 104 minutes only 100 surviving in the TV print I've seen most of the best Some Day Only A Rose Huguette Waltz and of course Song of the Vagabond are here in fine form.

It's an exciting alternative to the fine if musicless 1938 Ronald Colman film drawn from The Vagabond King's source material If I Were King.";

	schema:reviewBody "The early sound films were in one sense a step forward and in another sense two steps back. If you look at the late silent films like Chaplin's A Woman Of Paris or Murnau's Sunrise the stories are sophisticated as is the acting and the directing techniques. But the films are mimed plays  we don't hear any dialog we may hear musical accompaniment. Then comes 1927 and The Jazz Singer. Finally we hear somethingand it is worthwhile it's Al Jolson's voice  talking and singing. But even there huge parts of that first talkie are silent the Warner Brothers were not willing to destroy everyone at once. By 1930 except for Chaplin constructing City Lights most of Hollywood was switched to talkies. But the early problems of acoustics and sound recording make many of these films difficult for modern audiences. Also a reluctance to trust voices of established stars led to over reliance on stage performers.Dennis King happened to be an exceptionally talented actor and singer. Oddly enough due to his own choice he decided to stick to stage work until television came into it's own and then he willingly got into that new medium. This is fine because it leaves a record of his acting abilities and of his singing. But he only made a few movies in Hollywood and the best known one is not his initial film The Vagabond King but his supporting turn as comic villain and lover in The Devil's Brother  Fra Diavalo with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. It's ironic that that performance is recalled but understandable given the alternative two although both are good performances. His gentle vicar in Between Two Worlds has a moving scene where he leads the passengers on that odd ocean liner into a quiet childlike prayer  a very fine sequence by the way. And his performance as the brilliant gutter poet of the 15th Century France Francois Villon is preserved in The Vagabond King one of the leading American operetta of the 1920s. But the former part is not the lead role of Between Two Worlds and the productions standards of The Vagabond King are hopelessly dated today.Still The Vagabond King has much going for it four top performances by King Jeannette MacDonald as Katherine the King's niece O.P. Heggie as the crafty old Spider King Louis IX of France and Lillian Roth as Villone's girlfriend and ultimately savior Huguette. Given the datedness of the dialog from Justin McCarthy's turn of the century play If I Were King the leads manage to squeeze every drop of value out of it. Sometimes without the dialog look at the scene where a shaved Villon awakes in a royal bedroom and slowly realizes things have changed. Look at Roth's moment singing of her love for Villon in the tavern when he is missing and considered in custody. MacDonald has to play a perfection part  a perfect princess who Villon falls quickly in love with and who slowly falls for him when he is made respectable by the King's whims. It is a thankless role she can't have much fun being perfect but she radiates charm and her singing songs like Only a rose that one in duet with King reminds the viewer of things to come in her future when her partners were named Maurice or Nelson not Dennis. Heggie's King does not sing in the film but he gets the craftiness of the Spider King. But not quite the brilliance of the political genius of that sinister man. Catch Basil Rathbone's version in the Ronald Colman version of IF I WERE KING later on to see that. However Heggie does capture Louis' least likable trait  he was one of the most vindictive men of his age.Fighting against them is the sound equipment and direction. Some aspects of the stage production were saved. The different types of servants serving Villon in the palace fat men as waiters bringing breakfast ladies in waiting to amuse him and dwarfs to help dress him must have been in the original Broadway production. Another positive thing is the amount of Friml's score at least three of his best songs are in the film including the celebrated Sons of Toil and Danger. But the sound quality is awful and the director at times fails to show any talent at all like his failure to show two duel scenes between King and his enemy the Grand Marshal of France a somewhat wasted Warner Oland  did part of his part end up being cut?.It's interesting to note that only three years later 1933 King appeared in The Devil's Brother. Tendencies to emote which he had in 1930 another failure of the director of The Vagabond King to control were replaced by a more relaxed style and the sound quality improved remarkably well too. Therefore it's another plus for the Laurel  Hardy comedy as King's best performance on film as opposed to the historically more important Villon in the current movie. All of which is terribly ironic. But for the strength of his performance as well as his three leading costars I wish Oland's was as good as theirs were and the Friml score the film is worthy of an 8 out of 10.".

It's sad though that Dennis King was not given proper direction for the screen in his performance.Of course he and Jeanette MacDonald sing the Rudolf FrimlBrian Hooker songs beautifully. We even get a bonus of Lillian Roth singing the Waltz Hugette which was a big hit for her. If you remember in the biographical film I'll Cry Tomorrow Susan Hayward as Roth sings that song among others identified with Roth on the soundtrack. Probably a lot more of you remember the straight dramatic version of Justin Huntly McCarthy's play If I Were King that starred Ronald Colman eight years later. Seeing both I know where all the songs are it's like seeing Pygmalion after you've seen My Fair Lady. The Colman version had a much lighter touch to it though. Dennis King played it as a stalwart hero a little less of the rogue that Colman was. O.P. Heggie was also a far more serious Louis XI than Basil Rathbone was though I saw aspects in Heggie's performance that Rathbone no doubt imitated.Probably The Vagabond King was done just a tad too early. The early sound recording techniques don't help and in a few years King would have learned to dial it down a bit for the screen. Take a look at his dramatic nonsinging role as the country vicar in Between Two Worlds.King was Rudolf Friml's favorite Broadway leading man. He was the original Mountie in Rose Marie for those of you thought the part originated with Nelson Eddy and besides The Vagabond King he also starred as D'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers. For some reason that operetta was never made into a film and I wish it had. Even Dennis King playing it like he would for the stage would have been better than that awful thing with Don Ameche and the Ritz Brothers.The Vagabond King is certainly a film for Jeanette's legion of fans and it is a chance to see a Broadway star recreate his role for the screen despite the flaws.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sidney Poitier and Michael Caine strike a winning screen partnership in this chase thriller set in South Africa. However the most memorable portrayal comes from Nicol Williamson an oftunderrated actor who steals the show in virtually every film he's in as a particularly unpleasant racist security agent. The film is set against a background of volatile race relations but the political angle of the story isn't thrust forth too heavyhandedly. First and foremost this is a chase story... and it's all the better for it.Bantu activist Shack Twala Sidney Poitier is acquited of terrorism charges in a Cape Town court. He is on his way for a celebratory drink with his lawyer Rina Prunella Gee and her English boyfriend Jim Keogh Michael Caine when they are assaulted by two racist policemen. They turn the tables on the policemen and give them a pretty thorough beating. Twala and Keogh go on the run hoping to reach Johannesburg where Twala has a contact who can get them out of the country. However they are pursued all the way by the bigoted Major Horn Nicol Williamson. Horn's ultimate plan is to let Twala unknowingly lead him to the hideout of a rebel leader named Wilby.The Wilby Conspiracy is generally a good film. The acting is excellent throughout and the film has an unexpected element of humour with Caine and Poitier providing several dynamic exchanges. The script is sharp with enough incidents and twists to stay a step ahead of the viewer and an interesting central theme. There aren't many shortcomings in The Wilby Conspiracy though that's not to say it is perfect. The ending seems rather fudged and some of the plot developments don't quite ring true. The bit where Saeed Jaffrey's pretty young dental assistant attempts a treacherous doublecross is a good example of an unlikely plot contrivance. However on the whole this is a slick wellmade and absorbing movie.".

But unfortunately a really huge and ridiculous error was made in telling the tale.Due to political pressure brought to bear from various world human rights activists black nationalist Sidney Poitier is freed by the apartheid South African government. On the way to celebrate Poitier his lawyer Prunella Gee and her boyfriend Michael Caine get into a mle with South African police and after assaulting a pair of them have to flee.But it turns out the government in freeing Poitier in the first place has a whole other agenda. Poitier also has something else in mind to get a stash of diamonds hidden years ago in a robbery to aid the African National Congress. During the course of fleeing Poitier seeks the aid of an Indian dentist played by Saeed Jeffrey and his assistant Persis Khambatta. While Poitier is hidden away in a modern day priesthole he takes Khambatta in there with him and while the South African Security are even outside within a few feet of him Poitier and Khambatta are doing the horizontal mambo. Now granted Poitier had been in prison for 10 years and he was understandably ready to go still I found it a bit much. The steamy sex scene definitely sold a lot movie tickets but it was awkwardly planted into the story.Acting honors in this film go to Nicol Williamson as the South African Security Police Chief Horne. He is a chillingly evil man resolute in defense of the apartheid society and a bigoted product of that same society. Williamson is living proof of what Martin Luther King said about racism being as toxic to the perpetrator as to the victim.The Wilby in the Wilby Conspiracy is a Nelson Mandela like figure who is in exile in neighboring Botswana. He only enters the film at the very end and in a surprising way. The Wilby Conspiracy other than that tacked on sex scene done for box office dollars is a great portrait of the last days of the apartheid society of South Africa. It should be seen for Nicol Williamson's portrayal alone.".

	schema:headline " An interesting star pairing in an equally interesting situation marred slightly by a few things.";
	schema:reviewBody "Earlier in his career Mr. Poitier made The Defiant Ones about a black man and a white man on the run together and Something of Value about the strife between Great Britain and its colonies in Africa. Here he takes part in a sort of cross between the two a story about a South African rebel who is thrust together with a British playboy both of whom have to fight for their survival on a 900 mile trek to Johannesburg. Having just been released from prison on prior rebellionrelated charges Poitier is immediately targeted and mistreated causing Caine the boyfriend of Poitier's attorney to step in and help. Thanks to oppressive law enforcement officials the pair must flee the area and attempt to escape the country entirely. There's more to the story however as British Major Williamson locates them yet allows them to keep traveling perhaps having a grander scheme in mind. When Caine and Poitier reach Johannesburg they become embroiled in a plot to unearth some decadelong buried diamonds with the aid of Caine's girlfriend Gee shifty Indian dentist Jaffrey and his attractive assistant Khambatta. The story continues to turn and develop eventually involving Gee's estranged husband Hauer until Williamson's intentions are finally made clear. Poitier is intense and committed but not without a hint of humor. He also plays a scrappier character than he often was permitted to play rather than the immaculately tailored and clean ones he frequently portrayed. Caine does an excellent job and has good chemistry with Poitier. He's given more sarcastic or otherwise funny lines to deliver and does so adeptly. His ne'er do well character begins to display some deeper sense of feeling as the film progresses. Gee is at times unbearable. Sporting an unflattering shaggy wig in all but one scene and overemphasizing her lines obnoxiously she comes close to messing up the film several times. Fortunately she has a few lower key scenes that help somewhat. Williamson is excellent and provides plenty of interest as well as menace. De Gooyer makes for a very nasty little sidekick. Jaffrey is amusing and sad all at once while Khambatta is sultry and surprisingly dangerous. Hauer looking impossibly young and blonde plays a perfect jerk. Possessing a decidedly blunt point of view some viewers may find it unpalatable at times but it remains fascinating nonetheless. Some of the broader comedy aspects might have been better left out or toned down as they sometimes spoil the tension. Some technical ineptitude including a heavy reliance on questionable rear projection and a downright ridiculous use of speeding up the film mars the production slightly. There is a winceinducing sequence involving a power saw in a machine shop. Another impressive scene includes an entire section of a town working together to smuggle supplies onto a bus. The film is at its best when it focuses on the relationships between Poitier and Caine and that duo against Williamson. It falters a little when shoddy effects and the inappropriate acting of Gee take center stage. Filming took place in Kenya rather than in South Africa itself. Khambatta a former Miss India would soon appear with shaved head in Star Trek The Motion Picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good film but just a tad off. I think what bothered me was the rather flip attitude of Michael Caine's character. Just doesn't seem like a situation in which one would be so flip.On the other hand I would guess that it gives a pretty good idea of how things may have been in South Africa before freedom. And there are so very powerful segments in the film.However just when you think you've got a great political thriller  and you do  you then find the story is really about diamonds in a sink hole albeit diamonds that are to be used for Black freedom fighters. And who is helping them  an Indian dentist. And then there's a scene dropping down into a sink hole followed by a sort of silly chase scene.So it starts out kinda serious and then gets kinda silly. Then has an improbable ending that nevertheless is very serious.It's quite a good cast. Sidney Poitier may have been trying to move into action films with this film and after this film is when he turned more to directing. Michael Caine is a foreigner in South Africa who gets dragged into the plot through his lawyergirl friend Prunella Gee. Nicol Williamson plays a South African security officer chasing Poitier and Caine. Saeed Jaffrey plays the dentist and Persis Khambatta as his shady female partner. Rijk de Gooyer plays a Nazilike security agent. Rutger Hauer plays the wife of Gee needed only in the plot because he flies a plane.The problem with the film is that it never quite figures out what it wants to be. Serious drama sort of a buddy pic slightly adventure pic. And that's the problem. Entertaining yes but a split personality.".

It's a well working duo which has to overcome their differences to survive. The way how they begin to trust and care about each other is believable.The story is simple and moves quite fast  which isn't usual for 70's movies. The movie is mostly entertainment with apartheid being an issue in the background. The people who are expecting something deep might be disappointed . Personally I think that this movie sends a clear antiapartheid message without being preachy or sappy. There is also a reflection about human greed and sacrifice .Watch out for Rutger Hauer in small episode of pilot Blane . I also have to compliment the performances of Prunella Gee  Saeed Jaffrey and Persis Khambatta . The movie is both funny and dramatic and there are some beautiful landscapes here.I give it 610.".

All three principles are terrific but the script they're saddled with is at times too convoluted and at other times full of holes. It takes an inordinate of time to understand what's going on so the viewer ends up confused rather than intrigued.

With Kenya subbing for South Africa the movies has some stunning photography and a great score by Stanley Myers. The supporting cast includes a young Rutger Hauer Persis Khambatta and producer Helmut Dantine as a shifty prosecutor. Best of all is scenery chewer Nicol Williamson as the crafty cop trailing Poitier and Caine.

Prunella Gee and Saeed Jaffrey are excellent as well.Most of the film was shot in Kenya but that country subs fpr South Africa which makes sense as Driscolls novel addressed the controversy of apartheid which would have made filming in Capetown impossible at the time. The cast is really very diverse and talented. The story starts with Poitier Zack Twala being found innocent in a court trial. Rina Van Niekirk Gee is his lawyer and Jim KeoghCaine are there in court. After Zack is found innocent the 3 of them get into her car to go to her apartment to celebrate his freedom. They only get to the first police road block. From there they are are on the run. Zack wants to go to a confederate Anil Mukerjee Jaffrey to help them escape across the border. What he has not told Jim KeoghCaine is that he has an alternaternitive reason for looking up Anil. Jim overhears what is going on when they get to Anil's. They are being chased all the way there. Shacks lawyer is having an affair with Keough.The South African authorities following the group seem to want them to get over the border for a reason. Rather than give it away here watch the film. The filming is very well done and the pacing of the film is excellent. The movie is really more about the chase than the politics. Not a perfect film but darned entertaining.".

Prunella Gee who would later be in Sean Connery's last Bond film Never Say Never Again is one of the 2 women who get attention along with actress Persis Khambetta Star Trek The Motion Picture.While Gee gets the costar role Peris gets a steamy scene with Portier. The film while fictional is sort of about apartheid in South Africa. The struggles of that country with it's racist policy is well drawn in this film. While the film is not perfect anyone watching it should realize that this was what was happening in South Africa when the film was made.This film is not a classic but is a pretty solid film to watch for entertainment.

The film while fictional is sort of about apartheid in South Africa. The struggles of that country with it's racist policy is well drawn in this film. While the film is not perfect anyone watching it should realize that this was what was happening in South Africa when the film was made.This film is not a classic but is a pretty solid film to watch for entertainment. Sidney and Caine play off each other well.";

	schema:reviewBody "Even though The Wilby Conspiracy starred Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier two of my favorites I wasn't really expecting to like it. I thought it would be another boring movie about a small futile rebellion against apartheid in South Africa. It turned out to be an exciting thriller one that was extremely entertaining from start to finish! Sidney Poitier plays a newly freed prisoner but on his ride back home from the courthouse with his lawyer Prunella Gee and her boyfriend Michael Caine they're accosted by the police. They fight back in selfdefense but knowing that will not hold too much water as an excuse they flee the scene. As the three try to leave the country they get involved in a political scheme with Saeed Jaffrey all the while hounded ruthlessly by police chief Nicol Williamson.While both normally handsome leading men are a little bit grungy in this film it's still very much fun to watch. Rod Amateau's and Harold Nebenzal's script ties together so many great elements politics romance racial tension underground rebellion action and a touch of humor. They don't include silly comic reliefs that would cheapen the film instead it's a sophisticated sarcasm that makes the characters more human. Keep in mind though that the film does include the word conspiracy in the title so there will be some unexpected twists and turns as well as some potentially upsetting violence. Other than that rent this for an exciting movie night!".

Nobody feels any guilt although they probably should. Williamson himself might not even care except that his antiblackcongress activities are now interfered with by his own demise. Also his final thought may have been At last I can quit smoking. The first half is positively funny. Nobody is better at indignant shock than Michael Caine who is given some witty lines. Poitier on the other hand is more grim and dedicated to the cause of ending apartheid. Some of the other characters add color. Saeed Jaffrey is a trembling Indian dentist. Persis Khambatta is a fellow dentist and a fox both stunning and cunning. I have no idea why she copulates with Poitier a total stranger in a closet while police are searching the house though I understand why Poitier might chance it.Moments of suspense and comedy nicely woven together and directed with no particular poetry by Ralph Nelson.It made me laugh aloud at times.

We watched it recently on what appears to be a remastered DVD that has a great look something that other films from that era have not kept.The story involves a man Shack Twala that has served ten years in Robben Island where most political prisoners were sent for being a voice that was a threat for the white ruling class. Shack Twala's lawyer Rina Van Niekirk makes a case for the violation of human rights being taken away from him and surprisingly enough the prisoner is set free. Happiness for his release is only short lived. As Rina her boyfriend Jim Keogh and Twala go downtown their car is stopped and the police apprehend the just released man again.There were forces in higher places that did not take lightly the fact that a black man would get away because they understood that Twala would naturally try to go North to the friendly Bostwana to get away from his tormentors. Major Horn one of the most cruel men in the police force follows Keogh and Twala as they move up North a chase that will bring them to a final battle in which justice will prevail.Not having seen this film we were interesting in watching the duo formed by Sidney Poitier and Michael Caine two excellent actors in an action film that is never dull. Mr. Poitier has a steamy scene with the gorgeous Persis Khambatta in a closet as he is being sought by the police. Saeed Jaffrey offers some comic relief with his dentist Mukerjee. Nicol Williamson plays Major Horn.The film for obvious reasons could not have been shot in South Africa so Kenya was used for the exterior photography by John Coquillon who gets the beauty and barrenness of the country it tries to stand for.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wilby Conspiracy is an old movie and so it is less dramatic and has less action than a modern action movie. The Wilby Conspiracy was pretty entertaining. There were good chasing scenes and and some of it was very funny. The actors were really good. The movie was useful for learning about history because it showed an activist and how they were victimised by the racist police. It also shows some white south africans who are normally not in apartheid movies where the black characters are the heroes. Many whites in south Africa were against the system of apartheid especially whites with an English background. It is good that this movie shows this with a British Engineer helping the black criminal. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. Mainly this movie didn't have heaps of information about Apartheid  it never really explains why the activist was in gaol and what was his motivation. That would have made it more believable. It is possible that the filmmaker wanted the audience to not know so that he was just another black activist being victimised by the government. It would have been a more historically useful movie if the characters had talked about what their political beliefs were and why. The characters of the police were also a bit too simple  they were more like 'badies' than actual people. To be more useful for someone learning about history it could have been fairer to the whites who were police who were not evil badies just ignorant people who were part of the system everyone else was. This was an enjoyable film which had some good action and suspense parts. But for a way to learn about the history of apartheid it is not ideal there are some large gaps in what it tells you  and it is more concerned with excitement and action than politics and history.

They also did that in the TV show NYPD where David Caruso made love with his cop girlfriend. I think they should have made the love scene in the attic instead of the closet. The attic look like it had a lot more room and enough space to place a small boxspring and bed mattress and some bed sheets so the characters could make more intense detailed love scenes.

In 1952 he had appeared under Canada Lee in the slow but rewarding Cry The Beloved Country. Fast forward to 1997 and he's playing Nelson Mandela to Michael Caine's F.W. de Klerk in a pretty decent TV movie.It's Caine he stars with here getting top billing after his career was somewhat resurrected by Uptown Saturday Night. It's an overlooked film with some great comic chemistry between them and some genuinely witty lines. Stories of how Poitier's Shack Twala was electo tortured in prison are rendered blackly comic by their telling with Poitier showing more genuine comic flair than he ever did mugging opposite Bill Cosby.For such serious subjects the film flirts closely with the line between gallows humour and overt comedy but the wit of the script always keeps it from going overboard. At one point Twala explains how at school he discovered Marx and Lenin instead of Mark and Luke and from there had absolutely no difficulty getting into jail. Handsomely shot with Kenya doubling for South Africa it's only the rear projection for carhelicopter scenes in Pinewood Studios that detract.As the film progresses the events do start to become more fantastical and it's difficult to know what's more unbelievable about Persis Khambatta's character... her motivation or the Indian incidental music that follows her around wherever she goes. A rare sex scene for Poitier sees African drums take over his own music dominating hers as they become entwined. Similarly Prunella Gee starts out with a very sensible character but ends up being sexualised more and more as the film progresses. Fortunately it manages to pull the whole thing together with a very good series of twists at the end.Ultimately this well packaged picture is a strong vehicle for Caine Poitier and deserves to be more than to be a forgotten entry on both men's resumes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've only seen three of Andre Techine's films RendezVous Scene of the Crime and Wild Reeds but after watching Wild Reeds I knew I'd have to watch everything else he'd ever made for now I was a lifelong fan.Scene of the Crime has many of the virtues of Wild Reedsa film that will inhabit you for weeks after you've seen itchief among them Techine's intelligence and sensitive handling of character and  flair for melodrama. If Thomas Hardy were alive today he'd probably be Techine's scriptwriter.The film's two concerns are repression and freedom. Thomasa sullen angry 13 year oldand Lilihis dreamy distractedly neurotic mother undergo several collisions and unions with a young escaped convict and his friends they are left to pick up the pieces and reconfigure their lives. Both mother and son are bound by a repressions whose roots are in family community and religion. And each conflict with others binds them like a rope so that Thomas futilely lashes out in anger while Lili attempts to lose and in doing so find herself with an act of impulsive negation. We could trace much of the repression toward the less likable charactersother criminals or family membersbut doing so is futile. Techine understands what Renoir meant when said everyone has his reasons and so this film isn't about the difficulty of living with other people but the difficulty of living in this universe.Techine has often been called a novelistic director meaning he takes you deep inside his characters' thoughts and motivations. This doesn't involve voiceover just Techine's direction and the melodramatic plots that force their characters into confrontations ordained by the strength of their passions. Melodrama asks the most of its characters requires them to feel and undergo all they can. It's numerous coincidences and runins can seem like an amplified version of life's randomness and havoc. Techine's approach involves an analytical acceptance of melodrama's approach to narrative a willing and measured use of its conventions resulting in narratives that often seem more vivid than reality and paradoxically more truthful and satisfying. The emotions unearthed are more intense than those brought out by reality but possess the inner truth of reality.His technique is not flashy attentiongetting or hyperformalistic which means it works discreetly and extremely well. There is an everpresent analytical attention to the natural and un surroundings that surround his characters along with an intense intimacy toward them. He follows very few rules and mixes quick cutting with measured long takes and a mobile camera. All this allows us to move back and forth and toward and away from his characters sympathizing with them in closeup one moment then judging at a detached angle or pan to another character's reaction. It is a wonderfully effective method and constantly reminds us of each character's motivations as do the relentless melodramatics.Techine's films aren't formally difficult but if you lose track at one point it's hard to catch up because his characters will have accumulated even more motivations and reactions by then. The intense sensitivity of his style allows us to accurately register each character's accumulating layer of emotions which continually enlarge their motivations. To lose track of that accumulative process is probably what happened to Roger Ebert who wrote the film should have been a gangster drama made in 1939 so that the melodramatic plot would seem more acceptable and Techine's moments of psychological insights wouldn't seem so out of place. The film IS primarily flawed in the sketchiness of the convict's lover and the overlyrushed pace of the climactic sequence.He doesn't consider that the melodrama of the plot is precisely what allows for those moments of psychological insight. And desire for the film to be an oldfashioned crime noir seems inexplicable when this is obviously a family drama where crime serves to provoke a shakeup and reevaluation of family relations and the lifedirections the characters have chosen. At the end of Scene of the Crime we're not sure whether Thomas and Lili have either recovered or damaged forever. And as Lili hauntingly remarks after a certain point losing and finding yourself may be the same process.".

	schema:headline " Lacks focus but interesting";
	schema:reviewBody "The title is a bit misleading since Le lieu du crime is not a noir thriller or a mystery. It is a relationships movie with psychological undertones. Director Andr Tchin is especially drawn to the exploration of family affairs featuring naturalistic depictions of human sexuality. For example see Ma Saison Prfre 1993 also starring Catherine Deneuve in which the central tension maintained for decades is that of a brother's unrequited desire for his older sister. Tchin is very good at exploring taboo situations without leaving us with a sense of the perverse and he is able to hint at a deeper nonexpressed sexuality behind ordinary life.Here Catherine Deneuve stars as Lili Ravenel who has a 13yearold son Thomas Nicolas Giraudi who is not doing well at school a father who no longer cares about people at all including members of his own family and a mother who is emotionally close and distant by turns. Lili is estranged from her husband a man she no longer loves if ever she did. She is a woman of a certain age who finds diversion in managing a night club. Thus we have the familiar psychology of the bored middle class woman who we know will be drawn irresistibly to the excitement of an outsider. Directors who find themselves in the enviable position of directing the beautiful cool and stately Deneuve seem themselves irresistibly drawn to showing her in compromised situations. I'm thinking of Belle de Jour 1967 and Mississippi Mermaid 1969 directed respectively by Luis Buuel and Francois Truffaut. In the former Deneuve is a daytripping prostitute and in the latter she is a criminal on the run. For some odd reason there is something deeply moving about seeing Deneuve give into her baser nature. I think.Anyway here she does indeed give herself to the rough young man who has killed his companion and she does so without a hint of regret or lingering doubt. Incidentally in Tchin's Ma Saison Prfre mentioned above there is a scene in which a young intern has his way with Deneuve using much the same approach that Wadeck Stanczack who plays Martin an escaped con employs here. That Lili's sexuality is aroused by his crude demand is the psychology that Tchin wants to concentrate on but because one of the weaknesses of his movie is a lack of focus the impact of her desire is not as strongly felt as it might be. For a most striking and stunning exploration of this theme see Vittoria De Sica's unforgettable The Garden of the FinziContinis 1971.Another weakness of this movie is some unconvincing action and dialogue in places. The opening scene in which Thomas is threatened by Martin who demands money to help him escape is a case in point. Martin's threats seem mild and ineffective. One wonders why Thomas is compelled to return. I also wonder about the boy's response to seeing his mother in bed with Martin. His first reaction is to say He will kill you! and then later he asks his father Is that love? which doesn't seem like something a 13yearold would say. A sixyearold maybe. Also a puzzle is why Claire Nebout who is interesting as Alice the girl involved with the two escapees stops her car in the rain to pick up Thomas only to throw him out a few minutes later. Why did she stop at all? As the scene was shot he seemed to be in the middle of the road so she couldn't avoid him but considering that it was dark and it was raining I don't think that would happen. At any rate the purpose of the scene is to show that Thomas like his mother is starved for excitement begging Alice to take him with her.My favorite Tchin movie is RendezVous 1985 starring a very young and vital Juilette Binoche who is clearly adored by the director. It is like this movie uneven in places but Binoche is incredibly sexy and captivating. If you are a Binoche fan see it. You will experience a side of her not shown in her American movies.By the way when this was filmed Deneuve was about 43yearsold and had already appeared in at least 67 films. She is the kind of woman who grows more beautiful as she grows older. I found her much more attractive here than when I first saw her in the celebrated The Umbrellas of Cherbourg 1964 released when she was 21.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "Penned by noted erogothic horrormeister Jean Rollin this 6th installment in the seemingly unending Emmanuelle series steals a page from that other Emanuelle single M series starring Laura Gemser in its attempts to blend erotic fantasy and sleazy exploitation with some vague premise involving a druglord and white slavery ring.

As to be expected there is much photogenic nudity and soft core sex amidst the exotic settings of the rain forest. This time Emmanuelle is played by gorgeous German model Natalie Uher who's blank vacant style of acting is hilarious but fitting for the series. And like the previous films this one boasts very good production values. Wellphotographed welllit fantasy featuring some truly hilarious dialog! I was surprised at how entertaining and enjoyable Emmanuelle 6 turned out to be. I would like to see it in it's original widescreen aspect ratio as it really is lovely to look at. Recommended for those who like sexy films that aren't pornographic. these films make women look beautiful without debasing them with hardcore imagery.".

It's plot line is disjointed but it serves its purpose....to show lovely women in the nude. There are several scenes featuring gorgeous ladies in the buff including every squareinch of the spectacular Natalie Uher. In fact this film is GROUNDBREAKING as the first movie to clearly show a woman's vagina and still receive an Rrating by the MPAA. Usually the MPAA gives full female genitalia the labia and clitoris an NC17 rating. The MPAA typically employs an unfair and discriminatory doublestandard where they will allow penises to be shown in Rrated films but not vaginas. This film breaks that doublestandard and sets a new precedent by clearly showing the lead actresses' vulva as she sunbathes. So if you are watching this film to see lots of good female nudity then you will enjoy it. If you are expecting Gone With The Wind or Deep Throat then you will be disappointed. 55".

Austrian model Natalie Uher was the 4th girl to play Emmanuelle in the official series  and she did have the looks! Natalie had posed for Playboy magazine at a very early age so she was no beginner. The element of the exotic is always important for an Emmanuelle movie this time locations in Brazil and Venezuela served well for that. The story avoids a close connection with the previous movies by a trick Emmanuelle suffers from amnesia! She was found in the Amazonian forest and now she visits a professor who tries to help her. It seems Emmanuelle was on board of a cruise ship then kidnapped to be sold on a slave market. Fortunately she had friends including an Indian girl... Uncredited Jean Rollin directed some scenes for this movie especially the scene with the snake dance appears to be his surreal style. Emmanuelle 6 has many beautiful scenes the love scenes as well as for example the fight of the Indians against the gangsters flying arrows out of the mysterious blue shadows. Probably it's the most underrated part of the series. I voted 786467 for the six cinema films.".

Indeed much of this motion picture was filmed aboard the famous battleship that is now a national monument on the bottom of Pearl Harbor.Another prominent feature of Here Comes The Navy is the USS Macon the U.S. Navy's last dirigible. If the elderly battleship USS Arizona was a leftover from World War I the USS Macon represented the cutting edge of technology in 1934 much as the Space Shuttle does today. The giant airship crashed into the Pacific Ocean less than a year after this film was produced fortunately with the loss of only two of her 100 crew members. Although the service continued to operate much smaller and less expensive nonrigid blimps for many years the loss of the USS Macon put an end to the Navy's rigid airship program. There can be little doubt that many of the USS Macon's crewmen seen in this movie were still aboard at the time of the crash.Of course the principal feature of Here Comes The Navy is the crackling byplay between perennial rivalbuddies James Cagney and Pat O'Brien both of whom were at the top of their form here. As usual Cagney plays the brash wiseguy while O'Brien is the steady authority figure bent on channeling Cagney's energy into the right direction. It is a formula they were to repeat in several more movies most famously in Angels With Dirty Faces.Caught between Cagney and O'Brien is Gloria Stewart. This was the same Gloria Stewart who would later be featured in the 1997 version of Titanic. Stuart did a reasonable job here even though she was inevitably upstaged by her two dynamic costars. But then Cagney and O'Brien could easily steal scenes from anybody.Here Comes The Navy is a treat for Cagney fans and there are still plenty of those out there. It is equally a treat for history buffs. Originally intended as a showcase for the contemporary Navy the movie is now a time capsule of the service in a bygone era.".

While it is yet another Jimmy Cagney film in many ways it shocked me when I saw that the film was set aboard the USS Arizonathe famous ship that was completely destroyed with most of its crew at Pearl Harbor just a few years later. Seeing Cagney and crew walking about this doomed ship is a rare opportunity to see the ship that still rests at the bottom of Pearl.Later to my utter amazement the USS Macon one of the US Navy's dirigibles makes an appearance as well! This huge airship was to be destroyed in a storm only a year later and once again the real ship was used in parts of the film. This is once again an amazing opportunity to see the ship.So combining the two rare opportunities with a pretty decent Cagney film gives you a film wellworth seeing. For those who don't care about the historical aspects of the film I give it a 7it's still pretty good and worth a look.".

Seeing Cagney and crew walking about this doomed ship is a rare opportunity to see the ship that still rests at the bottom of Pearl.Later to my utter amazement the USS Macon one of the US Navy's dirigibles makes an appearance as well! This huge airship was to be destroyed in a storm only a year later and once again the real ship was used in parts of the film. This is once again an amazing opportunity to see the ship.So combining the two rare opportunities with a pretty decent Cagney film gives you a film wellworth seeing. For those who don't care about the historical aspects of the film I give it a 7it's still pretty good and worth a look.";

	schema:reviewBody "Here Comes the Navy is a key film in the history of cinema. As it marks the first teaming of James Cagney and Pat O'Brien that in itself is historic. For these two in my humble opinion are the inventors of the male buddy film. The only other rivals for that distinction are Edmund Lowe and Victor McLaglen when they did a series of films as Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt. Cagney and O'Brien were teamed for seven years by Warner Brothers in various parts.This also is James Cagney's first film in any of our Armed Services. He's the usual fresh mouthed Cagney who as a civilian runs afoul of CPO Pat O'Brien over a woman played by Dorothy Tree. Then Cagney joins the Navy and there's O'Brien waiting for him. And O'Brien has a sister Gloria Stuart who Cagney falls for.But of course when Warner Brothers had the good idea of shooting this movie at the San Diego Naval Station they had no idea that they would be shooting on what became a national shrine. In fact it's mentioned several times that both O'Brien and Cagney are assigned to the battleship U.S.S. Arizona. Shortly after this film was made the Arizona and the rest of the Pacific Fleet moved to Honolulu and on December 7 1941 the Arizona became a part of history. A whole lot of the crew of the Arizona served as extras in Here Comes the Navy so a lot of the faces you see are probably at the bottom of Pearl Harbor in the Arizona. Knowing that I find it incredible that Here Comes the Navy has never made it to VHS or DVD. Hopefully that will be rectified soon.".

	schema:headline " Cagney gets a new screen partner";
	schema:reviewBody "With the birth of the production code the fun precode frolics of Cagney and Joan Blondell were at an end. Thus Warner Brothers came up with a new dynamic screen team  James Cagney and Pat O'Brien. This is the first of the films they did together. Prior to the production code O'Brien often played the same kind of roles that Cagney played  the fasttalking smart guy with big ideas and a big dose of attitude. Since you can't have two of these in the same picture O'Brien was generally promoted to being the more traditionally respectable of the two in their films together and such is the case here.The film starts with construction worker Chesty O'Conner James Cagney and naval officer Biff Martin Pat O'Brien trading at first verbal barbs and then punches. Chesty gets fired from his job because of the time he takes off recovering from the fight and decides to go another round with Biff. Unfortunately Biff's ship has put out to sea so Chesty thinks the solution is to join the navy and get assigned to Biff's ship. He actually does wind up on Biff's ship but soon learns he can't take to punching out officers whenever the mood strikes him. To complicate matters Chesty takes a shine to Biff's sister Dorothy Gloria Stuart and this just inflames matters more as Biff wants his sister to have nothing to do with Chesty. Warner contract player Frank McHugh provides the comic relief as Droopy Mullins Chesty's stalwart friend and shipmate.The film works better than most made right after the production code primarily because the teaming of Cagney and O'Brien worked so well. By turning down the volume a bit on O'Brien's screen sauciness and turning up the volume on Cagney's the two play off of each other's dynamism perfectly. This film is also interesting for historical reasons  it was filmed on and around the U.S.S. Arizona one of the ships that sank at Pearl Harbor seven years after this film was made.".

These are but a few of the many insults traded by Jim Cagney as Seaman 2nd Class Chester Chesty' O'Connor and Pat O'Brien as Chief Petty Officer Biff Martin both on and off the U.S.S. Arizona.The film follows their tumultuous association as civilians before ironworker Cagney joins the navy and then as military colleagues thrust upon each other on a peacetime vessel.James Cagney looks great in a tux and gets to dance a little before the real fun starts.  The ironworkers have thrown themselves a dance and first prize is a big silver cup.  Chesty's pristine crisp rented tuxedo doesn't last very long as Gladys Hawkins his girlfriend literally waltzes off with Biff Martin.  Chesty doesn't take kindly to this and the two men who have previously locked horns Cagney and the ironmen antagonize the passing sailors by shouting conflicting commands at them come to blows.  O'Brien wins the fight and the dance crowd simply walks over the prostrate form of poor Chesty who can only lie there in a heap.  To add insult to injury O'Brien and Gladys win the 1st prize for the waltz contest!  The following day things get even worse as Chesty is laid off from his job and Gladys dumps him preferring Biff's company.Vowing revenge Chesty decides to join the navy to get even with Biff. First stop is the San Diego naval training station where Frank McHugh always topnotch and extremely funny in this movie as Wilbur Droopy' Mullins enters the picture.  He and Chesty become fast friends who cover for each other and who borrow money back and forth so fast all throughout the film forget trying to keep up. Droopy's reason d'etre seems to be to try to send his poor mom enough money for her to buy a decent pair of false teeth ones that will enable her to keep up with her job as choir singer AND allow her to eat meat. This is a VERY funny running gag with an excellent payoff at the end of the film.After training Chesty and Droopy are assigned to Biff's ship the U.S.S. Arizona as hoped.  The moment Chesty claps eyes on Biff he attempts to punch him.  Needless to say this is not encouraged and his efforts are immediately curtailed.  Biff then decides to make naval life very difficult for his nemesis.While Chesty has supposedly given up on dames' because of his experience with Gladys enter Dot Biff's sister played well by Gloria Stuart.  Of course Chesty is unaware that she's also a Martin and chases her until he wrangles a dinner invitation out of her.  On liberty for the evening of the dinner Biff pays a visit to Dot and in seconds the boys are at it again.After a series of misadventures Chesty actually escapes duty by bribery and sneaking off the ship in disguise to see Dot and is admonished by Biff who reports him as AWOL.  Chesty is a prisoner and cannot leave the ship. He degrades the other sailors who avoid him at all costs.  He and Dot also split in a dramatic wellplayed scene in which they are both terribly disillusioned.  Later Chesty proves his courage during a mock battle but he denounces the officers the medal he receives and the navy as a whole.  He is then granted a transfer to a naval aircraft a zeppelin.  The crew of the Arizona must then act as ground crew for a mock maneuver Chesty's aircraft is involved in Biff gets in trouble and Chesty ends up saving the day and getting the girl. Droopy's infamous mom is finally seen at the end of the film and we even get a glimpse of her new false teeth!Very entertaining and lots of fun with all the stars in top form.  Cagney and O'Brien argue and fight all through the film in some great comic scenes  yet they were best friends in real life!Recommended!!!".

In this film the actual African American characters look at Cagney in blackface as if he were goofy. They too let it pass.";

This film starts off with a great bang but as the movie goes along things become quite predictable and rather flat. The first part of the movie is great with a lot of fighting and insults being thrown by Cagney. Needless to say Cagney is very energetic and delivers another fine performance. His relationship with Stuart is also handled very well as the two actors have a lot of chemistry together. O'Brien is in good form as well and he and Cagney do their magic unlike any other duo. The biggest problem comes in the middle where the story pretty much gets weighted down by the familiar bit where the cocky Cagney must learn what it means to be a normal human being and shut his mouth up before it gets him in real trouble. The action scene at the end is very nice as is the funny ending. The most shocking scene comes when Cagney sneaks off the boat in blackface.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me it's always cool to come away from a picture with something that was entirely unexpected. In the case of Here Comes The Navy I literally did a jump in my seat to see and hear mention of the U.S.S. Arizona the famed battleship that went down during the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought our country into World War II. I had only seen this huge ship before in documentary footage covering that historical event so it was a rare treat to see aspects of daily routine occurring aboard ship during the film's run.The other treat of course is catching Jimmy Cagney and Pat O'Brien in the first of their many teamups for First NationalWarner Brothers. You know I still can't get over the fact that some of their best work together took place over seventy years ago! In this one the duo is at odds with each other as Cagney's character Chesty O'Connor signs up for a stint in the Navy just to get aboard the ship commanded by his nemesis Biff Martin O'Brien. There's not a whole lot of credibility to the timing and coincidence necessary for that particular circumstance to take place but that's no problem for the movies. Complicating matters further wouldn't you know is that Martin has a sister Gloria Stuart that Chesty goes for so right there you've got the makings for an even more heated rivalry.Speaking of which that seemed to be a common plot element in many of the early Warner Brothers flicks of the era. In the 1937 prison movie San Quentin inmate Humphrey Bogart had a sister that the warden fell for thereby giving the impression that Bogey's character was getting preferential treatment. The warden  Pat O'Brien! You really have to catch one of Cagney's early films to get a sense of where all that enormous talent came from. This picture offers a dance scene part of the 'Iron Workers' Frolic' that allows Cagney to strut his fancy footwork. I got a kick out of the poster advertising the dance contest I've never seen one before that promoted 'Big Doings'! Just another one of the visual treats you can appreciate from a picture from the 1930's. Another was catching Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams as the dance floor manager looking almost impossibly young but in checking I was shocked to learn that by the time of this movie's release he had already been in over eighty pictures!!! Learning something new every day.Anyway story wise you won't find anything resembling an Oscar contender here but you can still have some fun with this first CagneyO'Brien team up. Character actor Frank McHugh a frequent Cagney supporter is on hand to lend comic relief. His gimmick has to do with buying his mother a pair of false teeth  and to think back then you could do it for twenty dollars! Now that's the good old days!".

Usually Jimmy's the cocky jerk and Pat's the nice guy. That's sort of the case here too but I actually found myself liking Cagney more than O'Brien. He's fun and likable even if he's not always right. Pat on the other hand is a sour puss throughout the movie. Gloria Stuart plays O'Brien's sister who Cagney falls in love with. She's very pretty and does a fine job in a part that requires very little. Historically important for being partially filmed on board the USS Arizona which was destroyed at Pearl Harbor seven years later. Also some footage of the dirigible USS Macon which crashed the year after this film was released. It's a fun movie that fans of the stars will certainly enjoy. The climax is implausible but exciting. There is a blackface gag that will set some today back on their heels so be prepared for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is more fun than you might expect. Not the romance which is dull and familiar. A swabbie Cagney falls for the daughter of a Chief Boatswain's Mate O'Brien and the two guys hate each other. They always seem to be stationed together. And Cagney's character is equally familiar  the tough selfish cynic who joins the Navy on a dare and finds himself stuck. He proves himself a hero of course as all these characters do as Cagney himself was to do a few years later in The Fighting 69th. That's all boring. What's fun and interesting are the locations. Usually a story like this is shot on relatively cheap cardboard sets with some inserted footage of Navy ships. See Follow the Fleet inter alia for an example.Here though as other commentators have pointed out the shooting was done on the decks of the real USS Arizona and there is considerable footage of the dirigible Macon which was housed at Moffet Field near Palo Alto California. The monstrous hangars are still there.The first time Cagney demonstrates his altruism is while the Arizona is on fleet maneuvers off San Diego. It's genuine heroism too. A powder bag leaks and a fire threatens the entire turret. Cagney throws himself on the burning powder to smother it. There was a similar explosion in the turret of the battleship USS Iowa in 1989 that damaged much of the turret and killed 47 crewmen. The Navy blamed it on a homosexual spat. I may be biased because I was on a ship that took part in fleet maneuvers off San Diego too. I was a lowly lookout with no real responsibility and enjoyed every minute of watching guns go off in the sunshine. My ship the Coast Guard Cutter Gresham was supposed to track a submarine on sonar but couldn't find the submarine in the first place so the exercise was a flop. I won't bother to describe the farce that followed the announcement of Air action port! Where was I? I wish someone would discretely flap a napkin at me when I got off topic like that. I'd do as much for you. Anyway the second time Cagney indulges in heroics is a charm. He gets the girl saves O'Brien and wins another medal I guess.Cagney is his usual bouncy self sneering and ready to bop everybody on the schnozz. O'Brien is reliable and unexciting. Gloria Stuart who passed on recently is less than inspiring. Frank McHugh lends solid support. I could hardly believe it when I saw Bill Elliot as a Navy officer. Ten years later he would make a series of cheap Westerns and serials as Wild Bill Elliot one of my faves when I was a kid.At any rate and for whatever reason I expected to be rather more bored than I was. Nice crisp photography.".

	schema:reviewBody "Effective Gothic thriller. I especially like the setup where Vicki Cortese gains admittance to the US by impersonating a dead fellow prisoner in a WWII concentration camp . That way she not only has her own secrets but is also no unblemished young thing which is usually the case in these womanindanger films. Once in the US however she marries into great wealtha dream come truebut in the process gets more than she bargained for.A lot of the story depends on appropriate emoting. Fortunately it's a powerhouse cast but I especially like Fay Baker's icy nanny Margaret. She's quietly intimidating without overdoing it. Too bad she didn't get bigger roles in more movies. I can't help noting however that Cortese may be the only Hollywood leading lady without a perfect nose. It's a fine regal beak and I'm glad she hung on to it. I can also see why Basehart fell for her in real life.The San Francisco locations make a good open air contrast to the dark mansion interiors that dominate the characters. I expect director Wise applied his noir skills from the great Val Lewton series of horror flicks. Also the ending amounts to a delicious twist both unpredictable and very well thought out. My one problem was figuring out who's related to whom since that's important to the plot. I don't know if that's the screenplay's fault or mine.Anyway it's an effective thriller with a fine cast and an imaginative ending worth tuning in for.".

	schema:reviewBody "A most interesting movie in the Fox film noir range is House on Telegraph Hill. It's especially pleasing to see this title made available not only because it undoubtedly rates as a true film noir but it's one that fully deserves to be better known. I don't recall seeing it before at all either on first release or TV. Released on 13 May 1951 21 September 1951 in Australia the movie's box office potential was hampered by its cast. Undoubtedly a fine actor Richard Basehart was never a mustsee draw at the neighborhoods. For this movie he managed to persuade Fox to hire his wife Valentina Cortese for the main role. She also was a brilliant actress but at this stage no ticketwindow sensation either.Thus the ticketselling brief was borne chiefly by William Lundigan a competent player within a very limited range. I always thought he had little charisma but there were fans who liked him. Not a sufficient number however to make House on Telegraph Hill a rousing success. Which was a shame because House is a very deft noir thriller with atmospheric photography by Lucien Ballard and excellent moodily overplush art direction from John De Cuir and set decorator Paul Fox. True Ballard does not photograph Miss Cortesa very attractively but her stunning Renie costumes help to disguise this problem. Lovely Fay Baker brings considerable presence to the support cast. And I enjoyed the brief caf glimpse of Chinese singer Mari Young who renders the opera ballad Lover's Broken Dream accompanied by Gew Wong on the butterfly harp Lung Wong Chinese banjo and Lee Wong twostring violin.In short House on Telegraph Hill fulfills two essential noir requirements 1 The prevailing mood both photographically and storywise is dark 2 the central character is not only threatened and in danger but finds herself in a situation from which it seems impossible to escape.".

It's like Okay we get the setup here. Now how about something actually happening? Nothing much did until the final minutes with the exception of a very short automobile scene.The first part is the most interesting when we see how the heroine of the story Victoria Kowelska Valentina Cortese makes it to America to take the place of another woman in San Francisco. She was interesting to me only because she was a new face sometime I don't recall seeing before on film. Most of her fine film career has been done in Italy.I did enjoy the two main male actors too Richard Basehart and William Lundigan but they were nothing super playing routine roles. The set designs with the big house on Telegraph Road were nice. It was another of those big old mansions in which these kind of stories always took place in the 1940s films. Great lighting always makes these houses with the long stairways look Gothic and foreboding especially in blackandwhite photography.For those who see the title and read the previews and thus are excepting more of a film noir or even a thriller with horror overtones consider yourself warned. Instead it's more of a women's film and a stereotypical one at that. It's okay but nothing memorable.".

The movie may be part of Fox's Film Noir Collection but it's really more of a Hitchcock womaninperil type film. The movie may seem unusual when seen today with the modern emphasis on the plot twist. Throughout most of the film I kept waiting for the inevitable twist that never materialized. The lack of a twist each time I thought I saw one coming was in its own way the best twist of all. The House on Telegraph Hill is deliberately paced and shot beautifully by Robert Wise. Some of the interior scenes especially those in the hallway of the old house look as good as you'll see. The acting is great with the relative unknown at least unknown to me Valentina Cortese giving a real standout performance. She has an undeniable screen presence and the ability to draw a viewer in. I really felt for her character's situation throughout the movie. The ending of the film is very nicely done and had me on the edge of my seat. As I was waiting for a twist I was completely surprised by the final act. The drama and suspense are almost palatable throughout the film's finale. Overall The House on Telegraph Hill is a very nice underseen film.".

Her gradual awareness of Basehart's character are the primary focus of this movie. Also in the mix is the young son of her deceased friend and the friend's great aunt who left the mansion to her. The photography by Lucien Ballard is terrific throughout especially the closeups of Basehart.

	schema:reviewBody "The House on Telegraph Hill 1951A very solid movie with a bit of a forced hand and something like a familiar plot in new clothes. The key innovation is that it ties the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp to a conventional American melodrama and has the lead woman taking on the identity of her best friend in the camps. It is filmed with precision and drama all the way through and makes a visually strong statement as well as one with the social message that the adjustments of Nazi victims and their survivors is really hard to fathom. It kludges along a little with a narrative fix to make the information clear and fast at the start and get us to San Francisco 1950.The leading character played by Italian actress Valentina Cortese though she might well be intended to be a Polish Jew given her situation in the camp is very strong a somewhat awkward leading woman but different than some of the types populating postwar movies. I liked her increasingly and her difference as an actress helps cement her difference as a character from her American friends. She deserves our sympathy and overall she gets it. Oddly that element of surviving a death camp six years after the liberation of a string of them in Europe from the Nazis becomes less and less salient so that when the woman's duplicity is brought up toward the end the growing male protagonist brushes it off as just one of those things. He's right really but the fact that the woman returns and has to pretend to be a young boy's real mother is tough going if you consider something like the truth of it. It's convenient that the surrogate mother figure who has apparently done a pretty good job raising the kid is also a meanie in good Hollywood caricaturing style. The other man in the story the one who you expect to be on our leading lady's side turns out to be weak duplicitous and a bit of pretty wash by the end.Robert Wise is one of those smart directors who seems to make something unique happen no matter what the material. And the odd angles to this story even with the inevitable outcome make it really good.".

Startling eyes  the right eye looks straight ahead while the left is canted somewhat outward lending her every expression a kind of fey quality. From most angles her big features are full of bone structure dominated by an aquiline nose compellingly ordinary. She has the overall appearance of a northern Italian paisana from the Po Valley. She could be stomping on bitter rice next to Sylvana Mangano.In this film Cortese is an inmate at BergenBelsen and adopts the identity of a friend who dies. Not that this makes any difference in the rest of the story. She might as well be who she claims to be.Anyway with her new identity she returns to a Gothic house on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco that she has inherited from a deceased aunt. Her young son  or rather the son of her dead friend  lives there with his guardian Richard Basehart and a strangely distant maid servant Fay Baker. She and Basehart after a tooquick romance have been married but the moment they move into this cockeyed American Gothic house things seem askew.Basehart has the difficult job of projecting politeness and caring towards his wife without even the underlying hint of warmth. And Margaret the icy maid seems to have wandered in from Rebecca. The only person Cortese can depend on for honesty and confidence is William Lundigan in the Kent Smith role.In fact everybody and everything seems to have wandered into this rather unfocused romantic drama from someplace else. The young kid has a playhouse in the back yard bigger than the domicile I now occupy. It has a hole in the floor and wall and there is a scene in which Cortese snooping around as usual almost falls through to the street half a mile below when she is surprised by the ominous Basehart. I thought surely the climactic scene will involve that dangerous hole but no. It's never seen again thrown in willy nilly like so many other adventitious elements. The whole production is a patch work of vague threats all seen from the point of view of the uncertain and perhaps imbalanced Valentina Cortese.I didn't much care for it. Not so much because it's a mixture of romance mystery and drama in which everyone seems to be scuttling around behind everyone else's back but because little of it seems to hang together. Pretty thoughtless.Others might enjoy it more than I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "The House on Telegraph Hill is directed by Robert Wise and adapted for the screen by Elick Moll  Frank Partos from the novel The Frightened Child written by Dana Lyon. It stars Richard Baseheart Valentina Cortese William Lundigan  Fay Baker. Filmed on location primarily in the Telegraph Hill area of San Francisco the film features photography by Lucien Ballard and a musical score directed by Alfred Newman.Victoria Kowelska Cortese survives Belsen but with her family killed by the Nazis she is all alone in the world with no identity. With her Belsen friend Karin Dernakova Natasha Lytess not surviving till liberation Victoria decides to take on Karin's identity to get to America. Under the guise of being Karin Victoria winds up in San Francisco living in a prime mansion married to Dernakova trustee Alan Spender Baseheart mother to young Chris Gordon Gebert and heiress to the family fortune. But the House on Telegraph Hill is home to many secrets and unanswered questions Can Alan be trusted? Why is Margaret Baker the housekeeper cold towards her? What really brought about the death of the recently deceased aunt? And can she even trust her only real friend Major Marc Bennett Lundigan?Director Robert Wise was one of the most versatile men to have ever worked in cinema . He pretty much covered all genres in his long and distinguished career here for The House on Telegraph Hill he blends Gothic melodrama with film noir leanings. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction Wheeler DeCuir Little  Fox the film is certainly a lavish enough production and for sure the story is well elaborated but the picture as a whole is not all that it can be. For although it's rich with an eerie ambiance that's occasionally punctured by the promise of some sinister intervention it never delivers on its promises. The suggestions and heightened tensions grab the attention but the screenplay doesn't allow the woman in danger scenario room to grow. None of which is helped by the fact that the film opens with Victoria narrating her flashback in pasttense voice over! It's hardly a smart move by the makers that is it? Perhaps it's wrong to judge it as being part of the group that contains Rebecca 1940 Suspicion 1941 Gaslight 19401944 and The Spiral Staircase 1946? But fact remains it's a long way from being half as good as any of those films.However there is still enough in Wise's film to keep it above average and make it a safe recommendation to fans of the womaninmansioninperil subgenre. The story is well played by the principal actors. Baseheart has to play his cards close to his chest in the tricky role that requires him to keep us guessing as to if he is good or bad. That he offers no clues is testament to the good performance Baseheart gives. Italian actress Cortese binds the film together with a layered performance that contains excellent visual acting where nervous smiles and saddened eyes tell of guilt and longing that the screenplay has sadly not let the character expand upon. Baker is a touch underwritten but does a neat line in icy cold veneer while Lundigan offers up a nice counterpoint as the other man in Victoria's life. Having Lucien Ballard on cinematography is a good move. Be it capturing the expansive colour vistas for Budd Boetticher  Sam Peckinpah in Westerns or shooting in atmospherically stark black  white for the likes of John Brahm  Jacques Tourneur Ballard showed himself to be a master photographer. Here in the brooding Dernakova mansion he deals in shadows and low lights to great tonal effect. Alfred Newman's a record 9 time Academy Award winner score aided by Sol Kaplan is very dramatic and flows freely around the house and is at one with Victoria's various emotional states.The House on Telegraph Hill contains menacing undertones that are boosted by camera music and acting. If only the writing was in tune with those things then we would be talking about a classic of its type. 6.510".

She uses this new identity as a ticket to America marries Richard Basehart and assumes the mother role to the son the dead woman left behind. All the while a possessive and meddling nanny lurks in the background and resists all of Cortesa's overtures to create a happy family.Richard Basehart was terrific as a villain. He had leading man good looks but was so good at being oily and duplicitous. There is some attempt at making the audience guess how much Cortesa's character is actually in danger from her husband there's an inheritance involved and how much the nanny is implicated but only some. Mostly the plot is straightforward and we know Cortesa will get out of everything o.k. just not exactly how.The film has the look of a film noir heightened by the San Francisco atmosphere but it's really more of a conventional suspense thriller than a true noir.

	schema:reviewBody "The interesting American career of Italian actress Valentina Cortese met a high point here in one of her best known films. The next year she gave an even better performance in SECRET PEOPLE 1952 see my review but here she is also excellent. Here she plays a Polish woman whereas in SECRET PEOPLE she is Italian presumably based upon the theory that one foreign accent sounds like any other to the Americans and with those exquisitely sensitive eyes she might as well be Polish indeed from anywhere she says because we believe her. The story commences in the grim surroundings of Belsen where she and a woman friend are imprisoned by the Nazis. Her friend dies three days before the American liberators arrive and Valentina assumes her identity because at least the friend has a son in America while she has no one and nothing left and anyway she speaks English with an Italian accent so that's OK then. This eventually leads her as a displaced person to New York where she meets an intimidating lawyer and the sinister Richard Basehart who is guardian of 'her' young son who is named Chris and lives in a big mansion on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco. The American Major who interrogated Valentina at Belsen turns up at a party as American Majors do in films especially when they are played by handsome and reliable William Lundigan and she turns to him for help because she is becoming worried by Richard Basehart who married her as soon as he saw her in New York and she soon realizes it was really to secure his position in control of the large family fortune. Yes the story is pretty farfetched. Robert Wise does his usual superior job of directing but this script needs more than that. Despite the fact that this film is largely set on Telegraph Hill it is not one of those hills which is alive with the sound of music. There is a playhouse at the bottom of the garden with a big hole in the floor through which one can fall 300 feet to one's death. It has been sitting there like that for four years 'since the explosion'. For such a large and carefullykept mansion with a Chinese butler there is a distinct shortage of maintenance in the garden despite its impeccably cut lawn! Naturally Valentina falls down the hole when she is cornered there by Basehart but he grabs her hands and saves her from death. But that is only a temporary respite for there is the poisoned orange juice to come. Oh but between those two events there is the brake fluid drained from the car. And you know how steep those San Francisco hills are without brake fluid. She is saved by a pile of construction sand onto which she lands when the car crashes and she is thrown out. Everything about this story is perfectly natural and happens every day. Valentina loves 'the feel of silk on my skin again' after her sufferings at Belsen and she has a very sweet nature but there is a creepy woman named Margaret in the house played by the eerily forbidding Fay Baker who is very possessive of the little boy Chris whose only interest appears to be baseball and is played by a child actor named Gordon Gebert who has a rather annoying voice and is badly handled on screen. Robert Wise had clearly not learned the art of directing children yet. The tension mounts as we slowly climb the Telegraph Hill of this story and the tale becomes increasingly Gothic and less and less convincing. Will Valentina who survived Belsen also be able to survive Basehart's machinations to do her in and have the money to himself? It is very much touch and go and I ain't sayin'.".

Valentina takes a chance and gets from the fryingpan into the fire but in a completely different world  from the atrocious misery of concentration camps to webs of intrigue in the riches and luxuries of high society in California.Robert Wise was always one of the most reliable of directors while he never repeated himself  it's astounding how different the character of every one of his films is from all the others. Here we find ourselves in a thriller like in The Spiral Staircase but with more interesting human relationships as you walk in blindness among the manoeuvring characters as much as Valentina does and you can only suspect the worst of almost every one of them  except the real perpetrator. Only in the last scene the real drama is revealed and the only one who understood it all from the beginning was the dead woman in the portrait who triumphs.It's a film of outstanding eloquence both in intrigue dialogue cinematography and above all direction. Even the music couldn't be better.".

Valentina takes a chance and gets from the fryingpan into the fire but in a completely different world  from the atrocious misery of concentration camps to webs of intrigue in the riches and luxuries of high society in California.Robert Wise was always one of the most reliable of directors while he never repeated himself  it's astounding how different the character of every one of his films is from all the others. Here we find ourselves in a thriller like in The Spiral Staircase but with more interesting human relationships as you walk in blindness among the manoeuvring characters as much as Valentina does and you can only suspect the worst of almost every one of them  except the real perpetrator. Only in the last scene the real drama is revealed and the only one who understood it all from the beginning was the dead woman in the portrait who triumphs.It's a film of outstanding eloquence both in intrigue dialogue cinematography and above all direction. Even the music couldn't be better.";

The deceased woman had a son who inherited a large wealth of money from a death in the family. The imposter woman plays the role of mother believable as the true mother was away for many years along with trustees who live in the house caring for the boy who never met the true mother. Various parties jockey for the family wealth in a manner of ways creating much distrust and suspicion. There are many good tense moments clues to uncover and plot surprises. Well paced welledited and smart cinematography with great rich black  white film stock.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone seems to like Valentina Cortese's performance and while she's believable as a wideeyed concentration camp survivor arriving in America it's Richard Basehart who steals the show. I've only ever known him from his TV show in the 60s and his goofy role in La Strada but for the duration of this film he quietly ratchets up his character from an initially charming but cool demeanor to a fullblown psychotic foaming at the mouth about making forty dollars a week and KarinVictoria realizes she never escaped the camp she just traded one monster for another. Towards the end he attaches himself to her like a barnacle. She can't even use the phone or have some alone time which seems amusing in an age where most women would tell their husband to scram.You might think the scenes from Telegraph Hill are forced perspective but it really is that steep one false move and you're cartwheeling all the way down to the bay.Well it's not Vertigo but it does keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a happy ending KarinVictoria has a son to care for a potential male suitor and she's loaded. Not bad for a Polish country girl.".
