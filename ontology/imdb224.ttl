Loyalist General Qingyun is the only survivor of a battle with antiQing rebels. He encounters a starving village whose inhabitants engage in banditry to survive where he is nursed back to health by the attractive Liansheng. With his strength regained Qingyun impresses one of the village bandit leaders Jiang Wuyang with his fighting skills. Wuyang introduces him to his big brother who also happens to be Liansheng's husband Zhao Erhu and Qingyun begins to assist them with their raids. Qingyun convinces his two new comrades to form a loyalist army unit to fight the rebels and feed their own people. The three men swear a blood oath. Their stunning military successes impress the governing powers but as Qingyun's influence begins to grow they soon fear him. The political and emotional stakes will be tested leading to differences between the blood brothers.";

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I had the opportunity to view one of the best films i've seen in a very long time. One that stays with you far after the closing credits. One that requires time after viewing to untie all the knots in your stomach.Peter Chan's The Warlords is a period epic in every sense of the word. Chan covers a lot of ground here depicting war and the consequences thereof consisting of his antiwar sentiments. It tells the story of three brothers played brilliantly by Jet Li Fearless Andy Lau Infernal Affairs and Takeshi Kaneshiro House Of Flying Daggers who make a pact of brotherhood to one another that consists of killing anyone who harms one of the brothers and killing any brother who harms another brother as they lead an army through war after war taking over city after city.It's incredible to watch the thought process of making vital decisions during a battle or within their own army to defy humanity for the greater good. It shows the internal and external struggle of these decisions by opposing points of view. The emotions felt by these men translate in any language and leave you emotionally drained after watching the film through to its tragic end.The cinematography is outstanding the budget is huge the directing brilliant and the war scenes brutal as can be. We're talking decapitations gushing blood limbs sliced off and a man being blown up by a cannonball. Chan is delivering a truth in the brutality of war rather than dressing it up to keep most of it realistic.War is hell.... and this film will take you there and back. Highest recommendation.".

The characters' portrayal is very successful due to the great acting. The battles and the fight choreography deserves a solid 9. Both artistic like the martial arts beauty and brutal like real war is.This movie doesn't have unnecessary emotion or unnecessary gestures from main characters. That's where this movie succeeds. That's where 'Azumi' or 'Braveheart' succeeded. And that's where 'Troy' and 'Gladiator' failed to deliver. They all have great cinematography brilliant fight choreography and superb acting staff  but that's only the technical side. 'Warlords' succeeded to deliver in all the aspects. Simple and little story with no overdramatizing and no inconsistencies.If one's wondering why I gave only 7 it's because beside of Erhu I didn't find one likable character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Looking at the list of writers involved in this project it is a fraking miracle that this film is as good as it is. While it is no The Banquet it is a solid historical epic which features the most layered and complex performance of Jet Li's career.Loosely based on the Shaw Brothers' 1973 film The Blood Brothers as well as the life and death of General Ma Xinyi this is a tragedy in the Greek or Shakespearean sense. Jet Li plays General Pang Qingyun a general of the Ching army whose command is slaughtered by the Taiping rebels while Pang's allies the Ho Army watch and do nothing.Injured delirious and with no one left to command Pang is nursed back to health by a beautiful woman who turns out to be the wife of Andy Lau's bandit leader Zhao ErHu. When the Ho Army raids Lau's village steals their supplies and kills one of his men Jet Li convinces ErHu and his lieutenant Zhang WenXiang played by Takeshi Kaneshiro that if they join the Ching Army they will get the respect money and guns necessary to protect themselves and their village. Pang ErHu and Zhang swear a blood oath to stand together with death as the penalty for oathbreakers.This starts Pang on his quest to save his country from itself building an army from the unwanted the poor the brigands. In the process Pang must fight Imperial politics as much as the enemy Taiping rebels. Each step along the way Pang has to barter away a little piece of his soul to achieve victory with Zhang reacting with heroworshipping approval while ErHu becomes increasingly disgusted.The down side to working with a star of Jet Li's caliber is that in every role he is Jet Li bringing with it his quiet heroism and idealism. This film turns that drawback into an advantage by casting Jet Li as a man who does increasingly villainous things for the purest of motives. Like a Chinese Robespierre Pang is trying to build a free united China on a pyramid of corpses.The film that The Warlords reminds me of the most is John Ford's The Searchers.Like The Searchers The Warlords starts with a massacre. Both films feature characters who leave their homes on an obsessive quest that seems impossible and takes them years to complete.John Ford uses John Wayne's iconic heroic status and subverts it as the obsessive quest slowly destroys Wayne from within. Jet Li's character in The Warlords follows the same arc beginning his quest with idealistic purity and finishing just inches from total madness. Both men succeed in their quests Jet Li's Pang in saving his country Wayne's Ethan Edwards in rescuing his niece but in both cases their quest is ultimately futile because what they saved was the reality and what they wanted to save was an ideal. Both men end their films framed in a doorway that they can no longer cross because their journeys have turned them into men of war who have no place in the world of peace on the other side of the doorway.".

The Warlords movie budget was  40 millionafter seeing it you will ask yourself How did they do that with so little money?!?A production of the same caliber would cost in the US at least  100 million. But this movie is the proof that cheap stuff that comes form China isn't always bad.Same with the outstanding performance of Jet Liout of the 40m budget he received 13m paymentwho was worth the money.There is a lot of drama in the movie but also a lot of action.If you like battle scenes like in Braveheart this movie will deliver.If you liked Crouching Tiger hidden dragon and Hero you will like this one.The Warlords though is not a fairytale like those two it is very realistic and if you are expecting to see people flying aroundkung fu fighting or something like that you will be disappointed.There is none of this here.But the movie is good. ten stars.".

The cinematography is well done costumes are excellent epic battle sequences are choreographed beautifully and the characters and complex character relationships are well developed sincere and sympathetic.

Of late period or martial chivalry movies either look aesthetically beautiful like Zhang Yimou's trilogy of Hero House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower or opt for the grittier more down to earth look with plenty of dirt and grime like Battle of Wits. Director Peter Chan's The Warlords follows the latter with its strained colors and muck on everyone's face in parallel of the grey that befalls everyone in this tale of a trio's struggles with the System and amongst themselves.Those who are familiar with stories featuring similar themes like brotherly bonds blood brothers and the likes will find that The Warlords when striped away to its core conforms to the same. But what Peter Chan did and I thought succeeded was to fuse really hard core battle action sequences with character driven drama and having the stellar leads of Andy Lau Jet Li and Takeshi Kaneshiro play something quite unlike their usual on screen personae well except maybe Kaneshiro. Publicity talk has been rife of Jet Li's unbelievable pay package taking up almost 40 of the production cost but if that was true I'd guess it must've been a reward to take on something risky to a screen idol that is and as it turned out it could instead be a career defining role for Li who doesn't get as much opportunity to show off those slick martial arts moves no doubt in part wanting to stick the movie as close to reality as possible bye shawdowless kick!Li opens the movie as a disgraced general Ma Xin Yi who was betrayed and only survived a massacre of his troops by the cowardly act of playing dead Yes! Jet Li playing a coward pretending to be dead! Told you! In his quest to survive incognito he chances upon a bandit Zhang Wen Xiang played by Kaneshiro who acknowledges General Ma's fighting prowess and recruits him to the gang of Lau's Cao ErHu. However the bandit life is not for a man of war who sees the poor bandit village getting their arses kicked when soldiers of a rival court raid them and thus finds the catalyst to encourage the bandit men to draw salary and food by joining the army. Suspicious and needing assurance of the General the trio of Ma Zhang and Cao sign a blood oath and thus the blood brothers are born  one a charismatic leader one a general looking to reclaim his honour and one in every bonding the earnest and faithful follower.As the story unfolds you begin to see how defacto leaders always feel threatened by young upstarts both in the politics within the small band of brothers and in the bigger picture with the court officials. With individuals there's almost always a clash of ideals with many methods available in achieving common objectives and one man's insatiable ambition will put the others at risk in Machiavellian terms. Finding themselves stronger in unity repeated success on the battlefield start to change folks and reveal true intentions. Even the rule of law established becomes subject to interpretation based on the moment's convenience and core principles like honour and gentlemen's agreement get tossed out of the window. As innermost desires are revealed you'll begin to see how seriously or not the blood oath is being treated by each individual especially when one finds the other being externally threatened or betrayal of temptation in the highest order courtesy of female lead Xu Jinglei's Lian as the token flower amongst the thorns.However the story bore strength in its presentation of key moments where you'll be called upon to question and even judge the characters their decisions and at times forced to choose sides. You may be convinced by one argument yet understand the necessity of why something else was done instead. And I'd think you'll probably won't stick to one side for the most parts and such bringing out the shades of grey that you'll experience for yourself if you happen to be in the shoes of the trio's foot soldiers. Naivety is truly unkind and sometimes one is just a pawn in situations far beyond one's grasp and you can see how this rings true for almost every character here.While it is easy to dwell on the battle sequences and make this one heck of an action romp in the veins of 300 ok so this one had its 108 heroes moment in a nod towards probable upcoming Water Margin movies which it did look to suspiciously tread along the same vein I thought the filmmakers here were smart to know when to show gore with the decapitations piercings and the likes to knowing when to retract such in your face moments for maximum effect. In the hands of a lesser director perhaps a key brutal scene will mean to show the obvious full frontal but in showing you something else instead with focus on individual reactions and the reactions of compatriots at one point in time I thought it achieved a more powerful effect with the audience I'm with tonight completed dumbfounded and silent throughout the scene.A remake of sorts of Shaw Brothers' Ci Ma some 35 years ago directed by Chang Cheh and starring David Chiang Ti Lung and Chen Kuan Tai in the lead roles Peter Chan has brought to us a worthy Chinese epic movie with lavish production values and one deserving of being called a magnificent effort. And yes this deserves a watch in seeing who's actually playing who and with a stellar cast to boot I don't see why not. Highly recommended!".

For one thing the Chinese did a pretty good job as far as giving the movie the proper epic side it needed. There's only a fine line between epic cinematography and drollery and these guys managed not to cross it unlike say Gladiator or '300'.Then there's the acting. Having only seen Jet Li in Hollywood movies before I thought he was something of a Jackie Chan without the funny face. I stand corrected he gives a great performance in Tau Ming Chong he is truly believable as his character general Pang gradually turns into a ruthless backstabbing freak for power. Finally kudos to the actor playing Er Hu Andy Lau. I hope I'll get to see more of him.Having seen the abominable blockbuster that 'The Last Samurai' really is the other night it definitely enhanced my appreciation for this title.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Peter Chan's latest blockbuster was a highly anticipated production during the Christmas season where it is the only Chinese production that seems to stands out from the other Hollywood blockbusters at the same period.For the price of one ticket you will not only get to see three well known actors Jet Li Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro but also a war drama between the country and brotherhood which has exceed most people's expectation.Set during the Taiping Rebellion during the 1860's to 1870's in China we were introduced to General Pang Qing Yun Li as the only survivor in a war with the enemies. He was taken in by a lady named Lian China actress Xu Jing Lei where he developed feelings for her when she offers him some food. Later he follows two brothers Zhao Er Hu Lau and Jiang Wu Yang Kaneshiro who were Robin Hood liked bandits to rob for food from the military.After Pang saves Zhao from the military he sworn into a brotherhood with Zhao and Jiang. They entered the military together with other male bandits and their bonds becomes stronger after going through a war. However this marks the beginning to end the brotherhoods among the trio.Pang wants to conquer the other states at all cost while Zhao insisted in peace talks to avoid more casualties. At the same time Pang develops feelings for Lian and upon to know that Lian is the wife of Zhao Pang takes back Zhao's promises to a group of soldier under their captivity of releasing them by killing them.The war has come to an end and the trio has been living in peace. However Pang wants more than what he has and for that he turned towards Zhao to achieve his motives and Jiang wants to stop the breakup of the brotherhood at all costs.While The Warlords is based on the late Hong Kong movie director Chang Cheh's 1973's The Blood Brothers Chan has make The Warlords looks much more better yet preserving the spirit of Blood Brothers at the same time. It is amazing that a director who makes romantic dramas could churn out a great war epic with swordfighting elements and at the same time brings out the emotion of the humans.The battle scene which appears shortly after the the start of the movie marks the success of the movie where we see people sacrificing themselves for the bonds of brotherhood and towards a better life. This is one of the values that can be seen through in the movie. In some way the battle scene resembles the climax of Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai 2003.At the same time the relationship between Pang Zhao Jiang and Lian shows the desire and the dark side of the human nature and emotions which is also similar to Zwick's The Legends of the Fall 1994 where father and sons fall out over a woman they loved.Commenting on the performance of the leading cast Jet Li gets a major makeover in the film followed by Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. Playing the role of General Pang Li express himself with more dialogues than action. Unlike his previous Hollywood productions one will not see much action from him. More rather he can tell you that he is more than just a actor who knows how to fight with martial arts. He will surprise you with the emotions that has been brought out to the audience. Lau as Zhao Er Hu creates a different feeling to fans who has watched his previous productions. He is more emotional and easily reveals his feelings than anyone else. This is another great change seen from Lau compared to his previous productions.Kaneshiro and Xu on the other hand were not given enough spaces to explore themselves. Playing the role of Jiang Kaneshiro was the youngest and the most innocent and easily influenced among the trio. He show he has what it takes to bring out the hatred and struggle among himself which can be told from the head cutting scene in the battle. Xu as Lian the woman whom both Pang and Zhao in loves with seems to be unimportant in the film. She appears only when both Pang and Zhao needs her to be by their side. Xu could have been given more opportunities to explore the relationship among herself and the three men.Human emotions and war have never looked so good when combined together. And to amaze the audience even further this is the first time Peter Chan tried to combine the two elements together. Chan has exceeded the expectations from the audience after several martial arts flop of similar genres from arthouse and drama directors ever after since Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2000 has put Chinese martial art on world map.".

Warlords certainly delivers in that department. But it's the substance that really counts.Throughout the movies one point has been repeatedly driven home the gallant or savage whichever you prefer fighting cannot be sustained without army provisions or food to be more specific. Strategies negotiations treacheries betrayals in this movie all surround this one vital agenda. And more than that starvation and poverty extend beyond the military context to the general populace. The suffering of the helpless powerless peasants is universal be it in The tale of two cities or Seven samurais. The three men in Warlords blood brothers sworn on an oath of death all have noble goals of helping to relieve the poor of this fate. But their mentalities are different.General Ma Jet Li the only survivor from the massacre of his entire army by the revolutionists seeks refuge with bandit chief Cao Andy Lau whom he subsequently convinces to bring the bandit camp to enlist with the government army. Ma is an almost enigmatic character that has a lofty goal but also a dark side. He is ruthless to the point of making you wonder if the price is worth paying. One may even be skeptical about his integrity but the movie seems to tend towards depicting him as more fanatic than evil. And in the end compared with the evil cunning of those in high places he is even nave as his tragic end clearly shows.Cao is a roughdiamond type of hero who does not have Ma's lofty aspirations but has a dogged loyalty and integrity that you'll be compelled to root for. And yet he is not lily white. As a bandit chief ravishing the conquered is a most natural part of his life and he cannot understand why General Ma insists on public execution of his people who molested two girls. We do that all the time he protests. Zhang Takeshi Kaneshiro Cao's secondincommand seems to be the one best guided by common sense remaining loyal to Cao and yet supporting Ma's ruthless acts for the good of the big picture. But in the end he is the most nave.Director Peter Chan who has demonstrated his artistry in a variety of genre from tender romance to dazzling musical has done it again with a stunning war epic. The potential dramatic conflict between the three blood brothers has been crafted into scene after scene of intense emotions that carry conviction. This is Jet Li's most impressive performance in his career todate. As if to demonstrate once more that an actor is only as good as the director Andy Lau who verges on looking like a clown in Zhang Yimou's pretentious House of flying daggers is a completely reborn actor in Warlords. By comparison Takeshi Kaneshiro's role is less multidimensional and he delivers.This movie can do without a female lead but movie makers have to cater to commercial considerations I imagine. The result is somewhat of a waste of lovely and talented Xu Jinglei screen idol of China's university campus population as well as a director and a screenwriter in her own right. In my view the unconvincing and underdeveloped romance triangle not only does nothing to help the movie but even takes away some of the intensity of focus.".

	schema:headline " Jet Li's War and No Peace";
	schema:reviewBody "From the Warring States Period going all the way back to the 5th century BC wars have wracked China seemingly without pause. During the second half of the 19th century and the late QingChingManchu dynasty some 50 million soldiers bandits and civilians died in the endless conflict.Watching Warlords screened for the first time in North America Saturday night in the Castro Theater part of the San Francisco International Film Festival at times one might have thought that most of those casualties are shown  often in closeups  in the film.Beginning with a view reminiscent of the Normandy invasion sequence of Saving Private Ryan the film by Peter Chan and Wai Man Yip depicts combat vividly and intensely. Chung Man Yee's production design peaks at times in virtually unprecedented battlefield spectacles.There is no resolution no peace and only a quasirelevant love story featuring Jinglei Xu but Warlords goes well beyond just fightin' and killin' and dyin'. Right from the beginning as Jet Li's General Pang picks himself up from under the bodies of his dead soldiers you notice two things Jet Li's complete lack of vanity and the ability of this martialarts star to act convincingly and well.The Manchu style of the head shaved in front and the hair gathered in a ponytail in the back looks hideous when it's all messed up especially with blood. Jet Li not only appears half dead in his first appearance but he is taking a badhair day to its absolute worst. And then you also notice that Famous Jet Li  who is NOT flying through the air in this film  has been replaced by an honest and talented actor who brings to life a complex conflicted tragic character.With shifting alliances goals and always at the edge of extinction Pang and his two blood brothers Takeshi Kaneshiro's soulful Jiang Wuyang and Andy Lau's towering Zhao Erhu perhaps Lau's bestever performance struggle from smalltime wars all the way to the taking of Nanking on behalf of the fastfading central so to speak government in Beijing. The same historybased story has been told in more modest terms in Zhang Che's 1973 The Blood Brothers. A historical war film a brutal but not gratuitously violent drama Warlords impresses even stuns but in the end fails to provide catharsis or even an attempt to make sense of the senseless  something Zhang Yimou came close to in Hero also with Jet Li playing a similar historic character.".

During the second half of the 19th century and the late QingChingManchu dynasty some 50 million soldiers bandits and civilians died in the endless conflict.Watching Warlords screened for the first time in North America Saturday night in the Castro Theater part of the San Francisco International Film Festival at times one might have thought that most of those casualties are shown  often in closeups  in the film.Beginning with a view reminiscent of the Normandy invasion sequence of Saving Private Ryan the film by Peter Chan and Wai Man Yip depicts combat vividly and intensely. Chung Man Yee's production design peaks at times in virtually unprecedented battlefield spectacles.There is no resolution no peace and only a quasirelevant love story featuring Jinglei Xu but Warlords goes well beyond just fightin' and killin' and dyin'. Right from the beginning as Jet Li's General Pang picks himself up from under the bodies of his dead soldiers you notice two things Jet Li's complete lack of vanity and the ability of this martialarts star to act convincingly and well.The Manchu style of the head shaved in front and the hair gathered in a ponytail in the back looks hideous when it's all messed up especially with blood. Jet Li not only appears half dead in his first appearance but he is taking a badhair day to its absolute worst. And then you also notice that Famous Jet Li  who is NOT flying through the air in this film  has been replaced by an honest and talented actor who brings to life a complex conflicted tragic character.With shifting alliances goals and always at the edge of extinction Pang and his two blood brothers Takeshi Kaneshiro's soulful Jiang Wuyang and Andy Lau's towering Zhao Erhu perhaps Lau's bestever performance struggle from smalltime wars all the way to the taking of Nanking on behalf of the fastfading central so to speak government in Beijing. The same historybased story has been told in more modest terms in Zhang Che's 1973 The Blood Brothers. A historical war film a brutal but not gratuitously violent drama Warlords impresses even stuns but in the end fails to provide catharsis or even an attempt to make sense of the senseless  something Zhang Yimou came close to in Hero also with Jet Li playing a similar historic character.";

My experience of watching Three Kingdoms has become a fading memory on a dusty shelf after I watched Warlords. It's the kind of movie that reminds you that there are websites where one can review movies and doesn't let you rest until you tell others about it.Essentially Tau Ming Chong is a tragedy making a steep turn into the dark closer towards the end. It may be a bit on the heavy side but by the time you realize that the movie has already sucked you in completely.An excellent acting team led by Jet Li makes sure that everything else is just frosting around the cake of well developed characters. That's not to say that the frosting is inferior. This movie has everything going for it choreography special effects sound and story. It has a something for everyone although Warlords is definitely a boys' movie full of hardcore violence brotherhood issues and politics.

Peter Chan learned from the mistakes of Zhang Yimou with HERO 2002 HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS and that lame piece of crap CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER 2006 he learned that big production and art direction doesn't mean the audience won't expect a good story and direction to go with a film he also learned that Andrew Lau's triadgangstercop INFERNAL AFFAIRS formula can get old if you keep heading toward a beaten path... furthermore any film that glorifies gangster camaraderie almost means doom with the Chinese film board.What Peter Chan did was very clever he actually found a story that allows Andy Lau's affected style of acting to fit the context of a story  WAR. Lau's acting never convinced me in contemporary story lines but it worked with WARLORDS. In fact he used all three of the male leads to their typecasted best  Jet Li reprises the hero who sees the greater good but has to accept the fact  that nothing comes without a price while Takeshi assumes again the role of a passive and reluctant hero caught in a crossfire. All the special effects come from the same software you see in big budget films whether it is South Korea Hollywood Europe or Japan and production value is nothing less than any of the prettybutempty periodpieces Zhang Yimou or Chen Kaige tried to fool audiences with...

	schema:reviewBody "On the question of whether one would like this film lot of it is dependent on whether you prefer Shakespeare or Sophocles in tragedy. As in the tragedy is not characterdriven but fatedriven if you get my drift. It is about people born into the wrong time rather than people who make the wrong decisions. This film is strictly Sophocles not Shakespeare. In fact it borrows heavily off classical Greek tragedy in its structure along with three Mandarins who act as a Chorus.Jet Li stars as an ambitious general with Utopian ideals in late Qing China during the turbulent Taiping era. Western Colonialism was making its presence felt and the crumbling dynasty as unable to stop it as everyone played for himself in a game of see who's the last rat to dive off the sinking ship. The Taiping Rebellion was also promising a Christian Utopia but led by madmen every bit as fanatical as anyone that got drunk on religion will ever get seemed like hardly an alternative.Probably the only Chinese epic I have seen fittingly since its setting was the Taiping Rebellion to have used Christian imagery including a really bastardized retelling of the miracle of the loaves and fishes that would border on sacrilegious if taken out of context. Watch out for one scene involving a baptism pool. Beautifully done.Visually though it is meticulous barring some sloppy special effects here and there. The entire film feels like a Sergio Leone wetdream. Blasted heaths wrecked buildings windswept plains and rainy nights all combine for an atmospheric effect akin to the best Westerns that ever came out of Hollywood's Golden Age.However one key determinant will make or break your liking for the film. I have always preferred Shakespearean tragedy to Greek and wonder why current Chinese filmmakers have yet to make a competent Shakespearean tragedy. And no I did not like THE BANQUET. And the fact that the film was classically Greek in structure and storytelling was the bit of a letdown for me. I admire its panache its style its storytelling most of everything about it except that somehow I never really engaged with the characters and their struggles.What I feel a lot of people are missing out or may be is that this really the antithesis of Heroic Cinema it is AntiHeroic cinema. A harsh satire on the limits of principle and selfrighteousness of not just Chinese rulers but also many of the selfproclaimed heroes of Chinese history. Yet all of them are also prisoners of their time and culture. The characters of Kaneshiro and Lau are bandits and as such their moral outlook is painfully limited to them there is only the fellow outlaw to be faithful to not the people. They claim moral high ground but instead when they rush into battle their cry is always to get rich fed and laid nothing more than the aspirations of a common criminal. Jet Li's character Pang Qingyun believes that he is faithful to the people even if this also means killing POWs has a claim that in war only winning matters! and thus in the end is also ousted by a bloodthirsty political culture in which only winning matters. The characters all appear to be doing right in their own eyes but they are constricted by their society and their culture and their period into being painfully flawed figures. This is where THE WARLORDS strikes gold among recent Chinese epics. It may be read as a rebuttal to what appears as character in history but is really sanctimony and perhaps strikes at the heart of the fact that all heroic narratives are written by the victors and therefore all heroic narrative is inherently sanctimonious.PS And is it just me or does everyone want to borrow off Hans Zimmer's score for GLADIATOR now?".

	schema:reviewBody "I want to start this review with a warning because like the other 2007 Chinese movie Lust Caution with a similarly monochromatic realistic palette the marketing of this movie is basically an attempt to entice people who might be uninterested in the actual themes of the movie the truth is Warlords can only be considered a heroic war epic if Lust Caution can be considered a sexy spy thriller. In other words nasty war sequences like the nasty sex scenes in Lust Caution were filmed to show the why's not the how's. In fact after a smallscaled only a few thousand men involved but FULLON Infantry  Archers  Musketeers  Artillery  Cavalry  Jet Li battle setpiece in the first half of the movie which actually left some members of the audience physically shaking it became very obvious that the movie director much like Lust Caution has very little interest in depicting the actual events of the war.Only the opening titles will tell you that this war specifically the Taiping rebellion of 1850s60s resulted in the loss of 70 million lives so people thinking to satisfy their bloodlust with this movie should be forewarned that after all the characters and premises have been introduced the remaining years of fighting are only depicted through various montages and cinematic plot devices. In fact I find this movie more a connected series of stark war stories vignettes about coal mining villages boy soldiers etc. than anything else. In short anyone coming in clueless about that part of Chinese history is unlikely to learn much by watching this movie the British and the French etc. were encroaching the Hui Muslims and Shandong rogue armies etc. were rebelling Empress Dowager Cixi was powergrabbing and everyone was making deals... no 2hour movie will show you all that.But there are still some problems with this movie which made me take away a few points. Being an Asian movie weaknesses in effects and production values still show up here and there some dubious CGI and such. And being a Hong Kongstyled commercial release the need decision to cut its running time down to 2 hours made it feel overedited to me. E.g. By cutting out all the love sex scenes I knew about the romantic relationships but didn't really understand it a bad case of tell but don't show and during lengthier shots and scenes the director editor kept cutting back and forth as if he didn't trust the strength of the actors or the script to hold up the tension. But enough with the reservations let's get on to the good stuff.1 CINEMATOGRAPHY. Most films are colorcorrected to bring out their colors and contrasts with scifi fantasy effects movies and cinematographerturneddirectors like Zhang Yimou being the most notorious for doing this. But this film was colorcorrected to drain out the colors so that it looked like some historical film footage from the 1860s if such a thing were possible. And when some colors do appear they only gave the film a fablelike mood of a legend being retold. This heightened sense of surrealism set by the cinematography was so powerful that there were only sobs or silence from the audience for the length of 2 hours.2 ACTION CHOREOGRAPHY. Hong Kong action directors choreographers must be pure magic because they can still create hairraising action sequences when thrown into the lot with clueless firsttime action directors like Peter Chan with Ching SiuTung in this movie Ang Lee with Yuen WooPing in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon etc.. The 4 short action sequences 2 battles 2 fights and various bitfighting in this film are swift precise and brutal nothing to drool at in the way of wuxia or comicbook violence but with enough inyourface realism to put this movie above the equivalent of any PGrating in most film markets. And Jet Li without displaying any martial arts forms was simply riveting to watch.3 SOCIAL COMMENTARY. The commentary is at once blatant and subtle and this is the reason over and above the action sequences for the positive reviews and wordofmouth coming from viewers who get it. It is blatantly clear that all sympathies lie with the little guys or underdogs and yet everything remains quite subtle because none of the characters sees enough of the big picture to sell the audience any underlying messages. By setting the story in the twilight years of the Taiping rebellion the film ends in 1870 it easily makes the point without anyone actually having to say so that the government wasn't eager to end a conflict which yielded political economic profit. The movie was just brimming with ideas.4 SIEGE OF SUZHOU. This siege which started off the 2nd half of the movie was where opinions really divided between the diehard war history fans and more regular movie audiences because the director's true vision started coming through with a quiet but almost complete turnabout in pace genre. In a film filled with arresting disturbing images the highly romanticized and nearmythical introduction of a remaining rebel leader pushes the characters' personal dilemmas to an almost ethical spiritual level the founder of the Taiping rebellion claimed to be the Brother of Christ and named his regime the Heavenly Kingdom of Taiping. It might make or break the rest of the movie for some viewers.I could go on about the rows of rice offerings or shoes with wooden nametags etc. but would rather keep this review relatively spoilerfree. However something should be said about the historical accuracy of this movie there is none because all the names and events have been changed. E.g. Jet Li's character is now named Pang Qingyun which in Chinese literally clouds in the sky reflects his ambitions etc.. So apart from the general historical context outline all events and characters portrayed in the movie are fictional....".

The 4 short action sequences 2 battles 2 fights and various bitfighting in this film are swift precise and brutal nothing to drool at in the way of wuxia or comicbook violence but with enough inyourface realism to put this movie above the equivalent of any PGrating in most film markets. And Jet Li without displaying any martial arts forms was simply riveting to watch.3 SOCIAL COMMENTARY. The commentary is at once blatant and subtle and this is the reason over and above the action sequences for the positive reviews and wordofmouth coming from viewers who get it. It is blatantly clear that all sympathies lie with the little guys or underdogs and yet everything remains quite subtle because none of the characters sees enough of the big picture to sell the audience any underlying messages. By setting the story in the twilight years of the Taiping rebellion the film ends in 1870 it easily makes the point without anyone actually having to say so that the government wasn't eager to end a conflict which yielded political economic profit. The movie was just brimming with ideas.4 SIEGE OF SUZHOU. This siege which started off the 2nd half of the movie was where opinions really divided between the diehard war history fans and more regular movie audiences because the director's true vision started coming through with a quiet but almost complete turnabout in pace genre. In a film filled with arresting disturbing images the highly romanticized and nearmythical introduction of a remaining rebel leader pushes the characters' personal dilemmas to an almost ethical spiritual level the founder of the Taiping rebellion claimed to be the Brother of Christ and named his regime the Heavenly Kingdom of Taiping. It might make or break the rest of the movie for some viewers.I could go on about the rows of rice offerings or shoes with wooden nametags etc. but would rather keep this review relatively spoilerfree. However something should be said about the historical accuracy of this movie there is none because all the names and events have been changed. E.g. Jet Li's character is now named Pang Qingyun which in Chinese literally clouds in the sky reflects his ambitions etc.. So apart from the general historical context outline all events and characters portrayed in the movie are fictional....";

But I feel strongly enough about it to write something anyway.The production values on this film are quite good  cinematography acting sets action scenes are all well done. The problem is that the story makes no sense and the politics are bizarre to say the least.A general gets up from the battlefield. He has survived a massacre by playing dead  a premise that is made less and less credible by his heroic performance later on. He joins a group of bandits killing some poor prisoner whom he knows nothing about in order to prove his loyalty to the other chieftains. He convinces the bandits to join the Ching army to fight against the Taiping who are in revolt against the government because they the bandits can get food and money that way. They ambush a Taiping supply convoy and then offers a deal to the government army. He will take a city for them from the Taiping if they give him half the spoils. So far so good. A man with no morals joins the bandits and with them becomes a mercenary soldier for a corrupt government. He plans to take a city sack it loot it and keep the profits. It doesn't fit the fairly decent image created for the hero but at least it's consistent.But then the film makers try to make this man into a genuine hero. He leads his forces selflessly into battle against Taiping soldiers  portrayed not as the ragtag peasant revolutionaries fighting with farm implements and having a religious motivation as they actually were but as a disciplined army with uniforms officers and rifles. He prepares to sacrifice his life to fight them.By great heroics he wins the battle ignoring the spear that has thrust all the way through his chest and takes the city. The spear has magically disappeared and our hero seems unaffected by the wound. Then amazingly he orders the execution of two soldiers in his own army for raping women in the city! He says he is serving a higher purpose and will not allow that kind of stuff to ever happen again.Huh? Where did these scruples come from? He's just massacred an army for no reason other than pay. He's just fought for a corrupt government that is subservient to foreign interests and the interests of the rich landlords in the regions. He has just taken a city and presumably sacked it. He leaves the city with chests full of silver coins.I don't know what the Chinese writers directors and censors were thinking when they made this film. One is tempted to conclude that however coherent the story might have been when originally written it was bowdlerized to support the government above all and pretend that supporting the government is a good thing for everyone even if it's corrupt.It was hard to take. I couldn't take it. Mao must be rolling over in his grave.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is your stereotype of Jet Li? The King of Martial Art? The Asian Romeo who kicks some bad ass but never gets the girl? Mr. Friendly who always acts with that same old smile? Well some of them might be true while some not. However many audiences might change their viewpoints after watching Jet Li's performance in Warlords. In this Chinese epic movie Jet Li interpreted Pang a man who was caught in complicated nets of brotherhood lust and betrayal. Along with his sidekicksturnintoenemies Zhao Andy Lau and Jiang Takeshi Kaneshiro who competed against Pang Jet Li as characters and as actors Jet Li's performance was even sharpened and bettered. Getting to speak his mother tongue Mandarin also gave him extra credits. This distinguished him from his present participation in Hollywood films in which he had to speak a foreign language and became stereotyped and probably marginalized. I dare to say it's Jet Li's best performance ever. His babyface could no longer cover those keen eyes of an actor. In the scene where he treated Zhao the last meal which turned out to be a soliloquy his conflicts were shown in his tone. When he covered his face with a handkerchief and wept those hysterical cries were disturbingly heartbreaking. It's the sort of scream that comes from a desperate old man who's been through a great deal of ups and downs in his life. Warlords definitely ensures Li's stardom as an actor.Unlike other martial art movie directors most of whom getting busy on how to make the scenes spectacular and the actors against gravity Peter Chan believes in the significance of a good story. He is famous for his romance productions such as Perhaps Love Three etc and that might be the reason why he successfully added a soft yet moving touch to the masculine story. Even though Warlords is based on one of the four great legends in Chin Dynasty The Assassination of Ma which is sensational and suspenseful the director insisted that the screenplay should also deliver the raw cruelty of wartime and in the mean while be compelling and persuasive. Apparently according to the movie itself Peter Chan has proved that he can direct romances and masculine movies as well.However I don't personally like the English title Warlords. TouMingJuang the Chinese title of the film means the vow people take when friends want to become brothers. Usually a typical oath of this sort is written this way Even though we're not born at the same time we'd rather die together. Thus whoever breaks the vow will have to face extreme punishment and revenge. This vow brought out the dramatic effect of the climax scene where the murder of brothers took place. But since Warlords makes more sense to foreigners than TouMingJuang I'd say it's a safe choice for it sounds proficient for an epic movie.I think it's a mustwatch in 2007 not only for the great performance but also the lessons behind it. The war is cruel and the men in wartime inevitably become cruel too.".

Wandering from the battlefield he staggers through the countryside. Collapsing near an abandoned house he is saved by a young woman who makes him food. In the morning she is gone. After selling his armor he falls in with a group of bandits who are stealing food for their village. After the village is beaten in an attack by a rival village Pang convinces the villagers to join one of the armies to get protection and food. To assure that Pang will not betray them Pang forms a pact with ErHu Andy Lau and Zhang Takeshi Kaneshiro. The blood brothers then lead their men off to war and an uncertain future.Cutting to the chase this is the first great film I've seen this year 2008. Pretty much everything about this film is top notch. This is an epic action film that has a great deal on its mind. This is a film that has romance examines war both its glory and its cost for example the trench siege of the city high level politics honor the bond between brothers in arms the promises we make and a couple of other things I'm too overwhelmed to recall. Its been rare that I've seen an action film that dealt with more than just macho notions of honor and right and wrong.The action is top notch. There is everything from one on one combat to huge scale battle scenes. Its also very graphic and very bloody. Limbs and blood fly. No matter how they did it the action has impact both in the oh Wow sense and the gut turning this is the cost of violence sense. The film also knows when to keep things off screen for heartbreaking effect. Its mind blowing.Need I go into the costuming and set design? You must see this on as big a screen as possible. Its overwhelming in the sense of scale. These are real big places. These are huge armies. I'm floored. Its like the epic Hero Curse of the Golden Flower The Banquet or House of Flying Daggers but in a gritty real lived in sort of way.The score is hypnotic. Several times the score drives the film lifting it up from the realm of film to something much more lyric and poetic. For me the film is often a tone poem a visual and aural meditation on the nature of the human condition as portrayed in the film. Yes I can tell you what is going on logically and dramatically but thanks to the score and its marriage to the visuals both horrific and beautiful the film ceases to touch the intellect but instead touches the heart and the gut. More often than not I felt things more than I thought things. which is why my words are severely lacking for describing much of the film. Its also why I have forgiven pretty much any flaws the film may have I was too emotional to care. If you want an example of what a great score can do you need look no further.The acting is Oscar worthy. Andy Lau is as good as he always is. He is one of the best actors working in Chinese cinema. Takeshi Kaneshiro is equally good. The real revelation here is Jet Li. I was floored by his performance in Unleashed but this is so much more. Here he gives a performance that is layered and touching. We feel his pain at the loss of his men in the early scenes later we ache for the pain of his love that is just out of his reach. If there is any flaw in his performance its perhaps that in the second half as fortunes change and the situations begin to move out of his grasp he becomes too internal. To be certain there is the confusion in his eyes but his face is a bit too impassive.If there is a flaw its that the film has almost too much going on. There is a large scale scope to the film and it has almost too many plot lines to resolve. It does so I think satisfactorily however there are times when I felt that I was missing something.I can't say enough good about this film.9 out of 10 because its not perfect but pretty closeAddendum To be honest thinking about the film some twelve hours after seeing it I'm feeling a tad disappointed about it. Only in that that the final portion of the film has so much going on that I'm not sure the plot is that clear. I think that the craft of the film engages on an emotional level that carries the film to the end even when the plot fails to fully engage the mind. This doesn't really change what I think of the film I still think its a great achievement".

This doesn't really change what I think of the film I still think its a great achievement";

	schema:reviewBody "Don't you think? I thought this movie was utterly disappointing. I was expecting something extraordinary due to the amazing cast...but this? This was such a letdown.First of all what's with the 'Lian' character? I don't think she was onscreen enough to be a subplot. But then she keeps popping up now and then so you can't ignore her. She gave such a stonecold performance I was cringing every time she spoke. It was just...Urgh.When I was leaving the cinema I was thinking about her role in the movie. She did say she only wanted to act in this movie because of Andy Lau and etc etc...but now that I think about it if all her scenes were cut it would've not made any impact on the outcome of the movie. She was just an insignificant little pebble amongst the HUGE boulders surrounding her.Secondly the characters were a bit 'off'. Something was missing. I kept thinking that Jet Li was doublecrossing his 'brothers' in some way because he had chosen the cowardly way out of war by 'pretending' to die...and it made me think that he was a liar and a cheat. He should've died honourably within the first few minutes of the film so we would be spared of his 'heroic' dialogue for the rest of movie. Then there's Andy Lau. Oh dear. The only scene I liked was when he was chained and screaming for justice. That was pretty emotional. Other than that oh dear he was such an embarrassment to watch. OH and I've forgotten about Takeshi Kaneshiro. The little teenybopper who was screaming at an obviouslyfake head. Sure it was mean to be an act of courage and a display of heroism but I don't think that he really pulled it off. Whenever he laughedcried it all seemed the same to me. When there were those horrid closeups he would smile and cry at the same time. Normally when people do that they resolve to either smile to cry not both at the same time. He is a pretty boy but he needs substance.Finally the plot was a mess. My mum loved the whole historic feel to it but later I told her that Yes it has some sort of historic feel to it but they could've explained it better rather than skipping here and skipping there with the different armies and such. I think the script for this movie was a little on the skimpy side. I've got a feeling that chunks of dialogue had been taken out to make sure the movie was short and probably concise. A mess. A terrible mess. It was hard to keep up with what was happening.But on the nicer XD side of things the war strategies were great to watch. The men sacrificing themselves the archers the action shots. They were great. Oh and my mum LOVES those StevenSeagul movies where 'justice is served' so she enjoyed it.It just didn't meet my expectations. I was waiting for an epic not this pile of illconceived crap.My rating 310.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warlords is a fascinating and great sometimes shocking but not perfect story of the rise and fall of General Peng. The central theme consists of his political ambitions and how they conflict with the required loyalty to his blood brothers. General Peng has to make some nasty choices and they don't turn out well. As far as I know but I am not an expert this is Jet Li's finest role enigmatic brave ambiguous with questionable values. My main objection against Chinese movies of this kind is that they lack character development but that does not apply to Warlords. Jet Li manages to stir up mixed feelings until the very last scene. If you thought you had seen it all regarding battle scenes Warlords will give you a surprise. Both the ambush and the great battle scene will pop your eyes out. There is no trace of romanticism the cruelty of warfare is pictured in every detail without becoming gory. There are also a few great special effects like when General Peng saves the life of one of his blood brothers. The key scene takes place after the Siege of Suzhou. The question arises what to do with the 4000 prisoners? The dilemma is unsettling and here it becomes clear that things will definitely go wrong for all three of the blood brothers. Warlords paints a grim picture of the Chinese civil wars in the 19th Century and the dirty politics involved. The result is of epic dimensions and can compete with any American and European movie of the same kind. My only complaint is that the movie is too short. I would have liked some more background information about the four main characters. The character of Lian remains unnecessarily shallow. Some intriguing scenes are not entirely developed. Finally I would like to know what happened afterwards with Zhang the narrator of the story. But these are minor quibbles. If you like movies of the grandioso kind don't miss Warlords.".

	schema:headline " Good mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "The Bird with the Crystal Plumage was Dario Argento's first film and it made him a hot property.  Having had very little experience with actual filmmaking he showed incredible potential with his debut and he took full advantage of it in years to come.  Here he explored a lot of the scenarios that would later charectarize his films.  With this film and particularly his next Dario showed he had been influenced quite a bit by the great Alfred Hitchcock.  The theme here an american in a foreign country becomes a witness to a heinous crime and starts investigating himself bears more than a little resemblance to many of Hitchcock's films.  An innocent man finds his morbid curiosity getting the better of him and as he progresses in his investigations he puts himself in grave danger.  The story unfolds in a similar way to Hitchcock's films clues are gathered periodically and there's a surprise in the end which is hard to guess but not impossible.  Argento gradually builds up the suspense and creates a genuinely intriguing mystery.  The film never slows down too much and it never fails to be interesting.  It's also got a surprising amount of laughs.  But in comparing Argento to Hitchcock Argento manages to create a style of his own which he would perfect in Profondo Rosso aka Deep Red a few years later.  That's of course the visual style.  Here he has the assistance of one Vittorio Storaro and the visual aspect of this film is one of it's greatest assets.  The film is wonderfully lit every single time and Argento switches effortlessly between dark and dreary visuals to shiny happy images.  Argento's visual style is one of his greatest trademarks and it bears some influence from the likes of Mario Bava.  I don't want to name any particular scenes they all flow well together.  Another terrific Argento trademark is the music.  Ennio Morricone's score is nothing short of fantastic ranges from cathcy repetetive melodies to haunting sounds of fear.  I think the impact from Argento's films would lessen considerably would it not be for those terrific scores he gets every time.  However Argento is not perfect.  He seems to lessen his standards when it comes to the acting department.  Here the characters are a bit wooden and he doesn't give them all that good lines to deliver.  The dialogue in many of his films seem a little childish.  And it doesn't look like he gives them many instructions the acting here and in most of his films is shaky and not very consistent.  It has been said about Argento that he basically thinks of actors as human props what's most important is where they are positioned and how they move.  Also it's very annoying how he dubs every film even the american actors have to do voice overs on themselves. That said Argento has more pro's than con's.  His films are always interesting and wonderful to look at.  The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is in my opinion one of his best. 9 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Argento's first film is his first Giallo and one that is sharply crafted amusing chilling and even eerily jazzy";
	schema:reviewBody "Dario Argento's first dip into the directorial pool is a potboiler somewhere in the realm between Hitchcock and Jack the Ripper classic noir and the modern catandmouse serial killer picture. Argento's method's may still be in a slightly embryonic state i.e. his intense stylistic flourishes which by the 80s would seem totally ridiculous in comparison to Crystal Plumage but already on his first film as director not on writer however as he penned all odds and sorts of spaghetti westerns and thrillers he assumes control like it's second nature. Suspense sequences involving the coolly suited knifewielding killer with Argento trademark black gloves and a long trenchcoat and black hat come off without a hitch and not without the kind of excess gore that he and other Italian Giallo directors got branded with throughout the 70s and 80s. Damned if I'll say this it's probably the one film by the director you can show unashamedly to your grandmother.Tony Musante an actor I've never come across impresses as far as a protagonist in an Argento film can such as this as an American with his girlfriend who are in Italy for some reason or another a writer it would seem as we only are told in one or two scenes which is just as well. He witnesses an attack on a woman inside an art gallery the only witness in a string of what has already been vicious murders by butcher knife all women all unconnected. He just wants to leave but he has to stick around to give more details. And then lo and behold he grows more and more intrigued and involved in the case till of course he and his girlfriend become a target by this sadistic killer! All of this is handled by Argento as if they're not the conventions that we all know in this kind of thriller he approaches all of them with a fresh take and adds in doses of unexpected humor to keep things interesting the painter behind the possible cluepainting with the killer in a field and his cats is incredibly funny.But it would be just one thing if Argento kept at making neargolden Hitchcockian ideals and the pulpy juices of a genre piece moving along. Argento is out to depict a sense of paranoia growing and growing upon an aesthetic that is not quite the Master of Suspense and not quite your common Dirty Harry thriller though Ennio Morricone's score sounds like a mix of his quintessential touch and some Lalo Schifrin thrown in for good measure. In a sense Vittorio Storaro's cinematography throws one off guard it's at times not so shot like your common thriller but as something more ambitious something that drills away through its premise to dig up any pure cinematic threat to the characters. This might sound a little pretentious but just watch certain sequences like when Sam is being trailed by the man in the yellow jacket or when the second female victim is seen point of view changing without a beat misses on either end. Thanks to Argento's backup of Storaro and Morricone he has here a twisting tale of a psycho killer with an artistic edge. It's clear to see even with the ending that yells out as Psycho exposition ripoff that he was on his way to a solid career.".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally saw THE BIRD WITH THE CRYTAL PLUMAGE for the first time and I have to say that it's pretty good. The only thing I can fault Dario Argento's first movie is the overall familiarity of this type of movie. In 1969 there weren't that many of these type of sexy thrillers and Bird must have looked even more dazzling and original then. But today stylish sex thrillers are a dime a dozen thanks mostly to the success of the wretched and unstylish Basic Instinct which obviously was inspired by the plethora of sexy often lurid disturbing and sleazy giallo films made in Italy in the 1970s. But one can't fault Bird and other giallos for spawning the whole and now boring genre.I really enjoyed the fact of who the killer is. Dario plays with the audiences' assumptions throughout the movie in the way it's filmed and with the P.O.V. shots. Because of this clever direction the ending must have seemed really weird disturbing back in 1969. Again these shocking endings have become trite today but I'm certain the ending was a major factor for the worldwide success of the film. It's played intelligently and because of this the whole integrity of the movie remains intact even after all these years.The film is not without its faults. It drags somewhat in the middle and the explanation ending is a tad trite but the film has many memorable moments too like when Sam goes to the painter and his cats or the antique shop. The later is a funny scene refreshingly played with genuine playfulness mainly towards actor Tony Musante's overt hunkiness. Susan Kendall looks amazing with her blonde hair and big eyes. Kendall and Musante make a great couple. In fact the whole film is really good looking even after all these years. This thanks mostly to cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's truly stunning camera work.THE BIRD WITH THE CRYTAL PLUMAGE is an enjoyable thriller. And I agree with the one who wrote that it's probably Dario's most balanced movie ever. And Ennio Morricone's typically unusual music is excellent. The DVD has the soundtrack as a bonus which is great. But the image of the VCI DVD is not the best quality. The image is seriously grainy. I wish they'd release a new DVD with a better transfer.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's of course definitely true that the earliest Giallo's are also most definitely the best ones and the same can be said for Dario Argento's movies. And this movie was not just his first Giallo but also his first movie in general! And what a great debut it was for him! This movie is definitely being one of his bests and one of the better Giallo movies out there in general.Finally a good Giallo again! I absolutely love the genre but I have to admit that most of the movies in it are extremely mediocre. Absolutely nothing tops Profondo rosso which also got directed by Argento but I can at least say that this movie comes close at times and especially considering that this is one of the earliest movies out of the genre I really have to take my hat off for this one.Some good mystery some good characters some great tension and killings. In other words plenty to enjoy for the Giallo lovers in this movie. I think that this movie did a great job with its storytelling and the way it was handling its almost constantly present tension and mystery. Also good news about all of it is that it doesn't fall flat at the end as often is the case with these type of movies.The movie uses some great and at times also innovative cinematography which helps to create a certain mood and tension for the movie which all definitely helps to make this a very effective one within its genre. And if you still aren't convinced to watch this movie let me throw in a couple of more names besides Dario Argento's Ennio Morricone and Reggie Nalder. Nalder is a great character actor I have seen popping up in a wide variety of movies. I have even seen a skin flick with him in it which is all the more shocking once you know how Reggie Nalder looks. Luckily he himself didn't got nude in it but I always enjoy seeing him in movies and he often plays the quiet scary looking henchman as he basically also does in this movie.And then there is also still the Ennio Morricone musical score. Most people don't really know it but by far most of Morricone's musical scores are some weird ones that still have lots of quality to them though. As does the score to this movie which is one Ennio Morricone himself is even proud off since he often plays it at some of his concerts.Finally a Giallo movie again of which I can truly and honestly say it's a great one that I absolutely enjoyed watching.810 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film that fully credits Dario Argento as the sole director turned out a compelling murdermystery stylishly completed with an excellent score sublime photography and gripping moments of suspense. In other words an authentic giallo like only a real Italian master can deliver them! As it is common standard in this type of horror films the actual climax usually this means the killer's identity and motives is slightly inferior to the creation of setting and atmosphere. Yet in this adaptation of Wallace's novel the plot twists are credible and the finale is satisfying. The story focuses on an American novelist who moved to Italy due to a severe writer's block. One night he witnesses an attempted knifemurder in an art gallery. Even though he and his girl are becoming the main target of the serial killer at large our hero finds himself to be more and more obsessed with the tracking down the murderer. Dario Argento is known especially for his violent and explicit horror titles but this first film of his completely depends good old fashioned suspense and involvement. You almost get the feeling that the killer is on YOUR tale. The comparison between Argento and Alfred Hitchcock surely isn't exaggeratedat least not when it comes to Bird with the Crystal Plumage. Really all aspects about it are impressive. Even the dialogue and acting normally critical letdowns in Italian horror productions are convincing. The film is given the finishing touch by a few extremely ingenious details like an eccentric cateating painter and a stuttering pimp! Viva la giallo!!".

	schema:headline " Early giallo outing for a famed director";
	schema:reviewBody "This first offering from acclaimed director Dario Argento was made before Argento really got into his stride. This is a straightforward mysterycumthriller packed with suspects vital clues and plenty of twists but the horror is restrained to a few murder scenes. Argento's later trademark gore is also missing here as there's nary a drop of blood in sight. This doesn't make this a bad film but it's not what you would expect from the director and feels like more of a pedestrian effort than his later iconic works. While Argento has not yet polished his own unique techniques there are a lot of elements in the film which pop up in his later work  take for example the influential p.o.v. killer shots the black gloves coat and hat for the killer influenced by Bava's BLOOD  BLACK LACE and the opening set piece which is one of this film's highlights. Another highlight is the scene where hero Tony Musante is stalked through the streets by cameoing assassin Reggie Nalder who enjoys taking pot shots at his victim  very stylish and very Hitchcock.The moment Nalder appears on screen my heart lifted  this underrated actor has played some VERY nasty and scary types in his time namely the chief vampire in SALEM'S LOT. It's just a shame he didn't take a more prominent role. Saying that the rest of the cast all give assured performances especially Tony Musante as the charismatic lead. Suzy Kendall also gives a solid performance as his girlfriend who thankfully has only a minimum of histrionics aside from one perilous moment. Argento finds time to throw in a homosexual shop manager and a mad painter who eats his own cats! The identity of the killer is an unusual and clever one and Argento keeps the mystery elements flowing with threatening telephone calls minor characters getting bumped off and plenty of shocks and scares. While this film isn't as polished colourful or stylish as his later classic works the seeds were sown and in time Argento would develop his visual flair. For now this film is worth looking into as the first starting block on the road to his success and subsequent downfall. It wasn't until 1975's DEEP RED that Argento really hit his stride.".

	schema:reviewBody "It all begins rather nonchalantly  with a semirugged handsome and solitary man visiting American writer Sam Dalmas calmly walking along a dark and empty Roman side street. Across the way inside what appears to be a highend contemporary art gallery Sam witnesses a struggle between an obscured shadowy man and a woman dressed in white. The mysterious blackgloved man appears to be attacking the woman with a large knife or razor. Shocked Sam runs over to help banging on the fiberglass partition that shields the gallery from the street but it's all in vain. Without warning the gallery's alarm goes off and another invulnerable partition quickly slides into place from behind thereby trapping Sam between the two. He has no choice but to watch helplessly as the woman is repeatedly and mercilessly stabbed by her masked leatherclad attacker. And we have no choice but to sit and watch along with him.Although there's great danger in store for Sam if he remains in Rome being the only eyewitness to a still unsolved crime he's determined to assist however he can. The only way he really can help is by forcing himself to confront the memories of what he saw that night. And we are forced to do the same. Argento gave us almost all the clues to solve the movie's mystery right up front film title included something the character of Sam doesn't even get to consider. We saw exactly the same things Sam did. Can we recall those initial images we shouldn't have taken for granted and with them guess the killer's identity? Can Sam figure it out before he's next on the killer's list? Throughout Bird Sam is haunted by what he saw or rather what he didn't see and only by immersing himself in the horror of the memory and the future danger that comes with it can he free himself from its ghost like John Harrington in Bava's Hatchet for the Honeymoon Sam Dalmas must go on. One of the most auspicious directorial debuts in genre cinema history if not in all of cinema Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage took the world film markets and critics by complete surprise upon its initial releases throughout '70'71.Dario Argento was an already accomplished screenwriter having cowritten Sergio Leone's epic unsurpassable masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West but Argento's directorial debut was neither greatly anticipated nor expected to be of much note. Today Argento is considered to be among the most influential genre filmmakers alive and the roots of so much that we take for granted in the world of cinematic thrills and suspense first took seed in The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. Despite Bava's originating the giallo subgenre with 1962's The Girl Who Knew Too Much and 1964's Blood  Black Lace it took Argento's Bird to kickstart the craze which ran for a further twelve bloodriddled years. This nailbiting interim include great works by Lucio Fulci Lizard in a Woman's Skin Don't Torture a Duckling and Sergio Martino Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key Torso but Argento himself brought the giallo's glorious run to its end with his overtly selfreferential 1982 film Tenebrae in which again like Hatchet for the Honeymoon the protagonist and antagonist are one and the same.The Bird with the Crystal Plumage however keeps firsttime viewers guessing in addictive frustration and shaking in their seats until its final sadistic scenes. Unlike Bava the dialogue and plot matter a great deal to Argento and few if any other giallos can match Bird's inventive narrative. Aided by intelligent imaginative and disquieting camerawork by future Oscarwinner Vittorio Storaro who like Argento was a prior relative unknown and a gorgeously arid percussive score by Ennio Morricone Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage was the start of an ingenious and daring career that has seen many highs and many unfortunate lows. Even though Bava will always be the Renaissance Man to lovers of Italian Horror Argento should be remembered as the Mannerist the Expressionist. He took it to the next obvious yet intelligent level away from Bava's bold entertaining experiments in style contrast perspective and otherworldly lighting and instead into a darker morallycontrarian realm. One where the feelings and intentions of the artist's images and the audience's reaction to them may not be in sync where a world of feverdreams and wakingnightmares is ruled by Freudian panic and where the word 'primal' may lose its definition for it could be all there is. Most amazing of all Argento's best works were yet to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't consider Dario Argento a favorite director. Sometimes I even question his talent. But his movies have a hypnotic effect on me that always leave me craving for more. The Bird With The Crystal Plumage is the fourth movie I watch by him and it's become my second favorite next to Deep Red.Adapted from a novel that probably no one has ever read by Frederic Brown this is Argento's first movie and incursion into the world of horror that he's lived in ever since. It's arguably also his better structured and directed movie. I always have problems with Argento over characterization the killer's motivation editing dialog. But in this movie perhaps because of its simplicity or because it was his first work it all works rather nicely.The plot doesn't offer anything new Sam Dalmas is an American writer with writer's block working in Rome on a nonfiction book assignment just for the paycheck. On the verge of returning to America he witnesses an attempted murder and becomes involved in the investigation of a serial killer. This is Deep Red and Tenebre. Argento has a formula and seldom abandons it.Tony Musante plays Sam Dalmas with competence but it's not a complex role characters seldom are in these movies. However Musante brings charm and humor to Sam and it instantly likable. The dialog isn't memorable but gialli benefit from having powerful visual storytelling and Argento's camera was never this good  perhaps because legendary DP Vittorio Storato was in charge in the same year he worked in The Spider's Stratagem and The Conformist for Bertolucci now that's talent!. For instance the attempted murder is shot inside a museum separated from the sidewalk by a glass pane. Sam looks inside as if watching a movie on a big screen.Argento is always weak on misdirection and suspects. A good mystery needs suspects to keep the viewer off the killer's track and to add spice to the movie. But his movies never have suspects and the revelation  of which he makes a big deal  is always disappointing because it always turns out to be some character who was in the movie once or twice and so we have no emotional involvement in him.Argento's gialli are more concerned with the way characters find and interpret evidence. For instance the way they discover the killer's apartment comes from analyzing and isolating an unusual sound in a recorded conversation between the killer and Sam. Visual clues aural clues memory  that's what Argento is all about.Finally I must say Ennio Morricone's score for this movie was beautiful. Although I love Claudio Simonetti's more innovative music in Argento's movies Morricone brings tension and suspense with the harmonious mystical themes he composed for this.All in all The Bird With The Crystal Plumage is a visual and aural delight an unpredictable suspenseful mystery that celebrates the best in its genre.".

	schema:headline " Excellent earlyArgento slashermystery.";
	schema:reviewBody "As other have noted The Bird With The Crystal Plumage was Argento's first stab no pun at the horror genre and it's surprising to see how quickly his trademark style and key cinematic concerns fell into place. The film begins with ominous shots of a shadowy figure slipping on black leather gloves running his fingers seductively over a collection of huge shimmering knives intercut with some menacing shots of a young woman walking through town as if being photographed by an unseen foe. This is Argento establishing a sense of foreboding and mysterious dread before plunging into the plot so to speak as we're introduced to our central character a jaded American writer taking a relaxing Italian break with his girlfriend and the world in which he inhabits.Much of the film hinges around a Hitchcockian set piece in which our hero walking past a jewellerystore late at night witnesses an attack on a young woman by an assailant dressed completely in black. Our hero tries to help but finds himself trapped between the two glass security doors forced to watch impotently as the attacker escapes and the girl starts to bleed. This is really an exceptionally welldirected scene by the young Argento as he establishes a set of themes characters and locations that will be revisited from different perspectives throughout the course of the film as our hero and his allies in the policeforce try to piece together the mystery surrounding the attack and it's links to a series of related murders over the past few months.The mystery element of the film really works and kept my attention throughout with Argento really understanding the genre and playing with the audiences preconceptions of Hitchcock and Agatha Christie... and so on. The music here by Ennio Moriconne adds another layer to the story often undercutting as opposed to underscoring the dramatic tension of the scene creating a sense of unease and disarming confusion for the characters that isn't entirely dissimilar to the themes and ideas used by Goblin for Argento's more famous films. Another interesting element here is the cinematography with The Bird With The Crystal Plumage benefiting greatly from the skills of nowlegendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro who uses colour composition and miseenscene exceptionally well with a number of scenes and set pieces prefiguring his exquisite work on films like The Conformist Last Tango in Paris and Apocalypse Now.A number of scenes here standout as absolutely brilliant the first attack included with Argento creating a sense of real danger... often by having the lights cutout during keyscenes or utilising slight camera moves to play with the audience's sense of perspective and character point of view. The chase through the early morning streets of Rome  replete with a hitandrun a shootout in a disused busdepot the hunter turns hunted and a great payoff as the assailant finally disappears into the crowd  is an exceptional creation handled superbly well by the young filmmaker whilst another scene which has a young woman wander blindly into a darkened elevator only to be sliced to pieces by the same darkfigure clutching a straightrazor incidentally this scene was pillaged shotforshot by director Brian DePalma for his film Dressed to Kill is great moment of tension and terror and a great burst of gore in an otherwise restrained early endeavour.The final act of the film offers up a satisfying doublepayoff in which Argento allows the film to play into the audience's suspicions only to then pull the rugout from under us with a twist ending that I for one certainly didn't see coming. Here Argento elaborates on the ideas behind the title and the multitude of birdsymbolism scattered throughout the film most notably the first attack scene in which the victim Monica lies bleeding and helpless in front of a statue of a bird's outstretched claw or the highangle overthecity shot as our hero searches the streets for his girlfriend whilst simultaneously building on that previously vague scene involving the bizarre reclusive artist.The acting throughout the film is strong and the dubbing so prevalent in all Italian films of this era is less distracting than I was expecting. The narrative is strong and completely compelling with Argento drawing us into his scintillating cinematic web and leading us much like his central character down a number of blind alleyways and narrative culdesacs. Though it's certainly less violent than some of his subsequent work there's still a real sense of terror and suspense created by the offsetting music and the overall use of camera composition and staccato editing. In a way it seems like a how to... guide for the rest of his career but that's perhaps a little unfair. For me The Bird With The Crystal Plumage is a riveting revolving enigma of a film that shows a young filmmaker establishing his style and ideology in a way that is absolutely impeccable.".

Though it's certainly less violent than some of his subsequent work there's still a real sense of terror and suspense created by the offsetting music and the overall use of camera composition and staccato editing. In a way it seems like a how to... guide for the rest of his career but that's perhaps a little unfair. For me The Bird With The Crystal Plumage is a riveting revolving enigma of a film that shows a young filmmaker establishing his style and ideology in a way that is absolutely impeccable.";

I don't write reviews like that and I find people who do misleading. If you look over most of the positive reviews for The Bird with the Crystal Plumage on any site you're likely to find they talk about the history and importance of the film but never the film itself. More specifically never the typical story itself. If that's what you base your opinions on there isn't anything I can say to change your mind. However if anyone is sick of hearing onsided praise for The Bird with the Crystal Plumage simply because it's old or simply because it's Dario Argento's first film and want and honest review of the movie read this.First and foremost this is not even close to Dario Argento's worst film. Compared to his most recent Mother of Tears this film is unarguably better. The main problem I always have with Argento films is that he unabashedly pumps his movies filled with cheese The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is nothing like that. It has a typical Giallo plot that is solid and doesn't allow room for cheese. And that's also it's flaw. Being solid the plot is also unoriginal even for its time and just downright average at best. It ends with the average reversal of expectations that if you don't expect at the end of movies like this you're simply naive. The plot most resembles the fouryearyounger and somewhat superior slasher Black Christmas. That isn't saying much however because as I've said the plot has been used so many times I'm sure people were even sick of it back in 1970.With all that said not too many people are going to find this uninteresting. It opens with a very memorable first scene and ends with a very memorable ending. Between those two points the whodunit elements are all fairly fastpaced and even a little immersing. Argento uses a lot of small elements and some interesting plot points to keep the pace up. Sadly you realize it's all just a formulamatic mess.Argento's directing is simply flawless here even more so than his more popular movies. His repeating use of white is stunning likewise is the music. Everything reeks of his personal style that I've yet to see another director imitate. He understands how to make a scene the most effective it can be and that is the single reason I give The Bird with the Crystal Plumage as high of a score as I am. Without the directing this wouldn't even be worth watching.And that is simply all there is to say. The movie is light on plot and heavy on atmosphere. By 1970s standards this must have been a somewhat entertaining if not typical whodunit. By today's standards however there is little reason to watch The Bird with the Crystal Plumage unless you're a horror buff or a cinema buff.310".

Absolutely nothing makes sense in this film.Musante a witness to an attempted murder decides to stay in Italy and become a police inspector's assistant sotospeak which in itself is quite silly. But that's nothing that's not why this film sucks big time. A couple of details that stand out 1 When they all got to the zoo how is it that at that very moment a scream was heard from the killer's husband's flat? A coincidence? Or just one in a series of dumb moments in this piece of crap? 2 When they capture the wrong person thinking he's the murderer how does Musante manage to find the killer's flat so easily? 3 Once he gets there why is it that his friend and his girlfriend are there? When the hell did they get there? They were with Musante the whole time just before in the zoo! Certainly they don't expect us to believe that the female killer kidnapped the two of them in broad daylight  with police all over the place  and then somehow dragged them to her place?! With a helicopter no doubt or perhaps she has wings or Cpt.Kirk beamed her! Certainly she would have been more concerned with fleeing rather than kidnapping and killing?! 4 Why was Musante's male friend killed while Musante's girlfriend was only bound and gagged?! It would have made more sense for both to be dead when Musante arrived there. If anything it should have been the other way around the friend gagged and the girlfriend dead after all the killer is a killer of women right? 5 What's with that assassin dressed in yellow who ran over a cop and chased down Musante and his girlfriend? No explanation whatsoever is ever made as to who he was or might have been! There is a really dumb scene in which a voice expert explains that two recordings of voices were actually from two different persons the inspector takes ages to finally realize what the expert is saying  he practically has to draw it for him! Or maybe the explanation is meant for the audience which Argento assumes is as dumb as his scripts. The explanation given regarding the killer's motives is so farfetched that immediately I associated the film with Dressed To Kill and its incredibly dumb explanation about Caine's motives and inner workings of the mind. There is also no real credibility in the killer's husband constantly covering up for his wife's murderous behaviour  even when she tried to kill HIM and REPEATEDLY. Sounds like a comedy doesn't it? Additionally it is really stupid that the murderesses' husband was dressed in leather with his face covered while his wife was trying to kill HIM! This sort of fooltheviewer plotdevice reminds me strongly of De Palma and his bag of tricks and illogics. The murderess always killed dressed in leather so it's really stupid to have the viewer accept that she was trying to kill her husband while HE was dressed in leather and even wearing a mask. Really stupid. And let's be frank here does the girl playing the killer look anything like a mad massmurderer? Hardly. She looks like a 60s fashion model. Probably slept with someone involved with the film to get the role.The rating I gave it should actually be even lower but I figured that the film at least wasn't dull  though far be it for me to imply that it was exceptionally interesting. Leonard Maltin that mediocre filmcritic wrote that this movie is best viewed on the big screen. As if that would take away all the absurdities that Maltin typically overlooks! As if there is a screen big enough anywhere in the world for Maltin to spot the obvious glaring illogicalities in this or any other dumb film! No. MY expert advice is best not view it at all whether on a small screen a big screen or a triangular screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "1969 saw the emergence of a young up and coming director named Dario Argento.

	schema:reviewBody "THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE Dario Argento  Italy 1970.Dario Argento's debut film that rightfully put him on the map as one of the most gifted horror directors in a long time. After just seeing Sergio Martino's The Case of the Scorpion's Tail it won't come as a surprise that I enjoyed watching this film much more. Although not as outrageous in style perhaps a bit too much style over substance as his later films Deep Red 1975 and Suspriria 1977 there is still plenty to enjoy with some impressive set pieces and superb cinematography.Like the American jazz pianist in Deep Red 1975 the central character is the American abroad in Rome but this time he is a writer Tony Musante trying to relax abroad because of his writer's block. Things start to get ugly when he witnesses a murder while passing an art gallery. The attacker traps Musante and he is forced to watch the woman struggle until the police arrives. The police question him and take his passport after which he sets to investigate the murder by himself with the aid of girlfriend the gorgeous Suzy Kendall piecing together clues along the way.The story is involving most of the way with quite a surprising twist ending. And finally a Giallo where the lead Tony Musante is not just adequate but even quite good. But since Argento dubbed all his films he shot most of them without sound recordings the performances are hard to judge so for what it's worth. Suzy Kendall has got nothing to do really except look beautiful and getting hysterical when it's her turn to be stalked by the masked killer.This is one of his more tightly scripted films after Deep Red which means it's still a mess but seldom so confusing it becomes totally distracting. But he made one almost fatal slipup near the end of the film which was quite annoying. Its more than just a goof but a major detail. When an accomplice of Musante storms into his room and tells him he has crucial information about the whereabouts of the killer we get some clues about the mysterious 'title character' The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. He reveals this is the rare bird Hornitus Nevalis 'which only lives in the Caucasus.' The realist that I am and amateur ornithologist I actually started thinking. What bird could this be?The bird was rare almost never breeds in captivity and 'hates the smells of other animals.' Hahaha.. the first real laughs started to come. Well I couldn't think of anything really the Caspian Snowcock sprang into mind not a crystal plumage really. They soon rush to the Zoo where the bird in question is the African Crowned Crane Balearica Pavonina with the fictitious scientific name Hornitus Nevalis. Why come up with this silly story about a rare bird from the Caucasus and then show one of the most commonly held birds in Zoo's anywhere? I've never been to a Zoo without these African Crowned Cranes  walking around between the other animals instantly recognizable to most people I suppose. Certainly enough to know they don't live in the Caucasus. With just the tiniest bit of research Argento could have come up with something a little more inventive. With this preposterous plot twist all credibility is thrown down the drain. But after all this is a Giallo so I guess there's no point in taking any of this seriously. Perhaps I watched too many of these ludicrous Italian thrillers. Nevertheless I enjoyed it most of the way but after a while good arguments can be made to put the sound off but then the Ennio Morricone score would be lost. Camera Obscura  710".

	schema:headline " Argento's debut Giallo is a fine one indeed!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bird with the Crystal Plumage the first and best of the Animals trilogy is an important film. First of all it's the directorial debut of a man who is without doubt one of the finest and most important horror directors to ever pick up a camera and secondly because this is a film that set a lot of the ground rules that Argento would abide by in his later movies such as the harassing phone calls the protagonist that sees something that later turns out to be something else and of course the black gloved killer. The plot follows Sam Dalmas an American writer staying in Rome that witnesses the attempted murder of a young woman inside an art gallery. After initially helping the police by telling them as much as he knows Sam decides to conduct an investigation into the murder on his own. However as he delves deeper and deeper into the mystery he becomes more and more intrigued and has to find out who the killer is  even though he might just end up the next victim.The principal reason that Bird With the Crystal Plumage succeeds is it's plotting. Italian horror has never been known for coherent plots but with this film you'd be forgiven for forgetting that. Unlike with some of his other films Argento clearly knows what he wants to do with this film and he does it. The plotting is efficient and little time is wasted deviating away from the central premise which allows Argento to connect with story and bring out the best from it. The film creates an almost constant sense of dread and tension and we really feel like the killer is on our protagonist's tail all the time. This is done by all sorts of methods such as the phone calls from the killer to things such as our hero being chased while out for a walk with his girlfriend. Argento constantly keeps his audience on the edge of their seat by throwing in these things and also by the way that the murder investigation is conduced. Argento puts his audience at the centre of the riddle and via the various clues that Argento gives us we are able to work the mystery out for ourselves. Bird With the Crystal Plumage also features an incredible soundtrack courtesy of a man that is probably the greatest composer of all time  Ennio Morricone. Ennio's score doesn't rival the ones that he did for Sergio Leone what does? but it is a great score in it's own right and more than does the film proud.Even though this film is the first that Argento ever directed it easily stands up to the rest of his oeuvre and surpasses most of it mostly due to the fact that it's such an assured picture. With his later Giallo's such as Profondo Rosso or Tenebre Argento would become more ambitious and start adding more to his plots and don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of those films but with this one Argento has proved that a film doesn't need a big plot to create an enticing mystery. Bird With the Crystal Plumage is at the very top of the Giallo sub genre and easily ranks as one of the best films that Argento ever made. Highly recommended viewing.".

From June 1941 to the final battle of Berlin in April 1945 the conflict between the Nazis and red army cost the lives of 35 million people. IF you look upon the war between Hitler and Stalin as being separate from all the other campaigns of conflict in the second world war then the campaign in Eastern Europe is the bloodiest conflict in the history of mankind. Something that seems very unlikely to be exceeded . Alas however western film makers seem reluctant to acknowledge this . Off the top of my head I can think of only 3 American  European movies to be set on the Eastern front ENEMY AT THE GATES  STALINGRAD and CROSS OF IRON.I first saw CROSS OF IRON in 1983 and have seen it umpteen times since then. This is an intelligent anti war classic and I never get bored with it. James Coburn  star of many a forgettable lightweight caper movie is perfect as the cynical Sgt Steiner. For the first time in his career he shows he has presence and probably gives his best performance in any film . James Mason is also good  though you have admit has Mason ever been bad ? but the best performance award goes to Maximillian Schell as the villain of the piece. Itd be all too easy to have Schell as a goosestepping Nazi  but Schells character is a Prussian aristocrat opposed to fascist egalitarianism . He dislikes the Nazis almost as much as Steiner does.Thats one of many good aspects of the script  its so thoughtful and with one exception it doesnt show any of the Germans as out and out idealogue fascists. But notice the couple of ironic touches in the film where people say the excuse of   I obey orders. It was none of my doing. I was not responsible  Something that has been said a lot of times during the last century  and the century before that  and the one before that. Guess if you travelled a thousand years in the future wed still be hearing that. I also find the script perfectly paced CROSS OF IRON lasts nearly two and a half hours but no matter how many times I watch it I never find it dragging in any way. I sometimes watch SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but I only watch the first half hour and last half hour cos the middle  of SPR is totally tedious. CROSS OF IRON has a much better script.Maybe the battle scenes of SPR are slightly more gory but at best theyre only as good as the ones in this film. Id say this is Peckinpahs best film . The editing during the battle scenes are absolutely superb as we see Soviet soldiers in slo mo  Germans in real time cutting back to Soviets in real time then Germans in slo mo. Then seeing a cross cut with a Soviet and German dying at the same time.A classic and unforgivably forgotten film set during the worst conflict in history . In my opinion the greatest WW2 film ever surpassing even DAS BOOT".

Then seeing a cross cut with a Soviet and German dying at the same time.A classic and unforgivably forgotten film set during the worst conflict in history . In my opinion the greatest WW2 film ever surpassing even DAS BOOT";

	schema:headline " Peckinpah's intense chilling masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Cross Of Iron is a masterpiece one of the greatest antiwar antiauthoritarian movies. It is one of director Sam Peckinpah's two finest works  the other being The Wild Bunch. It deserves to be ranked in the same great war movie company as Apocalypse Now Das Boot Full Metal Jacket Paths Of Glory Saving Private Ryan Seven Samurai and Zulu. Its setting on the World War Two Eastern Front its gruesomeness and its risktaking viewpoint on ugly combat from the German side have tended to count against fair assessment of its considerable artistic achievements. Viewers wary of the morality of its German viewpoint and its explicitness might find that it is fundamentally about humanity in general as a victim of war. The film reflects on the humanity which may be found on all sides of conflictincluding Russian humanity portrayed variously as relentless innocent brave and feminine.Cross Of Iron opens with an intense chilling montage of nursery rhyme propaganda combat newsreel and atrocity. By the end of the main title the montage subtly introduces the central characters a German reconnaissance unit patrolling on the 1943 Russian front.This 1977 film set rarely matched standards of cinematic mayhem. Cross Of Iron explosions don't look merely like pretty fireballs  they blast fragments rocks and debris leaving no doubt as to why blood gouts from stumps of limbs and shrapnelshredded entrails. Amid the screams of wounded and dying as dust subsides from a mortar barrage an artillery piece shorn of its crew by a near hit swings across a pocked battlefield its traversing wheel spinning under its own momentum. The carnage occurs in the choreographed slow motion which Peckinpah made his signature.James Coburn turns in one of his finest roles as Rolf Steiner a highly decorated NCO who leads a German reconnaissance squad. Steiner fights less for his country than for his comrades. He has low opinions of class and rank distinctions. He is contemptuous both of Nazism and the aristocratic Prussian arrogance of his new superior officer Captain Stransky played with great style by Maximilian Schell. But there are hints of a dark side. Although Steiner is articulate and philosophical he has no answer when his love interest during an enforced break from battle nurse Eva Senta Berger bitterly accuses him of being afraid of what he would be without the war.Among the many fine supporting performances James Mason plays the warweary Colonel Brandt. He sees the immorality and futility of German war aims but his sense of honour and duty about the prevailing struggle makes ceasing to fight unthinkable. David Warner plays Brandt's outofplace and outoftime adjutant Captain Kiesel who represents to his colonel the hope that a more enlightened postwar Germany might arise from the ashes of inevitable defeat.War movie buffs irritated by the technical inaccuracies common in many examples of the genre will find some satisfaction in attention to authenticity of weaponry. A range of genuine WWII German and Russian small arms appears. The T 3485 tanks are real although the very picky might argue that this is at least six months premature and that for the summer of '43 they should be T 3476. Tactics at times deviate from the textbooks but this is a drama not a combat manual.At the time of writing this great film of a great American director lacks the high quality collectors' edition Zone 1 DVD release it deserves. The Warner Home Video Zone 2 release available through www.amazon.co.uk has the high quality video and sound which have been missing from the nonstudio Zone 1 releases. This film is a musthave for war movie fans.Update as at September 2011 It appears that only the DVD and Bluray releases of this film for the European market  notably those published by Studio Canal  are good quality transfers as well as being in the original widescreen aspect ratio. Studio Canal's Bluray release encoded for Region B only is significantly better even than their DVD. It shows so much more detail compared to the DVD releases for example that the lettering and designs of German military awards like the Krim and Kuban Shield shoulder insignia can be seen clearly on screen and wine and beer bottle labels are easily read. The Bluray is available from Amazon.co.uk but can be played only on Region Bcapable Bluray decks. Extras on this Bluray include a gem a documentary by Mike Siegel called Passion  Poetry  Sam Peckinpah's War. This gives fascinating insight into the making of Cross of Iron and Peckinpah's directorial style through contemporary and later interviews with James Coburn David Warner Senta Berger Maximilian Schell Roger Fritz Vadim Glowna Katy Haber and Peckinpah himself. It includes a shot of Peckinpah reminiscing proudly about receiving a telegram from Orson Welles saying it was 'one of the finest war films ever made'.".

	schema:headline " Underrated AntiWar classic from Sam Peckinpah.";
	schema:reviewBody "Cross of Iron 1977 was a low budget masterpiece from ace director Sam Peckinpah. After having a falling out from Hollywood Peckinpah went to Europe to direct this W.W.II. antiwar film. The film centers around Sergent Steiner a battle weary veteran who leads his company into battle everyday for the past three years. Unlike others his only concern is the survival of his men and the fact that he's a live to live another day. One day an officer of Prussian descent Maximillian Schnell decides to make his and everyone beneath him lives miserable. James Mason plays the battle hardened Colonel whilst David Warner costars as his cynical aide de camp.Using the limited time and budget to it's fullest extent Peckinpah created a very stylish and action packed film. The bullets fly shells pound the earth and the blood flows. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography perfectly captures the action. The battles are very well staged and the acting is executed very well. James Coburn earned his stripes with this film. He's the man! Senta Berger a Peckinpah veteran from Major Dundee has a small role as a German nurse who briefly becomes involved with Sergent Steiner. What I liked about this movie was the fact that Coburn Warner and Mason didn't bother to use fake Teutonic accents.If you're a viewer of war films or a Peckinpah fan this has to be on top of your list. This is one hell of an action film. War will never look the same again after watching this film. Sadly the domestic D.V.D. release is not only expensive but of poor quality. Try and find and alternate way of watching this neglected masterpiece. I have to give this film a very high rating.Highest recommendation possible.".

The battle scenes are expansive and very bloody as we follow the German platoon trying to get back to its own lines. The soldiers are heroes in an unheroic war and the film captures the chaos cynicism and heroism of the German retreat. Well worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't add much to these reviews except to comment that I've found this film to be a great favourite among real soldiers. I once got to deliver the classic line to a Major and a Captain about hating all officers. Luckily? they knew I was quoting from the film!I'm not bothered about the assortment of accents in the cast that others have mentioned. It seems to me that if you believe in their situation and have immersed yourself in the film as it was easy for me to do then you don't even notice them after a while. I would argue that the cast in terms of dialogue in Private Ryan is far more of a problem since these seem to be 1990s guys transported back to 1944 and are far too 'knowing'. Moreover in Private Ryan I kept stepping back from the film feeling that I was simply being manipulated by the director. COI is far more chilling. I really liked if that's the word a scene where an artillery explosion killed both Germans and Soviets. Kind of emphasises the 'war is hell' message without preaching or being manipulative. I think Steiner is one of the greatest military characters ever to appear on film for what its worth Gregory Peck as Savage in Twelve O'Clock High and Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain in Gettysburg are also up there. I must say I didn't really like the ending but I can't suggest a better one but as an alternate ending I would certainly recommend that people do not see the awful sequel 'Sergeant Steiner' with Richard Burton! as Steiner.".

Although my mother told me this is one of her favorite war movies ever yes I know it may sound a bit strange but we have the same taste for war movies I also saw a rather bad score on IMDb about 6.6 at the time. Well now that I've seen it I can only say that this movie will be in my top 5 of war movies. This movie shows war the way it actually is dirty deadly tragic... and with plenty of losers but no winners. In this movie you won't find any glorification of fake patriotism or dying for a good cause that only politicians in their ivory towers seem to know. No this movie shows the war in its purest and most horrifying form.It brings us the story of Rolf Steiner a veteran hardened by the war who leads his men through every battle and dangerous situation but who also takes care that they will survive the madness. Than a Prussian officer who volunteered to leave the quiet battlefree world of France for the real action in Russia joins his fighting group. The man thinks of only one thing to get an iron cross as fast as possible so his family can be proud and shouldn't see him as a disgrace to their military tradition. This leads to a lot of problems between the two of course and gradually the tension cumulates until it explodes... I don't know if the story is based on true facts but the movie certainly gives a good idea of what the war at the Eastern Front was like especially after the Germans had suffered a major loss in Stalingrad. They had to retread but had to take care that they didn't get overwhelmed by the Soviet troops when doing so a lot of the man had lost faith in victory no prisoners were taken but were shot at the spot optimism had made place for cynicism ... It all feels very real and believable.And the feeling of realism can also be found in the way of filming. Some might say Peckinpah experimented too much with slowmotion handheld camera's... but personally I believe it only gives an extra dimension to this movie giving it that extra touch that makes it different from so many mediocre Hollywood productions. I really liked the way he followed the action closely making you feel like you are part of it yourself but what really sparked my interest was the contrast between the child's voice singing a happy song and the images of the horrors of the war at the beginning and the end of the movie. That really made shivers go down my spine.If I thought about antiwar movies I always used to name the World War I classic All Quiet on the Western Front the 1930 version as well as the remake from 1979 but from now on I'll have to add one extra movie Cross of Iron. If you are a fan of realistic antiwar movies than this is a movie you shouldn't miss. I give it a 910.".

Unusual for a war film  the story is told from the German point of view.  Being a Peckinpah film there are explosions and bloodspurting bodies  aplenty. The rough terrain and cramped quarters that the soldiers have  to deal with lend well to the declining German fortunes in Russia. As  in his other films notably The Wild Bunch Peckinpah utilizes his  now famous slowmotion technique to illustrate the violence and show  the effects of the destruction.  James Coburn stars as the battle wise Sgt. Steiner who has survived the  war thus far by his wits. Maximillian Schell plays his aristocratic  Captain whose main goal is the pursuit of the Iron Cross Germany's  highest decoration and who will go to any lengths to get it. James  Mason is the Company commander and David Warner is his adjutant.  Coburn is excellent in the lead who continues to do his duty in spite  of the inevitability of impending defeat. Schell is suitably ambitious  and cunning as the chief villain and Mason and Warner convey the  hopelessness of the situation while maintaining stiff upper lips.  Cross of Iron in it's uncut version 132 minutes ranks as one of  the greatest of all WWII films in my opinion. One of Peckinpah's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cross of Iron is probably the second best film made by Sam Peckinpah rivalled only by The Wild Bunch. It is a war film shich follows a unit of German soldiers as they escape from the front line as the Russians smash through their ranks. This was perhaps the most devastating line to be fighting on during World War Two and as expected there is a lot of death and gore not to mention filth sweat and treachery.James Coburn plays a German soldier with an almost Godlike air of invincibility about him. He is not a comic book creation but a hardened soldier who terrifies everybody including his commanding officers. Max Schell plays a commanding officer who wants an Iron Cross despite the fact that he a coward and will go to the most treacherous lengths to get it.This is an upsetting and unflinching film. It predates Saving Private Ryan by two decades yet is just as detailed and frightening just as bloody and maybe even better.Anyone yet to see Cross of Iron must do so as soon as possible. It is one of the great war films and an unforgettably chilling experience.".

This is definitely a different war film from its time and now. Peckinpah's directed this in a great fashion that hasn't been seen I have not seen his films since The Wild Bunch. I was lucky enough to have found the 133 minute version in a rental store. I hope one day to see this version on DVD in widescreen. James Coburn is once again in a great role as Steiner. He is also supported by the great James Mason Maximillian Schell in his best role since Judgment at Nuremberg and David Warner. The film had some fine editing and slow motion shots good underscore and a solid script. It is a tragedy that Peckinpah went so over budget that they had to end the movie half way through the script. I hope one day that somebody will remake this in the eyes of Peckinpah and be able to film the entire film.".

COI used real equipment and actors who could act not just pose.COI did the action shots with real effects real explosions. SPR did a lot with digital technology. Of course it's a snappier smoother visual experience but it has 2 decades of heritage and technology to prop it up.In my Opinion COI is one of the 3 best war films of all time. Apocalypse Now had a huge budget in the modern era  COI had 5 yugoslav tanks and comes a VERY close second. Don't ask me to pick the third right now. I have several options but COI and An are head and shoulders above the rest. Steiner is a performance of a lifetime for Coburn  should've been an Oscar IMHO.This is one of those films I watch several times a year as a calibration for the other stuff and for pure fun.Buy it watch it and watch it again and again...".

My advice Go rent out a Michael Bay  Bruckheimer film....something like Pearl Harbor. That will be more to your tastes I imagine.Cross of Iron is the kind of film that scars you mentally. I remember seeing it at a young age on British television in the early 80's and being totally blown away by it. There are so many visually memorable things about it that stay in your head long after viewing it.....the hypnotic kinetic camera work the astonishing streamofconsciousness editing style the grimy blood mud  stsmeared battlefields that feel almost like the great war rather than WW2.Of course great visuals are nothing when they are not married to a great story. The tale is deceptively simple  a recon unit of the Werhmacht is desperately fighting for survival and escape against the seemingly endless waves of vengeful Russian forces in the immediate aftermath of Stalingrad. The unit is headed by Steiner James Coburn never better a deadeyed wornout Corporal who cares nothing for the Third Reich the Furher and the army officers only for his platoon of unwashed burnt out and cynical troops. His men idolise him for his fearlessness and decisiveness in combat and as a group they make a deadly and efficient fighting force. The unit is thrown into chaos by the arrival of Captain Stransky a wonderfully slimy Maximillian Schell a vain aristocratic officer who is deep down a coward but is driven forward by his desire to gain an Iron Cross  something which sets him in immediate conflict with Stiener and his unit. Steiner ridicules Stransky's insane desire for a medal as he already has several  it's just a piece of worthless metal. Stransky however will stop at nothing even turning on his own forces to gain an Iron Cross. Thus a deadly circle of sacrifice mistrust betrayal judgement and redemption is set in motion.The fact that the main protagonists are German and the villans as such are Russians is the first of many surprises in the film that defy Hollywood convention. It is risktaking like this that very rarely happens in modern cinema.As for the performances.....James Coburn's face expresses more in the flicker of an eyebrow and an enigmatic halfsmilehalffrown than the likes of Hanks Affleck Cage etc could summon over an entire film. The supporting cast are also excellent. Schell is great as the cowardly Captain Stransky. David Warner and James Mason also excel in small but well observed and minutely detailed roles. Steiner's unit is a group of extraordinary actors. Many look as though they have been plucked from a spaghetti western  battered features grimy unshaved faces leering faces. Throughout the film there is a real sense of the actors functioning as a combat unit  Peckinpah obviously enjoyed being a part of the group and encouraged them to bounce off each other. This is especially evident in the bunker scenes when they are shown not as faceless killing machines but as human soldiers  joking farting drinking at ease. This contrasts sharply when they are on the battlefield and they become almost animalistic in their struggle to survive.The battle scenes are truly amazing  the now trademark Peckinpah crosscutting slowmotion and multiple pointsofview are evident throughout Watching them now you can see where the likes of John Woo James Cameron and definitely Oliver Stone picked up many motifs and ideas.If you have any serious love for cinema are jaded by the standard jingoistic bullst that Hollywood churns out and want to discover a film that will stay with you for a long time after you have viewed it then I recommend that you make the effort to seek this out. If any film deserved the special edition reissue treatment this is it.Stransky All right......I accept. I'll show you how a Prussian Officer can fight!! Steiner And I'll show you....where the iron crosses grow!".

	schema:reviewBody "I had read reviews of cross of iron well before my recent viewing of this incredible masterpiece on our local TV station during the small hours. None have given this remarkable film any justice. No war film is so unrelenting in portraying just a small sector of the largest conflict in history. With pitiless carnage from start to finish one wonders how any who were drafted to fight on the eastern front could survive such inferno after so many written accounts of the brutality and suffering of eastern front warfare are made visual in this film. I can't believe the compassion I could feel for the characters considering the age of the film compared with the bubblegum war films of that era. The mosaic opening scene entwining images of the phoenix rise of Germany prosperity and incredible evil against a child's nursery rhyme left me cold. No one could have any romantic notions of modern warfare after sitting through this film.This film satisfied something in me that has brooded for a long time. I have grown physically ill of films that portray German soldiers as useless cattle that were mercilessly butchered by brave AmericanBritish supermen. The soldiers of all sides were largely boys not a lot different to each other. All sides in the conflict had their brave and humane Steiners or their callous and evil Stransky's even those who fought to rid the world of the heinous Nazi's. Cross of Iron's closest contemporary in terms of visual repulsion and subject matter  Saving Private Ryan is simply another Hollywood Dirty Dozen in shiny new clothes. It portrays rank and file Germans and their soldiers as hideous Nazi's and paves the way throughout the film for Spielberg to inflict a glorified orgy of death upon them in the final scene which can only be described as a very personal fantasy for the director that unfortunately we are all now privy to. The image where rays of light bathe an American soldier who has murdered a surrendered prisoner like some kind of suggestive sainthood is disgraceful and who knows how many are influenced by this kind of vicious manipulation of filmmaking. Cross of Iron shows the wholesale slaughter of all humans in war and the increasingly hopeless situation of all involved is a physical strain upon the viewer. There is no better antiwar film.".

	schema:headline " Fine Film Built Around 'a Piece of Worthless Metal'";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in 1993 at 29 Palms in the Marines. It was selected as a training film for the entire company by my platoon leader who wanted to depict the leadership qualities of the noncommissioned officer  the cohesion of small units. It got a tepid reception from Marines then enamored of scifi actioners  the sardonic 'Full Metal Jacket' who thought the scenes of male bonding were sappy or 'gay.' Nor did the company commander seem to appreciate Peckinpah's antiestablishment tone. Antiestablishment is really the best description of 'Cross of Iron' rather than antiwar and though it is his only real war film holds to the dark theme of governmentcorporation vs. manly individualist that marked most major Peckinpah films. The story follows ace platoon NCO Steiner Coburn as he holds together his elite but warweary men  deals with his officers wise Colonel Brandt Mason dissolute adjutant Kiesel Warner heroic Lt. Meier Galo and weaselly Lt. Triebig Fritz. Hardest to deal with is his company commander the ambitious arrogant Captain Stransky Schell who transferred from the comfort of France to the horrors of the East to as Kiesel notes achieve 'spiritual domination' of the war symbolized by his obsession with winning the Iron Cross. Significantly most of the experienced soldiers including all the other officers have already won the Iron Cross while Meier  Steiner Stransky's subordinates are highly decorated. Though not well known in English Heinrich's book is a World War II counterpart to 'All Quiet on the Western Front' as it starkly depicts a German soldier's struggle to remain human through the horrors of Total War  the prospect of Total Defeat. Heinrich is a bit awkward  preachy compared to Remarque  this comes through in the film notably in scenes with the officers. For a film with a modest budget it's pretty long accentuating the preachiness. The impressive multinational cast suffers from the necessity of putting Englishspeaking stars in the main roles. Only Coburn  Warner make even slight attempts at German accents. Coburn depicts rather than details Steiner using his wicked smile  humor sparingly while bringing to life a talented tortured individual torn between his hatred of war love for his friends  his fear of leaving the only world he knows. Mason is as usual both nuanced  commanding. Schell is fine as the pompous captain but only gets a chance to show his tremendous talent when Stransky is manipulative notably the scene in which he blackmails Triebig. The fine Senta Berger gets little chance to develop nurse Eva. The soldiers are all scruffy to the point of ugliness a Peckinpah feature discarded in the bodybySoloflex action films made from the 1980s onward. Peckinpah had refined his trademark touches to a fine point. There's the brotherly love the men share without being 'gay' as well as their conflicted attitude toward women at once desiring worshiping  fearing them. The contrast of hardened jaded veterans with innocent youth first explored in The Wild Bunch permeates 'Cross of Iron' in Steiner's interaction with the Russian boy Prohic  Private Dietz Nowka the latter playing a 'kid's game' of avoiding sunlight as the platoon is about to make an attack. Like 'The Wild Bunch' the film has a bizarre but engrossing opening montage featuring war  Nazi footage mixed with band music  a German child's rhyme. Above all is the theme of resistance to oppressive authority. Steiner rejects the bullying of Stransky but also the condescending sympathy of Brandt  Kiesel which he hates just as much and expresses disdain for all 'medal scavengers.' Two new Peckinpah features a surrealist motif including flashbacks  fantasies and an overt political tone driven home by photos of Vietnam  a Brecht quote in the closing montage. The action scenes especially the slowmotion effects are as good as any by Peckinpah. Considering the low budget they should be the stuff of legend featuring extraordinary photography  precise correct detail. Peckinpah's operatic violence contrasts with the crushing unmanning action depicted in versions of 'All Quiet in the Western Front.' To balance making a film about the most demonized military machine in history Peckinpah is at pains to depict ALL the major German characters even Stransky as antiNazi. Stransky declares himself a Prussian aristocrat Steiner is openly disdainful of a SS soldier  Brandt lays plans for the existence of Germany after the Nazis. The platoon soldiers wear a mishmash of uniform civilian clothes  pilfered Soviet items further deNazifying them. This is probably Peckinpah's gloomiest film except 'Alfredo Garcia'which is pretty gloomybut it lacks the exquisitely artful darkness of 'Apocalypse Now.' Then again Heinrich's book isn't 'Heart of Darkness.' If you can watch 'All Quiet' 'Cross'  'Apocalypse' all in one day without abandoning all hope then you're as cheerful as Pippi Longstocking. 'Cross of Iron' is a unique work either as a war film an action movie or even a Peckinpah work.".

It was selected as a training film for the entire company by my platoon leader who wanted to depict the leadership qualities of the noncommissioned officer  the cohesion of small units. It got a tepid reception from Marines then enamored of scifi actioners  the sardonic 'Full Metal Jacket' who thought the scenes of male bonding were sappy or 'gay.' Nor did the company commander seem to appreciate Peckinpah's antiestablishment tone. Antiestablishment is really the best description of 'Cross of Iron' rather than antiwar and though it is his only real war film holds to the dark theme of governmentcorporation vs. manly individualist that marked most major Peckinpah films.

The story disclosed from the German side showing German soldiers as human beings was quite unusual in that decade. James Coburn has one of the best performances in his filmography in the role of an experienced rebel soldier from the lower classes hardened by the war but committed with his subordinates and exerting a perfect leadership.

The scenarios and the action scenes are awesome and the battles have an amazing choreography with Sam Peckinpah still in good shape.

What affected my choice was perhaps the current situation when with the outbreak of the most recent war I have been getting more and more uneasy about the thought that the previous war was in fact far less unambiguous than the banal clich 'Great Partiotic War' what we call it in Russia meaning homespun truth 'we had been under attack  so we stroke back'. In actual fact the USSR just certainly participated in the most awful war of all time. And that was participation to full capacity our land was lucky to have so much human and economic resources that paying little attention to casualties and even speaking about colossal casualties need with a plump 'YES'... In the both world wars' history there were neither the right nor the wrong neither the defenders nor the aggressors neither the conscientious nor the deceitful. What there were was just overcrowded battlefields and tremendous massacres due to the superpowerful military blocs' confrontation. And Germany was against all. It is not just German propaganda! Because saying that Japan and Italy sufficiently helped the Reich to achieve by 1942 impressing spreading over the larger part of Europe from Norway France and Greece eastwards to the Lower Volga  would be quite sure a hypocrisy. The Germans there is no denying their fantastic fighting spirit and selfdenial under their Fhrer Hitler an Austrian himself actually would indeed approach the Superpower status  only to be eventually pulled up and occupied by the wartime allies whose coalition however dissolved shortly after. The former have gone down in history as the monstrous evil fanatics tormentors of peoples and what of it? image of the enemy especially of the shattered one is likely to be demonised and since the war was the most monstrous one the demonisation was likely to reach the unparalleled extent. Jews alas have always been destroyed antisemitism has still not ceased to exist. Shootings of civilian population and property destruction by advancing or retreating troops used to take place on any war and still does. When the war was over the German and the Japanese rulers were dismissed and they were in the dock accused of 'war crimes' but that was because the winner is always right and judges the beaten. Just a decorum of diplomacy. I even wonder why so many people still believe that was really a holy violence and a fair trial. And the current war Donbass war must wipe out the rosecoloured view of victory in the antiNazi war as Nazism then was not a simple and unambiguous enemy and there was no deathnail for it then. Today some heavymetal songs from the turn of the 1980s and 1990s are extremely topical again. As they describe bombing warn that just as decades ago the Nazi Germany recarved the map of Europe sparks of crematory fire of death camps are still visible narrate the stories of hirelings of dirty tricks and monkey business. In fact I just a teenager that time foresaw that revanchism that came up in our pluralism age together with any other 'dissenting opinions' would lead to no good... But the Germans are just the ones who least of all stick to their demands in this regard! And the world is lucky to have SUCH Germans today as otherwise it might be a World War III with once more 'Germany against all'  and doomsday! However Germany at the moment needs revanchism like one needs a hole in the head. Who eulogise it are rulers of Eastern European states as it is a safe bet of giving up everything that connects with Russia the parent state and that is none of Germany's business. But how are we Russians going to solve the current pending problem  that is the challenge. We would be lucky to have the majority once again as in 1941 been convinced of being victorious 'victors need never explain'... But what if not?..Having grounded the significance and topicality of this film I am going to describe its advantages. This old film measures itself against many modern war films as well as it is still thrillingtowatch. Almost no 'tall tale' but striking accent when meeting almost any Russian characters bit parts. Why not involve Russians in auding. There have always been millions of those abroad 'Iron Curtain' is also just a clich shown to the best advantage by certain circle isn't it?. The female unit episode is certainly a shocksploitation but there is a black sheep in every flock. And why the Western filmmakers showed the Soviet female warrior not just as an abusive woman who immediately laid her arms down and gave in to the Germans. Instead this composite character is shown as a female hero who combats the enemy many times superior ready to sell her life and honour dearly...But the Germans are main characters here. They are neither protagonists here nor those who are praised and whitewashed. We see them such as they must have been on that war. Soviet posters showed them next to trench rats with arms round each other and quite similar to each other and that was not just propaganda. No military bearing in the war it is at the parade where a fighter is cleanshaven and wears fulldress uniform and is in blanched boots! While in trenches even the question of insignia is often of no importance. Because an officer who keeps subordination too zealously takes chances to have his own soldiers got rid of him. So some exclusively brave Wehrmacht soldiers would wear trophy Red Army garments give higher commanders a piece of mind pardon Soviet captives and even exchange defeatist views wishing Hitler himself 'kaputt'!".

Who eulogise it are rulers of Eastern European states as it is a safe bet of giving up everything that connects with Russia the parent state and that is none of Germany's business. But how are we Russians going to solve the current pending problem  that is the challenge. We would be lucky to have the majority once again as in 1941 been convinced of being victorious 'victors need never explain'... But what if not?..Having grounded the significance and topicality of this film I am going to describe its advantages. This old film measures itself against many modern war films as well as it is still thrillingtowatch. Almost no 'tall tale' but striking accent when meeting almost any Russian characters bit parts. Why not involve Russians in auding. There have always been millions of those abroad 'Iron Curtain' is also just a clich shown to the best advantage by certain circle isn't it?. The female unit episode is certainly a shocksploitation but there is a black sheep in every flock. And why the Western filmmakers showed the Soviet female warrior not just as an abusive woman who immediately laid her arms down and gave in to the Germans. Instead this composite character is shown as a female hero who combats the enemy many times superior ready to sell her life and honour dearly...But the Germans are main characters here. They are neither protagonists here nor those who are praised and whitewashed. We see them such as they must have been on that war. Soviet posters showed them next to trench rats with arms round each other and quite similar to each other and that was not just propaganda. No military bearing in the war it is at the parade where a fighter is cleanshaven and wears fulldress uniform and is in blanched boots! While in trenches even the question of insignia is often of no importance. Because an officer who keeps subordination too zealously takes chances to have his own soldiers got rid of him. So some exclusively brave Wehrmacht soldiers would wear trophy Red Army garments give higher commanders a piece of mind pardon Soviet captives and even exchange defeatist views wishing Hitler himself 'kaputt'!";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow!!! Just got finished watching Peckinpah's Cross of Iron. It totally blew me away. I'd resisted seeing it for years even though I am a big Peckinpah fan because it's considered one of his lesser films. I can't imagine why. This film is amazing. Easily one of the grittiest dirtiest dingiest most insane war movies I've ever encountered.In my experience the really great war films have a tendency to be either cerebral and textural Hell is for Heroes Full Metal Jacket Thin Red Line All Quiet on the Western Front Paths of Glory or kinetic and adrenalized Apocalypse Now Saving Private Ryan The Deer Hunter. Of course most films kind of jump the barrier here and there but usually you can make a distinction. Cross of Iron combines the two as well as any film I have seen. It also has the added peculiar distinction of being one of the only WWII war films with German protagonists.Coburn totally commands the screen as the brilliant Steiner a platoon Sergeant who hates officers and war but feels a strong obligation to his men who love him and trust his leadership. The midway point battle scene in this film where the Russians invade the bunker completely blew me away. I was not expecting something so absolutely insane. This ranks up there with the greatest battle scenes ever filmed in my opinion.Highly recommended".

	schema:reviewBody "It is plain to see why so many films and stories about World War II have the Germans be the badguys. They are either vile badguys or faceless badguys and both types of badguy are gunned down in large numbers as if they were emotionless unfeeling robots. Cross of Iron strikes a different and uncommon note by showing them from the point of view we see the typical good guys. In fact we see their point of view. There are still Germans getting shot at blown up by artillery shells but we're right there with them. Seeing through the same perspective as someone else is a powerful motivator for sympathy and if this film demonstrates any one thing it is that war is hell but it is vital to see that it is hell for all those stuck in the middle of it.Cross of Iron takes place in one small part of the Eastern Front of World War II it is not really important where since the film is not about the war itself. There is no mention of a military strategy and how the protagonists fit and then how they fight to achieve what their superiors ordered. The film is about the people who fight for reasons that are often beyond them but they are the ones who know the reality of war while most others are completely delusional to it. They simply have no way of knowing since they are not in the midst of it. This thought sets up the films central conflict with Cpl Steiner a battle hard soldier facing the delusions of a medal hungry officer assigned as his new commander.An element of the film that sticks out is its fascinating use of slow motion quick cut sequences. On the surface these seem to accentuate the violence with bursting bloody wounds but they are actually vital to Steiner's perspective. The story as told through his point of view is literally his point of view. As the battle hardened veteran who has survived many battles he is more acute as to what is going on he has a sixth sense of sorts and thus is able to survive. As any great film this element of choreography and editing isn't just for showing off fancy film making technique it is woven into the story itself. The film simply pulls no cheap tricks and is not afraid to show war as a nasty place where men on both sides often die from the same artillery barrage children die both sides brutalize others etc...To top it off James Coburn gives a great lead performance and David Warner who never quite made it to stardom has a great supporting role.  910BsCDb Classification 13  violence".

	schema:reviewBody "REVIEW OF THE REGION 2 DVD FROM STUDIO CANALIn 1976 audiences witnessed John Sturges' entertaining and appealing look at World War II from the German point of view in The Eagle has Landed. A year later Cross of Iron was a released. Sam Peckinpah's venture into the boots of the German soldier is a much more honest downbeat and brutal tale. While The Eagle has Landed is a story of pure heroism Cross of Iron is a depressing take on the horrors of war. This film proves that infantry soldiers are usually just men fighting for survival no matter what uniform they wear.In the spring of 1943 the German Army is on the retreat in Russia. They're low on supplies food and ammunition the Reds are advancing in overwhelming numbers. Enter Prussian aristocrat Captain Stransky Maximilian Schell an ambitious and inexperienced officer who firmly believes in German patriotism and spirit. His superiors Colonel Brandt James Mason and Captain Kiesel David Warner dismiss him as arrogant and disillusioned gradually the true source of his ignorance is revealed to be madness. In contrast is Sergeant Steiner James Coburn the hero of the piece. Steiner will prove that Stransky is an incompetent coward and though Stransky comes to realize this he refuses to admit it. The film follows a series of arguments and conversations regarding class difference as the two men bait each other and grow to hate each other.The conflict between Steiner and Stransky is a microcosm of the war around them. Every one of their encounters is either borne out of or cut off by vicious combat of some sort. How important is Stransky's madness within the greater madness of a World War? From the moment Stransky appears he is the villain. He's freshly shaved and clad in a clean uniform ordering dirty infantrymen to push his luggageladen motorcycle out of a mud hole. His first meeting with Brandt and Kiesel defines his character he jumps when artillery shells burst outside a cramped bunker yet meticulously combs his gelcovered hair as he defies Brandt's opinion that the war has already been lost. We've seen five minutes of film and we've already chalked Stransky up as an arrogant idiot. Unlike typical characters though Stransky's disillusionment grows throughout the piece until a nailbiting climax involving a Russian assault on a rubblestrewn German rail yard the outcome of which is never clearly determined.Steiner and his men are the heroes of this film. They're dirty underfed and fighting for their own survival. Their only loyalty is to each other. The Fatherland and higher callings don't matter  when Stransky has a member of an SS squad transferred to Steiner's unit the Sergeant promptly puts him in his place as a fellow infantryman. The difference between Nazis and ordinary men is drawn with bold unmistakable strokes. Steiner's hate for all officers never appears less than genuine. He considers them to be career soldiers whose only aim is to make war. Kiesel actually makes this point late in the film when Brandt asks him What we will do after the war? to which Kiesel replies Prepare for the next one. Perhaps Steiner's view is unfair but he sees Stransky as inept and in the middle of a retreat Brandt and Kiesel busy themselves with a formal investigation into Stransky's conduct. Perhaps a little more than the stake of the officer corps' reputation is at stake eh? Something a bit more significant like men's lives? Steiner's dedication to his brothersinarms shines through even when he is not in their presence. During an interlude at a hospital he has a hallucination in which he pictures several of the patients as members of his squad. When one of them really does show up he elects to return to combat instead of taking his awarded leave to the Fatherland. His commitment is to his men and only his men.The effects of combat have rarely been portrayed so starkly. The first example comes when Kern Vadim Glowna explodes at his comrades during a birthday party which immediately follows a deadly violent patrol. Later in a quieter moment Kruger Klaus Lowitsch is the lone survivor of a Russian bombardment. Steiner finds him in total shell shock he can't move or let any emotion show through his voice. This scene is stark and moving. Battle sequences are brutal and intense. Peckinpah cuts rapidly from realtime to slowmotion very realistically. Many combat veterans say that time seems to slow down when you're in the midst of a firefight here we see things as a soldier would. Sometimes the handheld camera follows the men right into the trenches at a dizzying pace. At other moments blood squibs and onrushing bodies are slowed incredibly.Peckinpah's film is ultimately a statement about the sheer madness that war is made up of. It's not necessarily antiwar but it is brutally honest and unflinching. One scene set in a Russian shack in which Steiner's squad captures several women prisoners will become engraved in your memory due to its sheer graphic nature. Other lighter moments of soldiers' humor revolving around farting lack of bathing facilities and pure dirty nature of trench warfare are simultaneously hilarious and grim. This is easily one of the most engaging films about warfare ever shot. The North American DVD is to be avoided I highly recommend the UK DVD which contains an uncut widescreen transfer.".

The truth is that 9 out of 10 soldiers in WWII fell in Russia and that Germany and the German army was long defeated at the time the allied troops landed in Normandy. The question of course is why hasn't there been made more movies about the war between Hitler and Stalin ? And the answer is because Hollywood needs bad guys and good guys and the war in Russia was fought between nazis and communists who were all bad or so it seems. Or in other words the truth just is'nt good entertainment!! In the Cross of Iron Sam Peckinpah has made an astonishing honest and realistic movie about what it was like to be in the front line of the bloodiest war of this century  if not ever. And he shows that war at the end of the day never is about the ideologies strategies the generals or even the head of states  in this case Stalin and Hitler  but about ordinary people struggling to survive. The fighting scenes in the movie are just as brilliant as in f.ex. Saving Private Ryan and the story is much better more realistic and without spielbergs obvious flaws. There are no heroes no saints in this movie. The main character is the war and what it does to people. In other words forget The guns of Navarrone Where eagles dare The heroes of the Telemark and all those horrible Hollywood movies about how the English and American saved Europe from Hitler they maybe saved Europe from Stalin  but certainly not from Hitler!!!. Watch the Cross of Iron instead. In my opnioin it is Peckinpah's best and maybe the best war movie ever. 910".

And he shows that war at the end of the day never is about the ideologies strategies the generals or even the head of states  in this case Stalin and Hitler  but about ordinary people struggling to survive. The fighting scenes in the movie are just as brilliant as in f.ex. Saving Private Ryan and the story is much better more realistic and without spielbergs obvious flaws. There are no heroes no saints in this movie. The main character is the war and what it does to people. In other words forget The guns of Navarrone Where eagles dare The heroes of the Telemark and all those horrible Hollywood movies about how the English and American saved Europe from Hitler they maybe saved Europe from Stalin  but certainly not from Hitler!!!. Watch the Cross of Iron instead. In my opnioin it is Peckinpah's best and maybe the best war movie ever. 910";

All the favourite characters are back and this movie takes a interesting spin on its location. The plot is a fast paced actioned packed affair with even better fight sequences than the series.So if you liked the series then this is the desert you deserve.

The rest of the story picks up were the series left off and takes place both our world and Ed's world. The overall plot was fairly good and and the director and writers did good job paying respect for the characters and the series.

Edward has made friends the Alphonse of the Real World who is 19 tall and a rocket builder. They're heading to a carnival and met up with some Gypsies. One of the gypsies is named Noah who can sense that Edward isn't from this world.While the other Alphonse has accomplished more of his alchemy training. And is wearing the same outfit as his brother.Little does Edward know is that the secret society that his dad's been involved with for sometime is planning an invasion in the Alchemy World.You're unable to use alchemy in the real world so they wait for someone from the Alchemy to perform a transmutation circle that'll be a gateway between each worlds.And when that happens it'll be a battle to the finish. The fate of both worlds are in the hands of the Elric Bros.This movie features a lot of familiar characters from the series including alter egos in the real world. Those who like the TV series might like this movie. It has action suspense and it ties up all the loose ends that were left off in the last episode. I really liked this movie. Most people dislike it due to the idea of the story or for containing several CG elements on hard to do animation sequences. It has the same animation and it was done by the same people who did the TV series. I think it's worth checking out for the die hard FMA fans. Those who aren't familiar with the TV series won't like it when you're not sure what is going on.Plus the English dub does do the movie justice thanks to Funimation people who succeeded in bringing the TV show to the US.".

It wasn't bad the animation is good and the story was okay however the plot was severely lacking. After I finished watching the movie my first impression was that someone had made an excellent movie removed a fifth of it and replaced it with fan service. The plot simply does not flow there are a number of instances where plot devices are randomly introduced and just as quickly dropped e.g. the spear of longinus where the story progression seems horribly contrived Ed's conversations with Fritz Langespecially the talk about parallel worlds and where important scenes have simply been removed without compensation most obvious in the opening subplotwhy is Ed wearing that shiny helmet?. My other major gripe is the fan service. A little fan service is OK but this is ridiculous. All of the popular characters from the anime had cameos regardless of whether or not they offered any significant contribution to the story. Rather they are just dropped in for a couple of scenes did their trademark thing and left. This wouldn't be nearly so bad except for the fact that important scenes were probably sacrificed so old favorites could have a minute of screen time.That said the movie is still entertaining. A lot of people disliked the ending and while I don't think it was amazing I believe it was consistent with the anime. My final recommendation if you know nothing of FMA watch the anime which is far superior to the movie. If you've seen all 51 episodes the movie is definitely worth watching if for no other reason than that it significantly progresses the story.".

It gave me a sense of closure I didn't have before about the series. And I liked Noah a lot for some reason am I the only one who noticed that she looked like rose??.910";

It was horrible. I bought a bluray in order to see details in The Sacred Star of Milos. I just liked the animation of background but Ed was weird. His hair was like a jelly. And I wonder the people whoever watch The Sacred Star of Milos and liked it if they can really see or not. Anyway The Sacred Star of Milos was bad. I couldn't feel the soul of FMA. I was thinking about this one. And I saw that everything was great. The story quality of animation and the soul. I recommend everybody to watch. In terms of FMA's atmosphereyou can still feel what you felt before thanks to this the movie. It made me happy in brief.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will say this now  I thoroughly enjoyed the Full Metal Alchemist series. This makes me biased but I think my bias is because it was well written acted and brought to life.I enjoyed The Conqueror of Shamballa for many of the same reasons. The plot is believable yes there was a Thule Society and yes they were into the occult and the characters have additions that would naturally occur over two years.However I felt that while this is the story of the Elric brothers I did feel that Mustang Armstrong Winry et al could have been used a lot more. Eckhart was a decent bad girl she had the prerequisite maniacal laugh when she shoots down Ed and provides plenty of food for thought methinks she and Yoda should have a talk about fear  watch it if you don't know what I mean.The story could have also been explored in more detail. For a 100 minute movie though it did quite well. A longer movie might have allowed more screen time for the minor characters too you could count on two hands the number of lines some of the minor characters including the military ones actually got.I did also like meeting the Earthly equivalent to King Bradley he played a fairly big role including a reflection on the pros and cons of science along with cameos by Lyra and we see how Hughes would have ended up if he had never married Gracia they're getting set up by the end.All in all with good music as always and fairly good animation apart from a few minor lapses it was a very good show. If its the end its a good one and if its one of a series of movies they'll come out with we can always hope D then its going to be a much better addition. Either way we're all the better for it in my opinion.PS  I have watched the English dubbed version I'm not sure how the original Japanese looked so any inaccuracies may be due to the translation.".

The greatness of both anime series is almost beyond words and it's up there on the list with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Gin Tama of top twenty anime series of all time.So why did the ending of the movie leave me unsatisfied and somewhat depressed? Because it was unsatisfying I wonder what the writers were thinking?Well I'm done complaining about the ending now for the positive the story is STILL good in my opinion until the ending and the animation is awesome and seems to improve from the first series please note that this movie is a finale to the first animated series ONLY and is in no way associated with Brotherhood animation. Seeing the characters grown up a bit was neat and the plot revolving around two alternate worlds is always good if it's done right which it was until the ending without being too damn confusing to follow.Now for the basic outline of the story Ed and an alternate world Al are now studying rocket science since in that world alchemy doesn't exist. But then a certain 'nice' lady wants to open up the portal to Ed's original world where alchemy DOES exist to find the legendary ShangriLa opening an opportunity for Ed to get back home.Overall 710.

I guess I expected better reunions and stuff and like some stuff seemed like it was just thrown in there. I didn't like how Al stole Eds original look either. ANd they should have had more of Mustang Winry and some other the other characters. i don't know. And they also used CGI in with the drawing. I personally don't like when they use the computer stuff with the normal anime. If you know what I mean. I didn't like the ending either. Its not the way I would have ended it at least. Ed and Al should have ended up in their side of the gate. And Ed should have ended up with Winry.Its not like super terrible though.

I was excited when I first saw this film back in the day to see how everything ended and it didn't disappoint.All the characters who lived are back and everything is different. The characters are a few years older and more mature. The story does an interesting take on the idea of parallel universes and we get to see alter egos of characters in Ed and Alphonse's world in the real world setting of Europe cira 1925. Ed and Alphonse are separated on both sides of the gate and both are attempting to return to each other. In the midst of all this a fringe group of the Nazis is studying alchemy in an attempt to pass through the gate and conquer the alternate world in order to fuel their supplies for war. It moves at a brisk pace and has great action sequences befitting of FMA. The animation has much better production value than the show although some of the CG used hasn't aged well and makes great use of color for both worlds. The film has a good villain but not as good as in the series. I can't recommend this film to people who haven't seen the show because it requires prior knowledge of the show to understand the events of the film. If you liked the original FMA then you will most likely enjoy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie Conqueror of Shamballa is a 2005 Japanese anime based on the Fullmetal Alchemist series and manga. The movie is a direct followup of the series and gives resolution to many of the conflicts that remained at the end of the show. The story follows Edward Elric a young alchemist stuck in a parallel world and trying to find his way home. Driven to be reunited with his friends and family Edward must face new adversaries who also want to travel to his homeworld but for much more nefarious reasons.This movie is a fan feast with characters brought back from the series along with answering a lot of the questions we were left with at the end of the show. Full of fun action scenes great animation some funny moments and a story with a surprising amount of depth Conqueror of Shamballa is a great movie to top off the series. The story ties into reallife history making the story all the more enjoyable. The movie also ends strong with a very exciting climax.Despite this Conqueror of Shamballa suffers from a common problem with anime melodrama. Overthetop obnoxious personalities occasionally contrast from the serious story line. Another problem with this movie is that it does not stand alone. You must watch the series otherwise you're just seeing the last chapter to another story. This prevents outsiders from enjoying this anime. Also while fun for the most part and having an exciting final act the movie is boring and drags on through the second act.Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie Conqueror of Shamballa is a fun movie overall and a mustwatch for any who enjoyed the series. With a great story and plenty for the fans watching this movie is a perfect way to finish the series. If you have not yet seen the show come back to this anime later. You're meant to know the events from the series and this movie builds on that. The series is excellent and will be well worth your time.".

Driven to be reunited with his friends and family Edward must face new adversaries who also want to travel to his homeworld but for much more nefarious reasons.This movie is a fan feast with characters brought back from the series along with answering a lot of the questions we were left with at the end of the show. Full of fun action scenes great animation some funny moments and a story with a surprising amount of depth Conqueror of Shamballa is a great movie to top off the series. The story ties into reallife history making the story all the more enjoyable. The movie also ends strong with a very exciting climax.Despite this Conqueror of Shamballa suffers from a common problem with anime melodrama. Overthetop obnoxious personalities occasionally contrast from the serious story line. Another problem with this movie is that it does not stand alone. You must watch the series otherwise you're just seeing the last chapter to another story. This prevents outsiders from enjoying this anime. Also while fun for the most part and having an exciting final act the movie is boring and drags on through the second act.Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie Conqueror of Shamballa is a fun movie overall and a mustwatch for any who enjoyed the series. With a great story and plenty for the fans watching this movie is a perfect way to finish the series. If you have not yet seen the show come back to this anime later. You're meant to know the events from the series and this movie builds on that. The series is excellent and will be well worth your time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Before the two anime adaptationsFullmetal Alchemistwas originally a manga Japanese graphic novel written by Hiromu Arakawa and published in Square Enix's monthly magazineShonen Gangan. It was the story of two brothers who used the ancient arts of alchemy to perform a risky taboo to transmute their dead mother to bring her back to life. As a result the younger brother lost his entire body while the older lost his leg. At the last minute the older brother bounded the younger brother's soul to a suit of armor sacrificing his right arm. With the older brother outfitted with artificial limbs made of steel called auto mail they then set out on a journey to find the legendary Philosopher's Stone and use it to get their bodies back to normal.While the manga was still being written an anime series would be produced by Bones and Aniplexwith Arakawa's approval. When it was released internationally in my case being a selection on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block the popularity of the franchise soared and critics took notice with one saying that it was a perfect blend of action comedy and hardhitting drama. They weren't lying in that regard. When the series ended it was not the end of the story so a featurelength movie was produced. This is whereFullmetal Alchemist  The Movie Conqueror of Shamballacomes in.Directed by Seiji Mizushima who also directed a majority of the episodes of the television show the film takes place two years after the events of the last episode of the series. It's 1923 in Munich Germany and since his sacrifice leading to theseparation from his younger brother Alphonse Aaron Dismuke Edward Elric Vic Mignogna has spent his time in our world studying rocketry with his friend Alphons Heiderich E. Jason Liebrecht. One day Ed saves a Gypsy girl who has the power to read minds which throws Ed into a devious plot by the Thule Society and the Nazi party that could start a war between the world he's in and hishome world all while his brother Alphonse sets out on a journey to find his brother at the same time.Going in blind the average moviegoer would barely understand what the hell is going on in this movie if at all. This is why I would say to people when discussing the series as a whole to watch all 51 episodes of the original series before watching this despite being an original story derived from the show according to anime critic Ryusuke Hikawa. As for the movie itself storyaside the film captures the action comedy and drama of the show just fine and also includes the show's musical score blending with tracks made for the movie. As someone who is a fan of the franchise I can say that it's a definite plus. The downside is that the film is geared toward a limited audience. Again if you haven't watched the entire series the original not Brotherhood pretty much all of the movie won't make a lick of sense.While I do agree thatFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhoodis a much better work with a superior ending the original series and the movie itself is actually not too bad either. I kinda like it and would give it a recommendation to fans of the series. Is it the best ending they could come up with? No. But it'll suffice.".

Personally I am having a hard time seeing why anyone would dislike it that much.I consider it far superior to The Sacred Star of Milos as it manages to keep the feel of Fullmetal Alchemist despite mostly taking place in our world. It's not a perfect movie for example the antagonist leaves a lot to be desired and the CGI is at times quite annoying but highly entertaining. It also works very well on an emotional level with the characters from the mangaanime undergoing both physical and spiritual journeys. The filmmakers weren't afraid of making difficult choices and the end result is a gorgeous film that certainly satisfied my desire for further Elric adventures.I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed either of the two anime series or the manga.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are massive spoilers ahead for the show if you haven't seen it  I would suggest watching it it's probably the first 1010 I've given a show in years I'll also say you probably will be extremely lost in this review regardless. Well if you're like me and thought the ending of after about 15 hours of the show ended terribly with Alphonse looking for a way to bring his brother back from beyond the gate learning nothing from his entire experiences on the show because they wiped his memories and having one of the best sibling relationships ever conveyed in a TV Show ending with them separated across worlds and Edward still having a prosthetic leg and arm that looks too advanced for the technology back then and asking no questions about it at all among many other things. Here this is the ending for those that pretty much said WHAT THE FCK!!!!! to it I'll say the ending in general is passable but underwhelming.Edward casually tells our world's version of Alphonse I'll get to that later about his exploits across the gate and ensures that yes it was where he came from. When going to a carnival Edward saves a psychic gypsy from the evergrowing Nazi's but the Nazi's go fullon comic book supervillain when they decide to walk through to the world Edward is from to conquer it and bring back whatever weaponry they have so the Nazi's can take over the world. Meanwhile Alphonse as in Edward's brother is a trained alchemist looking for a way to get through to the other side of the gate to get Edward back.Okay the story is very convoluted and... well dare I say terrible? I'd say this is passable if you're a fan of the show but if you haven't seen the hours and hours and hours of the 2003 show beforehand this would be about as easy to follow as a moth in a snowstorm. I'll also say that the whole other versions of the same character in the show popping up makes no sense to me. It just seems like service to the fans to say Hughes is in this and so is Edward and Al's mom Alphonse and pretty much every character that dies makes an appearance in this movie. I'll say seeing the relatively minor characters make an appearance is very good because it gives a much better moment of closure than the show did. I also might not call the real world counterparts service to the fans because the dead characters seemingly have the opposite personalities that are in the show and they do NOTHING with it! And while I'm on the subject I don't really like the new ending of They're in pre WWII Germany hanging out with gypsies but at least they're together... To me that is not satisfying.Onto the compliments the animation is much better here than at any other point in the show it looks so good. The same with the voice acting as well it's basically top notch. I'll also say if you are a fan of the show like I am than there are moments of drama in here that work so well. I love the scene where Edward says he has to pilot the Nazizombie spaceships no... really I said I don't like this movie's plot! back through to the real world and destroy the portal from that side is really well done seeing Alphonse's reaction to it. If you think too hard about scenes like that however it doesn't really work especially considering Edward was the only one who could open the damn portal from that side! Whoops!.So... If you're a fan of the show this is a step down. I will say because of my love for the show and it ending in a way that was less awful than the show itself it's a guilty pleasure of mine. I am glad I saw it but hearing the fan community be polarized on this movie is hardly surprising to me. I can see why some people don't like it but for me I actually do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fullmetal Alchemist is one of my favourite manga series of all time written and drawn by the brilliant Arakawa Hiromu and published monthly in Shonen Gan Gan. So I was expecting the movie to make up for the lacklustre morbid anime series. Unfortunately my expectations were not met.The movie picks up where the anime left off with Edward trapped in postWorld War II Germany. He's found an alternate version of his younger brother Alphonse and is staying with him in his flat. Around this city are several other lookalikes including alternate versions of Fuhrer King Bradley Maes Hughes and Hughes's wife Gracia.So far as I could tell Alternate King Bradley is searching for a dragon so he can help his crazy Riza Hawkeyelooking employer open the gate to Edward's world and that's about where the plot seemed to disappear. From there onwards the movie seems to get itself muddled in complicated dialogue and poetical nonsensical statements as well as the depressingly large number of plot holes. The ending in particular annoyed me Edward Elric's choice to return to Germany abandoning his girl Winry seems so completely out of character and a pointless gesture of idiocy to boot. As well as the bit about Al somehow appearing on the other sidethe half of the ship he was standing on fell to the bloody earth! There was no WAY he could have jumped that gap not without Edward noticing. Important secondary characters such as Riza Hawkeye and even other main characters such as Roy Mustang are pushed into the background treated more as props to try to support the sagging plot line of the movie.On the plus side the fight scene between Gluttony and Wrath is rather enjoyable if gory as well as Armstrong's shenanigans in Lior. Even if the plot is hackneyed and mildly confusing at least the meaning in the movie is fairly obvious humans fear what they cannot control. The lady who opened the gate feared Edward's alchemical world because she didn't understand it. Also the animation is very well done as well as the voice acting in the Japanese version anyways and the music composed by Michiru Oshima is undeniably beautiful.Overall it's worth tracking down a copy of Shamballa if you enjoyed either the anime or the manga just to say you've seen it. I wouldn't buy it but I'd at least borrow a copy from a friend.".

Also the animation is very well done as well as the voice acting in the Japanese version anyways and the music composed by Michiru Oshima is undeniably beautiful.Overall it's worth tracking down a copy of Shamballa if you enjoyed either the anime or the manga just to say you've seen it. I wouldn't buy it but I'd at least borrow a copy from a friend.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hitler the Last Ten Days is beyond doubt the best movie ever made about Adolf Hitler's final days. The sets uniforms and script are exceedingly accurate. I could find only two flaws regarding uniforms. Even the actors bore a remarkable resemblance to the characters they portrayed. I was somewhat disappointed with the casting of Doris Kunstmann as Eva Braun. Doris is far too beautiful. Britt Ekland would have been a much better choice. The exterior scenes being shot in black and white accentuated the graphic realism outside the bunker as opposed to the color shots of the madness within. Most of the script is based on the writings of Rittmeister Gerhard Boldt portrayed by Simon Ward as Hauptmann Hoffman. Boldt left the bunker just shortly before Hitler's suicide. The research done for the construction of the sets must have been awesome. Even an old cement mixer viewed in wartime photos is present. The bare concrete walls and luxurious furnishings cast a stark reality of the bunker interior. Regarding performances Alec Guinness is of course commanding as Hitler. He clearly shows he is concerned about nothing except his place in history and how many followers he can convince to follow his lead of suicide as opposed to surrender. All the other roles except Eva Braun's are minor as they should be. Goebbels comes across as the eternal lackey who would rather his children die than live in a world without Hitler. Bormann's sole concern is consolidating power in the Reich that is soon to be no more. The Generals follow orders as they have for years and quarrel amongst themselves about who should break the latest bad news to the Fuehrer. All in all the film is quite entertaining and will definitely hold the attention of any history buff.".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one approach the towering figure of Adolf Hitler a figure so outsized in his cruelty so colossal in his infamy that it staggers the imagination to conceive that he actually lived and breathed? Yet he was as human as you and I and gifted with some of the virtues and most of the flaws that flesh is heir to. One could examine him from a historical psychological or sociological perspective. Taking a position on Hitler's moral character is not difficult he was the embodiment of evil. But did he have greatness as well? His nemesis Winston Churchill offered this assessment If evil can be great we cannot deny him greatness. He certainly had genius. Not as a painter as he probably wished. His genius lay elsewhere. He was probably the greatest actor of the twentiethcentury who used first Germany and then the World as his stage mesmerizing it with performances of such messianic passion that he transported his audiences away with him to some unattainable inner Valhalla of their own making. Watching one of his performancesI call his speeches performancesbecause it was not what he said but how he said it that was extraordinary one is immediately struck by how well thought out and structured they were with every gesture and movement of the body orchestrated to give meaning to the the torrent of words pouring forth.Hitler has been well served in cinema. As an enthusiastic cineaste and certifiable egomaniac he probably would not have been pleased by the portrayals. He likely would have viewed himself as a tragic hero or worse a misunderstood martyr. He would never have understood that his crimes were too heinous and numerous for cinema to depict him in that light. Some notable interpretations of Der Fuhrer have been Charles Chaplin The Great Dictator 1940 Ludwig Donath The Strange Death of Adolf Hitler 1943 Luther Adler The Desert Fox 1951 Albin Skoda The Last Ten Days 1955 Richard Basehart Hitler 1962 Billy Frick Is Paris Burning? 1966 Frank Finlay The Death of Adolf Hitler 1973 Alec Guinness Hitler The Last Ten Days 1973 Ian Bannen The Gathering Storm 1974 Anthony Hopkins The Bunker 1981 Derek Jacobi Inside The Third Reich 1982 Norman Rodway The Empty Mirror 1996 Noah Taylor as a young Hitler in Max 2002 Robert Carlyle Hitler The Rise of Evil 2003 Bruno Ganz Der Untergang 2004. All of these actor have illuminated aspects of the man's complex personality so in many ways the performer we like best as Hitler is the one who best captures those qualities we associate with the man. Alec Guinness best captured my view of Hitler as performing artist. The bunker was his stage and his entourage his last captive audience for his final most terrible performance the initiator of Gotterdammerung. It is an impressive acting turn by Guinness because the script does not allow him to indulge in any great histrionic oration. Instead he brings all the vanity and egocentricity of a frustrated actor desperately needing the approbation of his audiencehowever small. Whether launching into a monologue about the great old days of his rise to power or haranguing his generals to will their way to victory that need for approval to be the center of attention is like a spoiled child who is never satisfied with the love and attention he receives can never fill the gaping void that is the core of his existence.Guinness who made a career both on stage and film portraying little men illuminates beautifully the inner life of the man capturing Hitler's pettiness of spirit and essential provincialism. A wonderful example of this is the scene where Hitler having decided to kill himself and have his body burned smugly tells Goebbels who has decided to do the same that there may not be enough petrol because he is hoarding all of it for himself all the while spreading gobs of cream on his chocolate cake like a little boy satisfying his sweet tooth. This is for the most part a quieter Hitler than previous shown and with one notable exception mercifully free from the usual hysterics and ravings that have long since become clich. At the same time Guinness manages to capture the drugridden blearyeyed broken exdictator shuffling his way to the grave. One could almost feel pity for this creature if only he himself were not so pitiless. Even at the end he is the eternal actor never comfortable with being himself always assuming a new role in order to define not only himself but his relationship to others. Whether playing the charismatic father figure to a still believing Captain Hoffman Simon Ward the sly old matchmaker between General Von Greim Eric Porter and Hanna Reitsch Diane Cilento the betrayed friend and mentor when he hears of Himmler's attempts to negotiated a truce with the allies or justifying his barbarity Nature is cruel so I too must be cruel! to his final penultimate audience Eva Baum just before they commit suicide Guinness keeps this Hitler even with his monstrous ego intensely and uncomfortably human. And with his uncanny chameleon like ability he easily incorporates the man's gestures and mannerisms without ever slipping into caricature. Guinnes always considered his portrayal of Hitler to be among his five greatest film performances and it wouldn't be until he played William Dorrit in Little Dorrit 1988 would he have another film role that would challenge his abilities as an actor.".

Derek Jacoby and Anthony Hopkins come no where close to this in their respective films Inside The Third Reich and The Bunker. This is like a color camera capturing Hitler speaking in English. It is frightening yet has touches of humor especially when the announcement of Hitlers death is made to the other residents of the bunker you see a pretty blond woman reach for her small case containing cyanide capsules and cigarettes. She chooses the cigarettes and she and everyone else in the room light up. The most memorable line in the film is Hitler trying to conjure up some of the old charismatic magic of the past addressing a young captain played by Simon Ward. The Gods give their love only to those who demand the impossible. Mankind is ruled by will by determination. When the will is thrust by genius it generates a force which throughout history has proved irresistible".

The use of black  white archive footage intercut with the bunker footage is well done. The casting of Sir Alec Guinness was the first mistake. For once it would be nice to see a German actor portray a German character. The Hitler anger and rage scenes were an obvious copy of all the mannerisms Hitler used when making his public speeches. To me this great Shakespearean actor could not find the right combination of voice and gestures to bring off the explosive temper of der Fuhrer. I did see a much more refined style for the quiet interior thought moments of Hitler by Sir Alec. The casting was all over the place. Especially glaring was Adolfo Celi a Bond villain as a German general with an Italian accent. The tradition of casting British actors as Nazis should have been maintained throughout this film. The handsome amazing profile Simon Ward was also a total waste as his character arch from Hitler worshiper to disgruntled Nazi was hollow. The military conference scenes did shed some light on how cowardly the German High Command staff was in their inability to confront Hitler about his disastrous military decisions. The only thing to remember about this long forgotten project is that England's greatest actor should never accept a role where he has to mime the world's greatest villain.".

The claustrophobic environment coupled with the impending doom of the oncoming Russians especially when hell's rain can be heard above from inside the bunker gives us more than a fair idea of what was going through the minds of those in a way imprisoned below. There were fine actors in it and of course Sir Alec Guinness's portrayal of Hitler is excellent. At times though it seemed there were elements of comedy in his portrayal but it could be said it was almost showing a kind of sympathetic playing in the sense of a man who has wronged but feels wronged himself. By Germany and the Germans more than the allies.When 'Der Fuhrer' is mouthing off deluding himself everything is okay when clearly it's not there are added documentary footage pieces of WW2 BerlinGermanyBattlefieldsNazi atrocities contradicting his very words to emphasise his colossal delusions.The fine actors in it carry this through very effectively right up to its predictable and factual conclusion. However it is meant to portray the end of the Reich and Hitler himself some questions other than the dialogue that may have been recorded leave us to 'suppose' what MAY have been said. For example it was known that Eva Braun was totally dedicated to Hitler but leading up to the couple's suicide she is seen questioning his motives basically as if they were worth it then at this topping herself. Noone other than Hitler and Eva were present at their point of suicide history has had us believe. There again there's always licence so to pick on this film for that would be unfair.The last time I saw this on TVUK was in 1985 at a kind of celebration of forty years since the end of WW2.

	schema:reviewBody "Not particularly cinematic but still fairly arresting thanks to Alec Guinness's riveting performance in the title role. Guinness's interpretation of Hitler portrays him as both a doddering old coot AND a paranoid lunatic. He's pretty scary. Director Ennio de Concini juxtaposes the outr goings on in Hitler's bunker with newsreel footage of Germany's decimation at the hands of allied forces. The dialog is at times comical Hitler discussing the obesity problem of German music stars and at times creepy Hitler ordering the flooding of German subway tunnels being used as a makeshift hospital by injured German soldiers. Guinness is great and is supported by many fine character actors including Adolfo Celi Simon Ward and Eric Porter. Doris Kunstmann makes an appropriately bourgeois Eva Braun and in a cameo Diana Cilento plays a resourceful flying ace. The chilling music score is by Mischa Spoliansky.".

	schema:headline " the world's greatest evildoer";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems only fitting that Sir Alec Guinness the world's greatest actor was chosen to play Adolf Hitler the world's greatest evildoer. Although Hitler was only fifty six when he died he managed in those 56 years to do more evil than the rest of humanity has in 200000 years or however long we've been on the planet. This movie has moments of absurdist black comedy worthy of Samuel Beckettindeed Hitler in his bunker was probably the inspiration for the mad tyrant Hamm in Beckett's Endgame who also lived in an underground bunker. The frequent playing of Johann Strauss's jaunty Fledermaus overture provides ironic comment on the on screen action. Guinness was at a low point in his career when this film was madehis glory days of the 1940s and 1950s were long gone and his comeback role as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars was still in the futurebut he gives a commanding performance and is never less than believable as the mad dictator. The mostly ItalianBritish cast has a number of interesting performances particularly Adolfo Celi Number One in Thunderball as General Krebs the one relatively sane person in the bunker and Diane Cilento as the female aviator Hanna Reich who is clearly in love with Hitler and jealous of Eva Braun the lovely Doris Kunstmann. Excellent as history lesson and entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen this movie a long long long time ago on TV with commercials so when I saw it recently on DVD it was totally new. I've seen the Ganz version Der Untergang and recently also saw the Hopkins version The Bunker this one is still my favorite. Is it the closest to what happened in all it's minutia? Who knows probably not since the Simon Ward character is fictional and I don't think the other two mentioned films had used fictional characters I don't know why that was necessary the Hopkins and Ganz versions both had low level Officers as part of their stories but they were based on real people. Despite it not being loved by historical purists I do like the characterization of Hitler by Guinness Ganz portrayal is way to likable and Hopkins is hard to understand when he goes on his rages Guinness is not likable he's totally wacko and thats the way I want to remember this madman as. Production values are to me high end it was a first class production. Things I did not remember but really liked when watching this the Wagner music was great and it has some really funny lines from Guinness's Hitler as he speaks to his captive audience of worshipers along the lines of I paraphrase Germany will be truly great when Wagner is performed by an all German cast totally naked! lol. There are a few pretty funny scenes that had to be put in there to show his madness and bewilderment and it works great for me. All three of these films I mentioned are worth watching I like this one the best for the reasons stated and also that it didn't focus so much time on Goebells that the others do. I think Goebells is shown a lot in other versions to show how sick these people were but in this version all you need is Adolf to despise the whole group. The Ganz version is good to watch if you want the tiny details but it seems like it pulls punches which leads me to think there is some lingering sympathy in Germany for Hitler also that it is rated in the top 100 films of all time there are some real Hitler lovers somewhere. The HBO version is also good to see because it focuses a lot on the others in the bunker and also spans the whole time Hitler was in the bunker which was like 4 months so we see a lot of transformation going on. If your a buff of WW2 history you will definitely enjoy this film highly recommended. As Max Bialystock from the 1968 film The Producers says That's Our Hitler!. 10 of 10.".

For people of the Third Reich British English seems a bit out of tune.Aside from that fact then the movie is entertaining and it does hold some pretty good performances by the actors hired for the various roles. Needless to say that Sir Alec Guiness is the one doing the most of the lifting in the movie with his performance.There were some nice touches to the details such as the uniforms and such.If you are looking for a actionpacked World War II movie then Hitler The Last Ten Days is not the best of choices as there literally is no action here. This is a storybased movie that only takes place in the command bunker in Berlin from where Hitler ruled supreme and saw his vision of a Third Reich crumble up until he took his own life. Hitler The Last Ten Days offers more of an insight into the person who was Hitler and into his utopian visions of one Reich.The dialog in the movie is quite good as is supposed to be rather historical accurate if so then that is impressive. But again the British accent just completely threw the movie off course and down a notch in entertainment value. But for a 1973 movie Hitler The Last Ten Days did quite well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alec Guinness's eerie performance as Hitler centers a deeply ironic if sloppy look at the Fhrer's final hours in his bunker. It's not the film one needs to see for that story 2004's German film Downfall stands supreme but it scores some points with a terrific cast and weird bits of black humor.It's April 1945 and the Russians are closing in on the Third Reich. Once proclaimed to last 1000 years it now appears unlikely to survive the month. As the curtain falls around him a frustrated Hitler alternates between tirades and tea breaks even getting married to the hopelessly devoted Eva Braun Doris Kunstmann.At the outset we hear Josef Goebbels proclaim Hitler the only man worthy of Germany's tragic grandeur. Guinness's Hitler indeed seems all too content to accept this mantle preferring to die as long as he isn't alone. He even hands out cyanide pills to his underlings as little gifts to speed them on their doom. The point of Ennio De Concini's film with the aid of newsreel footage is to show how cowardly these acts really were. Many Germans in 1945 suffered far worse fates for Hitler's mad folly then expiring at a time of their own choosing over cream and cakes.The newsreel sequences which roll in and out to counterpoint the hollowness in Hitler's claims push entirely too hard at this point. There's also a major subplot about a young officer named Hoffmann Simon Ward who grows disillusioned with the Fhrer which doesn't gel into anything interesting as we never see what pushes him to lose his faith. Ward looks alternately supercilious and wooden clearly at a loss as his character is given little to do.The film scores best with small moments like an early occasion when Hitler accepts birthday greetings from his staff with hard stares at each man in turn or later on when Eva leads a ridiculously merry singsong in blackface. Kunstmann gives a solid if ahistorically spirited performance. Eva really loves the guy but you can see her discomfort as Hitler brags about being unmarried and explains Love and devotion to a man are the highest virtues of a woman. Intelligence is not very important.Guinness studied Hitler the speechgiver and it shows at times like when he denounces his SS commander Himmler in a loud voice pressing his hand to his heart a la Triumph Of The Will. By 1945 one suspects such grand gestures were beyond this druggedout mental case. It's fun to watch a great actor cut loose though however historically inaccurate he may be. Guinness was rarely so outr perhaps only more as Fagin in Oliver Twist and he's fun to watch as he apparently thought so too. His resemblance to the real Hitler is startling however off his performance may sometimes be.The rest of the cast is quite something too. I counted two James Bond villains Bond's fatherinlaw Sean Connery's exwife Grady from The Shining and even Manuel from Fawlty Towers. Adolfo Celi as Krebs even has the same guy dubbing him here who did his Largo voice in Thunderball. All do fine work and De Concini blends them together well even if their scenes lack the intensity or realism of Downfall. It's hard to fault Last Ten Days for this too much as they were there first but nothing Guinness does here will make you forget Bruno Ganz in the later film.In the end the film's message seems to be that Hitler was a bad bad guy. As a moral point that's fine but dramatically you need something more. The Last Days delivers something of interest it's a film of texture and craft but it fails to rise to the grand scope of the history it presents.".

Guinness brings his legendary acting prowess to the character. It's not the most thrilling story especially since the ending is inevitable. It's a methodical telling. It is the performance that holds it all together.";

Unfortunately this oversimplified formula is applied here and takes the subjective high ground. This is most obvious in the 21st century where Hitler's antismoking policy is hyped. An analysis of this from a 1973based perspective shows an arrogant selfindulgent dictator imposing his own killjoy whims on those imprisoned in his presence. On the other hand what we see now is a toplevel politician banning smoking in a very small portion of all government offices. No one is to blame for playing on dated values however this does highlight the subjectivity and specious moral judgments being made.In fact there is also a good deal of realism. Real historical events are referenced and Hitler's real attitudes towards certain individuals and groups are also demonstrated. But they are tacked on to the unconvincing drama.However if you did like this movie you probably won't like The Bunker 1981 with Anthony Hopkins. It's much more even in it's portrayal of history's easiest portrayable villain if you don't mind Goebbels sounding like he's from... what New York?".

And who can forget how they are saved from friendly fire at the climax of the film.Operation Petticoat was one of the biggest commercial and critical hits that Cary Grant had in Hollywood. Coming right after North By Northwest it could well be argued this was the high point of his career.The film holds up very well today I think today's audience would laugh just as hard as they did in 1959.".

But the merits are considerably more than reviewers originally gave credit for and the film endures as a cleverly crafted entertainment on several levels.  Its uncomplicated premise accommodates humor less derived from incident than from character and situation making it seem far less pretentious than most films of its kind.  Service comedies of this period tend to follow a pattern set by MR. ROBERTS which was based on a hugely successful stage play and quite reverent to those origins. PETTICOAT is far more spontaneous so even if plot threads tend to be a bit familiar its the delivery rather than the content which holds our attention.  Of course it doesn't hurt to have Cary Grant at the peak of his powers hitting all the right notes balancing the role of naval officer with innate dedication combined with his own charismatic charm and seemingly effortless humor a performance which is both naturalistic and funny.  Curtis too had found his groove at this point he had just completed his tour de force for Billy Wilder SOME LIKE IT HOT contributing just the right balance of ingenuousness and starofthemonth savvy to make his second banana' role a success.  But the lion's share of the credit must go to Blake Edwards then in the early stages of his most successful period as a master comedy craftsman boisterous yet sophisticated among the last of a breed of Hollywood stylists on the rise at a time when the old studio system was nearing its end.".

Having grown up in a neighborhood called Noah's Ark you traveled in pairs or you just didn't travel our Lt. Holden is an accomplished backalley maneuverer who joined the Navy for the prestige of the uniform and what it can get him in particular a certain Miss Super Chief. Alas having secured for himself a cushy job as an admiral's aid sent ahead to Manila to prepare for his admiral's later arrival the sudden outbreak of the war results in the cancellation of the admiral's transfer and all Mr. Holden's carefully manipulated plans are sent completely awry. Thus being at loose ends he finds himself assigned as a replacement officer to the SEA TIGER. Faced with the alternative of being stuck on Bataan to endure the oncoming Japanese conquest he sees it is in his best interest to make up for the seagoing experience he has managed to avoid up to this point in his naval career by becoming the boat's Supply Officer and securing everything the captain needs to get the . . . submarine out of there and to someplace where he can get a better deal. Although thoroughly uncomfortable with this new addition to the wardroom of his ship Captain Sherman is so solidly dedicated to his responsibilities as the boat's commander that he is willing to make a pact with the Devil to get her going again and so Lt. Holden allied with his handpicked detail of scavengers  Seaman Hunkle Gavin McLeod a sailor only known as The Prophet of Doom and of course the trusty or at least reliable and punctilious marine Sergeant Ramon Gallardo there isn't a burglar swindler pickpocket or fence in the islands that doesn't know love and respect him  commences a supply procurement program which might most charitably be characterized as unorthodox  or less charitably as just plain felonious. But he really hits his high point when he manages to scavenge five stranded Army nurses and convince the captain that he has to take them aboard. From then on the film becomes Cary Grant's battle to get his groaning belching backfiring spitandbailingwirepatched submarine safely to Australia while avoiding any exchange of information concerning the facts of life between the crew and their guests. His struggle is complicated all the more by his continual personal encounters with the almost terminally accidentprone but especially wellendowed young nurse Dolores Crandall in the words of the Chief of the Boat Malumphry  if you wanna know what you're fightin' for  there's your answer who for all her blunders unintentionally winds up saving the boat and all aboard. As if to highlight the unconventionality of their situation along the way they manage to wind up with the vessel painted pink don't ask me how  just try to believe I actually saw a performance nearly identical to Malumphry's in reaction to a similar problem aboard a reallife nuclear ballistic missile submarine around 1980 have to set up a maternity ward complete with goat the children will need fresh milk and accomplish the unique induction of Seaman Hornsby into his brief but flavorful naval career. The plot is actually developed in the form of a flashback from about 1960 allowing it to end with a slightly sentimental and amusing bit of a twist. Clean and wholesome while still being thoroughly adult when a man is tired and irritable you can be sure there's one thing he's not getting enough of  vitamins and minerals you can watch this one with your kids  maybe even after they've reached their cynical adolescent years.Note the use of the brackets  above in place of the stylistically correct square brackets was made necessary by some IMDb format change that made use of the correct brackets impossible. Hopefully they will not eliminate other commonly used symbols in future updates simply because the people they employ never got better than a C in junior high school English class and don't know what they are for.".

From then on the film becomes Cary Grant's battle to get his groaning belching backfiring spitandbailingwirepatched submarine safely to Australia while avoiding any exchange of information concerning the facts of life between the crew and their guests. His struggle is complicated all the more by his continual personal encounters with the almost terminally accidentprone but especially wellendowed young nurse Dolores Crandall in the words of the Chief of the Boat Malumphry  if you wanna know what you're fightin' for  there's your answer who for all her blunders unintentionally winds up saving the boat and all aboard. As if to highlight the unconventionality of their situation along the way they manage to wind up with the vessel painted pink don't ask me how  just try to believe I actually saw a performance nearly identical to Malumphry's in reaction to a similar problem aboard a reallife nuclear ballistic missile submarine around 1980 have to set up a maternity ward complete with goat the children will need fresh milk and accomplish the unique induction of Seaman Hornsby into his brief but flavorful naval career. The plot is actually developed in the form of a flashback from about 1960 allowing it to end with a slightly sentimental and amusing bit of a twist. Clean and wholesome while still being thoroughly adult when a man is tired and irritable you can be sure there's one thing he's not getting enough of  vitamins and minerals you can watch this one with your kids  maybe even after they've reached their cynical adolescent years.Note the use of the brackets  above in place of the stylistically correct square brackets was made necessary by some IMDb format change that made use of the correct brackets impossible. Hopefully they will not eliminate other commonly used symbols in future updates simply because the people they employ never got better than a C in junior high school English class and don't know what they are for.";

They are joined by a group of army nurses such as Nurse Barbara performed by Dina Merrill and Nurse Crandall played by Joan O'Brien  though Tina Louise was offered but turned down the role whose lingerie is put to some unusual uses and the gags begin .Agreeable comedy set in Pacific Ocean during WWII with plenty of humor laughters  tongueincheek and results to be pretty funny  though some jokes may be considered sexist these days . Topnotch performance by two masters of comedy  as Gary Grant was his hero in the genre and likable acting by Tony Curtis as a conman executive officer . Great teamwork from Grant and Curtis keep things rolling . The whole film is a happy and at times comic vehicle for its wonderful stars . However  Grant himself was at first reluctant to take his role  knowing he was much too old to play a wartime captain . Some of the plot points of the movie were based on reallife incidents . Most notable were scenes set at the opening of WW II based on the actual sinking of the submarine USS Sealion  sunk at the pier at Cavite Navy Yard the Philippines  Cmdr.

	schema:reviewBody "Operation Petticoat is yet another military farce directed by Blake Edwards. It is in pretty much the same military farce style that he used in other movies such as Operation Mad Ball and What Did You Do In The War Daddy? He makes a thing as horrific and serious as the concept of war and transforms it into something quite witty and jocose. Blake does this without causing any offense however and therefore he did it well. Basically the movie has an astonishing likeness to Down Periscope or I should say that Down Periscope has a peculiar likeness to this movie. In essence a naval submarine commander is given command over a broken down sub and a motley ragtag crew. The most rowdy crew member however is the supply officer Lt. Holden. He displays a blatant disregard for rules and yet still portrays as likable. Even more surprising is the fact that somehow despite his various behaviors Holden manages to get the job done and have some fun along the way.The commander encounters various obstacles because of his supply officer but nothing that isn't purely entertaining. The commander is portrayed by Cary Grant and Holden is played by Tony Curtis. Both Grant and Curtis do a fantastic job in this film and play off of one another quite well. Grant as you know is an amazing actor and has been in many classics like Arsenic and Old Lace An Affair to Remember North by Northwest Only Angels Have Wings To Catch A Thief and The Bishop's Wife just to name a few. This is a classic Grant performance his style predictable yet this litany is somehow appealing. Tony Curtis is also one of my favorite actors at least in his older films. As of late Curtis' movies have been losing a lot of their former luster. It's only one more reason that this lighthearted movie is enjoyable seeing Curtis in one of his finer performances. I would put it right up there with his performances in movies such as Houdini Spartacus Some Like it Hot not to mention the Boston Strangler and Six Bridges to Cross. In some of their finer performances Curtis and Grant dominate the film with their clever acting. However the acting aside from Curtis and Grant was actually good not specifically notable but never was there a moment in which I was aware of bad acting. The only small exception was in some of the dialogue referring to women in which the lines were rather clich for war movies. Also aside from the actors and directors of course the camera work is as fine quality as it could have been. The musical score fit perfectly in with the style of the movie and writing was well done on the parts of the writers especially Maurice Richlin who has worked with Blake on quite a few of his productions including some of the Pink Panther movies as well as the aforementioned Daddy What Did You Do In The War? The situations that the writers came up with for a war scenario are ridiculous but very entertaining. Overall this is a higher quality film and noteworthy in the long run. Despite this it certainly was not amazing by any means. This movie in the end was a very appealing satirical and splendid production. A movie which is definitely worth a view but not important to have seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cute and amusing. Cary Grant is the skipper of a submarine stuck in a remote Phillipine base at the beginning of World War II. Damaged in an air attack the submarine barely gets under way with Tony Curtis as a dapper lastminute replacement who shows up for duty in natty and immaculate dress whites. Curtis is a born social climber. He is also however a born thief and Grant appoints him Supply Officer for the boat.In some funny scenes accompanied by some clever dialog Curtis manages to steal enough supplies from various depots to keep the boat going. He also steals such luxuries as toilet paper and a pig for a New Year's luau. At one such wayside stop he manages to pick up five stranded Army nurses one of them being the hypermastic Joan O'Brian.You can pretty much predict the gags that will follow  five beautiful women aboard a submarine with a crew of horny young men. The men make a point of squeezing past O'Brian in the narrow passageways at every opportunity. The Chief Motor Mac improvises a piece of machinery out of somebody's girdle. Curtis gives up his dream of marrying his rich girl friend back in the states when he falls for the elegant blond Dina Merril who in real life probably had a fatter portfolio than Curtis's fictional girl friend. Cary Grant falls for O'Brian and after the war we see both couples now friends with Grant an admiral and Curtis the skipper of the submarine a dedicated navy man.Some of the jokes now seem dated the current Zeitgeist being what it is. An officer showing the nurses around the boat is embarrassed and stutters fiercely while trying to tell them that the loo is called the head. On the whole though the film is disarming enough to be pretty funny. Grant is fine in this light comedy. He grumbles a good deal at the disorder brought to his command as if practicing for his later Father Goose but he's done this so often that he could have done it all in his sleep. Tony Curtis is often criticized for his mannerisms but I don't know why. He's very good indeed at this sort of thing. He knows how to deliver a gag line without dwelling on it almost running over it so that if it's a clunker the viewer hardly notices. He's convincing in expository dialog as well and usually brings something fresh to his lines. He could do drama too and better than Grant.The submarine winds up being painted pink. It is attacked by an American destroyer DD 568 which should be USS Wren and Grant desperately sends up the nurses' underwear. The destroyer picks up some of the debris and the captain holds Joan O'Brian's brassiere up staring at the capacious thing and mutters The Japanese have nothing like this. You may or may not think you'll get a kick out of it but you probably will.".

This movie is a perfect illustration of the notion that funny and filthy are not necessarily synonymous.

The writers have produced a script that is funny without pandering to the lowest common denominator. The humor is a cut above but easily understood by most viewers. Other viewers have rightly praised Cary Grant's and Tony Curtis' performances. However there are some other gems not the least of which is Arthur O'Connell as the machinist's mate.

	schema:reviewBody "Operation Petticoat brings Tony Curtis and his idol Cary Grant together for a very funny film directed by Blake Edwards. Curtis of course does a great Cary Grant impression in Some Like it Hot and working with Grant was a dream come true for the 34yearold actor. And nothing about the experience disappointed him or the audience. The film also features Dina Merrill Gene Evans Dick Sargent Arthur O'Connell Madelyn Rhue Virginia Gregg and Marion Ross.The film is shown in flashback as the submarine Sea Tiger is about to be junked. Grant as Lt. Cmdr. Matt Sherman looks at his log book and reminisces to a time when he was trying to get the Sea Tiger back into the war after his sub is nearly destroyed in an air raid. However it is next to impossible to get supplies. Assigned as a replacement officer to the Sea Tiger is one Mr. Holden Curtis a wheelerdealer who got into uniform so he could meet the right people. Though he maneuvered a country club job as an aide to an admiral planning to go to Manila the war intervened and the admiral cancels his plans. Holden gets the Sea Tiger assignment. He promises that he can get supplies and presents one of his band of merry men Ramon Gallardo a prisoner whom he promises can travel on the sub. But he's a Marine Sherman objects. There isn't a thief pickpocket or fence in the islands that doesn't know love and respect him Holden answers. Holden gets supplies by any means necessary including taking pipes from the bathrooms part of the major's office wall etc. He also manages to rescue five nurses who were stranded on an island disrupting the entire sub. Though he finally confines Holden to quarters Sherman realizes soon enough that if you can't beat 'em join 'em and calls on Holden for help again.Operation Petticoat has some hilarious moments including Holden's stealing of a pig for New Year's dinner and the subsequent confrontation with the owner and military police on the sub where Sherman and Holden refer to the pig as Hornsby. Unable to get the right color paint the sub is painted pink and nearly bombed by a U.S. ship.Cary Grant is wonderful as the commander authoritative and then authoritative but frazzled as he is haunted by one of the nurses a Jonah Joan O'Brien who causes disaster for him whenever she shows up. Tony Curtis is equally good and he does not play the role for comedy rather he has the comedy come out of the character  a former street kid ambitious to marry money with his own agenda in the Navy.The rest of the cast is very good with pretty Dina Merrill being the love interest for Curtis only to learn that he's already engaged to a wealthy woman. Arthur O'Connell is funny as the frustrated mechanic as nurse Heywood insists on helping him run the ship at one point using a girdle to connect some of the parts.Operation Petticoat is a real treat  a very funny film with good direction script and acting all around.".

	onyx:emotionText "Operation Petticoat brings Tony Curtis and his idol Cary Grant together for a very funny film directed by Blake Edwards. Curtis of course does a great Cary Grant impression in Some Like it Hot and working with Grant was a dream come true for the 34yearold actor. And nothing about the experience disappointed him or the audience. The film also features Dina Merrill Gene Evans Dick Sargent Arthur O'Connell Madelyn Rhue Virginia Gregg and Marion Ross.The film is shown in flashback as the submarine Sea Tiger is about to be junked. Grant as Lt. Cmdr. Matt Sherman looks at his log book and reminisces to a time when he was trying to get the Sea Tiger back into the war after his sub is nearly destroyed in an air raid. However it is next to impossible to get supplies. Assigned as a replacement officer to the Sea Tiger is one Mr. Holden Curtis a wheelerdealer who got into uniform so he could meet the right people. Though he maneuvered a country club job as an aide to an admiral planning to go to Manila the war intervened and the admiral cancels his plans. Holden gets the Sea Tiger assignment. He promises that he can get supplies and presents one of his band of merry men Ramon Gallardo a prisoner whom he promises can travel on the sub. But he's a Marine Sherman objects. There isn't a thief pickpocket or fence in the islands that doesn't know love and respect him Holden answers. Holden gets supplies by any means necessary including taking pipes from the bathrooms part of the major's office wall etc. He also manages to rescue five nurses who were stranded on an island disrupting the entire sub. Though he finally confines Holden to quarters Sherman realizes soon enough that if you can't beat 'em join 'em and calls on Holden for help again.Operation Petticoat has some hilarious moments including Holden's stealing of a pig for New Year's dinner and the subsequent confrontation with the owner and military police on the sub where Sherman and Holden refer to the pig as Hornsby.

I thought that was quite a coincidence see as I am Tivoing old episodes of the Gilmore Girls I never watched it when it first came out and Marion Ross played Lorelai the First Lorelai's grandmother in that show.

But it's the dialogue that matters and the interplay between Cary Grant and Tony Curtis the men and the women. These dynamics prove fertile comedy ground and are mined for everything they're worth without ever overdoing it or becoming silly.The film looks fantastic. One of those where the full weight of military cooperation is evident on the screen with planes flying low overhead naval destroyers dropping dozens of depth charges in the spectacular climax and an unexpected level of detail in some of the external shots of the sub. The resultant location shooting means the film is a lot less studiobound than similar films of the era. Talking of the sub I don't know if the interiors were shot on a real sub  I doubt there'd be room  but it feels very authentic and realistic.Most of the best material stems from Curtis' attempts to procure supplies for the sub with the best scene in the film being the theft of a pig and the ensuing cover up. It's a riotous few minutes and as funny as anything I've seen in a film made in the '50s.".

There are the Zuckerstyle Airplane moments. There are sex gags on par with anything National Lampoon did in their heyday. There are the heartwarming subplots involving a few budding romances which are genuinely sweet. There are the overthetop cartoony CGI scenes like something out of Kung Fu Hustle. It's not just aimless humor either it's satire with a message. Everything from school culture to teen promiscuity to multiple religions to Internet celebrity to social class divisions to fetishes and kinks to organized crime is spoofed twisted around and put back in its place severely distorted and hilarious. It's a bit like Monty Python's Life of Brian in that there is a single real underlying message to the whole film but it doesn't let that get in the way of taking things off into a whole new crazy direction for a few minutes every now and then.Unlike many comedies the characters are not just singlejoke constructs. The cast is brilliant and their characters are well fleshedout and genuine people who just happen to live in an overthetop psychotic world much like our own and do crazy things.This movie is a total head trip and it's seriously one of the best movies I've seen this year. Every time you think you've figured it out it throws something completely new and unexpected at you.This is the movie that modern overdone selfaware comedies like The New Guy the last couple of Scary Movie installments or anything made after 1990 with the words National Lampoon in the title wish they could be.".

	schema:headline " Secret The Key to Your Old First Love";
	schema:reviewBody "When this romantic movie was released for the first time in Korea there wasn't big media hype. However it became famous gradually through wordofmouth so that it was shown again a few months after it went off the air. Also it pulled down big amount of money. Many reviewers said 'If you miss this movie it would be one of the goofiest things you've done throughout your life as a moviegoer.' I found it true for myself after watching it.To cut to the chase it's a romantic movie. However if you expect just a bog standard chick flick it would be pretty different from what you've expected because it doesn't have only sweet love story and humor but also the touching plot unpredictable fantasy and even a twist. Also when it comes to its music couldn't be better! It's been considered as one of the movies which have the best music with 'August Rush' and 'The Pianist'. Some commercials were takeoffs on its stunning piano performance scenes.Thus it would make people who like romantic stories and sweet music be glued in front of the screen but I'm not sure in the case of people who anticipate cutting edge special effects spectacle and action scenes. The story goes pretty slow in the firsthalf part and some graphic effects at the last part is sort of cheesy It was awarded the prize for visual effects though. Nevertheless I still want to recommend it strongly to even these people. At least I'm not afraid it'll let them down. I can rattle on for hours about the reasons followed by.First let's get down to characters. Main characters are Jay Jay Chou and Rain Kwai Lunmei. The two players seemed to have chemistry. Jay Chou is already famous as a good singer and an actor in East Asia. He played lots of roles in this movie. He starred in it as a main character who had a talent for piano. Also the story was based on his first love. Moreover it was his debut movie as a director. He was a composer of this O.S.T as well. He'd studied piano until high school so he could make amazing scenes in which he played the piano by himself. His calm and gentle appearance went well with the sweet dialog.Rain is a mysterious girl in the same piano department with Jay. She has innocent looks that could make many guys remind of their first love. Kwai Lunmei played the role of the girl which I think is the most difficult role to express the character's complicated emotion without a flaw. Plus the quite cheerful supporting actors add zest to the movie.The story takes place at one arts high school in Taiwan. It seems to be the late 20th century or the early 21th century. One day JayJay Chou who has just transferred this school follows the unknown tune from the old piano practice room. He tracks down one lovely girl who is playing the piano there. They have good feelings toward each other right from the word 'go' and they fall in love with each other gradually. However she sometimes disappears saying 'It's a secret.' Next? I don't want to spoil your pleasure. All that I can say is that the director hid some special factors such as fantasy and dramatic reversals in the last part and locked down the cover good and tight until the climax. Actually the first part seems to have something in common with other romantic movies. However the ending part will lead you to the unknown world.It's no exaggeration to say that its background music is another main character. Even if you hate soft music once you try to listen to its music it would begin to wear down your defenses. It won't let your ears close even for a minute. Especially the scene called 'Piano Battle' between Jay and the talented student at the school is considered to be the killer part of the movie. Jay copied it correctly by ear right after the talented boy played one piece. This was how the battle went. They played three pieces each and two of them were arranged Chopin's works. I bet over ninety percent of people who watch it would find themselves searching for the video clip of this scene on the Internet afterward. I even signed up for the piano institute right after watching it and mastered Chopin's Impromptu.The cinematography also pulled its weight. It tried to play down its involvement in the story. I thought first it was nothing to write home about but I realized it helped me to concentrate on the story not on less important things. I don't mean it was lousy. The subdued lighting matched perfectly with the atmosphere. Also certain scenes were shot dynamically. While two boys were having the piano battle in particular the camera chased their alive and dynamic performances very effectively.Are you still hesitating to watch it? Well I'm a girl in twenties who loves romantic comedy and classical music. This movie which has all these things was beyond amazing to me. I know arts can't be judged if one is better or worse than another. However a lot of film festivals acknowledged 'Secret' through giving it many awards. It means that many people thought it was very worth watching.Also one experience sometimes changes people's tastes by accident. There might be a chance 'Secret' could be this experience to somebody. Shake off your prejudice and just expose yourself to the variety of arts. I hope my review change your mind. Lovely music striking scenery interesting stories...'Secret' which was made out of this will stimulate your sensibility. It's time to hunker down and dive into the romantic world!".

It indeed is quite brave of him though it's arguable to strike while the iron is hot to diversify and have a hand in directing so early in his cinematic career and coming up with quite an interesting engaging story though like any creative work his story did make him seem quite intelligent in spite of his usual laidback demeanour.Jay stars as Jay yeah bring back those lazy Hong Kong production days where characters share the actor's first names because they were working on so many movies simultaneously it's hard to keep track so why not name the characters after yourself! a new student in Tamkang Secondary School. He follows a mysterious piano tune and meets with Rain Kwai LunMei a fellow student with whom he starts to spend many loveydovey moments with. It's essentially a romance story for dating couples to catch and it will be a definite test of anyone's cloytolerance given that the lovebirds share so much saccharine sweet dialogue and behaviour those with lesser tolerance will have goosebumps all the way.And for the romantic movie fans it's time to revisit some of the clich plot elements like the bicycle ride  who can resist a bicycle ride!  lovely scene setting landscape shots idle banter close contacts dance kisses the third party Sky whom I think is more attractive than Kwai thus providing that additional tension the list just goes on. Jay has mentioned parts of the story was really based on his own experiences it is indeed interesting to try and find out just which are. Being a piano student the movie too was a showcase piece for his musical talents and prowess on the piano coupled with computer generated graphics which enhanced certain scenes for dramatic effect with great aplomb.Those who think that Jay Chou can't act will want to rethink that again. Given Initial D was pop and that Curse was action Secret was a perfect dramatic platform for him to do a little more emoting even though he can't seem to shake off his signature drawl. And of course some help to make him look good came from thespian Anthony Wong who had also played his cinematic dad of similar interest  capability in Initial D as he again does in Secret. Here their father and son characters play off each other a little more in some endearing comical moments and naturally Wong seemed a more believable father figure than Chow YunFat for Jay Chou.The strength of the movie however laid in its story. I shall keep it a secret just exactly what it was and all I can say is it is similar in nature to some of my favourite movies in the past thus I had taken a natural liking for Secret as well. However while you think you might have it all planned out how the story will unfold Jay Chou actually had an added punch to keep it a little bit fresh and in doing so raises it to a slightly different level as well with a fairly intense climax that will have you rooting for a desirable outcome no less. What worked against it though would be the verbatim nature in which the story was explained making it a little draggy and at times repetitive instead of allowing the audience to put the pieces together.Jay Chou as story writer he had someone to script it for him actor director and composer Secret turned out to be a surprisingly commendable co mmendable effort. If this is any indication of what's to come from this talented dude then I'll be more than happy to be a fan convert for his cinematic efforts at least. Recommended date movie of the week remember to bring out those tissues as well! I won't be surprised if this movie will work its magic into my top ten list for the year.".

I was bent on catching the show because oneI saw the movie trailerwhen I was watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that I thought was average but that comes under another thread which really caught my attentionand two I am a fan of Jay's music. His acting has received much flak but this time round one must say that his acting has improved even though his character in the movie was basically he himself. So Jay stars as Ye Xiang Lun anyone noticed that Jay known for being very filial to his mum took his mum's surname? Really sweet of him.who is a new student at Tamkang High School. He meets Lu Xiao Yu Guey Lunmei on the first day of school and the romance begins. The lengthy sequence of building up the romance was cloyingly sweet. Riding on bicycles close contacts apples! sweet kisses conversations that were shy and slightly flirtatious  Jay's fans would probably swoon and wish they were Guey Lunmei while others would probably feel their goosebumps popping up. Of course romance always comes with a third party who in the movie comes in the form of attractive Jing Yi. Before you switch your minds off thinking this as just a film about high school romance be assured that it is much more intelligent the kind which makes you think back ponder and oh! the puzzle fits together perfectly think Deathnote the movie The twist comes at a very good time perhaps a little too late for some at the point when one starts to demand for reasons behind what is happening. The ultimate twist is more than what you can figure out not a new idea but one which makes complete sense in the movie and one which Jay worked on and brought to the climax  which would have you hoping for a happy ending. The magic that Jay laid on the movie is one the story two the piano and three the characters. The piano was awesome brilliant breathtaking no doubt to showcase Jay's skills at tickling the ivories which is mesmerizing!. The piano battle the sweet practices together the use of music in the film to convey feelings and vent the characters' built up emotions thinkanthony wong and jay in the movie  they were really effective in helping one relate to the characters and fall in love with them. The characters in the movie were well put together  bringing on the endearing moments which have you wishing you had someone like that thnk anthony wong as jay's father with those comical humorous moments and the brainless sidekicks those two from the rugby team Guey Lunmei shows off her acting chops as Xiaoyu which was really believable and brings the character a lot more depth  the happiness the confusion and the emotional pain showing her acting skills to the mainstream audiencesince she usually does arthouse films Not to mention Anthony Wong's portrayal as Jay's father which was so believable and so endearing caring so much for his onscreen son that makes you hope for a happy ending for him as well when the truth finally dawned upon him. Overall this movie was definitely worth the ticket and I believe more will be made to sit up and take notice of Jay's talents. It is refreshingly good and a movie that will remain on ons'e mind even after the show's ended. Do give the movie a chance and watch it and bring your tissues! I used up quite a fair bit!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was pleasantly surprised after watching this film on DVD. While the premise of the story may not be entirely original there are many who may compare it with Il Mare or its Hollywood remake  The Lake House frankly speaking the manner in which the plot unfolds is relatively engaging and has kept me glued to the screen from the opening credits to the closing credits.The film Secret begins with Lun played by Jay Chou who also directed the film being led by a mysterious and alluring piano piece to an old dilapidated room in his new school Tamkang Secondary School. It was in this room where he meets Rain played by the infectiously sweet Kwai LunMei who was responsible for playing the mysterious piano solo. This chance encounter would trigger the start of Lun and Rain's somewhat nebulous relationship which would be 'put to the test' to an extent by another female student named Sky which was played to perfection by the delightfully charming Tseng Kaixuan.Jay Chou had also taken this opportunity and a great one as well  with music being centerpiece of this story in his directorial debut to pay a small tribute to one of his favourite composers Chopin wherever possible. Apart from being described as a gifted composer in the film Chopin's Waltz was also featured in the beautifully shot sequence of a piano duel  which was one of the highlights of the film.Besides the storyline and music the film's cinematography was decent as well. In short it's a wonderfully packaged film with a plot formula that works.DVD Extras 1.5 out of 5 stars  definitely could have been a lot better. The making of video was disappointing with no guidance or insight on the making of the film and it was constantly interspersed with periods of continuous silence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I never heard of Jay Chou before but simply based on this film alone he seems to be quite a talent. Secret is really his film as he acts directs plays the piano and serves as singersongwriter. That's a lot for a guy not even in his 30s. It's even more impressive how he manages to weave all his talents into a solid whole easily defining a style of his own.The core of Secret sounds pretty clich with Chou playing a pretty boy starting school and falling in love with the school's outcast. The first part of the film really doesn't go much behind its premise and doesn't intend to be anything more than a simple romantic drama. Luckily Chou is helped by good performances of the entire cast and some solid cinematography which makes it all very easy to bear.Apart from the love story there is a big musical angle too resulting in a few nice scenes on the piano the most interesting one being the piano battle between Chou and the school's biggest piano talent. It brings some fresh ideas to the film which at that time is really nothing more than a solid genre piece. It's of course also a good way for Chou to demonstrate his talents on the piano. And impressive it is.The path for the film seems fixed after the first part but Chou knows how to surprise. Halfway through he adds a magical twists to the story elevating the film above many of its peers. While at the same time it adds to the drama and sentiment it never crosses the border of becoming a true melodrama as the fantastic elements keep the film from turning into a simple tearjerker.This magical twists also allows Chou to play with the visuals some more resulting in several beautifully shot and constructed scenes. In places the CGi is a tad too intrusive but that is easily forgotten as it is never there just for visual kicks alone. The soundtrack remains pretty active and is not what you'd call subtle but since it is integrated so well into the whole story it never becomes bothersome and Chou hits the rights notes time after time again.It's nice to see so many things go right in a film like this. Visually Secret is solid and often stunning the acting is equally solid and with Anthony Wong completing the cast you really can't go wrong. While the film starts of in pretty classical manner halfway through it really blooms and turns into a very quirky and lovable genre film creating an impressive universe of its own. Chou really shines as a director in the second part of Secret making me curious to any new output will see of him.It's nice to see young talent like this thriving. As a whole the films feels a tad poppy and maybe a bit too flimsy apart from that it's one big solid romance with a pretty cool twist and a magnificent ending leaving you pretty fulfilled after the film has finished. 4.05.0".

This love story was genuine and not like many other clich stories you can find in the movie market. The actors and actresses put up remarkable jobs too. I personally feel that Jay Chou has made a great improvement with regards to his oncestagnant facial expressions. His costar Guey Lunmei's acting did not fail to impress too for a neophyte selected by Jay Chou himself her acting was breezy and natural.The whole story is filled with love passion for music and excellent piano pieces. My favorite parts were the piano battle as well as the piano duet. I thought that Jay Chou's pianoplaying was fabulous. He indeed lived up to his label as musical genius.Overall the movie was great. I watched it twice and both times I still cried and laughed the same as before. Although I'm merely fifteen and hence my mentalities may be a cry away from some readers and moviewatchers here I think that this show is one that you should catch. You will not regret it! ".

Starring Jay Chou as Jay and Kwai Lun Mei as Rain this film maybe feel a little bit of ordinary. But believe me it's not. The romance between two lead is just so believable that I began to remember my own high school experience. The innocence of love between Jay and Rain really move me in some way I can't explain you have to watch it by yourself to know it. Secret 2 is rumored to be releases 2013 but according to some it will be an entirely different story. No Rain no Sky maybe even no Dad.

This is the only 2nd movie i have seen of Jay's and I am a huge fan. I love his music and his voice is so beautiful. As for his acting it's rather good... I Love Love stories and though this is two high school kids I still love the fact that love has no boundaries and can travel thru time. There is a similar American movie which starred Christopher Reeves aka superman and Jane Seymore aka Dr. Quinn Medicine woman called somewhere in time where reeves' character is obsessed with this woman from the past and goes back to save her...It too is a sad ending unfortunately he comes back to the future cuz he stuck a present day penny in his pocket which forwards him back to the future and he couldn't' go back to see her...sad cuz he dies only to be reunited with her in death...Glad these two didn't die...Jay is so amazing with the piano. He has so much passion for music it's a wonder he is so natural for this character that he creates from himself. I say beautifully done I did have to get a box of tissues...Poor Rain when she thought Sky and Jay were together when she came back... So glad they got together ...They are so good together...I definitely have to add this to my collection now and now I am a huge Jay Chou fan...and gotta get more of his music and movies!!!".

Jay does a commendable job as director writer and actor. I watched this movie without knowing much about it because anything with Guey Lun Mei Rain in it I am there. But after coming here to the trusty IMDb I had the shock of my life.I wouldn't have noticed that it is a first time director nevermind if he is Jay Chou on the helms because this definitely looks like a work from a season director. And although I would have guessed that Jay is the Music director since he is such a 'pop legend' it still impressed me because the entire movie did not have any of his signature fancysmancy stuff... Indeed I am pretty in awe and I think I might just have to view Jay Chou in a different light.The story while it is a little slow in the beginning is fresh and original. In the beginning Jay Jay Chou and Rain's Guey Lun Mei interaction had me thinking that I already know the ending that Rain was a ghost. That completely had me smirking and I was thinking nothing of it. But when the big reveal was about to happen I realize that it was too soon in a movie for a simple ghost girl story. And I was indeed much surprised that it wasn't anything about ghost but more of a suspension of disbelief. It reminded me of 'The Classic' and 'Il Mare' and other Korean greats except with a very original twist! I spent about 15mins just staring and wondering how something so simple could be so captivating.The special effects in the movie isn't very consistent. There are some parts that are done exceptionally well and other parts that had me rolling my eyes. But technical faults can be forgiven as long as the heart and the soul in the story is there. And indeed it is. Jay wrote the story and so the connection with music is inevitable. Yet Jay did not paint himself as a hero or as a great man he was just an average Joe who fell in love with an average Jane but I am bias Guey is one of the most attractive girls in my book. The development of the love between Jay and Rain has gotta be one of the most believable in recent years. The interaction the dialog reminds me of young love. gush But for a movie to work the acting as to work. And boy did the acting work in this one. Jay feeling much like a broken record for saying his name so many times is surprisingly natural. He doesn't have the deliberateness of many 'seasoned' actors and I liked that. Underacting as opposed to overacting is always good. Anthony Wong Jay's dad as always is one of the best actors of our time and it shows. Even though he doesn't have much to flex his acting chops he does so because he doesn't over shadow anyone else. The best actors are the ones who can play at his player's level and Anthony has shown that he could do that. Don't get me wrong I am not saying that Jay is good or bad as an actor but Anthony definitely toned down and accommodated the feel of natural acting in this movie which is completely different from the Hong Kong high energy stuff he is probably used to.But Most of all I would like to gush Here it comes! about Guey Lun Mei. She isn't a very frequent actress and at last count i think she had only about 34 films. But her acting oh god her acting she has gotta be one of the best up and coming actresses ever. I believe her happiness i believe her sadness i believe her anger i believe her desperation. I believe everything she emotes because she is so good at emoting. She doesn't have a signature laugh or a signature cry like so many others but she has a kind of natural talent that draws me closer to her character Rain. I am so glad Jay chose her as the female lead because I don't think anyone else in Taiwan would be able to pull of her kind of subtle acting.So in conclusion. Watch this movie. Don't judge Jay Chou for Jay Chou. and start falling in love with Guey like I am. Story's great cinematography's great music is fantastic actors are great definitely a 10 overall.".

It was a good attempt it kept me watching till the end hoping to give it ten out of ten.Despite being a romantic film this film did not move me a bit. I am not sure should i blame it on the unrealistic puppy love or jay's runofthemill acting. I put the final blame on the character. It was unclear how strong this love was between Lu and Ye. Ye knew Lu was ill and failed to see her for five months. Lu gets jealous too easily. For her to give up the secret score and cry for Ye for five months is just incredible. I did not understand why was it necessary to make both Ye and Lu come from single parent family. Makin Ye a homemaker with a weird father was not much of a character development.The cinematography was great. i like the brown visual presentation of this film. Not forgetting the bicycle rides the ice cream and the piano. Music is something Jay is strong with.

Apart from the acting of the main lead everything else is impressive the settings and especially the soundtracks they are the best.

Admittedly it really brings nothing new to the table but it delivers the usual ingredients in a perfectly decent enough manner. It revolves around three characters of a type that populate countless Italian westerns  a loner with amazing weapons skills an unscrupulous banker and a dangerous yet lovable Mexican bandit. While its setting of a small town under the rule of immoral criminals who are only set free with the help of a slightly less amoral character is a scenario that has been told umpteen times. But sometimes more of the same is okay and well this is more of the same there's no doubt about that.The title character is a debt collector called Durango played by Brad Harris. It does have to be said that he seems extremely ill suited to play a character such as this in a western. This musclebound actor replete with impressive sixpack seems out of place here and would be better suited to action movies and peplums. He also lacks much in the way of charisma and so this tree trunk of a man is miscast in my view. The other characters are a bit better although the chap who played the evil banker seemed a little too Latin to really convince as a character called Ferguson! Still these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things and you'd be correct to wonder just why in hell I am even complaining about them. I'm wondering that too and I've just written them. No the most important thing is that this film takes us from A to B on a wellworn spaghetti western path and it does it successfully if unadventurously. It's certainly a film that deserves to be more widely seen though and is ultimately another successfully entertaining bit of Italian Americana.".

	schema:headline " Amazing piece of cinema powerful. dramatic moving";
	schema:reviewBody "Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 Market screening Since I am not Chinese or of Chinese extraction City of Life and Death has a different resonance for me. I know of the Nanking massacre for which it has to be said the Japanese have yet to apologise or even properly acknowledge from my own interest in history as well as the John Rabe story the Nazi who helped save thousands of Chinese civilians until recalled to Germany since Hitler did not wish to upset his Japanese allies.Therefore for me City of Life and Death retells a fearful part of history but not one with which I have any direct connection. So while this film may resonate a certain way for Chinese viewers be they from the mainland Hong Kong or overseas Chinese I can tell you that I as a European have seldom seen a film so powerful gripping dramatic and moving.City of Life and Death is not nationalistic propaganda or a reversioning for the screen no punches are pulled. The woman next to me was in tears. So be warned this is not easy viewing. But by featuring on a few characters allowing them to become fully threedimensional human beings not Chinese not Asian but human beings who live love and feel director Lu Chuan makes his audience feel and share their fear and terror as the Japanese invaders commit atrocity after atrocity on the fallen city's inhabitants. Never forget this actually happened.If anything Lu Chuan soft pedals on the horrors. They are depicted but are not front and centre. This is not a horror film so gore hounds and ghouls should seek their thrills elsewhere. Rather it is the arbitrariness with which the Japanese went about their murderous work that scares. Wrong place wrong time rape torture murder. This wasn't the efficient methodical murder the Nazis introduced but rather cold brutality as a cat toys with a helpless mouse. Unthinking unreasoning just because.Filmed in black and white City has so many images and scenes that remain fixed in you mind long after the final credits have rolled. Lu Chuan even selects the grain and grading according to the action. The use of colour would in this case have weakened the film.But if City of Life and Death were just two hours of suffering it would be unworthy of an audience. So Lu Chuan gives us the central characters of Mr. Tang John Rabe's secretary Miss Jiang a schoolteacher and Kadokawa a sensitive Japanese soldier who witness but cannot delay the unspeakable. All of them are helplessly swept up in the maelstrom which Lu Chuan leavens with scenes of attempts at normal life normal human interaction and naked attempts at survival. These are people with whom one can identify and empathise.Yet at heart City of Life and Death is extremely uplifting. The message at the end is positive and optimistic. In writing this review the film is coming back to me again. What I once read black and white on a page has been made real for me and yes I'm emotionally moved by it.If you believe in the power of film want a break from popcorn entertainment are looking for a film that can make you feel as opposed to having your emotions manipulated then please go see this one. It's rare when I think a film should be seen deserves to be seen but City of Life and Death belong in that very rare category.".

These are people with whom one can identify and empathise.Yet at heart City of Life and Death is extremely uplifting. The message at the end is positive and optimistic. In writing this review the film is coming back to me again. What I once read black and white on a page has been made real for me and yes I'm emotionally moved by it.If you believe in the power of film want a break from popcorn entertainment are looking for a film that can make you feel as opposed to having your emotions manipulated then please go see this one. It's rare when I think a film should be seen deserves to be seen but City of Life and Death belong in that very rare category.";

The way it makes a contrast between the fragility of the Chinese position and the vast and enormous military resources at the hands of the Japanese to simply dispose of the Chinese population just the way they want remorseless and unlimited in their decisions creates in the spectator a sense of utter despair and impotence as the starting violence and euphoria transforms into raw and premeditated brutality. But this same perspective makes you appreciate more intensely the triumph of the defeated's mentality over the conquerors' one the silent resistance that becomes an unified wall against the oppression and ruthless rule of the Japanese military whom at the end began to fall apart morally. The action is awesomely captured photography is great and direction is remarkable some scenes hit you really hard but not to the extent to consider it a sadist or heavytowatch film.

	schema:reviewBody "The last Rape of Nanking event film I had watched was the docudrama Nanking back in 2006 during the Hong Kong International Film Festival. With interviews conducted with real survivors I was riveted to listen to their account of the atrocities conducted by the Japanese soldiers and you empathize with them as they relive their memory and make them known. The dramatic elements were nicely presented as well with notable names reading off memoirs and letters pertaining to individual episodes which collectively make up the brutal horror a living hell if you would of the conditions of occupation.Lu Chuan of Kekexili fame has crafted this fine film that looks into 2 broad episodes  the first few hours of occupation which will satisfy action junkies and the later half which looked into the atrocities that were committed some 1 week into occupation from within an international safety zone set up by Westerners led by German John Rabe who gets some concession by virtue of Nazi Germany being Japan's ally.There's the controversial aspect of the film though where it doesn't demonize the invading force right away. Instead I lauded its realistic portrayal of the human condition of Fear when we go into the unknown and this emotion gets vividly captured in the first few minutes of the movie setting the tone of the entire film where fear drives us to do inhumane barbaric acts. That being said it doesn't shy away from reenacting the atrocities committed against the Chinese from bayonet stabbings mass burials of breathing souls burning and the machine gunning of surviving soldiers and rape.Filled with plenty of characters each given a specific purpose in the film either representative of an historical legend or collectively as a group it makes you feel for the individual with documentarylike precision and I am somewhat intrigued at how one can feel so much through the simple camera work of going real close to the actor's face and lingering onwards to capture moments of despair and bewilderment.If there's one film you should see this year then don't miss this one. I only hope that it gets played in a decent cinema hall with a great sound system otherwise it'll do this film no justice. Certainly a contender for one of my films of the year and comes highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH is a masterpiece  of film making of finding the midline of response to war from both sides of cautiously but successfully blending intimate stories with the gory atrocities of war and of recreating a period of history we too soon forget unless prodded by works such as this. Lu Chuan both wrote and directed this vision of the 1937 decimation of Nanking the capital of China by the Japanese that lasted in action for only six weeks but that has been a permanent festering wound on the history of mankind that will always be a reminder to what War is about. Subtitled NANKING! NANKING! the audience is led to expect a film honoring the Chinese who bravely fought to resist of the Japanese invasion and ultimate destruction of the then capital of China. Instead the writerdirector elects to put us in the midst of the war showing all aspects of how war changes and affects and destroys people. The black and white film is able to create the illusion that we are actually in 1937 Nanking. We meet several important personalities from that time the Chinese Resistance leader Lu Jianxiong the inordinately gifted and handsome actor Ye Liu the Chinese schoolteacher Miss Jiang Yuanyuan Gao who fights constantly to save her people the Nazi German John Rabe John Paisley who maintains a Safety Zone to protect the Chinese until the Nazis recall him to avoid insulting their Japanese allies Rabe's Chinese assistant and translator Mr Tang Wei Fan and his wife Lan Qin who despite the suffering they endure from the Japanese still are selfless in the choices they make to help their people and Kadokawa and impressive Hideo Nakaizumi who as a Japanese soldier is a symbol for those warriors who are conflicted about the cruelty inflicted on the Chinese. These individuals provide stories with the story that allow the viewer to connect to the human aspect of the victims and the perpetrators of the annihilation we are witnessing. There are devastating scenes of the forced 'comfort houses' created to keep the Japanese soldiers happy the demanded selection of 100 Chinese women to provide physical gratification to the enemy the massacre of thousands of citizens  men women children  and the destruction of the very city itself. But Lu Chuan balances these with some very tender moments such as the first sexual encounter of a virgin soldier with a prostitute and how he interprets this experience as love to the point of providing as much gratitude and safety to the prostitute as he can and the incredibly tender scenes between Lu Jianxiong and a little boy who brings him bullets. The cast is stunning and while many of us do not recognize the faces they are obviously some of the cream of the crop of Chinese and Japanese actors. Yu Cao is in charge of the very realistic and photographically perfect cinematography and the musical score by Tony Liu is not only appropriate for the theme of the film but also provides some very simple Western piano music for the intimate scenes. There are multiple choices of subtitles including English. CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH not only documents a piece of martial history that is important to remember but it is also another way of viewing how WAR can alter the minds and lives of those on both side of the battle. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

We've been told and taught that 300000 Chinese were killed in that slaughter most of them were refugees. We've seen so many cruel photos read so many articles and heard the vivid reports of some survivals which has made 1937's Nanjing a scar on the heart of every Chinese especially the old ones who witnessed the slaughter and their descendants.I don't want to talk too much about the hates between Chinese and Japanese. Why I think Nanjing! Nanjing!  the greatest movie about this tragedy is that when LU Chuan shot this movie he not only put away his hates but even used an angle of a Japanese soldier and dared to show the soldier's sympathy and humanity. This movie is logical rational and together with deep emotion. It's not simply a movie for Chinese people to deepen their hates on Japanese it's a movie for people all over the world to see to know to experience and to explore what Japanese have done to Nanjing in 1937. It's not another traditional movie about Nanjing Slaughter which describes Japanese soldiers as some mentally disordered ones as demon it shows that what happened in Nanjing in 1937 was simply a slaughter human done to human. Just because this movie was shot without hates without slants without sharp emotions it has demonstrated the most powerful thing in the world truth.Nanjing 1937 not matter Japanese admit its existence or not  we may forgive but never forget.".

	schema:headline " Powerful chronicle of the 'Rape of Nanking' compromised by view through an anachronistic lens";
	schema:reviewBody "Chuan Lu the talented director of 'City of Life and Death' was faced with a quandary in attempting to recount the Rape of Nanking perhaps the single greatest series of atrocities committed by the Japanese occupation force during the Second SinoJapanese War in 1937. Just as the Jewish people always say never forget when it comes to remembering the Holocaust the Chinese people also feel compelled to never forget and recall their own Holocaust. But Mr. Lu can't ignore the fact that the Japanese people of 1937 are not the same people of today and his compulsion to reconcile the past and the present was perhaps his greatest challenge in writing the screenplay.Ironically Lu ended up receiving death threats not from the Japanese but from some Chinese people who felt that he did not extract a sufficient enough pound of flesh as compensation for those who suffered during the Occupation. I can recall my own grandparents who had relatives that were killed in the Holocaust speak ever so harshly of the Germans and wanted nothing to do with any of themeven those born after the War. Because it was an emotional issue they ignored the Biblical admonition found in Ezekiel 1820 The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity. The same can be said for many Chinese people who are unable to forgive the Japanese even though rationally it makes no sense that those born after the war are blamed for their parents or grandparents' crimes. While Director Lu's reconciliation strategy is a noble one I'm not completely convinced the way he went about expressing his attitude of 'forgiveness' toward the Japanese enhanced the story strengthening its verisimilitude.Where the film is successful is in the multitude of indelible images that recreate the horror show that was 1937 Nanking. The images from the film's opening sequence are shattering as they suggest an escalating atmosphere of terror that affected both the Chinese civilian and military population . One image that really sticks in my mind are the Chinese soldiers trying to escape the walled city and are unsuccessfully held back by their commanders. For those soldiers who stayed behind they're shown to be courageous as they fight back against an overwhelmingly superior force. When they are finally defeated and surrender the brutal Japanese soldiers take no prisoners. Some are herded into a warehouse with the doors locked shut and then the building is set on fire. Others are marched to the ocean and almost all are machinegunned to death. Before they're murdered the soldiers shout Long live China and again show their courage against their brutal occupiers.Worse is what happens to the civilian population especially the Chinese women. The Japanese force the leaders in the 'Safety Zone' an area where refugees were supposedly protected by an agreement with international observers to select 100 women to serve as prostitutes over a period of three weeks for the Japanese soldiers. The women are strapped to beds and are raped continuously through the day and night. Some fail to survive the ordeal and who can forget the scene where the soldiers carry out the nude corpses in a wheelbarrow? The strategies of the Japanese troops recall the sadism of their Nazi counterparts in the book  film 'Sophies Choice'. You'll recall that Sophie was forced to select one of her children over another by the Nazis. In Nanking the Japanese play their own little sadistic gamethey lead families to believe that their loved ones will be let gobut then order the families to choose only one! Of all the characters here Mr. Tang is the most compelling. Tang was John Rabe's interpreter and assistant. When Rabe informs him that he's being recalled back to Germany Tang makes a pact with the devil by informing the Japanese commanders that there might be Chinese soldiers hiding out in the safety zone he does this to obtain a safe conduct pass in order to save his family. This admission creates the pretext for the occupiers to violate the agreement and invade the safety zone in order to commit more atrocities. Tang soon learns that the Japanese had no intention of honoring their side of the bargain and a Japanese soldier ends up throwing Tang's daughter out the window. In an act of redemption Tang trades places with a soldier and remains behind as his wife escapes when she leaves Nanking with John Rabe.Lu is unsuccessful when he attempts to throw a bone to the Japanese people of today by creating the unconvincing character of Kadokawa. According to Lu he based Kadokawa's character on diaries he read of Japanese soldiers who were in Nanking during the massacres. Although there may have been a few soldiers who were repulsed by what they saw the vast majority were more like Ida Kadokawa's sadistic direct superior. Lu has trouble fleshing out his Kadokawa characterhe shows his sensitive side to a Japanese 'comfort girl' who he claims that one day she'll be his wife. And later Kadokawa shoots Miss Jiang as a mercy killing and then does himself in as he is unable to cope with his guilt. But it's really not enoughKadokawa is an anachronistic presence designed to suggest that Japanese people weren't that bad even back then. But in 1937 the mindset of the average Japanese person was decidedly quite fanatical.What Lu merely needed to do was put a disclaimer at the beginning of the film noting that Japan transformed itself after the War and that the son should not pay for the iniquity of the father. Without Kadokawa or perhaps having him as a greatly reduced presence 'City' would have been much more true to life and there would have been no misunderstanding Lu was blaming the Japanese born after WW II who bear no responsibility for the bloody scenes that happened so long ago.".

	onyx:emotionText "Chuan Lu the talented director of 'City of Life and Death' was faced with a quandary in attempting to recount the Rape of Nanking perhaps the single greatest series of atrocities committed by the Japanese occupation force during the Second SinoJapanese War in 1937. Just as the Jewish people always say never forget when it comes to remembering the Holocaust the Chinese people also feel compelled to never forget and recall their own Holocaust. But Mr. Lu can't ignore the fact that the Japanese people of 1937 are not the same people of today and his compulsion to reconcile the past and the present was perhaps his greatest challenge in writing the screenplay.Ironically Lu ended up receiving death threats not from the Japanese but from some Chinese people who felt that he did not extract a sufficient enough pound of flesh as compensation for those who suffered during the Occupation. I can recall my own grandparents who had relatives that were killed in the Holocaust speak ever so harshly of the Germans and wanted nothing to do with any of themeven those born after the War. Because it was an emotional issue they ignored the Biblical admonition found in Ezekiel 1820 The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity. The same can be said for many Chinese people who are unable to forgive the Japanese even though rationally it makes no sense that those born after the war are blamed for their parents or grandparents' crimes.

	schema:reviewBody " The spoilers contained are not really spoilers just a very brief mention of a couple of scenesAs both a history nerd and a war movie freak I was rather surprised to discover both a part of history as well as this movie and realize that I have hardly heard anything about the rape of Nanking not by a word mentioned in any history lesson nor school literature in Sweden where I live. I haven't seen many books about it either during my years of devouring all literature about WWII and wars in conjunction with it. Sad but it gave me the more reason to learn about the SinoJapanese wars. This movie I guess was the introduction. The mixed reviews were rather confusing but I chose to go with the general trend that it was see worthy. It was.Seldom I have been so completely punched down by a Movie and so utterly engrossed. Everything about this flick just sucks you in and shakes you up entirely.The black and white execution can I guess be a bit different for watchers not used to old bw movies and definitely pretty unusual nowadays. But as I see it this is one of the most important features of the movie giving a raw documentary and very authentic feel to it. A very smart move by the director giving the impression that what you are watching is a piece of naked atthescene history. Still the visual of the movie never loses it's insanely beautiful and powerful cinematography with every frame InYourFace smashing you like a fist of master photo. The actor portraits are strong convincing and complex and lets you feel and wonder rather than just being fed evolving and revealing more and more as the story unravels. Some critique Nakaizumi Hideo's rendition of Kadokawa but I don't get it. IMO he does an amazing job and makes me believe and feel him. Often western viewers have a hard time getting used to Asian film which according to me has to do with the fact that western and Asian storytelling and dramaturgy traditionally differ a little bit which of course is completely natural. In many Asian flicks I think the acting and scripts can feel a bit melodramatic for a western viewer. Not for me though as a long time fan of Asian film. In this movie however not a trace of that can be detected. The form of this epic piece of film history is rather the mellow and minimalistic storytelling of old classic war drama like for an example the excellent Finnish The unknown soldier by Edvin Laine 1955 about another rather unknown part of WWII  the Finnish wars.The score and sound is also powerful and adds to the air created and a couple of scenes are epic unforgettable in their perfect harmony of visual score and emotional strength the scene with the climb to the top to oversee the field of corpses and the scene with the ritualistic dance. Scenes that makes one shiver to the core  pure cinematic ecstasy.The story is simple yet so dense of emotion and complexity in it's slow pacing leading to a inevitable climax. Never pointing fingers never glorifying never picking sides. Just showing the horror of war naked and raw never glutting in blood misery and atrocity nonetheless giving a deep impact on the Viewer.This movie is NOT overrated by the people calling it a genuine masterpiece because it IS. A powerful haunting rendition of a horrific piece of history with believable portrayals of HUMANS rather than sides. Humans affected by and changed by war. Beautifully told in it's awfulness.In a word fantastic.".

The subject matter is profound the acting is topnotch the cinematography is excellent however the pacing is deliberately slow to match the mood of the film making me wonder some time how long I had to suffer through.

	schema:headline " Bearing Witness... to the City of Life and Death";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a harrowing slowmotion sequence in City of Life and Death which encapsulates the experience of this movie for me the shot of a few women in an attic looking up as they realize something dreadful is happening outside followed by a Japanese soldier getting up to inspect his work under the open sky. In this movie the audience is simply and cruelly asked to bear witness to a Conquestinprogress without the comfort of being able to understand or do anything about it. And the basic nature of Conquest is now as always revelling on the ruins of your enemies' civilization to paraphrase the director.So while the film is framed around the Safety Zone established by John Rabe Minnie Vautrin etc. for the first month or so during the conquest of NanjingNanking in World War II the establishment  workings of the Safety Zone is hardly the focus of the movie. Which means unfortunately for gorehounds and hatemongers that the scope of the film is limited when it comes to events happening outside the Safety Zone e.g. the headchopping competition reported like a sports series in Japanese newspapers but perhaps the Japanese should be the ones making movies about their headchopping champions.In other words this is one of those arthouse war movies no Schindler's List doesn't count try La Battaglia di Algeri which will probably disappoint all kinds of people from actionjunkies to historybuffs. And as the movie is filmed in Japanese English German and a variety of Chinese dialects not to mention Mandarin spoken with various accents only speedreaders with an interest in arthouse films should give it a try as most audiences will be readingneeding subtitles most of the time.This is because this movie is a selfdeclared memorial from the film's opening titles to the victims of Nanjing 1937 filled with broken bodies and minds but also imbued with a lifeloving spirit. It may be roughly divided into 3 sections which I will call from the invaders' viewpoint Shock and Awe Rest and Recreation and Mission Accomplished or if you prefer The Men The Women and The Future. The movie proceeds chronologically but there is no real narrative flow to speak of as the audience is put into the shoes of various characters who are not privy to the big picture. There is also no real dramatic or character development to speak of since most these characters are just trying to stay sane or alive. And in this way the movie quietly rises above most genre films including war movies because every single frame of it down to the fictional endcredits is pure cinema.From the realistically mute soundscape barely scored with any music coupled with the crystalclear sounds of live shots and explosions... to the realistically smokey landscape adjusted to monochrome it was filmed in full color catching every grain of dustdirt wandering in and out of focus. Every shot is a window into the blasted hellscape of Nanking. And with very little opportunity for emoting and acting every single cameos like the Caucasian roles would love to see a movie about Minnie Vautrin are given unforgettably sharp and natural characterizations.The first halfhour or so of the film presents the invaders in Shock and Awe mode as they systematically mop up all the resistance and the men in Nanjing giving the audience a chance to take a long hard look at the faces of the refugees prisonersofwar. However the main bulk of the film shows the invaders in Rest and Recreation mode having fun like the youths that they are even at the expense of the women in the Safety Zone. The film concludes with a short epilogue after the collapse of the Safety Zone when the invaders take full control and celebrate their Mission Accomplished but with a symbolic twist at the end shows who really had the last bitter laugh.The fact that this film was released in Mainland China which doesn't have a movierating system may give some the impression that it was made for mainstream or general audiences but it's probably just that Chinese parents are expected to do a bit more homework. So apart than sharing my feelings about this film I would give potential audiences a word or two of advice1 Watch the director Lu Chuan's earlier films like The Mountain Patrol first to get a taste of his film style language as his is a kind of neorealism or cinema verite completely different from the Danish Dogme films or Reality TV designed to immerse the audience in the film environment rather than to convey any plot or character. To make the most out of a mountain of research the director has simply chosen a few significant historical events and created a few fictional composite characters for them to make the audience live through the winter of 1937 in Nanking.2 Do a little research on what was happening in 1937 as well as the Chinese Army's last stand in Shanghai before they gave up China's thencapital Nanking to get a historical perspective of what happened before and during the events in film with some basic historical background in mind it will be easier to understand what is being conveyed by each shot or scene this film is not a substitute for historical research and the director certainly does not claim to have the last word on Nanjing....SPOILERS...P.S. If you didn't get all of the symbolism in the last scene one of them is Fatman and Little Boy.".

There has never been an adequate accounting.This movie is a muchbelated and necessary piece of cinema then. It is also of quite astonishing quality. A Chinese production with an estimated budget of just 12m it is a tourdeforce. By all technical standards it compares extremely favourably with the best of the genre from Hollywood or Europe. Commercial Chinese cinema like much of Chinese production is on a steep learning curve in order to catch up to the longestablished traditions and skills of the Occident. I wasn't expecting much. It came out of the local supermarket brantub. Yet here is a long intricate and extremely proficient work. One is obliged to make allowance for cultural nuances. Some of the scenes detailing relationships are needlessly maudlin for my British tastes though not particularly worse than Hollywood schmaltz. It is yet far more mature and less melodramatic than the German production of 'Stalingrad'. Shot in BW like 'Schindler's List' it instead describes a national holocaust rather than a racial one and is therefore less inclined towards the moral browbeating of Spielberg's overlong Oscar junket.Almost all of the faces are unfamiliar to me and this lends the movie a genuine newsreel experience like the liberation of BergenBelsen or the Cambodian killingfields. There's nothing to spoil here. This movie is about exactly what it says on the box  appalling demonic cruelty and massmurder. It's a missing page of history. But it IS cinema it's not a documentary. It's harrowing and disagreeable viewing. It's flawed but it's also highly competent and professional. Easily a match for 'The Killing Fields' or 'Stalingrad' better than 'Enemy At The Gate' and only a step behind 'Schindler's List'.Chinese cinema has definitely come of age. Recommended. The 'HighFliers' DVD has English subtitles.".

There are lots of stories the director can use. But it just missed. I'd think another documentary Nan King is a bit better in terms of content. However I must say a good thing about this movie is less violent than it can be. If you check out the videos in youtube you will know.I'm not a overwhelming patriot and never have been.I don't need the film to be portrayed from China perspective so long as it stays with facts and balance view. The were goods  bads in Japanese soldiers and so were Chinese. Spending too much time to show a Japanese soldier's remorse is a bit boring and out of proportion. He was only a minority. What's in the mind of the majority Japanese soldiers? This is not revealed. Harmony is the current theme in China. Is this related?Some of the plots are unnecessary too much battle  gunfire...no need. Just like car chase in each standard action movies. Have seen enough of such which did much better. I'd rather to see each main character's individual story.For example some of the Japanese women didn't know what job they were going to do in China when recruited from Japan homeland. They thought they could contribute something to their country  but their job were assigned as prostitutes. This could be a good plot but just missed.Story of the film is a bit weak. The only touching moment is when recruiting 100 women for Japanese soldiers.If you are interested in this movie I'd also recommend you to see Tokyo Trial.".

	schema:headline " Lu's harrowing account of the nastiness imbued within Nanjing's Japanese invasion is a dramatic stern and honest depiction of a dark hour in twentieth century history.";
	schema:reviewBody "City of Life and Death is the sensational bringing to life of the Japanese's massacre or rape as the film itself states in its promotional material of the Chinese people based within the Chinese city of Nanjing a besieging and brutal taking of an urbanised locale quickly reduced to rubble during the Second SinoJapanese War of 1937 through to said conflict's complications and consequent merging with the Allied Pacific campaign of World War II. Chuan Lu's film doesn't just raise awareness indeed put across historical events of which few may be aware of outside of The Far East nor indeed lecture on how terrible everything was whilst pining to a western ignorance in actuality the film rejects a style more synonymous with 2003's Imaging Argentina or 2007's Goodbye Bafana as films observing darker chapters in human rule and instead confronts the issue in an engaging grounded and cinematic manner.It's worth mentioned at this point that despite the material the film looks absolutely stunning an instance much later on as a militarian Japanese bigwig looks on towards us slightly off camera as the stakes that bound those executed moments earlier stand idly behind him a prisoner still tied to one strikes us as an individual image worthy of a Pulitzer winning photographic portfolio. The film covers two principal characters in the early stages Nanjing is yet to fall and we begin on the battlefield outside the city's limits as a young Japanese private named Kadokawa Nakaizumi awakens from passing out and sees the first images postslumber to that of what we see of the film proper. The opening fight sequences between Chinese forces and Imperiast Japense Army troops carry with them highly primal highly tribal and highly medievallike characteristics in that a breaching of a city wall is followed by either band of men standing at opposite ends of a road. They taunt and chant waving whatever weapons they have before one charges the other in a manner more resemblant to that of what large clusters of men centuries ago may have done when sword and shield were the instruments of war that they wielded.As the Japanese close in pockets of resistance and live Chinese plague the area the finding of a large cluster on them in a church bringing about the alerting to the proper authorities whom pounce to the area wielding an airraid siren which laboriously hums away in that way airraid sirens do as if a giant mosquito of some kind swooping down and in ready to suck the life from those whose blood it is will shortly be spilt. In amidst all of this is a Chinese academic and translator whom works for a local German doing his best to save the Chinese through his place of business doubling up as a makeshift hospitalcomesafety zone the man is a certain Mr. Tang Fan a sort of Itzhak Stern to that of the German John Rabe Paisley who uses an uneasy alliance Germany supposedly has at this point with Japan to save and offer sanctuary. One of the more intricate exchanges is a sequence in which Rabe's Nazi armbandplusemblem must be used disparagingly to try and convince a somewhat merciless Japanese official of his authenticity and that he is indeed in league with the man's nation if it means a chance at saving lives.The plight of young Kadokawa represents a more moralised representation of the Japanese at once a trooper there to follow orders the engaging in shoot outs with pockets of Chinese snipers and resistance and the doing of his job gives way to a burning sense of wrongfulness within the operation. Kadokawa's presence and the generality of his strand offers an oppositional viewpoint from the perspective of what is effectively the enemy content preventing the film from merely demonising the Japanese nor indeed constructing an anonymous faceless machinelike representation of them. Kadokawa's overlying detachment is highlighted during an exchange with a local Chinese prostitute his inability to properly engage with her for means men essentially frequent her forces the woman into driving proceedings and stands in stark contrast to manya other Japanese soldiers quite willingly able to commit war rape a distinction alienating Kadokawa from his peers and suggesting at an alternate mindset one that is not a rampaging masked face of evil.Lu in no way holds back from some of the more sterner content one might expect bloody wartime violence imbued throughout and barely giving way to anything else the meticulous attention to the precise Japanese techniques used in liquidising and cleansing the city of those deemed the enemy shown at great lengths the lengths to which Lu and his production team go in recreating sanctioned off spaces of dirt harbouring the Chinese prisoners penned in by wooded fences and wire quite frightening as are the finer attentions to details a long wooded bamboo cane used to cut a disparate pack of wouldbe inmates into separate clans consisting of those ready to be heaved off for execution and those whom must suffer some other means of fate particularly memorable. The sequences of death and mass destruction carry with them an eerie atmosphere of acceptance a torch bearer making his way to a fuel drenched building full of prisoners seeing those nearer the boarded up exits wielding resigned looks on their faces. Lu's film hits all the right notes it is a film that allows its characters to walk alone down bombed out and destroyed streets pondering a decision which will have great ramifications. It is a natural film an honest film a film willing to have a character confront his captain after having just witnessed him executed a prisoner and enquire as to whether it was necessary  those involved in its production deserve immense praise.".

The film covers two principal characters in the early stages Nanjing is yet to fall and we begin on the battlefield outside the city's limits as a young Japanese private named Kadokawa Nakaizumi awakens from passing out and sees the first images postslumber to that of what we see of the film proper. The opening fight sequences between Chinese forces and Imperiast Japense Army troops carry with them highly primal highly tribal and highly medievallike characteristics in that a breaching of a city wall is followed by either band of men standing at opposite ends of a road. They taunt and chant waving whatever weapons they have before one charges the other in a manner more resemblant to that of what large clusters of men centuries ago may have done when sword and shield were the instruments of war that they wielded.As the Japanese close in pockets of resistance and live Chinese plague the area the finding of a large cluster on them in a church bringing about the alerting to the proper authorities whom pounce to the area wielding an airraid siren which laboriously hums away in that way airraid sirens do as if a giant mosquito of some kind swooping down and in ready to suck the life from those whose blood it is will shortly be spilt. In amidst all of this is a Chinese academic and translator whom works for a local German doing his best to save the Chinese through his place of business doubling up as a makeshift hospitalcomesafety zone the man is a certain Mr. Tang Fan a sort of Itzhak Stern to that of the German John Rabe Paisley who uses an uneasy alliance Germany supposedly has at this point with Japan to save and offer sanctuary. One of the more intricate exchanges is a sequence in which Rabe's Nazi armbandplusemblem must be used disparagingly to try and convince a somewhat merciless Japanese official of his authenticity and that he is indeed in league with the man's nation if it means a chance at saving lives.The plight of young Kadokawa represents a more moralised representation of the Japanese at once a trooper there to follow orders the engaging in shoot outs with pockets of Chinese snipers and resistance and the doing of his job gives way to a burning sense of wrongfulness within the operation. Kadokawa's presence and the generality of his strand offers an oppositional viewpoint from the perspective of what is effectively the enemy content preventing the film from merely demonising the Japanese nor indeed constructing an anonymous faceless machinelike representation of them. Kadokawa's overlying detachment is highlighted during an exchange with a local Chinese prostitute his inability to properly engage with her for means men essentially frequent her forces the woman into driving proceedings and stands in stark contrast to manya other Japanese soldiers quite willingly able to commit war rape a distinction alienating Kadokawa from his peers and suggesting at an alternate mindset one that is not a rampaging masked face of evil.Lu in no way holds back from some of the more sterner content one might expect bloody wartime violence imbued throughout and barely giving way to anything else the meticulous attention to the precise Japanese techniques used in liquidising and cleansing the city of those deemed the enemy shown at great lengths the lengths to which Lu and his production team go in recreating sanctioned off spaces of dirt harbouring the Chinese prisoners penned in by wooded fences and wire quite frightening as are the finer attentions to details a long wooded bamboo cane used to cut a disparate pack of wouldbe inmates into separate clans consisting of those ready to be heaved off for execution and those whom must suffer some other means of fate particularly memorable. The sequences of death and mass destruction carry with them an eerie atmosphere of acceptance a torch bearer making his way to a fuel drenched building full of prisoners seeing those nearer the boarded up exits wielding resigned looks on their faces. Lu's film hits all the right notes it is a film that allows its characters to walk alone down bombed out and destroyed streets pondering a decision which will have great ramifications. It is a natural film an honest film a film willing to have a character confront his captain after having just witnessed him executed a prisoner and enquire as to whether it was necessary  those involved in its production deserve immense praise.";

	schema:reviewBody "The story of the first six months or so of the Rape of Nanking in 1937 and 1938. We begin with the battle for the city from there we witness the fall of Chinese forces and the Japanese attempts to take the spoils of war. Most of the film is the attempts of the population to simply survive. Its is a heart rending tale about death the destruction and rebirth of the human spirit and of life. Its is a deeply moving episodic tale and one of the best films of the year.Where do I begin? Perhaps with the beautiful black and white photography that paints a haunting picture of life and death. Color is wildly over rated and the simple black and white images allow so much more to be said. Color would simply have gotten away. This is a film where every image is a masterpiece. Its a film that should be hung on the wall even the death and destruction because its so beautiful. and that is kicker even though the images are so beautiful they are deeply deeply troubling. We are moved even though somethings are too pretty or perhaps because they are. The director and his crew are clearly aware they are making a movie watch the drum ritual in the last part of the movie there is no doubt that this is a movie and yet you are moved by the images. No you are moved by the story and the people in the images by using the medium we have a film that is in some ways more real then a straight documentary would have been.The film often takes the form of a documentary.. The camera seems to capturing events as they happen. The 40 minute battle for the city that opens the film is shot in such away that one could believe it was real. there is no music only the battle for the city. The sequences of the rapes of time with the comfort women and many of the atrocities and deaths are filmed as if we are there witnessing the terrible events few cut aways no swelling music for effect just the horror before us. It is stark an indictment of not only the events that happened 70 years ago but also an indictment of all wars. If you go to war these things will happen it seems to be saying with images that mirror recent conflicts. It is a message that can not be said enough.Forgive me its hard to describe this episodic film so that it will do it justice. Its told in connected parts that are separated by letters and post cards from inside the city. We follow several characters the Chinese secretary of John Rabe a German citizen trapped in the city who was in charge of the international zone which was turned into a safe haven. We see his family and those around them.There is one of the women on the board of refugees. We follow Japanese Sargent who isn't happy with all that is going on around him. We see occasionally one of the comfort women the Sargent sees a couple of times. At the start follow a soldier fighting the Chinese and his side kick a young boy. There are other flashes of characters who come and go and fill in the mosaic of the tale. Its not the entire story or anyone persons story its the tale of the city and what happened.I liked that everyone is seen in various lights. We have a Japanese soldier with doubts to be sure but he's not the only one. We see hesitation in many of the Japanese. This isn't to say they aren't bad they are but they are shown to be more than just monsters.It makes the horrors that transpire all that more troubling. And we see some less than brilliant moves on the part of some of the Chinese moves that they hoped would work in their favor and instead ended up working against them.This is a deeply moving deeply disturbing film. Its as antiwar as you can get. there is great horror from the normal horrors of war to numerous and frequent graphic rapes nastiness involving children and pretty much every kind of cruelty you can think of. A sequence where the women in the international zone are brought into a church and told that one hundred of them must go with the Japanese to be comfort women is has harrowing as sequence in any film since the women know that they are going off to a fate worse then death. And yet there is weird kind of hope in the sequence and in the film. By some women choosing to go they bought time for the other women. From death life.The film is filled with many sequences where from death some life comes. From some darkness there is light. As bleak and hopeless as things appear there is often some ray of hope among the darkness. Indeed as the film makes clear the war ended the Japanese left and China and humanity survived. From death life.Words of description are futile just as any mention of the films flaws is.All I can say that really counts is see this film. See this and prepared to be moved.".

	schema:headline " Marred only by one thing";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometime between 1979 and today filmmakers have lost the ability to tell a suspenseful story to flesh out characters so that today we see more style than substance more gore and mayhem than plot development.The Day of the Jackal Marathon Man Eye of the Needle The Boys From Brazil and others will be labeled boring by many here because they must wait for something to happen. A typical example from Odessa is the reunion scene. Voight infiltrates the meeting of old German soldiers make that old devoted Nazis gathering in a beer hall. He snaps a photo of the speaker shouting what sounds like the words of the prewar Deutschland uber Alles. One man comes and begins his eviction from the hall. In the next scene we see him nursing his wounds which are far more serious than the pushes we see. Tell me that today we would not witness a brutal beating punch by punch kick by kick.Films then used violence to advance the plot such as the Is it safe? interrogation in Marathon Man. Seventies films are no shorter than today's masterpieces but so much more intricate plot is compressed into their time frame.Three Days of the Jackal is a perfect telling of a Forsyth book we never become involved with the characters but watch in fascination. Here we follow Miller Voight giving us a horse in the race. I have reservations about the final confrontation with Schell and Miller's motivations but I have none about the story in general.Only in the score does Odessa fall short the music sounds almost if it was added as an afterthought and does nothing to enhance moods or foreshadow scenes. Worse the score seems the beginning of a pattern that continues to this day where in some scenes the music is the main character. Only the bierhall singing of the old Nazis sounds appropriate.I rated the film 8 of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sometime between 1979 and today filmmakers have lost the ability to tell a suspenseful story to flesh out characters so that today we see more style than substance more gore and mayhem than plot development.The Day of the Jackal Marathon Man Eye of the Needle The Boys From Brazil and others will be labeled boring by many here because they must wait for something to happen. A typical example from Odessa is the reunion scene. Voight infiltrates the meeting of old German soldiers make that old devoted Nazis gathering in a beer hall. He snaps a photo of the speaker shouting what sounds like the words of the prewar Deutschland uber Alles. One man comes and begins his eviction from the hall. In the next scene we see him nursing his wounds which are far more serious than the pushes we see. Tell me that today we would not witness a brutal beating punch by punch kick by kick.Films then used violence to advance the plot such as the Is it safe? interrogation in Marathon Man. Seventies films are no shorter than today's masterpieces but so much more intricate plot is compressed into their time frame.Three Days of the Jackal is a perfect telling of a Forsyth book we never become involved with the characters but watch in fascination.

	schema:reviewBody "You could do a lot of worse things than spend two hours indulging in the ODESSA file. This 1974 production was the second of Frederick Forsyth's trilogy of books that were put onto the big screen in the 70's. Although made in1974 the events meant to be are depicted are supposed to be about 10 years earlier. ODESSA was an organization created by Nazis to help former high profile Germans and members of the SS escape accountability after Germany's defeat in WW II. You would be given false papers new identities passports etc and many of them made their way to South America . The most popular destination was Argentina whose Peronist regime made no secret of it's admiration for Hitler and the Nazi way of thinking. This only made Argentina's defeat at the hands of the British in the 1982 Falklands war that much more satisfying! It's a docuthriller movie lead by actor John Voight who had been elevated to stardom by Midnight Cowboy and Deliverance. He plays Peter Miller a struggling Journalist who was looking to land the big story and is financially supported by his girlfriend Sigi who works at one of Hamburg's nightspots.After a routine check on a story of a suicide he is given a diary and documents from the deceased who as it turns out was survivor of a Nazi concentration camp. He takes his own life after seeing one of his former tormentors Eduard Roschmann a former camp commandant swanking it up in and exclusive restaurant in Hamburg without a care in the world. What drives him over the top is when he reports this he finds little sympathy from the West German authorities who seem either indifferent and try to fob him off.After reading an horrific and graphic account of the mans experience at the hands Roschmann a sickened Muller embarks on his own investigation. He soon discovers the real motives for the ODESSA organization and delves further into this only to the disdain of friends and loved ones who fear for his safety. Soon he also gains the attention of members of the ODESSA organization who don't approve of his meddling. He manages to sneak into a reunion for former soldiers from a crack Panzer division but unfortunately draws attention to himself. The beating that is handed out as well as an attempt on his life only emboldens him to carry on now knowing he is on to something? He also arouses the attention from members of MOSAD Israels equivalent of the CIA whose job is to track down former Nazis and dispose of them. After satisfying the Israels that he is not a Nazi they help him try to infiltrate ODESSA under an alias so he can track down Roschman who by this time he has is own personal score to settle. While reading the former survivors account it appears Roschman may have had something to do with his fathers death who at the time was a decorated soldier in the German army during WWII. So it's off to the races can Muller get to Roschmann and find out who else is in ODESSA's secret file before they get to him! You get the impression that this was inspired by the capture of Eichmann and the wish to track down Joseph Mengelie a notorious Nazi physician. It's important that in the 1960's and even 70's many former Germans from WWII were still alive at this time and many of them not only escaped justice but managed to wrangle cushy numbers in business industry and even in government under new identities. How widespread this really was I'm not sure I suppose many lower level Nazi party members did manage to start up their careers again although those who committed the real acts were probably better off trying to get out of the country where I suppose ODESSA came in a sort of club south America for Germans wanting to get away from it all. The scene in the beer hall during the reunion is a real party piece. Still reveling in nostalgia about the glory days where Germany was feared and respected as they swept all before them the frenzied gathering is finishes off by singing a rousing rendition of one of the German army's marching songs. In another scene when Muller visits Simon Weisentile a well known Nazi hunter who made it his life's work to bring them to justice he tells Muller that money was not a problem for ODESSA. Under the streets of Zurich were paved with gold presumably gold and other stuff that was looted by the Germans from their Jewish victims how ironic! Over all not bad movie  Voight was convincing as a German being blond and blue eyed and Maximilian Schell delivers a powerful performance as the arrogant and sadistic butcher Roschmann. It's certainly worth a watch!".

	schema:headline " A gripping thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "This thriller opens in 1963 with a brief prologue where we see Israeli intelligence officers discussing an Egyptian plan to launch a biochemical attack on Israel the only thing the Egyptians require is a missile component being made in West Germany. The action then moves to West Germany where Peter Miller a freelance reporter with an eye for a story follows an ambulance only to discover it was just going to an old man who had committed suicide. The next day the investigating police officer gives Peter the old man's dairy thinking it might make a human interest story... it does far more than that though it tells of how he had survived Riga concentration camp where he'd seen his wife killed at the orders of camp commandant Eduard Roschmann the dairy goes on to allege that Roschmann is still alive having been given a new identity by an organisation known as ODESSA. Having read the dairy Miller is determined to find Roschmann and expose ODESSA it soon becomes clear it reaches deep into the West German state and it isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. With few clues in Germany he heads to Vienna to see Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal not long after that he is approached by Israeli intelligence they have a plan to send him undercover into ODESSA a dangerous task where exposure could mean death but success could destroy ODESSA.Most thrillers seem to be packed with action however this one keeps things tense with a feeling of almost constant danger this means when the few action scenes do come they feel more intense. Jon Voight does a fine job as protagonist Peter Miller it was good to have a thriller about Nazis where the hero is German even if he isn't played by one! Maximilian Schell only has a fairly small role as Roschmann but he makes the character quite chilling due to the way he first denies having anything to do with the slaughter in Riga then making out that it was nothing important then finally boasting of the greatness of the SS. The story is well told and kept me gripped from the moment we learnt the contents of the old man's dairy... just the time Miller got gripped by the story too! If there is a flaw it was the suddenness of the end and the way he managed to find Roschmann alone in a castle still the story demanded that they be alone together for their final talk so that improbability can be forgiven. Overall this is definitely worth watching if you like your thrillers tense and don't demand nonstop action and special effects.".

	onyx:emotionText "This thriller opens in 1963 with a brief prologue where we see Israeli intelligence officers discussing an Egyptian plan to launch a biochemical attack on Israel the only thing the Egyptians require is a missile component being made in West Germany. The action then moves to West Germany where Peter Miller a freelance reporter with an eye for a story follows an ambulance only to discover it was just going to an old man who had committed suicide. The next day the investigating police officer gives Peter the old man's dairy thinking it might make a human interest story... it does far more than that though it tells of how he had survived Riga concentration camp where he'd seen his wife killed at the orders of camp commandant Eduard Roschmann the dairy goes on to allege that Roschmann is still alive having been given a new identity by an organisation known as ODESSA.

Not to be confused with the later weaker Nazihunting potboiler Boys From Brazil though the reallife Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal is a character in both Odessa File benefits from a very involving opening and a clever cathartic twist of a closer though the twoplushour film gets soggier than sauerkraut much of the time in between.Are we speaking German in this movie or English? Director Ronald Neame can't seem to make up his mind and it's a bit disconcerting to hear an old German army vet give a speech in accented English before his comrades break into a Teutonic singalong. Voight often seems lost in a film where he is bounced around like a pinball his gaze like that of a deer in the headlights albeit a righteous deer. A lot of the actors around him similarly feel unmotivated even the great Maximilian Schell who plays Miller's chief prey a former camp commandant named Eduard Roschmann. Efficient though Roschmann may be there are some gaping holes in the Nazi secondary Miller more stumbles through than exploits.The Odessa File also has one of the oddest movie scores fronted by a credit theme which as all taut thrillers must features Perry Como and a children's Christmas chorus. I kid you not. The incidental music is electronically processed '70s drivel that seems more suited for Logan's Run and was the brainchild of none other than Andrew Lloyd Webber apparently wanting to try something different while waiting for inspiration for another libretto to strike thenpartner Tim Rice.But the film does deliver in the suspense department setting up a nicely paranoid atmosphere wherein the sweet woman sent by the police to look after your girlfriend could be a spy helping a team of killers track you down. It may oversell the reach of the real ODESSA a Nazi relocation group in West Germany but the screen treatment is at times quite gripping and believable and of course features Nazis as bad guys which seldom fails for entertainment.You understand a bit of the mania behind Miller's actions if not exactly his methods when you see in flashback the way Roschmann handles his captives at Riga. Even after Schindler's List and other films have presented the same material in more graphic fashion there's a lot of power in the scene of a woman looking at her husband before the door of a deadly truck closes over her face or a moment when Roschmann toys with a man awaiting execution for a giggle.If it's not as good as Forsyth's book the film suffers from the same faults. The improbability of the scenes grows more apparent with repeat viewings but a firsttimer will likely be too involved much of the time to pay this much mind. And like the novel Odessa File the movie has a good heart. And what an ending! Don't let anyone spoil that for you if you are the least bit tempted about seeing this see it for yourself.".

Maximilian Schell also gives a terrific performance in his portrayal of the malevolent fiendish SS captain.The Odessa File is directed by Ronald Neame the film is well shot and edited. It deals with real world atrocities that have been mixedadapted with different namesplaces for the most part. It's an effective political thriller the film manages to keep it's plot constantly moving and involving even if at times it feels like it's treating its subject matter a bit too safe. The film doesn't have too many memorable moments or scenes to make itself standout in a time where political thrillers were dominant during the 1970s. It doesn't have the same ferocious impact as a film like Marathon Man. The Odessa File falls slightly short of the heights of the best political thrillers of the 1970s. It still is an Interesting film and one that deserves to be discovered again.".

Jon Voight's acting is strong although his German accent isn't entirely convincing and may make you laugh at times. The supporting cast is fairly fluffy at times and so the movie really hinges on Voight and the story itself. You cannot go too far wrong when adapting a film from a Frederick Forsythe novel. A case in point would be 'The Day of The Jackal' which is based on another Forsythe novel. This movie fails if compared to the Day of the Jackal and finds itself more akin to 'The Holcroft Covenant'.The movie skips along fairly fast and one can tell that there is much from the original story that has been cut and even the ending comes as a bit of a jolt. It still is a great movie that I am sure you will enjoy if you like spythrillers and the great cinema of the 1970's.".

It is certainly true that there have been some attempts to make thrillers like this nowadays but most of the time the spirit and atmosphere do not come even close Jackal remake is the perfect example. The way of making movies is simply different audience nowadays wants spectacular action scenes simply strong plot is not enough anymore.I do not know to what extent is the movie based on reality but I would suspect it is like half fictitious half real. Anyway there is almost everything believable except the idea suggested in the movie that the network of former Nazi top guys would be so strong even in 60's denazified Germany. Anyway although all aspects of the plot do not have to correspond with reality the movie can still be regarded as superb postwar thriller that belongs to the top of its genre even almost 30 years after it was made.810 for some unnecessary scenes.".

Anyway although all aspects of the plot do not have to correspond with reality the movie can still be regarded as superb postwar thriller that belongs to the top of its genre even almost 30 years after it was made.810 for some unnecessary scenes.";

Compared to the craftsmanship which most modern Hollywood thrillers are made by one could argue that most films from the seventies regardless of any genre are head and shoulders above what they make today.But as a seventies thriller compared to similar films from that period it's just slightly above average.

The presence throughout of Ernst Rhm is naturally the most remarkable feature usually at Hitler's side but otherwise not unduly prominent the film overall contains mercifully far less speeches  and marching  although there do seem to be more rather more shots of Goebbels this time round. After years of being accustomed to seeing the aerial view of the threesome of Hitler Himmler and Lutze Rhm's tame replacement as head of the SA approaching the Ehrenhalle in 'Triumph' the sight of just Hitler and Rhm giving the salute comes as a jolt. The presence of ViceChancellor Papen soon to be sidelined by the Fhrer until collared by the Allies in 1945 and brought back to Nuremberg as one of the defendants reminds us that this is still very early days for the New Order and Riefenstahl occasionally cuts to a suitably overwhelmed looking Italian delegation.Two amusing moments depicting the Fhrer caught slightly offguard are early on when he immediately thrusts a bouquet of flowers two little girls have just presented to him in Rudolf Hess's direction and the unaccustomed slouching posture he adopts while the leader of the Hitler Youth Baldur von Schirach attempts to quieten them down so that he can begin his address.".

After all many of the public domain films on the site have links on IMDb...and I followed the links to the site so I could download the pictures for free. In this case however there is no link on IMDb and I found Victory of the Faith by looking about archive.org. It's certainly NOT a typical film for the site and the story behind it is listed here on IMDb. This is apparently Leni Riefenstahl's first propaganda movie she made for the Nazi party and she would later go on to make the notorious pictures Triumph of the Will and Olympia...and effectively curtailed her career because she appeared to be a Hitlerlover. Sure she later went on to make some small films but her days as a mover and shaker in the industry were gone after the war. Plus no matter what she later said she certainly did seem to admire Hitler and did her best to show him and the party in the best possible light! I've seen just about all her other films including the two others I mentioned but until I recently found this one I assumed Victory of the Faith was a lost film. Read the IMDb trivia to find out how it became 'unlost'! After reading you'll understand why this copy is a bit poor as well as how historically significant it is.What follows is a long and relatively dull film showing the Nazis at their rally at Nuremburg just after Hitler and the Nazis assumed power over Germany. You'll see a veritable smorgasbord of evil Nazis though for some reason Heinrich Himler is absent. Additionally a delegation of Italian Fascists are on hand to sing the praises of Hitler. And of course there's Hitler doing what he does bestwhipping up the crowds. Much of the film is essentially silent with added martial music. According to the film's intro Riefenstahl didn't film the events herself but pieced together footage from the German press. Regardless it's effective propaganda by some evil folks that is mostly of interest to historians or those who are intrigued by Rieenstahl and her sad legacy. Hard to rate...but interesting.".

After reading you'll understand why this copy is a bit poor as well as how historically significant it is.What follows is a long and relatively dull film showing the Nazis at their rally at Nuremburg just after Hitler and the Nazis assumed power over Germany. You'll see a veritable smorgasbord of evil Nazis though for some reason Heinrich Himler is absent. Additionally a delegation of Italian Fascists are on hand to sing the praises of Hitler. And of course there's Hitler doing what he does bestwhipping up the crowds. Much of the film is essentially silent with added martial music. According to the film's intro Riefenstahl didn't film the events herself but pieced together footage from the German press. Regardless it's effective propaganda by some evil folks that is mostly of interest to historians or those who are intrigued by Rieenstahl and her sad legacy. Hard to rate...but interesting.";

Propaganda movies were still a really new thing and you could see how this one still lacked the qualities of Riefenstahl's later works. It is also not as epic somehow. I think these films are interesting documents of their time nonetheless in terms of the historical context. Yes the contents are despicable and demagogic but these films are still a chance to learn about history and understand what was going on as absurd as it may be. All in all I thought this was nonetheless not a particularly interesting watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Blde Mtze! is a German 1.5hour film from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary this year already but to me it felt newer. The writer and director is Johannes Schmid and it is probably his most known work still. It is a comingofage movie that is mostly for younger audiences teenagers etc. but those grownups young at heart will also have a fairly good time watching. Just like I did. The focus here is on a boy who gets to a new school and we find out how he makes friends with a girl and boy who initially seemed like his enemy. The film is never preaching anything actually it depicts these characters as rather unlikable such as the main character's mother. At least she came off like that to me. All the kids mostly struggle with the problems their parents got really and their friendship is an anchor that helps them to deal. But when developments have a negative impact on their friendship as well things look pretty bad. This is perhaps when the film is at its weakest too it becomes slightly generic and predictable there and also goes over the top with the drama near the end the potential drowning scene the heart attack especially and then the rushedin solution eventually. But the 70 minutes before that were really convincing and they did feel nicely realistic I must say. I very much enjoyed the film and all the actors made a good job too. Hey they even gave Moniva Ivancal a tolerable part and she was working which is pretty impressive as she is very unlikable to me and also not an actress in my opinion. The most known cast member is probably Julia Koschitz but she only appears in one scene. The film belongs 100 to the kids and they prove that they have the talent when they are not in films with horrible scripts like the Wilde Kerle franchise. I also liked Eisleb a lot in the Frau Holle film she made after this one here. It's a shame they apparently all chose other career paths away from the film industry. But if it makes them happy then I am happy. I give this film here known internationally as Silly's Sweet Summer another reference to how one boy calls the other I believe a thumbsup. It is really worth checking out thanks to the good writing and authenticity from start to almost finish and actually that last scene really made me want to go for a swim. Go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "While this film ISN'T as famous as DUCK SOUP or A NIGHT AT THE OPERA it's my personal favorite. I think it's probably because unlike these other two pictures there isn't all the singing and dancing in HORSE FEATHERS plus it has at least as much energy as any other film they made. Plus unlike THE COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS there is a real honesttogoodness plot!!! So it's not just one gag after another after another.Groucho is wonderful as the incompetent and perpetually horny Professor Wagstaff at Huxley College. Plus as idiots mistaken for professional ringers Chico and Harpo are at their best. Oh and I guess Zeppo is in the movie but as in all their early Zeppo films he is pretty much a nonentity. You can really see why he never caught on as one of the Marx Brothers nor did his other brother Karl who was by far the LEAST funny Marx Brother. About the only negative about the film is the climactic football game. Even for a Marx Brothers film this does get a little too stupid! But the rest of the movie is so good you really don't mind.UPDATE I just saw this film on the big screen and upon viewing it again I am reducing the score to 8. Yes it is good for the Marx Brothers but the plot such as it is is barely a plot at all the film's ending is bizarre and senseless and a few of the jokes a bit less funny after rewatching. Still good and still worth seeing if you just turn off your brain and enjoy all the nonsense.".

Groucho and Zeppo are the new college president and his son while Harpo and Chico arrive from a nearby neighborhood in time to add their own kind of confusion.  The campus setting allows them to satirize many aspects of college life and there are some good offcampus scenes as well most memorably the 'swordfish' scene in the speakeasy.

	schema:reviewBody "I was challenged by a reader because I wrote that a movie was funny. His belief was that the movie wasn't funny that it couldn't be because the comedians were too old and I wouldn't know in any case because I was also too old. So I turned to the good old Marx Brothers.Fortunately some other unhappy soul had deleted my comment for this movie so I can write a replacement.I think this is funny. It shouldn't really matter to me whether anyone else does except insofar as they support the market forces that guarantee I can access it. But as it happens lots of other people also think it funny and I wonder why.Horse Feathers if you do not know was the frontier term for split boards about two feet long that were nailed on barns in an overlapping fashion like shingles. These were primitive but had the advantage of keeping your major investment your horse warm. They are themselves ad hoc somewhat random with some order and an effective container. Such a barn was wholly manmade but clearly the mind finds it handy to make the joke that if the barn looked like a chicken then its name should follow.Lexicographers know that language often naturally grows from these jokes. The older the term gets the deeper the joke horsefeathers probably originated in the 187080's homesteading era and gained popularity as farm boys from those areas were mixed into the WW I army the term used as a substitute for one whose use would have been punished for insubordination. It subsequently entered the print world when used in Wilson's second presidential campaign.A youngster with no knowledge of its origin would simply hear nonsense. but a wizened farmer would recall the image of a building that looks ridiculous like a chicken. He would have recalled chuckling when thinking what part of the chicken he would enter and exit each day when doing his chores. It would contribute to giving his life enough richness to keep going.I believe that the best humor is humor like this. It combines small twists of language with implied bigger twists of incited images. And it gets warmer and deeper and funnier the more you live with it.The first language and image is what the Marx brothers invented in cinema. These guys had honed a stage act based on clever language  timing twists perspectives implied by stereotypes. Its all in the words. But they were able to bring it to us in a frantic ad hoc visual manner so that we could have a blizzard of images like the feathered barn the images themselves feathered together in a sort of story.Eye and mind played with and played through practice. These masters were not kids. Groucho by the time this was made was 43. He got funnier every year after that in working with these sorts of ad libbed word images. His secret word bit in You Bet your Life was even a part of this. These I think are basic to the both the notion of what makes cinema work folded images and narrative and what makes humor attractive naming enriched by ambiguous image. If you want to know yourself you navigate through your cupboard of these that you have collected. You go to school. You play the game. You can only do this and truly laugh if you are old enough or young and aggressive enough in collecting to have something to rumble around in.Marx brothers old school funny. At least to me. This is one of their Paramount projects before being reinvented again by MGM. More random more eggs.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

On the other hand HORSE FEATHERS does preserve for posterity some of the Marx Brothers' finest routines. Groucho has never been better as a crazy professor charged with the responsibility of rescuing a poor school his dialog fairly crackles with oneliners and he is a past master at handling mocklove scenes. Harpo has his fair share of visual setpieces notably when he leads a police officer a merry dance in and around his dogcatcher's van. He also has the chance for one of his harp solos. Chico enjoys himself most during a speakeasy scene when he and the other two brothers have great fun with the socalled 'secret' password. He gets to play the piano in another specialty number. The ending is a bit weak with a crazy football game stretching the audiences' credibility to the limit but all in all the film is great fun the humor stands up well eight decades later.".

	schema:reviewBody "Groucho takes control of Huxley College and gives football priority over everything else.  That gives this hilarious satire a current edge overshadowing its more dated elements like prohibition.  Besides that this is the only film actually starring the FOUR Marx Brothers.  Zeppo's role remains small but he has definite presence and provides key plot points.  He even gets to sing Everyone Says I Love You written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.  In fact each brother takes a turn at that same song using different lyrics with Harpo whistling of course in an effort to win sexy Thelma Todd's heart among other things.  This gives their musical numbers an integrity that's often missing even in A Night at the Opera. Still I'm not recommending the film for its musical content.  Simply stated Horse Feathers has some of the funniest wordplay ever written. Its wit is equal parts clever and corny but never falls into the category of stupid.  Combine this verbal mastery with outrageous and startling sight gags and you have a winner for the ages.  My only complaint is that no one seems to have a complete print.  Both the tape and DVD versions are missing some Harpo footage during a scene where the brothers converge in Thelma Todd's apartment.  This same scene is nearly ruined by excessive splices. You need a shooting script to understand the dialogue.  Yet even with these technical imperfections Horse Feathers remains a must see.  It's the best and purest example of Marxist comedy.  Duck Soup while brilliant has nearly as much Leo McCarey in it as Marx Brothers.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing but Duck Soup remains the only film I can easily see influences from past or then contemporary comedians.  Again that's why I place Horse Feathers first for its purity.".

I suppose I feel a special connection with this film mostly because I watch it and think this is the exact same kind of film that me and my friends would make. I know that had I lived in the 30's and been fortunate enough to be a Marx I would have been right up there with them. This is the film that really brings you in and makes you form a special relationship with the Marxes. Horse Feathers makes you feel like you're part of the action and incredibly close to the characters as though you are right there in the scene with them.".

Edna was born in Milwaukee her father died when she was very young she never had an adopted sister who was herself illegitimate. Because Edna suffered from respiratory disease she was sent to Fort Worth Texas when she was seven years old to live with her aunt and uncle. She and her husband Sam were married in Gainseville after which they moved to Wolfe City where they bought a mill to manufacture Gladiola brand flour. They were childless.Edna began her work in helping impoverished and homeless children soon after moving to Wolfe City where she started a crusade to clean up the county poor farm during which she arranged to have homeless children moved to the Morris Children's Home and Aid Society in Fort Worth. She joined the Society's Board in 1910. She then made trips to settlement houses in Chicago and New York City to study their methods when she returned she set up a day nursery for working mothers the movie has her setting up the nursery first when in fact this happened seven or eight years after she became involved in child welfare issues. As in the movie Sam's business failed in 1924 whereupon they moved to Fort Worth where Edna continued her work in child welfare. In 1927 she was named superintendent of the Texas Children's Home and Aid Society. Sam died in 1935 after rebuilding his business. Edna spent the rest of her life advocating for children concentrating on placing homeless and abandoned children with adoptive families. She also expanded the Society to provide health care for unwed mothers and an adoption service for their children. The Society later bought a maternity hospital that it named the Gladney Center.I loved Greer Garson in this movie she is strong brave and gracious. I just wish the director and producers of this movie had used a script that portrayed the real life of Edna Gladney rather than resorting to the fictitious adopted sister who kills herself and inventing a nonexistent son who dies in an accident to explain her motives. Edna was her own person who was genuinely involved in her life's work from her early 20s until she died in 1961  the movie didn't need these madeup people to explain why she became involved in child welfare issues.".

If there acting is terrible or limited I talk about that. If a story is bad I will mention that So why am I being picked on? IMDB? When one of my reviews gets deleted IMDB will not even tell me what someone found offensive. Well on to this review.I have never herd of this film it was part of 4 DVD pack of what Warner Brothers Stated as  Four Holiday Classic Films. Well if it was never in the pack I would never would have watched it. I think Warner Brothers thinks this film qualifies as a Christmas Movie because the first scene and last ends on Christmas. Truth be told both scenes together are no more then about 10 of the screen time.he story is a highly fictionalized telling of the story of Edna Gladney an early advocate for the rights of illegitimate children in Texas.Edna Kahly Greer Garson and her adopted sister Charlotte Marsha Hunt are to be married. But when Charlotte's motherinlawtobe discovers that Charlotte was a foundling she declares the wedding must not occur and Charlotte kills herself from shame. Meanwhile Edna falls for a brash cashier Sam Gladney at the bank and eventually marries him and moves with him to his home state of Texas.Sam Gladney has a flour mill in Sherman Texas and at first the couple has an idyllic life though after a difficult delivery Sam is told Edna must have no more children. Several years later their son dies and Sam's effort to ease the pain she still endures by trying to get her to adopt a foundling fails. But the little girl's story touches Edna's heart and she starts a day care center for the children of working women.The film is good not great but it is highly enjoyable. It is also a study on how this country treated children who came into this world with a single mother. It also shows how adoption was looked down upon. Very sad. Now what is great about this film is that it does keep you glued. It also shows a young girl becoming a full fledged woman who takes on the government and forces them to look at what labels do to people and how labels follow you from cradle to grave.Not for everyone. Most people under 40 might get bored. Adults who like to see a story unfold will be in for a treat.Well worth watching!".

In fact they come and go quickly and that's nice because it makes this more of an upbeat movie with a positive message. That's the intent so why dwell on the negatives?The only negatives in my opinion were too much usage of the word darling to the point where it's annoying and the last scene is drawn out a bit too much.

	schema:headline " Inspiring story of a 20th century saint";
	schema:reviewBody "Edna Gladney 1881  1961 was among a handful of selfless saints of the 20th century who gave their lives to helping others especially the needy downtrodden abandoned and unwanted. Gladney was a native of Wisconsin who moved to Texas and married a businessman there. Although much of her family and early life are highly fictionalized in the film she did not have an adopted sister who committed suicide nor a son who died as a boy she was moved by the plight of orphans abandoned children and those born out of wedlock as unwanted. She unselfishly dedicated the rest of her life to helping and caring for such children. The acting and portrayal as scripted in this film are fantastic. Edna Gladney was a great person and Greer Garson gave tremendous heart to her role. As the film shows Edna Gladney had her detractors for her humanitarian efforts. There were some in society then who looked on orphans and abandoned children as outcasts misfits and something less than human. Nor was her work easy. She struggled for many years to raise the funds to support her Texas home for children. She met apathy among many in the public and endured the criticism of those who opposed helping the downtrodden. Today Gladney is recognized as a true hero and humanitarian. Movies were also made about two other such heroes with similar stories in the 20th century. Father Edward Flanagan was a priest who founded Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska to take in boys from the streets and the courts. Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney starred in a 1938 movie about Boys Town.

Thankfully most people are not too quick to dismiss the good of such modern day saints as Mother Teresa Father Flanagan and Edna Gladney. And of course those are only a few of the many who lived in the last century whose inspiring life stories serve as good examples to spur all of us on to give and to help others. Thanks to the writers and the film industry leaders who brought these inspiring stories and others to the screen. This is a wonderful movie about a modern day hero with an excellent performance by Greer Garson.".

	onyx:emotionText "Edna Gladney 1881  1961 was among a handful of selfless saints of the 20th century who gave their lives to helping others especially the needy downtrodden abandoned and unwanted. Gladney was a native of Wisconsin who moved to Texas and married a businessman there. Although much of her family and early life are highly fictionalized in the film she did not have an adopted sister who committed suicide nor a son who died as a boy she was moved by the plight of orphans abandoned children and those born out of wedlock as unwanted. She unselfishly dedicated the rest of her life to helping and caring for such children. The acting and portrayal as scripted in this film are fantastic. Edna Gladney was a great person and Greer Garson gave tremendous heart to her role. As the film shows Edna Gladney had her detractors for her humanitarian efforts. There were some in society then who looked on orphans and abandoned children as outcasts misfits and something less than human. Nor was her work easy. She struggled for many years to raise the funds to support her Texas home for children. She met apathy among many in the public and endured the criticism of those who opposed helping the downtrodden. Today Gladney is recognized as a true hero and humanitarian. Movies were also made about two other such heroes with similar stories in the 20th century. Father Edward Flanagan was a priest who founded Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska to take in boys from the streets and the courts. Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney starred in a 1938 movie about Boys Town. Then in the middle of the century a young nun from Albania left a comfortable teaching position in a religious order in India with no money or resources and began ministering to the dying on the streets of Calcutta. By the time she died in late 1997 Mother Teresa's order of nuns ran more than 600 centers for the poorest of the poor around the world. Two films have since been made about Mother Teresa.

As it was Blossoms in the Dust became an important film for her.Like Boystown the film is based on a real person still living who worked with young people although this protagonist is female. And she works with the youngest of children abandoned babies giving them shelter and eventually a home.Greer Garson really hit her career stride with this role. Edna Gahley sustained two tragedies in her life that propelled her to her work with foundling kids. First her sister was found out to be adopted and when facts of her real illegitimate birth came to light she committed suicide. Marsha Hunt has a small but very key role as the tragic sister.Secondly she marries Sam Gladney played by Walter Pidgeon and when their child is killed in an accident after a bit of soul searching she finds her true calling in founding and running a home and orphanage for unwanted children in Fort Worth Texas. She also campaigns vigorously and successfully for the repeal of a law that mandated births out of wedlock be stamped illegitimate. Back in the day the simple fact of an out of wedlock birth could brand someone for life in real terms concerning job and service discrimination.Watching the film I was struck that the opponents of Garson who wanted to keep the law as is were using the same arguments that are being used against same sex marriage that were used against repealing the miscegenation laws. It seems we have to fight the same fight over many generations.This was the first film in which Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon were teamed by MGM. Their biggest success was in their next film the following year with Mrs. Miniver.Blossoms in the Dust got an Oscar for Best Art and Set Design for a color film. It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to How Green Was My Valley and Greer Garson got her first nomination for Best Actress but she lost to Joan Fontaine for Suspicion.Edna Gladney lived until 1961 twenty years after this film about her came out to the last a passionate advocate for the rights of the littlest citizens on planet earth. She would have been a firm believer in what Hillary Clinton said about it taking a village to raise a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST MetroGoldwynMayer 1941 directed by Mervyn Leroy with screenplay by Anita Loos stars Greer Garson in one of her finest acting performances still early in her career. Making an impressive movie debut in GOODBYE MR. CHIPS MGM 1939 leading to the literary screen adaptation of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE MGM 1940 along with a couple of light comedies opposite Robert Taylor REMEMBER 1939 and WHEN LADIES MEET 1941 BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST is certainly one along with her Academy Award win for MRS. MINIVER 1942 to be very much associated with the Garson name as well as her onscreen personality. Labeled a biography which states This is the story of a great woman and of the great work she is doing for humanity her name is Edna Gladney and she lives in Fort Worth Texas. We dedicate this picture to her BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST follows the pattern of many current biopics mixing fact and fiction but in true MGM essence a Technicolor film with great style and appeal.The Story of Edna Gladney starts at the turn of the century Wisconsin where Edna Kahly Greer Garson and her halfsister Charlotte Marsha Hunt are both to celebrate their engagements Edna to Damon McPherson John Eldredge Charlotte to Alan Keats William Henry. At the engagement party comes Sam Gladney Walter Pidgeon a bank cashier employed by Edna's father Samuel S. Hinds who earlier at the bank meets her for the first time and regardless of her exposed engagement ring tells Edna she's going to marry him. Finding Sam arrogant his appeal pleases her enough to become his wife and move with him to Texas. As for Charlotte she learns from her future motherinlaw Kathleen Howard that she's nameless foundling with an unknown father and because of this cannot marry her son. Charlotte's suicide along with the loss of Edna's child Richard Nichols and husband become a series of unpleasant circumstances leading to Edna Gladney's greatest achievements in life Taking in tagged orphans of all different backgrounds and opening a Texas Children's Home and Aid Society where she cares for children of working mothers as well as finding proper homes for orphaned ones. Aside from saving a woman Fay Helm whose personal troubles echo that of Charlotte's and realizing she hasn't died in vain Edna moves forward by fighting for children's rights speaking on their behalf taking the word illegitimate off birth certificates and changing the term orphans to our children. While successful in those issues her biggest problem is making the supreme sacrifice by having a special orphan so dear to her released under her care and into a home of a troubled couple after losing a child of their own. Others members of the cast include Fay Holden Mrs. Kahly Clinton Rosemond Zeke Pat Barker Little Tony George Lessey Mr. Keats Theresa Harris Cleo and Cecil Cunningham Mrs. Marcus Gilworth.Unlike the life stories of Thomas Edison or Madame Curie a role Garson would eventually play in 1943 the name of Edna Gladney is forgotten and totally unfamiliar by anyone today. Based on its presentation it's forgivable to mistake BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST as a fictional story with soap opera overtones. It's also easy compare this along with MGM's factbased story of BOYS TOWN 1938 starring Spencer Tract as Father Flanagan a priest with a goal of building a place for homeless boys. Regardless of similarities between BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST and BOYS TOWN each have become splendid achievements in their own rights. There are certain moments in BLOSSOMS where it becomes corny now and then but thanks to the sensitive portrayal by Garson it appears better than it seems. Once seen it's hard to forget her courtroom plea to those famous words There are no illegitimate children. Just illegitimate parents! Or her telling the judge Henry O'Neill she's ready to go to jail for not revealing the name of the family who adopted a child belonging to the mobstertype father Marc Lawrence who gave him up years ago or listening to Home on the Range theme song underscored during the GarsonPidgeon love scenes.Aside from Garson's welldeserved Academy Award nominated performance BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST also marks her first of eight feature films opposite her most perfect screen partner Walter Pidgeon. The GarsonPidgeon combination certainly worked wonders here and subsequent movies to follow including another Garson favorite MADAME CURIE 1943. They were as right together as Garson was for Auntie Edna Gladney. After Pidgeon's character is gone early in the story Felix Bressart takes over through much of the proceedings as the family doctor Max Bresler who offers both humor and straightforwardness through the necessary sensitive moments.Formerly available on video cassette and later onto DVD from Turner Home Entertainment BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST shows on Turner Classic Movies where the legend of Greer Garson 19041996 and name of Edna Gladney 18861961 and her early accomplishments for children's rights live on through the course of television revivals. 12.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blossoms in the Dust released in 1941 by MGM is the wonderful and inspiring story of Edna Gladly a sortof social worker in the early part of 20th century. Greer Garson shines in her portrayal of Edna Gladly. She and her husband Sam Walter Pigeon lose a son early on in the movie leading Gladly on a crusade to get unwanted children adopted in the state of Texas. Gladly not only provides a home for these children but she decides to make it her mission to remove the word illegitimate from these children's birth certificates. It is shocking in these modern times to think that at one time such children were branded this way leading to a stigma that followed them their entire lives. Gladly's life is not all roses  not only does she endure the death of her child she and her husband lose their fortune and then her husband dies later on in the film. Edna must then move her children's shelter at one point because some judgmental city councilmen obviously didn't want it in their neighborhood. But she perseveres throughout and Greer Garson's stirring speech to the state legislature in Texas is as moving as any delivered in a film and she finally succeeds in her quest to get the word illegitimate removed from birth certificates. Gladly becomes especially attached to one boy in her shelter and she nurses him until she finally lets him go to be adopted. The scene is a tearjerker and I defy anyone not to have tears well up in their eyes. What makes the movie work is the talented Ms. Garson and a fine supporting cast including Walter Pigeon and Felix Bressart and of course MGM's usual great production values. This movie is but one example of why MGM was the biggest and best studio of the golden age of Hollywood.".

A starring vehicle for Greer Garson. I am one of those people who believe that Garson was one of the greatest of the actresses around in the 1940s and into the 1950s. So that's the reason I watched this film I love Greer Garson. And despite the inaccuracy of the film in terms of biography Garson doesn't disappoint in her portrayal.I suppose the general topic  illegitimacy  was a problem for this film even in the 1940s. That may be a reason for some of the inaccuracies about the main character and her story. So just take it as a movie script not a biography that way it's a great story.In addition to Garson in the main role Walter Pidgeon is here as her Texan husband. This was their first film of many together. They fit together well and Pidgeon was excellent in the role. Felix Bressart  a wonderful character actor  plays the doctor who helps Garson develop homes for illegitimate orphans. He doesn't disappoint either. Pat Barker as the child Tony is remarkable but it seems as if this was his only screen role.This is not one of Garson's films which will wind up on my DVD shelf but I enjoyed it.".

She helped have 10000 babies adopted revolutionized adoption law and practices and helped remove what was once the stigma of adoption.Though the beginning of the story shows Gladney living at home with her parents and her adopted sister in truth Gladney's mother sent her to live with an aunt and uncle at a young age. It's unlikely the character of Charlotte Marsha Hunt was real. In the film it's Charlotte's situation that is one of Gladney's inspirations to pursue her work. Edna's courtship with Sam Gladney however is correct in the movie. The rest of the film is the usual biopic with events telescoped and combined. The bottom line though is that this is a wonderful film that requires a box of tissues to get through. Greer Garson is luminous as Edna showing her as kind passionate tough and loving of course she and Walter Pidgeon are terrific together as always. The children are beautiful and will pull at your heartstrings. Typical MGM fare with the high production values and color. Edna Gladney certainly did make blossoms in the dust.

Also nominated for Best Picture How Green Was My Valley Best Actress Greer Garson Joan Fontaine in Suspicion and Color Cinematography Blood and Sand.Number 10 in the annual Film Daily poll of U.S. film critics.COMMENT This first of the nine movies Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon made together hardly augured well for Mr. Pidgeon's future career. Not only is his name half the size of Miss Garson's on the film's credits but his role is rather small. His character dies halfway through leaving all the dramatic running to the oddly popular Garson. I can understand that the actress' grand manners and air of patronizing refinement could make her popular in some feminine quarters but I always found her artificial and  if given her head  cloying. She was well cast in Mr Chips and Pride and Prejudice where her roles called for brittle snobbery. The script has an unfortunate habit of telegraphing its punches well ahead enabling Greer to glide with ease from one domestic crisis to another. Nonetheless the drama does come across effectively in some of its key scenes particularly the address to the Texas Senate with which scene the film ought to have closed. Instead it drags on for another 20 minutes or so lovingly tying up a tedious subplot about a nursedbacktohealth crippled boy. Partly this is due to the excellent mounting photography sets costumes and production values MGM have poured into the picture but mostly to the quality of the support cast. With the exceptions of Felix Bressart Clinton Rosemond and Theresa Harris who seem to be reveling in their ridiculously stereotyped roles all the support players give interesting if not fascinating performances. Most of the other roles are brief  limited to one or two scenes  but those players make their mark. One must be singled out for special praise Marsha Hunt who overcomes a lack of depth in the writing to give Charlotte an appealingly tragic dignity.LeRoy's direction is competently bland while other technical credits especially the costumes and photography  Miss Garson makes a stunning first appearance in a blue costume and picture hat are highly professional. The only exception is Stothart's unbelievably heavyhanded music scoring with its consistently MickeyMouse use of appropriate tunes like Two Little Girls In Blue and Deep In the Heart of Texas.".

Nonetheless the drama does come across effectively in some of its key scenes particularly the address to the Texas Senate with which scene the film ought to have closed. Instead it drags on for another 20 minutes or so lovingly tying up a tedious subplot about a nursedbacktohealth crippled boy. Partly this is due to the excellent mounting photography sets costumes and production values MGM have poured into the picture but mostly to the quality of the support cast. With the exceptions of Felix Bressart Clinton Rosemond and Theresa Harris who seem to be reveling in their ridiculously stereotyped roles all the support players give interesting if not fascinating performances. Most of the other roles are brief  limited to one or two scenes  but those players make their mark. One must be singled out for special praise Marsha Hunt who overcomes a lack of depth in the writing to give Charlotte an appealingly tragic dignity.LeRoy's direction is competently bland while other technical credits especially the costumes and photography  Miss Garson makes a stunning first appearance in a blue costume and picture hat are highly professional. The only exception is Stothart's unbelievably heavyhanded music scoring with its consistently MickeyMouse use of appropriate tunes like Two Little Girls In Blue and Deep In the Heart of Texas.";

She plays Edna Gladney a woman who made a crusade of finding loving adoptive homes for outcasts. She's lovely and committed in the role and earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination for it. I believe this was the first time she was paired with Walter Pidgeon and he's pretty good too as a cocky Texan who charms her and then marries her but he very definitely stands in Garson's shadow for most of the film.Cedric Gibbons Urie McCleary and Edwin B.

We may have wound up on the cutting room floor but I wouldn't have traded the experience for anything.";

Toby said that while it may not seem like a stretch he is really different from his character and unlike the real life Toby Bo is struggling with his career. Toby...you're a great singer brilliant songwriter outstanding performer...but this wasn't much of a stretch. A cop a lawyer a teacher or even a biker allows you to try out your acting chops. Toby plays a country singer and Toby is really a country singer. Toby Keith's character dresses like...Toby Keith. But Toby did give a good performance so I applaud him for that.Lindsey Haun had better become a big star. She's beautiful and shes a great singer and actress...a double WHAMMY! Her performance of Broken was one of the highlights of the movie. This wasn't a huge blockbuster film but I hope it was big enough to get people to notice this great talent.The soundtrack was very good I'll give it that.

If you score her in comparison to the performance of the rookies Toby Keith and Lindsey Haun Preston wasn't that great.While I loved the movie there are a few disappointments. The character of Anna Maria Horsford should have been expanded. She is an excellent actress and could have been given more exposure.

	schema:reviewBody "I attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations 1. Just because you've directed a ton of music videos DOES NOT make you qualified to make movies. The movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense horrible angles and terrible lighting. The editing didn't help this mess at all. When Dixie shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it's never clear what the heck she's talking about.2. The plot had promise but the script was thin and full of Ford Truck sized holes. We never get to understand what drives the characters what's really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them. Sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic. The deep conversations were marred by stupid clichs. In fact the whole town was one big clich of southern life. Half the audience groaned when Toby drawled Ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl...and we were treated to that insipid line not once but TWICE! The revelations were yawn inducing and the dramatic confessions boiled down to I was stupid and stubborn.3. The acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with. Toby was dark and brooding most of the film but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming. It's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that. Kelly Preston's acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows. Lindsay Haun is talented and it's certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you don't blame her father for not coming to look for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost. And indeed their characters get lost in this film! 4. If you're a Toby fan you'll love the songs. But often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songsor the artists on his record label. For instance the movie's official love song is Crash Here Tonight. You'd think that would play around a tender love scene but nope...we hear about 45 seconds of it as he's heading to a memorial service. It was as if they said well we gotta use this song somewhere. The song Broken is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie.In summary...a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for Toby Keith's music and product placement for Ford Trucks. It goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video. I like Toby and really wanted to like Broken Bridges but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where.".

This is a good Southern story filmed from several small towns in Georgia near here. The scenery was very representative of the area.

But his character Bo Price is a broken man. He is filled with fear and regret therefore requiring restraint with raw emotion seeping through... and Toby Keith delivers! For anyone that has seen Toby in concert or in interviews... you'll be surprised to see that there is little of Toby Keith on this big screen. He was soulful and honest and downright haunting in his portrayal of a falling star who is forced to face the life he ran away from.Kelly Preston is simply stunning in one of the best performances I've seen of her. The only problem I have with this movie is that the relationship between her character Angel and Toby's character Bo is barely exposed leaving me a bit unsatisfied with the pat ending.Lindsey Haun is going to be a huge star. She is funny charismatic and unbelievably great in the role of Dixie a girl who's in search of a love that she never received from her absent father. Lindsey has some of the best oneliners in the film making you laugh out loud one minute but then tearing your heart out the next with her deadon portrayal of teen rage.The film is a bit short... it doesn't fully explore the relationship between Bo and Angel but it fully succeeds in the fatherdaughter dynamic and the chemistry between the cast is palpable. But I give it a 10 because of the performances alone... definitely worth seeing again and again.".

It was a good message movie good music with some humor tears and leaves you with thinking about broken bridges in your own life. There were many broken up parts of the movie and I would have also liked to see more detail of a relationship mending between Bo  Angel. Lindsay was a shining star for sure I hope she goes far.All in all I liked it but was not totally in love  I do not mean that bad so fans do not get all in an uproar.

It was a good message movie good music with some humor tears and leaves you with thinking about broken bridges in your own life. There were many broken up parts of the movie and I would have also liked to see more detail of a relationship mending between Bo  Angel. Lindsay was a shining star for sure I hope she goes far.All in all I liked it but was not totally in love  I do not mean that bad so fans do not get all in an uproar.

No real time given to Bo and Angel to come back together as a couple. If a woman was in the editing room on this film then she must have been a bitter person. A more romantic person should have been involved in the final cut. To bring Bo and Angel back as a couple reunited from all the pain they both has suffered along with Dixie their daughter.

It develops without over developing the deep value of family and the simple things in life. The editing was a bit choppy but the acting music and story all work.

	schema:reviewBody "Broken Bridges is a film that comes billed and equipped with three specific agendas to be an openly patriotic film to boast and share its Christian beliefs and a film to try and serve as a wholesome parable for Americans facing similar issues. All three agendas are fine by me if they were taken seriously and made competently into a watchable film but this is a depressingly mundane trudge through the genre I call American cinema one of the weakest genres thus far in film. You may have come across a film or two in this genre they're films that seemingly exist in their own dull world with dull characters and stiff dialog. At least that's how I've seen them. Another example would include Seven Days in Utopia a film I regarded as a huge missed opportunity not long ago but after seeing Broken Bridges I recall that film as a breath of cleaner fresher air.All the hell begins with the hamfisted morally devout incredibly obnoxious story that spells out things so incredulous and farfetched they are cringe worthy. Bo Price is a hack country singer he's played by Toby Keith so try and believe that who once had a fling with a Miami news reporter named Angela Delton Kelly Preston which resulted in a pregnancy. After that Bo fled responsibility and stuck Angela with a newborn baby girl. Sixteen years later after a helicopter crash in the military kills Bo's brother and Angela's brother when they fly back home for the funerals they are unexpectedly reunited with one another and contention flies.The movie's main goal is to show how Bo begins to connect with the child he unexpectedly father named Dixie Lindsey Haun who has gone on to be a rather unremarkable teenager who just so happens to have a heavenly voice. What it fails at is generating any fulfilling substance to these bland unsatisfying uninteresting archetypes.Broken Bridges is directly aimed at the crowd who crave films with relatable characters country music traditional living characters paying dues and ageold values where there's a heavy dependence on morality and spirituality I have no problem with any of those things. I was reminded of how surprisingly pleased I was with the Kendrick brothers' film Courageous which offers the same sort of material surrounding four policemen with complex homelifes who need to prioritize their jobs and their families. The film had a smooth if heavyhanded script seriously complex issues taken believably and welldeveloped characters portrayed by capable actors. With this picture all that is trade for wooden acting contrived plotpoints tedious fighting between characters an exhausted concept and a seriously lazy setup punctuated by some decent but forgettable musical numbers both solo performances and duets. Arguably the best scene in the film is when Toby Keith Willie Nelson and BeBe Winans get on stage to perform Uncloudy Day an engaging ballad. Sadly it's brief and one of two blinkandyoumissit cameos for Willie Nelson.On a final note take one more look at the title an I'll be damned if you can't guess its meaning. The title represents how our protagonist must make amends with those he has hurt and repair connections hence the metaphoric broken bridge. The title is about as convincing and as original as the material the film provides.Starring Toby Keith Kelly Preston Lauren Haun Burt Reynolds and Willie Nelson. Directed by Steven Goldmann.".

At the end of the movie one scene later it shows the door painted pink! Therefore the item that was on Dixie's finger was pink paint!

There are a ton of people here who would love to see it. I've bragged about it to my coworkers and I'm not a real big Toby fan. I think maybe they are trying to put this movie down when in reality it would have done pretty darn good at the box office. The theaters need to listen to those who go to the movies rather than the critics. From what I can see it will be out on DVD without going to the theaters and that is very disappointing. Regal Rave and all the other theaters should take another look at what they missed at the box. They all complain about not enough people go to the movies maybe they need to take another look at what they show. If you get the chance to see this on the big screen it will be well worth what you spend for a ticket. It won't be quite as good on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "A college student goes on a weekend skisnowboard outing with his girlfriend and his jealous buddy. It was supposed to be just the guys but Parker came along much to buddy Lynch's dismay. She is still learning and as a result of this the trio spends most of the day on a bunny slope. After some complaining from Lynch they decide to go on a quick run down the mountain before the day is through but there's bad weather moving in. They manage to convince the lift operator to let them go but through a series of unfortunate circumstances the lift is stopped midway up the mountain leaving them stuck as the place shuts down for the week. With bad weather the freezing cold and a large drop between them and the ground the chances for survival are looking slim. And that's not taking the pack of hungry wolves into account.I caught this at the Parks Mall AMC back in February and thought it was fantastic. It's from the Open WaterBlack WaterThe Canyon school of survival horror. All of those films are intense portraits of people stuck in some form of wilderness nightmare with little hope of escape but Frozen may just be my pick for best of the bunch. At one point early on into the trio's predicament I discovered that I had unknowingly squeezed my hands together so tightly that they had fallen asleep so it's safe to say that the tension got to me. The characters also really grew on me as the film wore on and I actually felt really bad for them. This is Emma Bell's first film and I was quite impressed with her performance. While she has a spotty moment or two for a firsttimer I'd say she knocked it out of the park. Her standout scene takes place when she's relaying her fears about what might happen to her puppy if she dies on the lift and if he'd think she abandoned him.Kudos to Adam Green for shooting this film on location. There are no greenscreens or studio sets to be found here. Green and company found an actual lift to go out and shoot on. Equal amounts of kudos must go to the actors as they were the ones up on the lift braving the elements for the authenticity a film of this type needs. Their hard work and tolerance paid off as I often felt like I was right there on the lift with the characters. The chilly atmosphere vividly leaps off the screen the bleak nature of the situation in which these three find themselves never in doubt. This film also hit a little closer to home for me as I spent a week of skiing etc. in Winter Park CO not two months prior to watching this at the theater. With that fresh in my mind I was left with an even stronger feeling of What if?.Also effective is the sparingly used score usually played over visuals of the abandoned ski park. There are some gruesome bits particularly the hand scene from the trailer and a discovery towards the film's end but most of the tension comes from the predicament itself and some of the debasing things the characters have to do. Needing to take a leak while stuck on a ski lift may not be a big deal if you're a guy but Parker's options aren't so easy.I didn't think much of Adam Green's Hatchet. Frozen on the other hand is worth raving about.".

	schema:reviewBody "The magic of Frozen is that there's no badguy. It's just humans against nature. I was worried at first that the film would be slow paced. I mean how many things can happen within such a small space?It turns out plenty. Although time passes during the movie the film does not give in to drawn out melodramatic sequences. They fight against nature but the film is structured to attack them from all sides at once but also in a way that's not transparently unrealistic. Although personally I feel that nobody would have survived the cold and dehydration of the first night.We even learn a little about the characters in a way that's more convincing than most disaster films I am thinking for example of The Poseidon Adventure. There are no stereotypes here.And they make mistakes. This isn't like Die Hard where the protagonist cleverly thinks of everything. Everything about the film including their being trapped up so high falls together like a series of coincidences and that makes it even more horrific because you start to believe that it might actually happen. There's even a little comedy to offset the horror towards the beginning.There is some gore in the film but hugely less than I was led to believe. This is no Quentin Tarantino film and no slasher film either.So having said what it's not what is it? It's a thrilling look at how even though we humans have extended ourselves into nature with technology how reliant we are on that technology. It's an intellectual thriller rather than a supernatural or a serial killer freakshow thriller. It's normal people without heroic powers stuck in a situation that is near to real the Lost in Translation of horror films.I though it was fantastic. I'll give Frozen a 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not jumping up and down for this one but I thought it was a very well done survivalthriller that had some shocking gruesome scenes as well as some thrills and definitely chills. The acting was pretty decent but the stand out here is newcomer Emma Bell who gave an heartbreaking performance as one of the stranded skiers on a ski lift man I felt all of her pain. I thought the director did a great job using different techniques with the camera and used his one location effectively that makes you think and feel that you're right there with them on that ski lift the thought just terrifies me but doesn't make me fear going skiing just makes me think twice about going on a ski lift. I think it's a tad overrated saying it does for skiing what Jaws did for swimming not really and to be honest it's more Open Water than Jaws just with more action and a different situation sorry it just didn't put the fear in me it just had me feeling sorry for them and rooting for them than actually being scared. It will have you thinking throughout questioning what would you do in that situation what lengths would you go in order to survive and some of it to me wasn't plausible while other scenes were very realistic and will have you on the edge of your seat. What makes this so special is the fact that they took a simple idea and went to great lengths to make it powerful and had three leads that could be anyone's friend sister brother lover and it makes you feel for them even more and makes the whole situation more unsettling and shattering with some scenes that will make you a little teary eyed good effort. This film actually has a heart and is refreshing from most horror offerings lately but it's more of a dramathriller and I can't wait to see what director Adam Green has up his sleeve next! Overall it could of had a slightly better conclusion and I don't think it's going to be the best genre flick of the year because I just don't see that happening but if you want to see something different new and bone chilling go support Adam Green's latest effort Frozen though more of a renter on a snowy night to me.

Other than what's been previously mentioned a hundred times on here the wolves the chair lift breaking apart all of a sudden for some reason the fact that they're freezing to death and still don't zip up there jackets or put their hands in their pockets or the fact that the ski resort is closing in the first place there's more that made this movie really bad. First of all Emma Belle doesn't stop crying for the whole movie. There's minutelong shots of her snotnosed face just bawling and weeping and sobbing and it doesn't add anything to the picture. It's just filler. Like when buddy is getting eaten by wolvesit keeps cutting back to shots of her crying but like all the time. It's overboard. We get it you're scared and crying but show something else. A perfect example of that is when the other guy climbs down the chair lift and gets to the snowboard and the wolves start chasing him down mountain while he rides the snowboard down what do we see? We don't get to see the cool chase down a mountain on a snowboard with wolves chasing him. No it just cuts to emma belle crying her ass off again and just sitting there. Then later when she gets down the mountain we see the guys body there. Why couldn't we see the guy try to outrun the wolves on his snowboard and then get eaten by the wolves? That would've been better. Also when buddy has his legs broke and he's rocking back and forth trying to get to something I haven't laughed that hard in a while! Watch this movie if you want some kind of illogical thing to laugh at but don't believe the obviously b.s. reviews on here talking about what a great and realistic horrorsurvival film this is because it's not and anyone who would write that is either too dumb to be trusted or they worked on the film.".

There are so many illogical things even assuming that the three skiers are completely brainless it's not easy to write them down.

I'll point out that 1. the chairlift cable is at best at treetop level as can be seen in various scenes say at 11054 but there are various shot of the whole track for ex. at 2603 so that leaning from the bottom of the chair will make at best some 56 m. jump on fresh snow 2. assuming that if you jump you won't jump to fall strait on your legs you could instead make some sort of rope with whatever clothes and equipment you have with you 3.the way to close a skylift is not to say wait for the last three to come down which is illogical as you don't know how many people form previous trips are still skiing on the mountain its to put a red flag on a chair as clearly seen at 1856  4. the resort could never be closed for days because of bad weather in fact the morning after the sky is clearly clear and bright 11000 even as at 11200 is oddly already gray with heavy snow such a closure in high season would result in dramatic loss of money 5. if in such resort there are wolf packs roaming which is quite improbable given wolves habits the whole track would at least been protected by a netfence this also prevents accidents if a skier would lose the track or deliberately try to get off it 6. before jumping try to get to the nearest pole especially if your limb are not yet frozen and you are not wearing heavy and cumbersome skiboots she doesn't for example These are some of the illogical issues of the movie.

Spoilers First the guy jumps. Yes it would be my first thought if I was put in that situation. However I would have done everything to limit the potential for injury. They could have removed shirts ski pants etc and made a rope to hang from the lift so they're falling from a shorter distance. Second the wolves. Come on! This is a ski area! They would never attack so aggressively. Possibly the first guy might have something happen because of his condition and blood but definitely not the second guy. That drove me crazy. Lazy uncreative writing. So much more drama could have been accomplished from developing the fallen guys situation than throwing in the wolf pack. Stupid. Lastly the guy climbs down. He would never manage it. Never! He has been trapped in the cold overnight with no food or water. I would question some of the most athletic people being able to do that climb...especially with ski boots on! Ski gloves have leather patches to protect against cable damage by the way has the writer ever been skiing?! The bunny hill uses cable lifts! Why not make it believable and have the guy use his legs on the cable to help distribute his weight and easier to traverse? Anyway I wont go on and on about all the things that bothered me in this movie. It drove me nuts. I can handle some stretches of possibilities but if they are presented in the wrong way or go over the top it just flops. This definitely flopped for me. The tension wasn't there you don't have any connection to the characters hell I wanted them to die nothing. All the reviews giving praise are either completely clueless drunk or working for the producers of this movie.".

Why not make it believable and have the guy use his legs on the cable to help distribute his weight and easier to traverse? Anyway I wont go on and on about all the things that bothered me in this movie. It drove me nuts. I can handle some stretches of possibilities but if they are presented in the wrong way or go over the top it just flops. This definitely flopped for me. The tension wasn't there you don't have any connection to the characters hell I wanted them to die nothing. All the reviews giving praise are either completely clueless drunk or working for the producers of this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "For a film that mainly revolves around a cast of three to carry the movie seven stars can seem like seventeen. What makes this film work is the realism. Every choice every consequence everything! Like a movie studio trying to emulate the moments before a car accident then its aftermath.I'm not one of these reviewers that will take you through the entire plot of the film. Especially in this case. This film's simplicity works. Three skiers accidentally get forgotten on a ski lift as the resort closes for the week.That's it! Yet this simple formula works better than any horror movie I have seen in a long LONG time! This opinion may be a little biased and I'll tell you why. Personally I am petrified of open heights. Adam Green's chosen camera placements are well picked never once allowing any hints of fiction into the story. That's the beauty of shooting on location despite how deadly the location can be.Deadly indeed! This movie really got under my skin. Not in anyway gorefilled like Hatchet or its sequel. So for all the gorehounds out there scanning the reviews for bloody details before watching it makeup effects enthusiasts won't be completely disappointed but it's no Hatchtet. However Adam Green focuses more on his Actor'sActresses' reactions to the horrors within the film. This works! Lord does it work! I'm a huge GOREHOUND I welcome squeamish scenes but the subtle incidents that happen to these characters while exposed to harsh weather works better than a graphic depiction of a chainsaw to the gut! I'm almost ashamed to admit that I had to turn away and groan at what I witnessed on screen! This is from someone who giggled like a girlscout throughout A Serbian Film! Frozen works! In all the right ways! My only complaints about the film are the lack of themes. Usually a survivalhorror like this contains some smug theme that ties the film together a topic the film tries to make aware to its audience. Romero does the aforementioned flawlessly just to provide one example. Dawn of the Dead and its issue of consumerism. For example one would assume that being trapped with two other people in a situation like that the throes of cabin fever would naturally work its way into the script. Yet Adam Green chooses to focus on the reality of the situation his characters find themselves in. As a result the film remains simple. Leaving the audience with no other thought to ponder upon besides their own feelings of fear. To some this may be a compliment to the film to others a weak link.The dialogue is probably the strongest device in the film. Revolving your film around only three characters the script better be able to keep the dialogue interesting or your audience is going to give up on these characters. Adam Green's dialogue is just that interesting. Realizing the situation the characters find themselves in the conversations that follows feels significant but above all genuine. Dialogue outweighs the action so be prepared for a lot of talking. However when the action arrives it's like an avalanche disastrous yet magnetic. I was literally frozen couldn't take my eyes off the screen.I've said enough...To reiterate a few points I have to say again this film really shook me. After it was over I had a deeper appreciation for the bed I was watching it in. I also made a vow never EVER to go skiing.".

The characters were welldeveloped and likable so you care about what's going to happen to them. It's also extremely thought provoking and realistic.The acting is very good especially as Adam Green the director actually tortured the actors so they come across genuinely cold. The direction is claustrophobic and uncomfortable in a good way! There are also some horrible cringeworthy moments which are genuinely horrific. The special effects and music were also top notch with the chilly wind effects getting right up your nostril.Although it did run out of steam in some sections for the most part it was an engaging and exciting film that was superbly acted and directed. Adam Green is proving himself to be a top notch director and clearly knows his stuff when it comes to making horror. I'd highly recommend watching this on a cold day or on a hot day if you want a cool down.".

Nothing is wasted everything works and you are on the edge of your seat the whole time despite the almost nonexistent plot. The script is a textbook example of taking a compelling hook and playing it out to its conclusion no matter the cost.The perfect film to watch in the dead of winter with all the lights on and  most importantly  a fire in the fireplace.

That's it. Filmmaker Adam Green somehow manages to pull this off keep the interest and the viewer's attention almost without a break for an entire hour that is the whole running time except for about 25 minutes to introduce the characters and create the atmosphere for their horrific experience which is in my opinion a good point because the characters are nice people and I cared about them and their luck.These three characters are Dan his girlfriend Parker and his best friend Joe all on a skiing vacation. One evening they get on a chair lift back from skiing but it stops without notice with them being its only occupants hanging 50 feet above the ground in the middle of nowhere and no hopes of being found in three days.Like I said the suspense and the thrill work very well and go in a crescendo especially for the first half since their situation begins. There are some truly horrifying moments proving once again that it doesn't take a lot of blood and guts splatted all over the viewer in order to convey a real feeling of terror. This is survival horror at its finest experiences that can happen to anyone because they involve all real life elements.The pace goes remarkably down toward the end and there are a few scenes that though not long drag it down a little bit and don't seem to serve any real purpose except to linger the denouement a little more.The only real problem I have with Frozen is its ending which I find objectionable not because I may think it is bad but because the rest of the movie is so terrific I expected something on par with that. It is however a very worthwhile movie and one I recommend to all fans of thrillers and horror movies full of tension.My score 9 over 10.".

This is mainly a film about survival and getting through hard times and i thought it was done very well and it was very emotional at times. All in all this film had good acting and a good story with likable Characters in it and i liked all of them and none of them annoyed me which is what people in most horror films tend to do to me but not this one! this film i was pleasantly surprised byi found it quite Dark and suspenseful. This Film is definitely worth a watch by everyone. this film will always be one of my favourites and i think its a good film.".

Gore was perfectly little but not completely absent which is for my taste and as the end credits started to roll I felt somewhere between entertained and almost depressed.I personally found myself more thrilled and pained than scared and I totally enjoyed this flick. I didn't let the fact that no one could really survive one night up there distract my enjoyment. Or the fact that what a crappy ski chairlift doesn't have some sort of an emergency system in it... but because it's possible that some cheap version doesn't... it was OK.Though it's true that if even one of the events that lead to them being stuck in the lift didn't happen they wouldn't have ended up stuck and that the causes of this movie's situation put together is highly unlikely. But it's possible to happen. And it's the realism of the possibility  however slight  that we are supposed to grasp not the fact how unlikely it is. The trio just had a really really shitty luck! The wolves seem to be the most complained aspect. As in how is there a pack of wolves in New England in 2010 when in fact there aren't in real life. I think the film makers were fully aware of that there are no wolves in New England anymore. They make a point in the characters' dialog that for some reason there are wolves where no one expected them to be. And it's not impossible. We are not in control of where wild animals and their packs decide to and can wander. Again it's not the unlikeliness we are supposed to focus on but the slight possibility of it happening.Personally I think if everything in this film was highly likely to happen it would decrease the intensity and fright. But when they create a situation that is unlikely but possible it wakes you up into reality that things aren't as safe and controlled as we'd like to think they are.People keep forgetting that it's completely another thing to watch a movie from the warm comforts of their homes even knowing a lot of what's going to happen than to actually be in the real situation completely unaware of the future and in constant need to improvise. And in this case to act on the survival instinct in a frightening situation. I acknowledge in some movies the characters are idiots or alternatively unrealistically perfect and clever. But this movie is not one of those. There are realistic young people making realistic choices and mistakes.One fine movie! Thrilling suspenseful and fine horror too in some ways. Just realistic human beings against relatively realistic nature with no technology to help them and acting on the survival instinct.".

Considering the amount of agony from merely spraining an ankle seeing the amount of leg trauma one character suffers while jumping is something I'd dread to imagine! And then the skinpeeling scene was just well describable.The only problem is the protagonists scammed their way onto the lift which makes it a little less believable they specifically would be the ones left trapped on a lift.".

They are kids freezing to death on a chairlift and behave how I think they would behave facing such a situation. The bone snapping and flesh ripping is there but just at the right amount. The fear and sadness portrayed by the characters seems real to me. Do not worry about going skiing after watching this film. It simply could not happen.

As I am a Taiwanese who has once colonized and ruled by Japanese during the second world war how Japanese coped with the war topic is always sensitive. However what I saw in this film is truly reflecting that Miyazaki is peace loving and his point of view on war life and love. He depicted about the beauty of dreams and surviving. You can see that everyone in this film try every hard to live even though the time is hard and forced to strike a balance between dreams and reality. However they are self fulfilling. So who is to blame? who ruined their lives and dreams? Those who leads them to the war to blame.In short the film perfectly shows how the director's been telling in almost every his masterpiece but in a personally way to the audience. Just like a final message he would like yo transmit to the world. I felt overwhelmed by the film and sad that he decided to retired. Please go to watch this film and you will do feel the courage to live hard and live well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The announcement of this film was a pleasant surprise after Ponyo and From Up on Poppy Hill which both had simple childish plots. Few films in Japan have tackled the lives of imperial period heroes the ghosts of the 1960s urge people to denounce what really happened in that time and memorialize an imaginary antiwar movement for example in this year's film Shounen H. For Miyazaki to choose a subject like this showed that he was really going for a huge challenge. Miyazaki is of course antiwar and environmentalist. But Ghibli films are never negative. What sort of positive image of the Zero bomber inventor would Miyazaki produce?The result is astounding. As everyone has noted this is not a children's movie. It's complex so it doesn't have the epic sense of Miyazaki at his best but history and adulthood are just as complex and Miyazaki does justice to both. The film indeed stays positive throughout by showing from start to finish how everyone wishes they themselves would behave rewarding the viewer with virtue and beauty but without being condescending about the hardships of real life. In a sense the film is about the importance of dreams but it's also about what it means to be a dreamer in real life and how our highest fantasies can be turned into beauty if we put our minds to it. The cartoon medium is put to full extravagant use in dream sequences that merge right into the narrative. Certain elements at the end of the film leave the obvious unsaid in a peculiarly Japanese and fulfilling way. The most classic films of Japan like the great works of Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu say something profound about the meaning of life and Kaze Tachinu deserves a place among those ranks.".

	schema:headline " A must see for animation fans! Stunningly beautiful.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a breathtaking masterpiece of art that allows your mind and heart to soar like the wind .The story is loosely based on the real life story of Jiro Horikoshi Joseph Gordon Levitt. He dreams of flying but because he's nearsighted decides to be a Japanese airplane designer. We observe his life from child to adulthood as he makes his dream plane and in the process falls in love with Naoko Emily Blunt. Will Jiro create the beautiful plane or realize that the beauty he's seeking is right in front of him all along? The film is a work of art. Hayao Miyazaki Director and Writer creates unique color palettes and designs. Since the movie takes place in the sky the animators go above and beyond to hand draw backgrounds and movements for the planes. We witness them majestically soaring through the skies and you feel as if you're with them. The voice acting is well done. I think they portrayed the characters and their relationships exceptionally well. Much of the film focuses on the romance between Naoko and Jiro. Their connection is both loving and tragic. The film was first released in Japan so American voiceovers are dubbed over the animation and yes it can be distracting. They confront actual events that happened in Japan such as the Kanto earthquake of 1923 and Japan entering the war. I love the truth in this film. It doesn't shy away from talking about the real issues that happened during this time.My favorite character is Mr.Caproni Stanley Tucci a historical Italian aircraft designer who is Jiro's mentor in his dreams. I enjoy Stanley's voice acting skills. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. The character himself is fascinating. He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war but a creator of dreams. My favorite scene is the last dream sequence after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.The message in this film is Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect. Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him Did you have a good ten years?I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11 to 18yearolds. This film shows people smoking and deals with serious issues of the time. This is a must see film! Reviewed by Keefer B KIDS FIRST Film Critic. For more youth reviews go to kidsfirst.org.".

He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war but a creator of dreams. My favorite scene is the last dream sequence after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.The message in this film is Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect. Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him Did you have a good ten years?I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11 to 18yearolds. This film shows people smoking and deals with serious issues of the time. This is a must see film! Reviewed by Keefer B KIDS FIRST Film Critic. For more youth reviews go to kidsfirst.org.";

	schema:headline " Miyazaki's swan song doesn't disappoint";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know if I loved it right from minute one but then it doesn't quite start like any Miyazaki film well even with a dream scene. Its a little quieter more natural thoughtful and subdued much like the main character will be through the film. And then earthquake hits. Its unlike anything you've seen in an animated film. It doesn't hype up its suspense or action. it simply shows Its protagonist Jiro react to a situation as calm and controlled as possible amid the debris and darkness and chaos and help a couple of people in need. of course he doesn't know this young woman he saves will be an emotional foundation for his life. But as with any simple but splendid poetry we have a sense of the connection made.Any other director might just make it a film about the 1920s earthquake that devastated Tokyo. Not Miyazaki. Soon after Tokyo is up and running and Jiro is after his passion which is airplanes. He dreams about them and more than that dreams about the Italian icon of flying he looks up to as he gives Jiro advice and philosophical points about flying inspiration and technology. And very soon after the film is more than anything about this man and his process  finding without any grandiose strokes what can make a plane fly quicker faster safer with more agility and s look like no other. And sometime soon finding a love all his own.Miyazaki has said once again but probably for real this time that he is done making films with the conclusion of the Wind Rises. If so that's fine. I'm not sure if it's any sort of culmination of what his career has been or what he's said  Though you could certainly have a double feature with Porco Rosso also about the wonder of flight but more in an adventure fantasy approach and have a fantastic several hours  and yet it's no less a marvel than anything else he's made. And if anything it just reveals more depths to how he feels for people and can show them in dimensions on screen than ever before. It is a biopic still and a line here or there may be cornball but so what. Its a fiercely intelligent film with genuine sentiment and a grace that comes from being a master letting your story unfold without rushing letting scenes play out for full emotional weight And ample colors and compositions painted with nostalgia for a mood if not necessarily a side in history.And yet you may think going in that there will be some sort of agenda politically speaking as it looks at a man who helped ultimately design planes that dropped bombs and shot and killed the US during world war two. It really isn't or as simple as that. A couple of scenes with a German businessman of a sort voiced by Werner Herzog yes the one and only you'll know him when you hear him lays out the futility in war and conflicts. And Jiro agrees. when someone speaks to him about what planes will be sent to fight whom he is already resigned. Japan will burn' he says more or less. And yet he always stays more pragmatic more about the work and the hard enough task to make the planes and make them fly high and well. This double edged sword also comes out when he is talking to his Italian guru in his dreams especially the last one at the end of the war.With all of this the Wind Rises is a touching love story that seems possibly very doomed from the start  before getting engaged Jiro is told by Nahoko she has Tuberculosis and he doesn't care or at least about that deterring him away  and how strong their bond is. How often do we get to see people in a movie animated or otherwise act like this to one another with kindness and compassion and a tenderness that for the most part maybe there's a bit of that Japanese Disney schmaltz but not much is without any reservation? Not often really at least like this as told at times without words at all the high point of the picture is when there is a kind of wordless courtship as Jiro flies a paper plane around and it goes to the girl and she flies it back out as he chase to catch it and it repeats. The moving music the amiable tone of the whole set piece the mild peril... I'm at a loss to how much that just works because it feels true.Did I mention its among the ten most beautifully animated films ever made? And I'm sure that group includes Mononoke and Totoro already. And I know full well a term like 'beautiful is overused and tired. But Miyazaki crafts his works or did by hand with gorgeous clear lines water colors and maybe some cgi and it both serves the story and its own sense of the world it's in the earthy greens the shiny clouds and blue skies the metallic force of the planes the drab grays of the offices and plane hangers. And yet you are still wrapped up in the tale of this man and those who cared about him or were inspired by and led by him and is another rarity easier to pull off in literature trickier here and Miyzaki just about pulls it off a mild wind that grows with power and energy briefly and then ebbs and flows with reality and again thought.".

	schema:headline " Hayao Miyazaki's Most Beautiful Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wind Rises is a fictionalized biography  character study of Jiro Hirikoshi and his story of becoming an Aviation Engineer. This movie had a great impact on me after seeing it in the theatre and I thought about what I had seen for the one hour drive home afterwards. In terms of pacing and how the movie focuses on the main character I was reminded of David Lean movies in its maturity and emotional grit. There were also times when watching that I thought to myself I have never seen hand drawn animation this good ever and will probably never see animation this good ever again. The character designs are beautiful. The backgrounds and color pallete are beautiful. The animation is breathtaking. But the story is just as beautiful as the artwork. The movie is about one mans journey to make beautiful airplanes but is also equally tragic in later scenes of the movie in the evolving love story and especially the last scene in the movie.This movie does not explain at any time through dialogue what the character is feeling but instead it shows you and the subtle and at times powerful emotions which are the glue of what holds his story together. Some people may wonder why Miyazaki took creative risks with the real life story of Jiro Hirikoshi. The real life Jiro never married to a woman with Tuberculosis. Did he really fantasize about building airplanes? Was he really followed by a Soviet Spy? I think the way the character fantasizes about airplanes even when not dreaming is an honest depiction of how creative people like Hayao Miyazaki think.Along with Porco Rosso this is probably Hayao Miyazaki's most personal movie. If you study Hayao Miyazaki's movies and read about his career like I have it becomes obvious that this movie is as much about Jiro Hirikoshi as it is about Hayao Miyazaki.I recommend anyone who has ever been creative to go see the Wind Rises.Hayao Miyazaki's Most Beautiful film.".

	schema:headline " Film Authority on The Wind Rises";
	schema:reviewBody "Aviation has always been a key element of the Studio Ghibli films from the flying broomstick in Kiki's Delivery Service to the airborne armies in Howl's Moving Castle. So for Hayao Miyazaki's reported swansong to focus on the development of aeroplane design is no surprise. A fictionalised biopic of designer Jiro Horikoshi The Wind Rises is a stunning achievement an animated film that uses the medium to tell a compelling highly emotional story that has appeal for children and adults alike. Horikoshi's designs were used during World War 2 and that detail may make The Wind Rises unpalatable to some. But Miyazaki's films have never focused on battlelines but on the personal stories involved and The Wind Rises gains power from the balancing of the beauty of the designs against the knowledge that the purpose for which the designs will be used leads to death and unhappiness. It's a bittersweet paradox and one that many directors would sweep under the carpet. Instead Miyazaki puts Horikoshi's dilemma centrestage and depicts the designer's angst as he finds himself immersed in industrial and international intrigue while he attempts to keep his own thinking pure. A subplot invented for the film relates how Horikoshi's work life is informed by his chaste romance with Naoko a woman with tuberculosis who won't marry until she recovers. Horikoshi's dreams take flight while his daytoday reality struggles to leave the ground behind. The Wind Rises stirs up sensational aerial dream sequences but also captures the bleakness of life on the ground as Tokyo recovers from a devastating earthquake. Horikoshi and Naoko journey to the Magic Mountain resort in an effort to address her physical malaise and their interaction with a mysterious German spy beautifully voiced by Werner Herzog sketches out the sinister world of warmongering that forms the backdrop to their romance. Studio Ghibli films have always been beautiful to watch and The Wind Rises excels in every frame. But the overriding message about the role of a gifted individual to overcome the constraints of society is just as beautifully wrought The Wind Rises is required viewing for anyone who wants to have their spirits lifted and soar like the wind for two blissful hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "So when I first saw that an anime called the Wind Rises was coming to theaters I could not wait to see it simply because it was an anime coming to theaters. I had no idea what the movie was about but when I saw the movie I discovered it was about one of my Favorite subjects Airplanes. It's a very simple story that could have been done in Liveaction. Jirou who as a boy met his hero airplane designer Caproni in his dreams was inspired to become an airplane designer. Years later Jirou lives his dreams and designs airplanes for a manufacturer who sells his beautiful designs to be used for the Ugly art of War. Jirou also fines love in the movie with a young girl name Naoko. All the characters in the movie who supported Jirou from his little bratty sister to his firm but fair boss to his best friend and rival at work. They all help to make you feel like Jirou had a real posh life. I also loved how the story gives us a perspective of Japan preWorld War 2 through the life of Jirou. All of this could have been done in live action but the craftsmanship of fame director Hayao Miyazaki makes you think otherwise. The animation takes a very surrealistic approach to telling this drama without making it seem cartoonish like Mickey Mouse. The scene portraying the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 made the ground feel like it was coming to life as a giant wave just took out an entire city. The Dream sequences worked very elegantly just naturally seeming through. And the planes! the animation team did a great job of making the entire layout of the airplanes look fantastic. I've seen dramatic anime where the animation does nothing to push the story along but Mr. Miyaazaki did fine work to make sure that was not the case. It's been forever since I've seen a 2D moving illustration on the big screen it felt a little weird but this was definitely the movie to bring us all back to that. Someone told me that Hayao Miyazaki may retire after this one as he feels he can't top this. I will not disagree because this one is excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me start by telling Woah What a great movie. Hayao Miyazaki's latest movie The Wind Rises is one of his best movies till date though the story line and plot is completely different from all his other movies which had a magical and fantasy feeling to it. It's nowhere near Spirited Away his best work till date but it ranks 3rd in my ghibli list after Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. The story partly nonfiction evolves around a young mechanical designer whose dream was to build beautiful airplanes. He ultimately succeeds in building fully uptodate planes but which went to war and none came back.His personal life is set in Japan when people were facing great uncertainty after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 the Great Depression and preparation for the war with China then America and Britain and Netherlands and the Soviets ... He and his colleagues do what they do best and what they are supposed to do under those circumstances make planes. Just do it. His life enters into a new stage when he meets again accidentally with the girl whose life he saved during the earthquake. Their beautiful romance and eventual marriage is however overshadowed by her disease tuberculosis which was incurable at that time and war.The ending completely pays off and blew me away in every term. The Movie is what we wanted from Miyazaki though intended for Mature Audiences only I suggest everyone to watch this movie and I am sure that you will receive 1 ounce more pleasure than I did. 1010 For this Masterpiece.".

The Movie is what we wanted from Miyazaki though intended for Mature Audiences only I suggest everyone to watch this movie and I am sure that you will receive 1 ounce more pleasure than I did. 1010 For this Masterpiece.";

	schema:headline " Deeply beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "Miyazaki's swan song most likely. It's an animated biopic of Jiro Horikoshi a Japanese aircraft engineer who developed the Zero the plane which would eventually bomb Pearl Harbor and do kamikaze attacks in WWII. The man himself was a pacifist at least according to this film. Most of the film just deals with the man's love for flight which obviously makes the story very dear to Miyazaki. In fact a good portion of the film takes place in Horikoshi's dreams where he can invent any crazy contraption. First and foremost the film is gorgeous. Though it mostly deals with the real world it finds the beauty in it. As good as the film is it isn't one of Miyazaki's best. It's a little longwinded and slow definitely don't take your kids to it even if they're big Ghibli fans. Miyazaki kind of neuters the militaristic history of Japan at that time. You can feel some terrible stuff going on in the background but outside of the Germans whom our hero visits at one point all the characters whom we meet are perfectly nice people. I would have liked a more detailed picture of history at the time. Also the romance that is depicted in the film which is entirely invented is a tad too maudlin though it is quite nice up front. And though I won't hold it against the film itself the English language dub is awful. This may be due to the film's specific Japanese setting but I really felt the voice actors were just dull as Hell. I hate to say it but Joseph GordonLevitt in the lead role is the worst. The least offensive performances come from Martin Short and Mae Whitman the latter is a professional voice actress who is great on Avatar The Last Airbender though she is best known for her role as Michael Cera's dull girlfriend Ann on Arrested Development. I wish I had just seen the subtitled version instead it was playing here but at an inconvenient theater. I might like the film better seeing it subtitled. All those criticisms don't amount to too much though. It's a wonderful film.".

The Wind Rises 2013 has received critical acclaim and has been dubbed as the farewell masterpiece of the award winning director Hayao Miyazaki most likely out of respect or marketing strategies but if we truly analyse it this piece is much inferior even compared to much lower budget foreign animated features especially in the storytelling department.If you are expecting an inspiring film there could be some scenes that are inspiring. If you are sensitive there could be some elements could upset you. Then there is a good chance that this will not satisfy you at all if you are looking for a good romantic or drama film and even if this might appeal to those who are genuinely in love with everything aviation or engineering they might just experience frustration as the whole film seems to be a series of underdeveloped scenes put together.Despite there are some deep messages in the The Wind Rises 2013 both the storyline and characters are very dull even with decent music and animation. Perhaps this is not intended for everyone and not everyone will enjoy this but as a record I watch this with an open mind with genuine interest and patience until the very end it is sad to report that I believe I am watching a poor attempt at a biographical film filled with the littlest dose of drama romance and war.

	schema:reviewBody "I am afraid this movie cannot be considered good. It is slow from the beginning to the end... At minute three I started to question myself... Why is this scene lasting 20 seconds ? 21 22.... I went to the theater without the knowledge of the synopsis... and I must say it is the worst way of discovering the film. One must be warned before he watches the movie... that the wind rises has nothing to do with any other Miyazaki's productions.  SPOILER  I have read critiques praising Miyazaki for this fantastic intense poetic film... In my opinion any beginner could have made a better storyline... and the drama is just so common. It is dull monotonous slow. Half of the movie was 100 disappointing and boring or clich I have loved you from the moment I saw you etc. A slight interest caught me in the middle of the movie when Jiro must struggle for his work and for his wife. Sadly it is only a fictional part nothing close to reality... so well could have been anything else.Besides some moral values promoted by the film are disputable... Jiro lets his wife breathe his smoking because she doesn't want to leave him any second... He prefers that she stays living with him rather than having a chance of getting cured in the mountains. And so on. I think this is very childish. Nourishing such ideals is idiotic. There is nothing to be praised in the decisions of this couple. The film only presents a way of thinking at a given period of time and takes no step back. Miyazaki casts a childish eye upon this couple when he should have been able to emphasize the flaws of this reasoning. Jiro could have made more compromises to take care of his wife... etc. But working is important for a man says Naoko's father. And... no rebellion no step back ... we're deep in some Japanese conceptions of life... and it bothers me deeply. In the same category Naoko leaving the house not to be seen dead is another weird ideal. Such ideals are WRONG for very known reasons  any man has a need for mourning when a person dies and mourning is easier when the dead person can be seen touched buried... So basically Miyazaki here is praising the ability to mourn without seeing the body. Jiro even says thank you to Naoko who asks him to go on living. I'm so shocked by all these idiotic ideals actually ! Anyway all in all... their decisions could have made sense. Yes it makes sense when someone is suffering and you know this person will die eventually to please her in every way even if it doesn't benefit her health... It is somehow the best thing to do when someone is about to die. But the problem is they stopped fighting far too soon !! How could they know she was so much about to die ?!  SPOILER  Many elements of the film needed more depth or explanation or stepping back to make a good adult movie. But as for me Miyazaki only casts a childish eye on matters way more complex. The wind rises is the typical example of work that gets fantastic critiques ONLY because of the name of the producer. Say it was The wind rises made by Unknown 001 it would not have received any good critique. People would have just watched the film for what it is as I did. But since it's Miyazaki everyone tries hard to see what's HIDDEN because since it's Miyazaki it must be great !! So let's say the animation is tremendous !! Erm guys the animation is absolutely standard. We could expect much more for the last film from Miyazaki...It so seems I don't like any of the personal films from Miyazaki the wind rises and Porco Rosso as it seems. I do not share the passion for aviation at all and it feels like a neurosis of Miyazaki. To sum up if you expect the usual Miyazaki fancy do not watch this movie.".

It really feels lie a goodbye movie but that is not what makes it sad. Although the movie is uplifting colourful and with an amazing music score... it is quite sad to think that Grave of the Fireflies happened just a few years later! This movie is deliciously colourful. We can also see Miyazaki's style on the characters. They actually do the Totoro's head size changing thing when expressing strong emotions. One of the things that I really liked was the music score. It starts as a simple guitar but in the end it evolves to a full orchestra. The sound effects are quite amazing as well. I felt that the Germany part of the movie was a tad slow and some parts could be more developed such as the flashligh part of the movie. This is a bit annoying but is soon forgotten. The mixture between dreams and reality is delicious. I felt happy and warm inside watching all the happy people riding Caproni's plane. But in the same time... I felt sad because as I wrote above... this would all end in a few years or months. It is disturbing that the Zero would be used as a weapon and that many would not return. It is funny  the movie makes you feel good and uneasy on the same time. Still this was one of the most gorgeous animation's I have ever seen. Mr. Miyazaki finished his career with a great movie and his work sure be missed.".

	schema:headline " Half an engineer half a poet eternally a dreamer";
	schema:reviewBody "... maybe that's Miyazaki's secret finally unveiled in his latest movie The Wind Rises.You know it's been three months since I discovered his work and I never had to experience any kind of disappointment. And although I got used to his unequaled capability to catch my eyes and my heart some of his movies really hit a sensitive chord like Kiki or Ponyo and perhaps the actionless moments of Nausicaa.But I can't really describe the effect The Wind Rises had on me. For one thing I'm glad I'm discovering it late because it's the film that best captures Miyazaki's love for airplanes. His passion never went unnoticed how could it be? Almost half of his movies involve airplanes flying devices or stunts in the air but there has always been an element of fantasy that distracted from the personal approach he had to flying even in Porco Rosso which was the most explicit homage to the Italian contribution to aviation.But The Wind Rises made me realize how fantasy is perhaps the sincerest medium to convey passionate matters because to put it simply it's all about dreams and vision that wait for the right wind to carry them a little and give them that extra push they need for flying. The wind has risen one must try to live is the excerpt from Paul Valry's poem that novelist Hori Tatsuo used as an inspiration for a tragic romance and who else than Miyazaki could explore such a story he who had dedicated all his life to things in the air from feelings to plain things pun intended. One thing he had in common with Jiro Horikochi the main protagonist.The film deals with planes in a way that has never been touched by Miyazaki it's not about flying but about the dreams of flying their very blossoming in the fertile soil of a man's mind. In fact the film is less devoted to planes than to the devotion of a boy then a man who designed the Imperial Army's most notorious aircraft. They were used in the war but the film has a point to make about war. Miyazaki believes in Jiro's humanism and expresses it through very riveting dreamy moments. Jiro is a dreamer literally and whenever he dreams he meets his alltime idol Italian Giovanni Caproni. Together they share their views about planes their universal appeal and sadly their belligerent uses or misuses.But don't get it wrong just because it's in the poetic vicinity of Miyazaki's usual works the film is as realistic as any serious biography picture although fictionalized with a romance adapted from the Wind Has Risen novel and many events that struck Japan from the Great Depression to Kanto's earthquake and last but not least the war. Jiro is portrayed as a witness of his time who must adapt to the evolution of society a twopace society with a feudal heritage yet trying to match the Meiji dream. The most emblematic image is the prototype being pulled by ox. This is Miyazaki's most personal film it has Japan it has humanism and well it has planes. And to give you an idea this film is far more revealing about Jiro than A Beautiful Mind with John Nash. There was something so catching in Jiro's passion in the way he kept focused on his job. I could even feel I was venturing into his mind as if Miyazaki met him in his dreams before making this film. I have no clues about planes but I do love a movie about passion this is a film about a man who loves planes by a man who loves them. To judge a good biopic I guess it all comes to the area of passion driving the maker. Having thick glasses Giro could never fly but Caproni almost rhymes with epiphany the Italian icon tells him that he can't even fly a plane but there's just something far more exhilarating than creating. And Miyazaki wouldn't disagree.The heart of the film is centered on the romance between Jiro and a gentle tuberculosis stricken girl like Hori's wife who inspired the novel. And whenever they meet the wind rises and make their encounter possible. Air is our universal heritage in the film it reunites people and give a proper meaning to their life. This air so fragile in Nausicaa this air that symbolizes peace in a world that prepares to war and about which the postapocalyptic Nausicaa warned us. Miyazaki signs his best film. I enjoyed it so much it could have been twice longer to the postwar period time.But the film culminates with the tragic ending and doesn't show much of the war. It is anticlimactic to use a technical term but I guess it's a fine ending because there wasn't much to add about Jiro once he designed the prototype once the plane that started as a concept hidden behind a fish bone became a technological marvel. The film is dedicated to the engineer and to the poet. And the verse The Wind Rises one must try to live is so beautiful it could work as an epitaph for Hayao Miyazaki summing up his best contribution to animation inviting us to dream to pursue our dreams and to take them seriously like a poet a bit like an engineer always like a dreamer.This is one of the greatest animated movies of recent times and given how critical I was about Frozen I was shocked that it won the Oscar. From what I read there was some controversy surrounding the peaceful nature of Jiro a sugarcoating of the war and an overuse of smoking. I'd say The Wind Rises deserved better than being beaten by a film that tried to play the socially relevant card to death. But the masterpiece flies over Frozen like a zeppelin over a fish bone.".

Together they share their views about planes their universal appeal and sadly their belligerent uses or misuses.But don't get it wrong just because it's in the poetic vicinity of Miyazaki's usual works the film is as realistic as any serious biography picture although fictionalized with a romance adapted from the Wind Has Risen novel and many events that struck Japan from the Great Depression to Kanto's earthquake and last but not least the war. Jiro is portrayed as a witness of his time who must adapt to the evolution of society a twopace society with a feudal heritage yet trying to match the Meiji dream. The most emblematic image is the prototype being pulled by ox. This is Miyazaki's most personal film it has Japan it has humanism and well it has planes. And to give you an idea this film is far more revealing about Jiro than A Beautiful Mind with John Nash. There was something so catching in Jiro's passion in the way he kept focused on his job. I could even feel I was venturing into his mind as if Miyazaki met him in his dreams before making this film. I have no clues about planes but I do love a movie about passion this is a film about a man who loves planes by a man who loves them. To judge a good biopic I guess it all comes to the area of passion driving the maker. Having thick glasses Giro could never fly but Caproni almost rhymes with epiphany the Italian icon tells him that he can't even fly a plane but there's just something far more exhilarating than creating. And Miyazaki wouldn't disagree.The heart of the film is centered on the romance between Jiro and a gentle tuberculosis stricken girl like Hori's wife who inspired the novel. And whenever they meet the wind rises and make their encounter possible. Air is our universal heritage in the film it reunites people and give a proper meaning to their life. This air so fragile in Nausicaa this air that symbolizes peace in a world that prepares to war and about which the postapocalyptic Nausicaa warned us. Miyazaki signs his best film. I enjoyed it so much it could have been twice longer to the postwar period time.But the film culminates with the tragic ending and doesn't show much of the war. It is anticlimactic to use a technical term but I guess it's a fine ending because there wasn't much to add about Jiro once he designed the prototype once the plane that started as a concept hidden behind a fish bone became a technological marvel. The film is dedicated to the engineer and to the poet. And the verse The Wind Rises one must try to live is so beautiful it could work as an epitaph for Hayao Miyazaki summing up his best contribution to animation inviting us to dream to pursue our dreams and to take them seriously like a poet a bit like an engineer always like a dreamer.This is one of the greatest animated movies of recent times and given how critical I was about Frozen I was shocked that it won the Oscar. From what I read there was some controversy surrounding the peaceful nature of Jiro a sugarcoating of the war and an overuse of smoking. I'd say The Wind Rises deserved better than being beaten by a film that tried to play the socially relevant card to death. But the masterpiece flies over Frozen like a zeppelin over a fish bone.";

In sequences like this Miyazaki sets up the film's central theme not only that flying machines will inevitably be used to massacre human beings but that every human endeavour every piece of art every piece of technology is inevitably compromised.Later Jiro and Caproni discuss the Great Pyramids. I'd rather live in a world with pyramids than a world without Caproni states. The implication is clear dreams may be cursed pyramids may be built by slaves to honour tyrants but better them or nothing. That this is a false binary or giant strawman argument is lost on Miyazaki one can always extricate oneself from problematic actions or systems.But the difficulty in extricating oneself from such things or noticing them in the first place is what seems to interest Miyazaki. Jiro himself eventually emerges as a Little Eichmann. A reference to Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann the term refers to anyone who on an individual scale seems dutiful benign or harmless but is nevertheless complicit in aiding or propagating destruction. As such Jiro's romantic idealisations are subverted throughout The Wind Rises culminating with the death of his wife to tuberculosis. Jiro may remain naive but bombarded with much dread and apocalyptic imagery Miyazaki's audience is never allowed to forget the darker ramifications of Jiro's actions.Though Miyazaki never really sanctions Jiro and Caproni's romantic rationalisations the intensity at which Miyzaki portrays Jiro as a wideeyed moron has led many to accuse The Wind Rises of whitewashing Jiro's historical role. Jiro's planes after all were built by Chinese and Korean slave labour. They were used to attack Korea invade China the Philippines Vietnam and so forth. Historians point out that Japan's militarism was hardly unique in terms of early 20th century Imperialism no better the Empires of France Russia Britain and the burgeoning United States would account for far more deaths but you did it too is no defence.Odd for a lead character Miyazaki's Jiro is passive lacking in any selfreflexivity and never questions what's going on around him. Despite or because of this the film works well as an allegory about the innocence arrogance myopia and culpability of artists and the way in which states coopt and pervert the aspirations of individuals. Such themes are typical in Japanese animated features everything from Akira to Sky Crawlers the nation seemingly forever sceptical of urbanisation modernisation and every new piece of technology it rampantly gobbles up. Miyazaki is himself a bit of a technophobe. Modern life is thin and shallow and fake he moans in interviews I look forward to when developers go bankrupt Japan gets poorer and wild grasses take over! The Wind Rises is as gorgeous as Miyazaki previous films bouncing from bucolic agrarian Japan to urban spaces to several long flying sequences. Elsewhere scenes in 1930s Germany echo a German tourist's visit to Japan and the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 foreshadows the atomic destruction of 1945. Jiro's wilful naivet itself resembles that of the physicists who split the atom.What's perhaps most remarkable about The Wind Rises though is the way it accurately captures the psychology of those working at the cutting edge of high tech industries. Jiro is intelligent passionate and singleminded but always moving between hotel rooms offices and lonely spaces. This alienation Miyazaki says is precisely what makes Jiro's intelligence so dangerous. Cacooned and sheltered Jiro belongs to a learned class which rarely meaningfully interacts with ordinary people and so rarely questions the morality and ramifications of its own behaviour. The result is a lead character whose brain is incredibly parcellated steeped in all forms of sophisticated denial.This being Miyazaki The Wind Rises is also obsessed with notions of Progress. Miyazaki's Japan becomes corrupt and perverse as it embraces the emacipatory tenets of Modernism. These perversions are subtly mentioned by Miyazaki if we ignore his heavyhanded dream sequences such as sequences in which poor children roam the streets or when banks foreclose on civilians. The result is a very sophisticated portrait of a nation in decline at the precise moment it embarks upon a project to lift itself up.Many have complained that Rises isn't as fun as Miyazaki's other works. Indeed the film at times seems like a dour melodrama by Yasujiro Ozu. But Miyazaki subverts the conventions of the melodrama at every turn. Consider for example the way Jiro's blindness literal and metaphorical echoes the film's very own aesthetic and narrative structure which relentless avoids looking at or thinking about warfare. For this is a film about a young man who is so preoccupied with love life and aviation that he doesn't realise that he's helping rain destruction down upon Japan the spectre of the atomic bombings loom over the film. In this way Rises plays like an anime version of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon or De Sica's The Garden of the FinziContinis another film in which surface beauty and foregrounded decor ironically counterpointed thematic underbellies.Rises boasts Miyazaki's most autobiographical script since Whisper of the Heart. Parallels are drawn between aeronautical engineers and animators between hanger bays and animating studios and Jiro at times resembles Miyazaki himself with his bespectacled eyes and love of windswept wings.

	schema:reviewBody "How do you even begin to talk about the final film from one of your favorite filmmakers to ever live? Japanese animation maestro Hayao Miyazaki has made some of the greatest animated films ever. From My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away Miyazaki's imagination seemingly knows no bounds so when he announced last Fall that The Wind Rises would be his last film before retirement I immediately knew I had to see it on the biggest screen possible no matter what. The Wind Rises is simply put another Miyazaki masterpiece. If you are already a fan of his works then you will love it and even if this is your first taste this very well might be the best place to start. The film tells the slightly fictionalized life story of one of Miyazaki's personal heroes aeronautical engineer Jiro Horikoshi. While Jiro is now more famously known as the man who built the Zero Fighter that the Japanese used to bomb Pearl Harbor the real Jiro was a pacifist who only wanted to build something beautiful. The film follows Jiro from 1918 all the way through the start of World War II and details the sweet yet tragic love story between him and his ailing wife while also showing how Jiro was inspired to create the Zero Fighter.Upon seeing The Wind Rises it's obvious why Miyazaki chose this particular story as his swan song it features every major thematic idea of his various works all compiled into one narrative and yet it is very different from any of his other films. Could Miyazaki have created another lavish fantasy adventure as his final film? He could have and all of his fans would have watched it but there's something special about The Wind Rises that makes it worth every ounce of salt in the world. Miyazaki's pacifism his eccentricity and his optimism are all on full display throughout the narrative all represented through the eyes of Jiro and how he processes everything through vivid daydreams and his own quiet optimism.As far as the animation goes the folks at Studio Ghibli have all done another marvelous job. The dream sequences where Jiro envisions planes are all some of the most gorgeous images Ghibli animators have ever drawn and the way that the animators use wind especially when dealing with any outdoor scene between Jiro and his wife Nahoko is simply stunning. There is an expressionistic flair to the wind that is very reminiscent to how Studio Ghibli approached the water in Ponyo. The wind feels alive and almost becomes a bit of an invisible puppeteer often working as hard as the music to cue you into the emotions of the story. Speaking of the music Miyazaki's longtime collaborator composer Joe Hisaishi has delivered another breathtaking score that manages to defy expectation with the Italianinspired theme juxtaposed against the Japanese setting.I really can't say enough about The Wind Rises. Perhaps the film has so much resonance for me because I am such a huge Miyazaki fan he ranks behind only Steven Spielberg in my book of favorite directors of alltime but The Wind Rises truly is a sensational film as well. This is quite possibly the most romantic film Miyazaki has ever made turning paper airplanes into a new form of love letter while also delivering some of the most fully fleshed out characters Miyazaki has ever committed to film. Like all of Miyazaki's works the characters are all slightly eccentric funny and extremely lovable even in all of their flaws but there is a depth to every character and their motivations in particular Jiro and Nahoko that is deeply moving.While The Wind Rises is not typical Miyazaki the spirit of invention is still there in every frame where you feel as if you are discovering a long lost epic from the Golden Age of Hollywood or something. That's actually how The Wind Rises feels to me. The Wind Rises is so simple yet complex at the same time and is consistently entertaining while being a movie you'll definitely want a hankie for. Thank you Miyazakisan for this film and for a career that has inspired me so much.I give The Wind Rises a 10 out of 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wind Rises is a beautifully crafted and highly enjoyable movie. Its story of an obsessively brilliant young man given to dreaming extravagant dreams and then actually realizing those dreams is timeless. When viewed purely as a cinematic experience The Wind Rises is an achievement of a very high order.Unfortunately the film has two significant flaws. First the handling of the character of the movie's protagonist Jiro Horikoshi is regrettable. Jiro is portrayed in uniquely heroic terms. From an early age we see him acting with the utmost virtue under any and all circumstances  rescuing young children from bullying carrying a woman for miles and miles on his back in the aftermath of an earthquake etc. Given the complexity of the animation this oversimplification of Jiro's character is jarring and his portrayal sometimes becomes mawkishly sentimental and irritating.More significantly this film glorifies the work and life of a designer of military airplanes that were used to kill many thousands of people. In scene after scene the Japanese militaryindustrial complex of the 1930s is portrayed as employing a wonderfully sincere and goodnatured group of men who were ready to roll up their shirtsleeves and work day and night to build beautiful planes. The passing references to what those planes would be used to do to the devastation of war are noticeable but have little impact on the viewer. Bathed in the warm glow of Miyazaki's incredible animation the audience feels the few brief references to war and devastation as if they were mild bumps on a very smooth airplane flight.The scenes of Jiro and his colleagues when they visit prewar Germany are quite telling in this regard. Although the scenes in Germany do include some highly controlling German behavior as well as a scene of someone being pursued at night by a gang of welldressed thugs not one single swastika is shown during perhaps 20 minutes of footage. The word Nazi is never uttered. Although the name Mr. Hitler is uttered much later in the film during a conversation Jiro has with a German at a Japanese resort  the man has a very large nose and is perhaps a regrettable caricature of a Jewish person  the name Mr. Hitler is spoken only once and with complete neutrality as if Jiro is saying the name Mr. Smith.This movie's brief allusions to wartime devastation and its omission of any mention of Japan and Germany's heinous ideologies greatly compromised my experience. It portrays Jiro an enabler of terrible worldwide aggression in the most heroic and reverent terms. If for domestic Japanese political or commercial reasons Miyazaki could not offer a more realistic and balanced story of Japan's preparations for and its predations during World War II then he should have chosen a different subject for his film. This comic book fantasyadventure left me angry and sad and for all the wrong reasons.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not recommended.Filmmaker Hayeo Miyazaki's last animated film The Wind Rises tells the reallife story of Jiro Horikoshi an engineer and designer of Japanese fighter planes during World War II. Drawn in the anime style with its stylized detail and realistic backgrounds the film plays like a historical biography and doesn't shy away from its adult storyline. This is a seriousminded animated film for adults which never panders to a younger audience. There are no happy songs cute characters or overblown theatrics involved. There is also no excitement joy or any semblance of emotional connection. The heavyhanded story continually weighs the film down even if the film's artistic inventiveness is at times buoyant and quite lovely to behold.Miyazaki's vision is known for his whimsical and other worldly themes as in films like My Neighbor Totoro Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away. Here he stays mostly grounded in realism due to the screenplay that goes through the paces of this man's life. Whereas in his past efforts Miyazaki's films were populated with strange creatures in afascinating surreal world that enchanted viewers with his unique poetic viewpoint those trademark bizarre and mystical creatures are nowhere to be found. In The Wind Rises the acclaimed animatoris now tether to the real world with only occasional flights of fantasy in the form of Jiro's dreams to free Miyazaki's creative imagination and engage his audience. His storytelling grounds the film for all the wrong reasons and the film never soars. The film is a disappointment a film so conventional and boringly told sidestepping important details about the main character's obsessive work with new models of fighter planes that actually were used at the Pearl Harbor invasion a fact never mentioned.A tender love story of Jiro and Nahoko ably voiced by Joseph GordonLevitt and Emily Blunt becomes a more interesting subplot. But weak voiceover work by an allstar cast nearly sabotages the film. The dialog is barely passable with too much overemoting by Mandy Patinkin John Krasinski Elijah Wood William H. Macy and Jennifer Grey. Even worse are some characters that become racial stereotypes of Italian Stanley Tucci German Werner Herzog and Japanese ethnic groups both in tone with the actors' heavy accents and in the physical caricatures as they are artistically rendered. In fact one character Mr. Kurokawa is so overplayed by Martin Short that it becomes a borderline offensive parody onto itself. That character is so reminiscent of Mickey Rooney's political incorrect interpretation of I.Y.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is not recommended.Filmmaker Hayeo Miyazaki's last animated film The Wind Rises tells the reallife story of Jiro Horikoshi an engineer and designer of Japanese fighter planes during World War II. Drawn in the anime style with its stylized detail and realistic backgrounds the film plays like a historical biography and doesn't shy away from its adult storyline. This is a seriousminded animated film for adults which never panders to a younger audience. There are no happy songs cute characters or overblown theatrics involved. There is also no excitement joy or any semblance of emotional connection. The heavyhanded story continually weighs the film down even if the film's artistic inventiveness is at times buoyant and quite lovely to behold.Miyazaki's vision is known for his whimsical and other worldly themes as in films like My Neighbor Totoro Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away. Here he stays mostly grounded in realism due to the screenplay that goes through the paces of this man's life. Whereas in his past efforts Miyazaki's films were populated with strange creatures in afascinating surreal world that enchanted viewers with his unique poetic viewpoint those trademark bizarre and mystical creatures are nowhere to be found. In The Wind Rises the acclaimed animatoris now tether to the real world with only occasional flights of fantasy in the form of Jiro's dreams to free Miyazaki's creative imagination and engage his audience. His storytelling grounds the film for all the wrong reasons and the film never soars. The film is a disappointment a film so conventional and boringly told sidestepping important details about the main character's obsessive work with new models of fighter planes that actually were used at the Pearl Harbor invasion a fact never mentioned.A tender love story of Jiro and Nahoko ably voiced by Joseph GordonLevitt and Emily Blunt becomes a more interesting subplot. But weak voiceover work by an allstar cast nearly sabotages the film. The dialog is barely passable with too much overemoting by Mandy Patinkin John Krasinski Elijah Wood William H. Macy and Jennifer Grey. Even worse are some characters that become racial stereotypes of Italian Stanley Tucci German Werner Herzog and Japanese ethnic groups both in tone with the actors' heavy accents and in the physical caricatures as they are artistically rendered. In fact one character Mr. Kurokawa is so overplayed by Martin Short that it becomes a borderline offensive parody onto itself. That character is so reminiscent of Mickey Rooney's political incorrect interpretation of I.Y. Yunioshi from Breakfast at Tiffany that I was gobsmacked at its disturbing comparison.Artistically there is so much to admire with the visual look of the film but not much to really get excited about. Besides its sluggish plotting the film mixes too many styles that just don't mesh very well detailed hand drawn linear contours with rich pastel colors painterly watercolor washed settings that create wonderful atmosphericeffects but are impressive computer generated imagery that nevertheless is jarringly misapplied.

The Wind Rises 2013 is Hayao Miyazaki's swan song and he could not have bowed out on a better note than this. Going from the TV series Future Boy Conan 1978 to TWR shows how Miyazaki's vision has changed and evolved over the years it's a beautiful thing.A loose biopic of Jiro Horikoshi this film is a gorgeously animated meditation on art love war and social responsibility. It's grownup tone and refusal to answer life's big questions make it so unlike the animated fare we are continually fed in the United States. If I didn't already hold nothing but contempt for the Oscars I would be furious that it lost to Frozen 2013 which is a cute but underwhelming movie.Let's hope Disney will release this for the home video market soon. This movie would also make a great doublefeature with Porco Rosso 1992 another Miyazaki film concerned with the rise of fascism before WWII albeit done in a more lighthearted manner.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been watching Studio Ghibli films for only a little over a year. And by now I have seen more than a dozen films. I have seen films released in 1986 Laputa to 2013 The Wind Rises and the beauty of the films has not decreased in 27 years. That's a long time to be consistent and I appreciate Studio Ghibli to still be producing films of such quality.I first watched The Wind Rises just after watching Grave of the fireflies which is a great movie itself and therefore could not appreciate the film to that extent. Having recovered from Grave of the fireflies after about 2 weeks I watched the film again and was astounded. And since then I have watched the film 3 more times. The magic doesn't seem to fade. Its still there.And what a soundtrack. It is the best of all GhibliMiyazaki Films and whatever credit you give to Joe Hisaishi it is still less. The music is stuck in my head since then and with the same intensity. I can not overemphasize the beauty of this film. There are a lot of strong moments moments which will persist even after a long time. You feel like you have gone back to childhood. There are a lot of themes touched. Love Sacrifice Regret Determination to name a few. Its more of an experience than a film. Its a tribute to Flight and Animation and if its to be Mr. Miyazaki's swan song then it is fitting enough be considered one of his if not the best. There are not a lot of things you can call beautiful but this surely is... Great work!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to pull out all the stops as I'm trying to verbalize how mightily impressed I am with Kaze tachinu 2013 or The Wind Rises. Miyazaki has now been at the top of his game for well over thirty years and his latest and apparently last film is remarkable in all the usual modi operandi  luxuriant use and understanding of colour extraordinary level of detail in even the most mundaneseeming particulars that make the scenes come to life fantastical sense of the relationship between dreams and imagination and reality and how the story stems from the images and extends to the world of the creator and ours. The film tells the story of Horikoshi Jiro a genius whose enthusing search for perfection makes him descend the dreampath laid down in his youth. A story of determination the film is also a profound meditation on the forces of nature Tokyo destroyed in the earthquake and by fire the aircraft in shreds and pieces. The influence and inspiration given to Jiro by what only he seems to be able to see around him makes him the visionary that he is. Airplanes trains ships radiators. The path to advance technology first by exposure then by imagination and invention. To be either Achilles twenty years behind or the tortoise. Filmmaking is very much the same seeing the unseen imagining that which has not been imagined. This is not compromise or pampering to the lowest common denominator but art that goes all the way beyond our wildest dreams and is still able to describe the indescribable so lucidly we become enraptured and immediately converted.All the Miyazakis I've seen have some incredulously indelible moments without compare. Here there are several including the utterly beautiful dreams especially the wind the opening five minutes in full the remarkable sound design during the dreams and the earthquake the water the rain and the flight.And speak of the wind! It has personality it's brilliant and as powerful as in Ran 1985 Zerkalo 1975 or The Wind 1928 in some ways even more so because it's animated in ways impossible to achieve in live action. And the love that uncharacteristically seems to evade and elude as it does in Wong KarWai's Fa yeung nin wa 2000. She paints and the picturesque mise en scne and the atmosphere is comparable to Van Gogh 1991 and its languorous lushness. Then there's Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain used by Castorp as an allegory for forgetting yet the novel becomes real through Nahoko's illness and not as a token of forgetting but instead of never forgetting.And then there's the war. It flies like a dream the pilot says thanking Jiro during the apparent climax of the film and Miyazaki cuts to a scene of utter destruction a cemetery of people ideals ideas and technology a disaster not unlike the earthquake in the beginning yet so tragically unlike.The name of the film comes from a quotation from Paul Valry but refers to Ghibli the name of the studio but also the engine of the aircraft in Porco Rosso 1992. It's a real engine used in an Italian aircraft during World War II designed by the Caproni seen in the film. In a way then this is as natural a conclusion to Miyazaki's career as one could imagine a flight of imagination carried by the most powerful wind and a shared dream of great minds that we are lucky to be invited in.".

I heard tons of positive reviews and as a Miyazaki movie I expected it to be poetic deeply touching and rather sad. It seems numerous people felt that way when they saw it it didn't work on me the tiniest bit.What I liked the depiction of Japan in a modernization and westernization phase something we rarely see on TV. Traditional kimonos side with western costumes modern cars move along ancient ox carriages. The way this modernization impacts on the people could have been deepened though even if it's not central to the moviethe depiction of the work of engineers the many little details that they have to take into account and that inspire them the weight of screws the form of a fish bone. This is also something rarely seen on TV that I for myself find quite fascinating.the beautiful landscapes and colors you expect of a Miyazaki moving. Since it shows the real world you may not be spirited away but still I found it very pretty.What I didn't not enjoy pretty much everything else.  First of all The wind rises is veeeeery repetitive. I couldn't count the amount of train rides plane crashes dream flights with Caproni unsubtle hints on the movie's maxim Paul Valry citation Le vent se lve wind blows in the face of the hero and repetitions of this quite pretty melody that becomes extremely annoying the tenth time it is repeated seriously almost all of the film had one and the SAME melody.The story arc in my opinion there was none. No suspense no tension the movie is just a 2 hourslong sequence of unrelated scenes glued to each other in a chronological manner. No character or relationship development either and even some plot holes. I like slow paced movies where few happens Sofia Coppola is one of my favorite director but they have to be hypnotic they shouldn't give you this feeling of waiting which gives you the opportunity to ponder upon the reason why you keep watching. I waited during the whole movie to feel implicated but nope I was just bored beyond belief. This is mainly due to the characters and their relationships to each other that feel extremely superficial and clichd. Jiro is the good studious and naive boy with a few knight in a white armorscenes Naoko is shy fragile and soooo in love Kayo the little sister is a grumpyfaced Chihiro the few Germans are cold and harsh controlfreaks. That over the 20 years of the story none of the faces evolve doesn't help. The romance between perfect workaholic Jiro and his devoted submissive? wife that hasn't any background story and any wish of her own except to die without disturbing her husband?!! is also really disturbing and syrupy sweet but let's skip this part. the main reason why I didn't like is the light and very oblique way it spoke about Japanese history WW2 and the role of our nice hero Jiro. Jiro and his team conceived the Mitsubishi Zero one of the deadliest plane of WW2 that was assembled by Korean and Chinese slaves? Let's not lose ONE SINGLE WORD about it. After all poor Jiro didn't see one of his beloved planes come back from war. After all Jiro has one or two naive pacifist punchlines I just wanted to build beautiful planes the weight of the plane will fit if we leave out the machine guns. Should be enough to excuse what he'd done for fascism in Japan. Which isn't acknowledged either. The only suffering you see or hear of is that of the poor Japanese people Tokyo earthquake ruins after Americans bombed the country... not the one Japan brought upon the whole Pacific. It could have been a nice tale about the impact of naive geniuses on the world but it's not. Just feels like avoidance. To me Miyazaki gets none of it the seriousness the madness and the cruelty of that era of history. This film is illconceived and unreflected and I'm still amazed by its critical acclaim. Definitely not a movie I'll recommend except in a reflection upon whitewashing and Japan's blinkered examination of its own history.".

The only suffering you see or hear of is that of the poor Japanese people Tokyo earthquake ruins after Americans bombed the country... not the one Japan brought upon the whole Pacific. It could have been a nice tale about the impact of naive geniuses on the world but it's not. Just feels like avoidance. To me Miyazaki gets none of it the seriousness the madness and the cruelty of that era of history. This film is illconceived and unreflected and I'm still amazed by its critical acclaim. Definitely not a movie I'll recommend except in a reflection upon whitewashing and Japan's blinkered examination of its own history.";

	schema:reviewBody "The focus of most of these comments has been on the film's perceived political commentary on American politics.Let's make one thing clear This film is a satire not a commentary in my opinion it's not about Republicans or Democrats or conservatives or liberals it is about the nature of democracies.The point that the film Bob Roberts makes can be summed up very clearly. Here is the nature of democracies Voters choose winners over losers champions over whiners statements of power over statements of sacrifice. The list goes on people prefer form over function youth over age presentationentertainment over substance.This film does transcend political lines but in it's context lets take a look at the specifics.  Bob Roberts is electable because his message is just vague and occluded enough by his presentation that he seems likeable. His message is not unique or original he speaks to the elements that have always appealed to the more rightwing or fascistic elements of society marginalization of the weak in this case the poor empowerment of the common man family values etc.Roberts' opponent Paiste is a textbook liberal but this contest is not about left vs. right.  Paiste is an educated man and a career politician. He acknowledges the challenges in the American economy.  He actually has answers to the issues whether they are politically favorable or not is not significant.  Roberts on the other hand says nothing about the real issues he appeals only to the emotions of the mob and because he uses the medium of folk music he offends the sensibilities of liberals both in the movie and in its audience because he uses the authenticity of the 60's and its messages of change and perverts them to express his messages of reactionism and exclusion.And it works.Tim Robbins has a winner here and this film gets overlooked because it gets dragged into these conversations about Robbins' own political views and whether the film is making a statement about Republicans or Democrats. But Robbins says something far more universal with this film democracies are not safe from tyranny or fascism all it takes is a charismatic reactionary who can manipulate the interests of the press and the political interests to rise to power by appealing to the worst elements of our psyche for entertainment glamour and exclusionism.  Please remember that Hitler came to power by appealing to the worst aspects of the people of his nation and was quite successful in creating much evil from that.  Being part of a free nation comes with a huge responsibility to carefully consider who we elect and what we value and to allow those debates to have meaning.  Bob Roberts shows us how easily we can neglect that responsibility and how easily voters can be sold an offensive exclusionary message when it is wrapped up in something more attractive than what's real.".

He's the Perfect Politician and that's why he's going to win... even if it takes a little manipulation here and there and maybe even some slight legerdemain. But you don't have to know that. All you have to know is that he's the guy with that open smile he's the guy who can sing a folk song he's the Poster Boy for the American Dream the one who can make this country a Country and make us proud to be an American citizen. He's the man you'll see on every news channel  Headline News Fox News CNN MSNBC  and he'll make you feel good about yourself. He'll talk about promise he'll embrace the people and the people will love him because he's their Hero.This is one sharp tack of a movie and one that every thinking person should sit on and feel the prick and maybe even see a drop of blood come out like a red flag. Tim Robbins is the new Orson Welles in the fact that he's able to direct write and star in his movie about corruption in the political arena. With this movie he's made his own little moving picture that depicts what we see on a daily basis once election times comes sway  candidate against candidate using the worst possible tactics to make the other seem unworthy of a vote always promising to make things better improve the status of life and making sure they look as primped and handsome and camera friendly as humanly possible because it's a known fact that handsome men gain more votes than men who look like Ebenezer Scrooge.And Robbins has those oddly engaging looks of his that make him the ideal person to cast in the role of the politician that is swaying the masses to his will in Pennsylvania. His is the face that looks angelic in many ways but one that holds a little menace just under the surface. Maybe it's the coldness of his eyes but when he plays characters like this he seems like he could slap you blind without a second's notice and immediately resume his cameraready smile in no time. And how many politicians don't already look like him? I'd like to know. Bob Roberts is a summation of all of the wannabe governors and presidents that we've seen display their talent for jab. We all want to follow someone which is why the movie becomes this monster towards the end and in one short scene Jack Black all but goes bonkers in his support for Roberts. That's the reality of the political game and just another part of who we are as Americans.".

The sad thing is as you watch the film you see how easy it is for this horrible man to manipulate the media into getting him elected. By using good looks and off hand remarks candidates are able to steer elections in the direction they want them to go. Meanwhile honesty takes a back seat to how well a candidate can croon a song. Truth trails behind what the media might be able to use as entertainment. The media is dazzled by fluff and sound bites they turn a deaf ear to real issues. When I saw this film the first time I was very uncomfortable. The film was too close to reality. Bob Roberts is a Joe McCarthyRush Limbaugh for the 1990's. Although they might seem harmless on the surface they do pose real danger. This movie is important and should be seen by all voters. It tries to teach people to look at the facts and the real issues and put the fluff aside. Ahh if only that could be done.".

His albums and videos are reminiscent of Bob Dylan The Freewheelin' Bob Roberts but his songs have titles like Drugs Stink and This Land Was Made For Me and lyrics like what's right is right what's left is wrong. It's funny to see the very liberal Robbins play a character like this. The songs written by Robbins and his brother David are very witty and biting and get his point across beautifully. Bob pulls a crazy stunt near the end to try to sway voters in his direction which I'm surprised no real politician has done. James Spader does an absolute perfect parody of a news anchor. A very funny movie particularly the songs Robbins sings. Brilliant satire. The final shot in this movie like the one in Robbins' Cradle Will Rock is very powerful.".

Bob Roberts was a 1992 'mockumentry' about the election of a Republican knownothing the title character to a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania in the movie Roberts wins against a toobrainyto win Democrat played by Gore Vidal.  The real 1994 U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania featured Rick Santorum as the Republican candidate. Santorum not only had the same aggressively antiintellectual outlook as Roberts I understand his staff is afraid to leave him alone with the press lest he 'throw a brick' he even used generous helpings of Roberts' fauxrevolutionary rhetoric to claim that his election would be an empowerment of the common people of Pennsylvania against a murkilydescribed 'elite'.   In fact Santorum like Roberts was a front man for an economic interest  to wit the health insurance industry  who bankrolled 95 of his lavish campaign and which was eager to replace his rival Harris Wolford who was an advocate for universal health coverage.   Like the Vidal character Wolford was disadvantaged by being a genuinely concerned person whose detailed worldview found it hard to stand effectively against the style of SantorumRoberts.

	onyx:emotionText "I am surprised that no one in this comments index noticed how truetolife this film turned out to be.    Bob Roberts was a 1992 'mockumentry' about the election of a Republican knownothing the title character to a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania in the movie Roberts wins against a toobrainyto win Democrat played by Gore Vidal.  The real 1994 U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania featured Rick Santorum as the Republican candidate. Santorum not only had the same aggressively antiintellectual outlook as Roberts I understand his staff is afraid to leave him alone with the press lest he 'throw a brick' he even used generous helpings of Roberts' fauxrevolutionary rhetoric to claim that his election would be an empowerment of the common people of Pennsylvania against a murkilydescribed 'elite'.   In fact Santorum like Roberts was a front man for an economic interest  to wit the health insurance industry  who bankrolled 95 of his lavish campaign and which was eager to replace his rival Harris Wolford who was an advocate for universal health coverage.   Like the Vidal character Wolford was disadvantaged by being a genuinely concerned person whose detailed worldview found it hard to stand effectively against the style of SantorumRoberts.    Guess who represents our state today.";

	schema:headline " Best Political Thriller Since The Manchurian Candidate";
	schema:reviewBody "A guitartwanging conservative with youthful looks and dark charisma launches a disturbing drive for political power in this perceptive and disturbing black comedy written and directed by Tim Robbins.There are lots of reasons to dislike Tim Robbins. He's a movie star. He's smug selfrighteous arrogant selfpitying and rich. He's married to Susan Sarandon the most gorgeous and vibrant mature woman imaginable. He has so much yet consistently strikes the pose of a martyr. I tuned into this movie prepared to hate it but came away very impressed. Whatever his flaws as a citizen or a political thinker Tim Robbins is a gifted film maker. The musical numbers are hysterical and the documentary style comedy is the best since SPINAL TAP. The movie keeps moving at a suspenseful pace and the chilling ending is surprisingly convincing understated rather than too melodramatic.Now there are some flaws to this movie that I think merit discussion. Tim Robbins hates the Bob Roberts character he plays hates him with a passion. Yet he strikes several false notes. Some reviewers would deny this but Bob Roberts is clearly supposed to be an evil Republican populist like Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. And that's fine. But Robbins gets into trouble by making Roberts too much like . . . well like Tim Robbins.Bob Roberts is a too hip. He's a Hollywood hipster. He digs folk music adores Bob Dylan and is entirely too cerebral and too in love with the flash and glamor of MTV type videos. Tim Robbins misses the essence of how conservatives market themselves how they tap into and genuinely share the loathing the white working class feels for intellectuals and artists. Bob Roberts minces around in a white fencing suit fencing with his campaign manager like a proud Prussian prince. Fencing! When George W. Bush was at Andover he named himself high commissioner of stickball. He knew even then that fencing was worse than polo. Tim Robbins misses the point about what cultural populism really means.On a deeper level this movie wants to leave you in a cold sweat like Frankenheimer's 1962 version of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. And it succeeds to a degree. But these characters are all surface with no depth. Bob Roberts is as cold and reptilian as Raymond Shaw but the problem is that his evils are all political not personal. You don't see more than a second or two of Roberts' parents and early life. You certainly don't see a maniacal mother figure like Angela Lansbury in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. There's not a hint of connection between the inner emotional or sexual lives of these characters and their extreme political convictions. Bob Roberts has a wife a blonde who hangs on his arm and smiles adoringly but we see nothing else. Married to a woman as formidable as Susan Sarandon Tim Robbins must know much more than this about marriage. But he doesn't accept the challenge. As a result Bob Roberts is a political cartoon rather than a person. And therefore the movie is chilling but ultimately not as profound or tragic as older political films like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay make no mistake Bob Roberts is definitely not the most subtle film ever made. It's not so much a veiled attack on the American rightwing as it is an all singing all dancing celluloid spit in the Republican party's face. It's also as paranoid as a junkie and almost proudly one sided which might be why it has slipped into relative obscurity  it's a film that could be very easily dismissed as a piece of leftwing propaganda directed by and starring Tim Robbins an outspokenly leftist actor.But Bob Roberts is a film that deserves a lot more attention than it receives largely because unlike a lot of political comedies it's actually funny. Bob Roberts is a mockumentary about a right wing politicianfolk singer named unsurprisingly Bob Roberts. Roberts is a kind of anti Bob Dylan whose modus operandi is to emulate the spirit of the folk singing radicals and then deliberately turn their message on its head  he sings songs about enforcing the death penalty on drug dealers and the positives of investing in the stock market. Dylan provides such an obvious touchstone for the character that it's arguable the whole film is as much a spoof of the Dylan documentary Don't Look Back as it is a political satire.  The songs are a good example of what makes this film work. Sure they're unashamedly political and barbed  they're the kind of spoofs that you'll now find dime a dozen on youtube  but they are so painfully earnest and straightfaced that they're kind of hypnotic. In Bob Roberts Robbins has created a character who absolutely believes the terrible and terrifying things he sings about and he plays the part with a wide eyed enthusiasm that makes you laugh but in that oh so unsettling I'm genuinely disturbed by this kind of way.  The jokes are totally underplayed save for an out of place 'before they were famous' Jack Black cameo appearance. He's the only actor who inhabits his role as if it's meant to be funny all but giving the audience a big fourth wall breaking wink. Everyone else however lets the humour come naturally from the insanity of what they're saying they don't gurn to the camera. From Alan Rickman's performance as the shadowy Big Business agent to Gore Vidal as Bob Roberts' running mate the rest of the cast play the thing totally straightfaced.Sure the movie's pretty preachy but it never becomes boring at a lean 102 minutes it's a freight train of a film spitting out characters situations and genuinely thrilling plot twists.Best of all is the film's ending which is as cutting as the punchline to a sick joke. There's no messing around to this one. The conclusion socks you in the guts then carries on its way whistling Bob Roberts' Drugs Stink as it goes.".

He is directing acting writing singing song writing  in one word he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies video clips concerts and political rallies all in one. And the result is incredible. There is a lot of mobility to the movie and he uses the shaky cam a lot but without the shaky part which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes and the two don't mix they don't bleed into each other and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around.The script starts lighthearted funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant the mix of singing and politics is very well done managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie as the writer drives his point home but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo.The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural both as an actor and as a singer and his portrayal of a tireless relentless flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles.There are a lot of cameos by Alist and Blist Hollywood actors and the movie turns at times into a veritable Spot the celebrity kind of game which ads to the entertaining value. James Spader hello Sir right this way. Here are your lines this way please. Susan Sarandon Hellen Hunt Pamela Reed Fred Ward Jon Cusack welcome welcome. Here are your parts please go right this way. Jack Black Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir I don't know anybody by that name but please please do come in. We'll see what we can do.The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest even if they are meant as a satire not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole bringing the powerful performance to a full circle.Bob Roberts.

The message of style over substance in politics making the news in America holds even more true today.It's really too bad that this movie was mismarketed and essentially buried it seems that even now it hasn't gotten the audience it deserved. The politicized nature of the content is most certainly the cause of that you can be sure.The songs are frighteningly well put together and convicing apparantly Robbins never released a soundtrack for fear of having them taken out of context. Anybody even remotely interested in the Mockumentary genre or in politics should definitely check this gem out. A brilliant piece of black comedy.".

The message of style over substance in politics making the news in America holds even more true today.It's really too bad that this movie was mismarketed and essentially buried it seems that even now it hasn't gotten the audience it deserved. The politicized nature of the content is most certainly the cause of that you can be sure.The songs are frighteningly well put together and convicing apparantly Robbins never released a soundtrack for fear of having them taken out of context. Anybody even remotely interested in the Mockumentary genre or in politics should definitely check this gem out. A brilliant piece of black comedy.";

I just rented it again August 2003 and find that it is as relevant now as it was then  perhaps even more so.I like the fact that the movie doesn't try to explain what exactly is behind Bob Roberts's campaign.  There are some hints that he may be a pawn and there are some hints that he may be playing a pawn.  Wheels within wheels.I also like the fact that they didn't take the easy route and make him into some kind of neoNazi.  Yes there was the guy with the intense eyes and Bob written on his forehead but Bob was given a broader appeal and a message that sounded on the surface very positive.Also subtle was the depiction of the media.  When Bob's competitor Paiste played wonderfully by Gore Vidal loses ground in the polls the media keeps dragging up the accusations even after it's no longer news and has been fully  debunked.  We wonder  are they pandering?  Is somebody telling them what to say?  Or are they just incapable of reporting news competently?  The movie leaves it to us to decide.Another subtlety crops up when Bob falls off the motorcycle.  Without writing a spoiler I'll just say that we briefly and not blatantly see evidence that his free spirit on a motorcycle image was carefully designed and managed.  If it's not clear what I'm referring to I'll just say the other white suit.  The same level of subtlety occurs when one of his campaign workers leaves by mutual agreement.  It's not completely clear what her mistake was but the stagemanaging of the whole event e.g. the Dom Perignon comment is quite enough to make the underlying point that she wasn't sufficiently committed or bamboozled for whatever the heck was really going on.I expect that if I saw this film a third time I'd see even more little tidbits like those.Incidentally I watched this movie with my jaw permanently dropped.".

What does the left have? A rabid underground journalist Bugs Raplin a goofy Saturday Night Livetype show Cutting Edge Live that may once have been edgy but now just seems silly even Roberts himself is a fan a tired old senator droning on about social programs Paiste and a few strident voices crying in the wilderness including the journalist played by Lynne Thigpen. Roberts has replaced Bob Dylan as the voice of his generation Robbins includes a hilarious riff on Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues video from Don't Look Back. Robbins' real target here is how the ideals of the 60s have failed miserably how times have changed back and how greed selfinterest and intolerance have become the new order of the 1990s and continue today. Roberts is not George Bush senior or juniorhe's a much more frightening animal who shows up just how the voices of dissent have dwindled into insignificance.".

By taking swipes at twofaced politicians and the grinningidiot members of the mainstream media who cover them Robbins managed to make his leftwing cause with humour. Although this film is a comedy it's not often laughoutloud funny but it's actually quite balanced politically. I never felt this was turning into a polemic because ANY politician who runs a dishonest campaignno matter which wing they representwill feel the sting of this mockumentary.As the title character Robbins plays a rightwing senatorial candidate in Pennsylvania who badmouths the revolution of the '60s while prostituting '60s images and reworking old folk songs to sell his corrupt message. It's quite amusing to hear an outspoken actor play a guy who's such a polar opposite. Roberts has it in for drug users the homeless the unemployed and any other group who aren't in the upper class. While the documentary filmmakers shoot all sorts of footage that can help the candidate look great they also manage to get many shots of the Roberts team at their worst. To be honest it might have been even more effective if Robbins didn't paint this man as the sleaze he really is. Letting the hateful folk songs which are performed with great cheer and the moneyhungry message speak for themselves might indeed have been more powerful. Scenes of dissension and anger in the Roberts camp almost undermine what the film is trying to do.As an actor Tim Robbins has been in an equal mix of drama and comedy. It's interesting that the rookie director would follow this sly satire with the deadserious 'Dead Man Walking'. It shows his range that he could be funny here while also expressing strong views then dial it down for stark pathos while still expressing strong views in 'Dead Man Walking'. In these two films and in 'Cradle Will Rock' he uses his friends and stock company of familiar names including wife Susan Sarandon Jack Black John Cusack Bob Balaban and several family members.If 'This Is Spinal Tap' 'Best In Show' and 'Real Life' are among the best mockumentaries 'Bob Roberts' is just a notch below. It doesn't have a particularly strong ending and the entire assassination subplot plays out as way too obvious. Giancarlo Esposito Roberts chief painintheass is an annoying actor and his radical reporter character never benefits the film. Still the sharp pokes this film takes are deserved and seem to be right on target. Here we are 12 years later and the movie is just as topical now. Not all political films manage to pull THAT off. Take a look at the poster where the villainous Bob Roberts is draped in the American flag. The current administration would love this guy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was fascinated by this selfcontradictory sometimes maddening film.  I had only seen a snippet of it before the brilliant song parody of a rightwing folksinger singing about welfare recipients who complain and complain and complain and complain and complaaaaain!  I was impressed by the quality of this ditty and rented the movie.Although billed as a comedy I found this one to be a generally oilandwater mixture of paranoid leftist diatribe and political comedy. Everytime a stereotypical Republican character elicited the response in my brain nobody acts like THAT I remembered oh yes it's a comedy. Although I laughed less and my heart beat faster as the movie progressed...I guess what disturbed me about this picture is it's offkilter perspective.

I had only seen a snippet of it before the brilliant song parody of a rightwing folksinger singing about welfare recipients who complain and complain and complain and complain and complaaaaain!  I was impressed by the quality of this ditty and rented the movie.Although billed as a comedy I found this one to be a generally oilandwater mixture of paranoid leftist diatribe and political comedy. Everytime a stereotypical Republican character elicited the response in my brain nobody acts like THAT I remembered oh yes it's a comedy. Although I laughed less and my heart beat faster as the movie progressed...I guess what disturbed me about this picture is it's offkilter perspective.

	schema:reviewBody "Raj Kapoor's Bobby will never get old. It is a brilliantly made modern teen romance. Raj Kapoor's direction and imagination are excellent ditto for his realistic portrayal of the modern 1970s India and its middleclass Christian community. The romance is portrayed beautifully injected with many youthful energies and further aided by colourful and vernal locations beautiful romantic songs comedy and drama and two very charming fresh talents in the lead roles.This is the love story of a pretty smart and headstrong Christian schoolgirl named Bobby and a romantic rich and wellmannered young man named Raj who unlike most of his contemporaries prefers to sit at home and write poetry. He falls in love with her the first minute he meets her and surprisingly enough it does not look clichd. The story shows how they start dating each other and how they later fight parental opposition. Interestingly while Raj Kapoor made this film to launch his son on the big screen he titled it after Dimple Kapadia who impressed him very much and reminded him of his muse Nargis. In a documentary about the life and craft of Raj Kapoor he said that Bobby's first meeting with Raj in the film was loosely inspired by Kapoor's first meeting with Nargis at her home. And I completely understand why the memory of meeting her stayed with him for the rest of his life when I see this scene. It is a magic moment.Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia make for a very good couple. This is according to me Rishi Kapoor's best performance along with his role in Mera Naam Joker. Maybe his dad was the one who could extract his talent to the fullest. He is likable impressive and very convincing as Raj. Dimple Kapadia's is undoubtedly one of the greatest debuts in the history of Hindi cinema. She was natural compelling beautiful and acted with total aplomb. Her western outfits and sexappeal are still very memorable. The rest of the cast are excellent with Prem Nath standing out in a wonderful comic act as Bobby's loving father. Pran was also very convincing as Raj's witty proud and dignified father and Durga Khote and Aruna Irani provided fantastic support. Oh and how can one forget Farida Jalal's Alka Sharma? A fiveminute role which stays with you forever just like the film.The film's cinematography is effective the editing is good as well and the art direction is fantastic. The characters are wellwritten and most importantly  the music is simply outstanding. My favourite songs are Main Shair To Nahin as is Aruna Irani's wonderful dance for the song and Chabi Kho Jaye Hum Tum. All in all Bobby was a trendsetter and it still remains an alltime sensational and fresh love story which will never look dated.".

He was naughty in his childhood and is sent to boarding school. He was never truly given the love of his own parents.He grows up and comes back home. In his birthday party he catches a glimpse of Bobby Dimple Kapadia. Raja is swept away and for him it's love at first sight.Raja finds out that Bobby is the granddaughter of his governess Mrs. Briganza Durga Khote. All his life Raja had treated Mrs. Briganza more like his mother than his own mom Sushma Sonia Sahani. Bobby's dad is a fisherman named Jack Briganza Prem Nath who definitely likes his rum. He longs nothing more in the world than his daughter to be happy.Raja and Bobby start to get to know each other better. And as they had suspected they were soul mates. Now all they needed was permission to get married.But they soon learn that the road may not be as smooth as they'd predicted. Raja's dad Nath Pran has a lot of pride in his money and his khandaan. Nath doesn't get along with Jack...and because of this Raja and Bobby and prohibited from seeing each other.But as the world knows love has no boundaries...but in this case could it be possible that Raja and Bobby can never be together? Was money that big of a deal? Or will it be a happy ending? Watch Bobby to find out! I certainly loved this movie! The star cast was chosen nicely. Rishi Kapoor delivers a strong screen presence all while being pinchmycheek cute! Adorable I tell ya! Dimple Kapadia also looks cute in many scenes and acts pretty good. Aruni Irani is wonderful in her role and the character she played was expressed very well through her actions. Pran well what can I say? Akhir Pran hi tho hai! Woh hume kabhi disappoint nahin karega! Prem Nath acted nicely and so did Durga Khote. Sonia Sahani had a small role but she played it well to a nice extent. Farida Jalal had a significant special appearance. She played it perfectly.The music! My god the music! LaxmikantPyarelal made beautiful evergreen tunes! The songs...the background music...everything was absolutely perfect. Well except one thing. This is my opinion but I didn't think there was any need to use Shailendra Singh for these marvelous songs. I think even more beauty could have been added to the songs if someone like Rafi Kishore or Mukesh had sung the songs. Besides SS's voice didn't even suit Rishi that well.I just have to talk about Lata of course! She once again proves how extremely flawlessly beautiful her voice is. When I finished watching the movie her melodious voice continued to sing in my head. All the duets like Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai and Jhoot Bole Kauva Kaate are sung perfectly by Lata. Her solo Aye Phansa is quite enjoyable too it shows her versatility. Her oneline song Akhiyon Ko Rehne Do is quite effective in the movie.The hit song Mein Shayar Tho Nahin is composed perfectly...the lyrics are quite nice too. Na Chahoon Sona Chandi is quite entertaining Manna Dey sings very nicely.And last but not least the direction by our showman Raj Kapoor. It was great every scene is directed and edited with care in order for the movie to be organized as well as entertaining. Some scenes made me cry. The character development is displayed well through the direction. One flaw though and this is just my opinion. Sometimes the shortsskirts for Dimple are just too short and tended to give her a sleazy look. I was just waiting to see her in a pretty sari but unfortunately I didn't get to see that.But anyway Bobby is definitely a classic. I give it a nine out of ten. Definitely worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that yesterday is the first time that I saw Bobby. I have always loved its songs and watched them occasionally too but never checked the whole film out. Yesterday I decided to finally check it out and I feel bad for not visiting this gem before. In Bollywood there are quite a few good teenagers  young adults relatively love stories. Some of the classics include  Love Story Ek Duje Ke Liye Betaab Hero Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak Maine Pyar Kiya and Dilwale Dulhanaya Le Jayage DDLJ. When it comes to teenagers  young adults love stories Bobby is undoubtedly the trend setter and would probably sit at the top. I would not go in to the story as we know how these films go. What is important is how these films are made. In Bobby Raj Kapoor has ensured that he got all the ingredients right. The chemistry between the lead pair is as good as it can get. Veteran actors Pran and Prem Nath play their roles convincingly. Prem Chopra makes a cameo in which he introduces himself similar to how James Bond does  Prem naam hai mera Prem Chopra. What to say about the songs? They still sound great. In fact this is one of those films which has a great collection of memorable songs. Coming back to the film being a trend setter I was surprised to find that Maine Pyar Kiya is an improvised version of Bobby. What is interesting is that while films such as DDLJ may appear to have dated now or lost some of its appeal to an extent Bobby still continues to impress. One thing that could probably be improved is the first 15 minutes or so of the film where the film shows young Raj Rishi Kapoor growing up. Considering the taste of today's audiences may be start the film from when Raj returns from the boarding school. Raj Kapoor is a legendary film maker and many of his films including Bobby should be restored to HD  4K format reedited and re released at least on Blue Ray.".

	schema:headline " Too Much Sexuality To Disturbing Extent !";
	schema:reviewBody "First off I can't hold my feelings against the way director Raj Kapoor was displaying his heroine Dimple Kapadia. I've never seen before in Indian movie or else such a passion to show and just show off a teen girl's body as plentiful as this ! It sure turned the taste of the movie from a romantic tale to a lunching of a 16 year old sex symbol ! Making the whole story from another Romeo and Juliet to another Lolita !Raj Kapoor was always interested in hard love stories this one is yet with a happy ending and without far melodramatic turns. However no movie he directed up till that moment was having this desire to exploit sexily a very young girl as increasingly as we've watched! That already exceeded the proper bounds of the movie's basic love story to an extent makes you think that Bobby's main point wasn't its love story only ! It was the 1970s. Earlier there was the free swinging and hippie 1960s. So it was ordinary to have a risqu fashions in a 1973 movie. But away from any historical conformity with the night gowns the short skirts the visible panties underneath them and the red Bikini ! Kapadia looked strangely naked for most of the time and according to the romantic movies the Indian cinema at the time and the girl's age  shockingly naked !. Clearly it isn't a movie about seduction and if it's about the sexual dimension in love then the nakedness was too abundant. It isn't even a sex comedy and you know what ? If it is then that's the wrong age to use!So could that be part of some kind of general development was happening back then values tastes modes movies..? or simply Kapoor was desperately commercial dispatching this sexuality to certain audience giving them a new yet teen sex goddess ?? That's itself new enough !. At any rate it is what the audience needed in India 1973 putting in mind its rank as super hit. And Kapadia grew up to be one of the boldest temptation queens in the history of Indian cinema anyway ! As someone who savors the classic Indian songs I must say that save Mein Shayar Tho Nahin no other song got my admiration or attention. Raj Kapoor's famous love of using wide lens is evident in here. He always was thinking of the viewer as they must see huge sets and performers all the time. The drown behinds the dcor were part of the romantic sense with its exact colors and smooth design. By the way this movie can be as useful as a dictionary for anyone who wants to study all the early 1970s gaudy and vociferous costumes for boys and girls. Prem Nath was nice in his supporting role. I touched a slight state of being influenced by Raj Kapoor's direction and acting. And we all know that Pran is god's gift to the supporting roles in the Indian cinema. He's one of few actors all over the world that can define The supporting role enjoyably and by countless movies too.Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia have great charisma. Yes the performance was plausible but what makes it super is originally the casting. The 2 of them are real teens. Being in the right age for a romance was always a problem in movies. The bet at the newcomers here was right. Sadly I didn't see both of them as bright except very few times later. I didn't like the script. Too ordinary makes the story not only old and familiar but weak as well. Simplicity has been forever the shortest way to being classic but wholly not this time. Bobby is supposed to be a naive love story with all the clichs the stereotypes but on a richly entertaining level. It didn't work for me because its true naivety sometimes and its distracting rather disturbing use of its heroine. It was importunately determined on manufacturing a wet sexy dream out of pretty young girl with or more than a romance between a boy and a girl.".

	onyx:emotionText "First off I can't hold my feelings against the way director Raj Kapoor was displaying his heroine Dimple Kapadia. I've never seen before in Indian movie or else such a passion to show and just show off a teen girl's body as plentiful as this ! It sure turned the taste of the movie from a romantic tale to a lunching of a 16 year old sex symbol ! Making the whole story from another Romeo and Juliet to another Lolita !Raj Kapoor was always interested in hard love stories this one is yet with a happy ending and without far melodramatic turns. However no movie he directed up till that moment was having this desire to exploit sexily a very young girl as increasingly as we've watched! That already exceeded the proper bounds of the movie's basic love story to an extent makes you think that Bobby's main point wasn't its love story only ! It was the 1970s. Earlier there was the free swinging and hippie 1960s. So it was ordinary to have a risqu fashions in a 1973 movie. But away from any historical conformity with the night gowns the short skirts the visible panties underneath them and the red Bikini ! Kapadia looked strangely naked for most of the time and according to the romantic movies the Indian cinema at the time and the girl's age  shockingly naked !. Clearly it isn't a movie about seduction and if it's about the sexual dimension in love then the nakedness was too abundant. It isn't even a sex comedy and you know what ? If it is then that's the wrong age to use!So could that be part of some kind of general development was happening back then values tastes modes movies..? or simply Kapoor was desperately commercial dispatching this sexuality to certain audience giving them a new yet teen sex goddess ?? That's itself new enough !. At any rate it is what the audience needed in India 1973 putting in mind its rank as super hit. And Kapadia grew up to be one of the boldest temptation queens in the history of Indian cinema anyway ! As someone who savors the classic Indian songs I must say that save Mein Shayar Tho Nahin no other song got my admiration or attention. Raj Kapoor's famous love of using wide lens is evident in here. He always was thinking of the viewer as they must see huge sets and performers all the time. The drown behinds the dcor were part of the romantic sense with its exact colors and smooth design. By the way this movie can be as useful as a dictionary for anyone who wants to study all the early 1970s gaudy and vociferous costumes for boys and girls. Prem Nath was nice in his supporting role.

His struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds to move through every golfing challenge of his day and succeed beyond the realm of possibility is well captured in Caviezel's delicately nuanced performance.Not a great movie but certainly worth more attention than it received in the theaters.

For the rest of you this true story will give you a glimpse of one of the best if not the best golfers and truest gentlemen the golf world has ever known.The story acting dialog cinematography were all first class. Some good music was even put in from time to time. All that aside this is a moment in a life that we feel is more important than all that. Even if the story acting dialog and cinematography weren't up to par it would not have mattered much because we learned about the man who lived and played in another zone than the rest of us. But that is a moot point because everything here was up to par.For years whenever we watched the Masters Golf Tournament we heard the name Bobby Jones and the announcers would list some of his accomplishments however this never really told us about the man himself. Well this movie does. Okay some things in it may seem sappy corny and not real but in those days that is the way things were. Those were days when respect for everything meant everything was everything and people moved on from that standard.In some ways the movie makes Bobby Jones out to be more human although we held him above that station. Yes he had a temper when he hit a bad shot but learned to control it. Yes he had some medical problems that we never really knew about. Yes he seemed somewhat selfish running from tournament to tournament at the expense of his family but the pressures on him were really great. And his family always stood by him. He accomplished what he wanted to accomplish at a young age and then quit tournament golf to be more with his family. Later he founded Augusta National Golf Course where the Masters is played each year.James Caviezel was probably the best person to play the role of Bobby Jones and his performance made Bobby Jones more real for me and this will always stay with me. It is probably too much to hope that the age of respect will once again come around but to those who see this movie that standard will be remembered at least on the golf course. Anyway this movie is a real special treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many amateur golfers I am interested in learning more of the early history of our game. That's the primary reason why I rented this film.What better place to start than with this film. Hollywood did a fine job telling the story of one of golf's memorable amateur players Bob Jones. And for sure many of us are also well acquainted with the Jones' legend the only man to have captured golf's 'Grand Slam'.Way back in the Thirties Bobby Jones won the U.S. and British amateur titles as well as their senior counterparts The U.S. Open and the U.K.'s 'Open Championship'. Accomplishing all that is no small feat either. Bobby did that in a single calendar year.And almost immediately after he had climbed golf's pinnacle Jones announced his retirement from tournament golf. He was 28 at the time.Some notable pros of his era fellow American Walter Hagen and Scottish legend Harry Vardon both thought highly of the smallish man from Atlanta Georgia. They too both saw the making of golf legend many times.Some matches they won. In others where they lost to Jones' magical shot making even finishing runnerup was considered an honor. However winning was not that easy for the mercurial first ever golf 'superstar'.The film devotes much time to exposing his mystery ailment stomach troubles. The cure though was less than conventional. Bobby took a little whiskey from time to time. So the film's producers claim.Early in his career the film also mentioned another health issue Bob suffered from varicose veins. He was 'much too young for that' his father decried.Aside from the heavy exposure devoted to a young Jones' temper the film cast a bright light even halo over Bobby Jones. That brilliance presided over both the golfer and the man. What I didn't like was the many closeup shots of Jones' helicoptering golf clubs after an errant shot. We get it club throwing is not flattering behavior for a gentleman's game.There's no doubt that Bobby Jones was that. He was in fact a Southerner. And Southerners that I've met have always exhibited gentlemanly traits both behaviorally and in their speech.The last line here belongs to one of the film's producers. One expressed his sentiments paraphrased this way.Golf is a backdrop. The real story is about an extraordinary man. Moreover Bobby Jones left his indelible mark on both the golf world and all those who knew him.Nothing needs to be added there I agree wholly. Bobby Jones both the golf legend and as a fellow citizen are stories of renown. This film captured both the highs and lows of Jones' life on and off the course in a sensitive yet respectful manner. For their efforts I doff my cap to the producers directors crew and actors. And Jim Caviezel's reprisal of the golf legend did Jones proud.".

	schema:reviewBody "A biopic by its very nature adheres to a certain pattern.  It often starts near the end of the subject's public life then flashes back with the subject as a child shows the child develop the attributes that the film will be about then gradually tells the subject's story until we are back where the film began.  Generally the film ends with text recapping the actual achievements of the subject.  Knute RockneAll American Yankee Doodle Dandy Bravheart and Rudy just to mention a few are examples of employing this pattern in film.  Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius follows this pattern to a tee.The secret of making a good biopic is in adhering to this formula without becoming formulaic. In my mind this was achieved in the portrayal of Bobby Jones as equal parts everyman and legend.  While he is defined by his remarkable accomplishments on the golf course He like Eric Liddell interestingly enough both born in 1902 the Olympic runner depicted in Chariots of Fire purposed that those accomplishments would be merely part of his legacy not the entirety of it.The acting in this film is first rate.  Jim Caviezel did not look a thing like Jim Caviezel.  While this is due in some measure to make up it is also in Caviezel's uncanny ability to transform himself into the character he is portraying.  Claire Forlani is making a cottage industry of playing strong individuals who are also extremely dedicated to the care and nurture of their love interest Meet Joe Black  Mystery Men.  It is  in some measure her portrayal of Mary Jones that brings out to the audience the complexity of Bobby's character.Jeremy Northam's nuanced performance as Golf Pro Walter Hagen also betters the story by showing us the antithesis of Jones.  Jones plays to be the best at a game he loves whereas Hagen plays to capitalize on a game he excels at.These strong performances were enhanced by Rowdy Herrington's overall direction of the film.  The golf sequences were amazing and no doubt aided by Tom Stern's breathtaking cinematography.  While the pacing of the film seemed on track I  thought the film was about 10 minutes too long and dragged in places.  Some scenes in the film's second act seemed redundant and may have better suited as deleted scenes for the eventual DVD version.In my mind though the film passed the ultimate test of the biopic I left the theater wanting to learn more about Bobby Jones but also feeling like I knew him well already.".

The movie was a blast and portrayed Bobby Jones as the congenial wellliked character that he truly was. Bobby was loved by all and showed his love for the game by only playing as an amateur. The film did a wonderful job of showing Jones to be respectable and classy. Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius made me love the game even more and respect those who play itand those who play it well. More movies based upon reallife class acts we need. The best part of the film is if you are a golfer you find that empathy and joy to feel what he feels. It is the emotional bond you can share with Jones and it is more than the traditional goodguy that saves the day. He is a real person and is genuinely portrayed as such. Applaud the makers job well done.".

	schema:headline " Stroke of Genius  a big whiff";
	schema:reviewBody "If golf is a good walk spoiled this movie was 14 and two hours wasted. The script leaves too many unanswered questions for those who know nothing about Robert Tyre Jones Jr. which hurts understanding the storyline. Rather it assumes we all are familiar with the history of golf and how it relates to Jones and his accomplishments. Why were early professional golfers like Walter Hagen considered secondclass to amateurs in the era? What were the four major championships in Jones' time and why? Did Jones only play major championships? While the talent difference between professionals and amateurs is clear today the semantics of the word amateur today connote a lesserskilled person than a pro and the movie does nothing more than confuse people on that important element. The movie was financed by and produced by the Jones Film Foundation LLC it was. So what you really get here is the story of Bobby Jones the way the Jones family wants it told. Which explain the total lack of balance. Director Rowdy Herrington who cowrote the screenplay with two others produced a script that is as sophomoric and lame and laborious as it is predictable even for those who don't know the history of the man who was arguably the greatest golfer of all time. The movie is a nice period piece despite a few historical inaccuracies and mistakes  like the storewindow reflections of modern SUVs in a scene where the future Mrs. Jones rides a trolley around 1920. The steam passenger trains purported to be transporting Jones around the Deep South have Britishstyle locomotives and passenger coaches. The golf courses supposed to be Oakmont and Merion are of the wrong architectural style. The greens are cut much shorter and roll quicker than the technology of the day allowed as they didn't stripe tees and fairways in those days. And so on. The golf scenes are too few and too stiff and too disjointed to the point where we don't see any meaningful tideturning dramatic shots  save for the winning putts haphazardly spliced in. Just a bunch of miracle shots in between a soap operalike storyline. Some of Bobby Jones' Jim Caviezal tee shots look like the ball flight was added with a computer. The dialog and character development are both poor and amateurish with contrived pathos and stock drama. The movie's conversations were cornier than the outfield in Field of Dreams. There were far too many instances of adlib clairvoyance andor disbelief. For example before Jones attempts a flop shot that needed to clear the high top of a tree to reach the green we get a closeup of a spectator whispering He'll never make that shot. And of course he does. Maybe that's how they tried to convey that it was a difficult shot to the nongolfers in the audience but those who play or watch the game are offended with that kind of obvious simplicity. There's another scene set in a clubhouse bar where Jones is goaded by a burly professional who can't believe he wants to stay an amateur  playing solely for the competition and not the money. After a disgusted Jones finally walks away upset with the overacted tirade omnipresent biographer O.B. Keeler Malcolm McDowell whirls and punches the obnoxious guy in the mug then turns and offers the clairvoyant opinion Someday money will ruin sports. The script comes off more like a patchwork quilt of unsubtle insipid scenes that don't really mesh well or add up to a whole. It's as if they made a list of significant incidents in the life of Bobby Jones and then rushed to find a way to string them together. I'd be surprised to hear that the screenplay writers spent more than a weekend working on it. If it took any longer they should be ashamed. If you like contrived you'll love the scene where young Bobby pulls off yet another miracle shot and a shocked spectator punches his hand through the lid of his straw skimmer. The action is so forced so movieformula it is funny but for all the wrong reasons. And the arduous recurring clichridden theme of stern practical preachy grandfather disapproving of Bobby's silly pursuit of playing golf instead of aspiring to a more productive pastime  against his son's Bobby's father wishes  is finally resolved in group hug at the end that was so expected so trite so cornball it caused me to laugh uncontrollably at what other theatergoers deemed a very inappropriate time. Sorry I couldn't help myself. Caviezal who like most of the other actors gives a cardboard performance looks pained and anguished throughout the movie and blandly recites the faulty dialog. He doesn't look a bit physically like Bobby Jones. Nor does he swing like a golfer. Jeremy Northam as Walter Hagen is actually believable although I thought Bruce McGill The Legend of Bagger Vance which was as awful as Caddyshack II looked like and played the Hague much better. Oh yeah the writers took some liberties with the facts  like the scene where Hagen chides Jones in the locker room prior to the 1930 British Open. Too bad Hagen didn't even make the crossAtlantic trip in 1930. There's too much foul language and clubthrowing after bad shots and the cloying scene where a reformed Jones calls a penalty on himself despite claims from witnesses that his ball did not move at address is so goodygoody it's sickening. It's hard for the audience to become compassionate with the stifflyplayed Jones character here  although he is accurately portrayed as a member of privileged society where whites play the game of golf and are waited on at every turn by blacks. The ignored wife the supportiveyetconcerned parents the sermonizing grandfather a serious attack of varicose veins... aaargh! It's a shame. This movie had so much potential but bogged down by a silly script it never got off the first tee.".

That brings things down to a pretty small audience.That being said this is a very good film. I do have to admit that I preferred the depiction of Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen in The Legend Of Bagger Vance but the depictions here are probably more accurate. The film also suffers from being a bit too long...123 minutes...it could have been edited more tightly. And I wish it had spent a little time telling about Jones' illness later in life.The performances here are in my view solid. Jim Caviezel was excellent as Bobby Jones although I did prefer the depiction by Joel Gretsch in Bagger Vance. Claire Forlani is good as Jone's wife. Jeremy Northam was good as Walter Hagen although again I preferred the depiction by Bruce McGill in Bagger Vance. I never cared for Malcolm McDowell in his younger years but as he has matured I've come to appreciate his performances and he's enjoyable here. I almost didn't recognize Aidan Quinn as a British golfer...watch for him...it's a rather small part. Brett Rice was very good as Bobby's father and Connie Ray good as his mother. Dan Albright was interesting as the grandfather. I also enjoyed Paul Freeman as the Scottish caddy.If you're a golfer I recommend this film. If you're not a golfer you may find it boring. But it is a nicely executed film.".

The sentimentality quotient was about the same the emotionality of the soundtrack about equivalent though this music was quite a lot better. Those other two films were a bit hard to watch but the sincerity of this one has completely won me over. I think the film is tragically underrated. There are some films I love for their artistry some for what they teach this is one of the latter and I suspect many people don't like to think how their efforts might pale in comparison with Bob Jones's. This might lead to sourgrapes negative votes for the film. I don't agree with them. Some people really do try that hard to be good and live up to expectations and actually manage not to fall apart in the process. As one who has caved in and felt that strange totally solitary and empty freedom of total loss of a dream of success I could relate very well to Bob's feelings and I was hoping he'd prevail. If the film can do that to a skeptic like me it's done a good job. I admire the man and the filmmakers. I hope the portrayal has been accurate. It's nice to think purity of heart exists in the world.

It is a great movie even if you know nothing about golf and don't care about learning anything about golf. It is a wonderfully done movie with great historical information and a great group of actors and actresses who make the entire movie pleasurable. It follows the life on a golfing legend Bobby Jones who started playing golf as a child and continued playing amateur golf and is the only person to win the Grand Slam of golf ok so maybe I don't remember what the name for the big thing he won but it was 4 big golf championships. The movie is well worth the time to watch whether you love golf or know nothing about the game.".

As Keeler says in the movie There will never be another Bobby Jones....He was right of course since he was speaking of the man's character more than his golf talents. Keeler also says at one point quite prophetically too that money would destroy the sport. He would have been right about any professional sport but most particularly about golf where every victory majors above all are quickly translated into endorsement deals. The players have become walking billboards for all sorts of companies.....something they will not walk away from as Bobby Jones did. Highly recommended for the kids as they can witness sport as it was before athletic ability was measured in dollars.".

It was a good movie about a man who loved to play golf and over his lifetime transformed himself into a man of integrity perseverance and great intelligence. He knew what was really important in his life and he made a plan that allowed him to fulfill his destiny in golf and in his personal life. He was the best golf player in the world but he was also an awesome man personally. One of his greatest accomplishments was bringing his father and grandfather together healing a lifelong rift.The movie was well done.  It was both entertaining and enlightening. It definitely kept our interest for the whole two hours. We felt his sense of lifelong struggle that life was never easy for him and we celebrated his accomplishments both on and off the golf course. The actors did a wonderful job especially Jim Caviezel as Bobby and  Malcolm McDowell as OB Keilor the newspaper reporter who wrote about Bobby's career from the very beginning.  Jeremy Northam also had a good supporting role as Walter Hagen.We'd recommend that you see this movie you don't have to love golf to enjoy it but if you do you'll enjoy it all the more.  It's worth seeing in the movie theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the ridiculous 6 awards and bigdeal promotion Paul Thomas's Bobby Sox is a very slight feature film hardly figuring with his best work as some IMDbers contend. It's the stuff that overrated is made of.For starters the award given to vet Jamie Gillis is absurd as he brings little to his stereotyped role as a washedup movie star now an alcoholic out on the road to do ballyhoo for a crummy monster movie he plays the monster yet accompanied by his handler Jon Dough. Dough's performance is even worse as he recites his dialog as if under protest and is just as stereotypical as Jamie playing the onenote womanizer.Smalltown setting might have made for some interesting Americana one of my favorite Adult genres see instead Red Ezra's or Brad Armstrong's or Michael Raven's features in that vein like Roadblock Crossroads and Adrenaline but PT and his talented scripter Raven Touchstone settle instead for the requisite sex plus some injokes about their profession. Shanna McCullough is a welcome sight as the local movie house owner sponsoring the promotion with Jamie  Jon casting some local gal to help promote the opening of their picture for a 2week run. Again this plot line should have generated some interesting material for genre movie fans closer to the mainstream than XXX as in the roadshow and huckster approach that typified exploitation movies in the golden age of the '30s '40s and '50s.Star Nikki Tyler as Shanna's busty blonde daughter no family resemblance whatsoever and looking way too old  mature to be Shanna's offspring SM being 35 years old at time of filming is okay in the tease and humping department but lacks jailbait potential. She's the choice for the damsel in distress as drunken Jamie in his monster costume pretends to grab her and carry her off while the townsfolk laugh at his slapstick moves unable to properly lift the hefty young gal off Terra Firma.Her boyfriend yet another stereotype as Steven St. Croix is less incisive than usual as a James Dean in leather jacket styled j.d. is quite possessive and concocts a plot to get Jamie in trouble as his response to Nikki dallying with the old guy. He enlists a wellcast Chloe who at age 24 really looks like a nubile teen as team mascot in a dumb plot to fake C's kidnapping blame it on Jamie and get him thrown into the hoosegow. Just as silly Nikki and the local soda jerk Bobby Vitale hatch an instant plot to spring Jamie using buxom Kimberly Kummings to divert cops T.T. Boy and Jay Ashley while they whisk away Jamie to safety. He holes up vodka bottle ever in hand at Shanna's home and PT has diverting kink content of Gillis trying on Shanna's clothing and then becoming a willing sub as she whips him and indulges herself in some SM.Shooting in 35mm and on a weekplus schedule gives the film some quality but it really doesn't amount to anything. Chloe is clearly far more talented and appropriate to the show than leading lady Tyler and Vivid has one of its famous contract girls Jenteal thrown into the mix for a castingcouch style threeway with Dough and the distinctive looking Chelsea Blue.Worst bit of insidestuff inaccurate at the time and hopelessly datedmisleading now has Nikki in charge of mom's movie theater showing Vitale her reallife husband unused 35mm projectors noting that they only use tape now for projection. This is a mainstream movie theater not a porn house so that notion is way offbase and merely tossed in so that PT can have her switching the current film in progress to a videotape of his Blonde Justice Part Two starring Janine which is on screen in the background as Nikki and Bobby hump in the audience for voyeurs to watch and jerk off to. This mishmash of a scene plays stupidly just as sex filler and nothing more but utterly confuses the history of film exhibition with mainstream cinema houses switching over to digital projection a decade or so later in the 21st Century never stooping to VHS video like the adult houses did back around 1983.".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable B picture and sadly Jane Powell's last film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film stars Dana Andrews Don Dubbins and Jane Powell who is made up to be an island girl. Dana and Don are part of a ship where the captain is an ogre. They leave him when they stop on an island. They end up finding a tribe of people. Jane Powell catches Dana'a eye early on. Jane still looks gorgeous under all the island girl makeup she is wearing. Jane learns English thru Dana and they eventually fall in love. Dana even saves the tribe leaders life when another tribe attacks. His friend wants to leave but there is no chance to leave while Dana is in love with Jane. Don ends up leaving on his own and Dana tells Jane he loves her. Dana finds out the killed Don because they thought he would bring back trouble. Dana breaks a taboo and is also sentenced to death. He and Jane see Dana's ship and they take a boat to try to escape. Dana gets on the ship and Jane paddles away. He goes after her as the tribe catches them. The head tribe man cannot kill them but one of the other spears Jane in the back. Dana comes to her and paddles to the ship with her in his lap. I cannot tell you if she died or not. It's not that clear. The captain makes a statement about not marrying a couple in twenty years and that a married man makes a docile hand. That makes me think Jane survived. I could be wrong but I choose to believe she lived. If she did I give the film an 8 out of 10. If not it gets a 6 because I hate sad endings. The film is never boring and quite interesting to watch.".

Even Jorge Stahl's colour cinematography looks like it was shot on leftover stock or 'ends'.

	schema:reviewBody "According to her memoir Jane Powell was initially excited about doing Enchanted Island in which she sang not a note donned a black wig as there were not too many blonds inhabiting the South Seas and spoke in monosyllable Tarzan style dialog. But Jane did not show her acting chops and it turned into a bad location with a disinterested director in Allan Dwan and a leading man in Dana Andrews who was at the height of his alcoholic problems.Add to that the fact that RKO the producing studio was going out of business and Enchanted Island was sold in a studio fire sale to Warner Brothers. All in all it was a disaster.I suppose a vacation to Acapulco standing in for the South Seas was worth something to all involved in Enchanted Island. A New Bedford trading ship puts in to a South Sea Island and just as the men are starting to loosen up with the women Captain Ted DeCorsia who is a true New England puritan abruptly calls a halt to things. That doesn't sit well with two of the crew Dana Andrews and Don Dubbins. They take off for the interior of the island where they run into Jane Powell's tribe reputed to be cannibals.Just about what you would expect to happen happens in this setting. Dubbins gets homesick for his girl in New Bedford and that starts everything unraveling. According to Jane Powell the ending was changed so that she would not die. But if the indifferent performances hadn't spoiled the film already the changed ending certainly did. This film is definitely not what author Herman Melville had in mind when he wrote his novel Typee on which this film is based. Typee incidentally is the name of the tribe Jane belongs to.The one saving grace of the film is Arthur Shields as the cheerful Mr. Dooley who has gone native as the British would say with gusto. He's populated the island with all kinds of children and they all seem to be girls. But Powell isn't one of his. He attributes her blue eyes to a passing Swede who was her father. I guess RKO couldn't afford contacts for Jane as they were liquidating.Except for Shields no one comes out of Enchanted Island the film with any kudos. I should also say though that The Four Lads did get a hit record out of the title song.".

When the story begins a crew of a 19th century merchant ship has just landed on Nuku Hiva island in the South Pacific. Despite seeming like a great place to chase the pretty native girls or perhaps because of it the jerkface Captain orders everyone back aboard the ship...they're heading out! Not surprisingly the crew is angry as they haven't had shore leave in 14 months! In fact a fight breaks out and two of the men Abner and Tom Dana Andrews and Don Dubbins run into the interior of the island. Despite hearing that the Typee people are savage cannibals they're treated pretty well up until the two really spoil everything.The film is based on Herman Melville's first novel and is a modestly entertaining about life among the savages of Acapulco Mexico where the film was actually made. However the ending is bad in several ways you just have to see it to believe it...and believe me...you WILL hate it as it makes no sense at all. A sad waste because of this.".

One of them has an infection from a knife wound and they have stumbled into the cannibal part of the island. Don Dubbins is Tom the wing man. I think part of the charm of this film is that not many people were traveling in the 1940s and 1950s so seeing a film about south sea adventures was extra fun. The story itself is okay. But why would sailors WANT to stay in the village where they could be killed by the natives? They had numerous chances to leave. Runofthemill love story. Boy meets native girl. Boy falls for native. Can this work out or will their traditions get in the way? Directed by Allan Dwan... he only directed one more film after this one. Pretty good film mostly for the island adventure theme.".

	schema:headline " Religion conquers all";
	schema:reviewBody "The climax of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake might be model work made for the film but it also looks like it might be stock footage perhaps from Lon Chaney's movie THE SHOCK or something else. In any case this film and THE SHOCK adopt the cosmic retribution angle that the dustup was really a Gomorrahlike act of divine intervention against the Barbary excesses of Chinatown and such. Anna May Wong is thanklessly wasted as the sinfully exquisite assistant of future Charlie Chan Warner Oland a ruthless land shark who doesn't let anyone know he's really Chinese. He keeps his jeering dwarf brother in a cage and terrorizes the heiress of an old Spanish family whose righteous Christian iconography pierces his mongol heart. He codifies the social and sexual threat of passing and miscegenation which is depicted as repulsive to both races. But this is all articulated in religious terms.

	onyx:emotionText "The climax of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake might be model work made for the film but it also looks like it might be stock footage perhaps from Lon Chaney's movie THE SHOCK or something else. In any case this film and THE SHOCK adopt the cosmic retribution angle that the dustup was really a Gomorrahlike act of divine intervention against the Barbary excesses of Chinatown and such. Anna May Wong is thanklessly wasted as the sinfully exquisite assistant of future Charlie Chan Warner Oland a ruthless land shark who doesn't let anyone know he's really Chinese. He keeps his jeering dwarf brother in a cage and terrorizes the heiress of an old Spanish family whose righteous Christian iconography pierces his mongol heart. He codifies the social and sexual threat of passing and miscegenation which is depicted as repulsive to both races. But this is all articulated in religious terms. The anglos refer to his heathen gods while the Chinese get irate that he betrays his ancestors.

Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck one of his first as both a writer and producer although an uncredited one it starred Warner's reigning screen Goddess Dolores Costello. The film has everything  romance adventure tension between the races white slavery an earthquake  but it did drag a bit. The prologue featuring Tom Santschi and Martha Mattox from The Cat and the Canary showing how San Francisco was founded went on for almost 10 minutes but was completely unnecessary to the story  a few titles would have sufficed.Then The Story starts in 1906  Dolores Dolores Costello is the apple of her grandfather's eye but he has worries. He is desperately trying to ward off unscrupulous buyers who want to buy his ranch for peanuts!!! Dolores also catches the eye of Terence O'Shaughnessy Charles Emmett Mack a young partner in his uncle's law firm. They are acting on behalf of an evil businessman Chris Buckwell the Czar of the City  he wants the ranch and he will stop at nothing to get it. Played by Warner Oland who made a career out of playing Orientals such as Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan even though he was in fact Swedish. The twist to the story is that he is Chinese shock!! horror!!  a secret known only to his brother Angelo Rossitto a dwarf whom he taunts and keeps in a cage and a flower of the Orient Anna May Wong his partner in crime.The appearance of slimy Don Luis John Miljan who else!! sets the wheels turning. Hernandez hopes he will save the ranch but finds he is only lusting after his granddaughter as does Buckwell who arranges for Hernandez to be in the city so he can be alone with Dolores!!! Only an earthquake can save her from a fate worse than death!!! No not that fate  she has rebuffed Buckwell who in his rage carries her to his inner circle where she is all set to become the latest export for the white slave trade. She has also discovered his secret!!! Dolores Costello is preposterously beautiful as John Barrymore once claimed. From the little you see of her Anna May Wong is very fetching. Charles Emmett Mack who sadly died the same year in a car accident was sufficiently heroic and Warner Oland showed how wonderful he was in duplicitous roles. The earthquake was quite spectacular with tinted scenes of red and purple.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing you sure have to say about OLD SAN FRANCISCO is that it is a very lovely film to see. The print though very old is in almost pristine shape at least the version they showed on Turner Classic Movies and the soundtrack exceptional. In addition the director and cinematographer were absolutely brilliantmaking the most of every scene with the most artistic touch for a silent I have seen in a very long time. Delores Costello is simply luminous thanks to them and so many of the scenes were treats for the eyessuch as the scene between Costello and her suitor at the fountain. It just doesn't get much prettier than this.As for the story it was nice to see that Hollywood was trying to be sensitive towards HispanicAmericans as they are shown in a very sympathetic light. A major problem is that despite being so very prominority none of the people playing these roles are Hispanica very common problem in Hollywood until the 1960s and sometimes beyond. Today such a practice would be condemnedin 1927 it was par for the course. In this film Delores Costello did a great job acting she was terrific but she looked about as Hispanic as Shirley Temple. If you don't believe me that such casting was common try watching a Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto filmas these characters were repeatedly played by actors of European descent. In fact Warner Oland who popularized the Chan role is even in this film playing the role of a big dumb jerk who happens to be a Mongolian man posing as a White man! Oh and most of the Asians in this film are drug dealers pimps or assorted lowlifes so I am pretty sure AsianAmericans probably didn't line up to see this film! The story is about a family of noble Spanish blood living in San Francisco in the early 20th century. Though they have lived there before the Americans arrived they are continually treated like outsiders as the Anglos and Chinese gangs take advantage of them again and again. Thanks to a nice young Irishman who has fallen for sweet Delores the family has a benefactor and things might work out for the better....or not! See it for yourself to see if sweet Delores manages to escape the lecherous clutches of the Chinese underworld white slavers and greedy land speculators for a hint God doesn't like what is happening and perhaps He'll have to intervene.Despite the film's many shortcomings and overt racism as well as a sappy ending all of which can be understood based on the age of the film and prevailing social mores the film certainly IS excitingmostly because of its scandalous subject matter and fast pace. This combined with the artistic nature of the film make it a film worth seeing. Just don't let your politically correct friends and coworkers know! The sight of Oland's midget brother kept locked in a cage throughout the film like a dog is just too much to bear.".

	schema:reviewBody "1927 was only a few years after the real event but Old San Francisco is far from anything real from history. The movie was just made to capitalize on the epic tragedy without any guide line on a real life story of survivable so they made one up. That made up story was very racist and it was written by Darryl F. Zanuck whom later became the producer of future antiprejudice films in the 1940s. The film starts out with a lengthy prologue about the history of San Francisco. The opening felt like a lecture telling how Spanish aristocracy become to own the land by giving exampling by using one family namethe Vasquez. They show the history of the Vasquez with not needed scenes until the story proper begins in 1906 at the hacienda of Don Hernandez Vasquez Josef Swickard and his lovely daughter Dolores Dolores Costello. Already the film is lengthy most of that prologue would better serve cut on the editing floor. The story should started with 1906 not 1700's. Don Hernandez is having financial problem with his ranch nonetheless refuses the entreaties of wealthy businessman Michael Brandon Anders Randolf and his lawyer Terrence O'Shaughnessy Charles E. Mack to purchase his property. Terrence became love struck by first sight with Dolores but Vasquez refuse to sell the ranch and send the two men away. The two men return to Chris Buckwell Warner Oland a rich powerful business man who ran illegal activities in China. Not only is he plotting to grab their land for himself but also claim Dolores as his bride. Chris Buckwell has two big deep dark secrets under his skin. He's able to indulge in his illegal business without fear of retribution from his Chinese victims because people believe he is Caucasian status. Buckwell happens to Oriental. While Warner Oland is really white and not Asian Warner Oland was such a brilliant actor in this role and pretty much help him get further roles playing Orientals such as Charlie Chan. While the movie shows some Asians in a negative light it doesn't over do the stereotypes. While Buckwell might be over the top with him trying to sell Dolores to white slavery and him keeping a midget brother in a cage. There are scenes where normal realAsians are trying to plead their case to the evil Buckwell. It wasn'tuntil  of the film when the Earthquake came to play. It comes quick and end pretty much the same. It's really great to watch but it's not that long. Those special effects in 1927 were rather good in those days. It's still pretty interesting how they were able to do some of those scenes. Though beautifully photographed and consummately produced the action in this historical drama moves the audience. Shot at the end of the silent era Old San Francisco includes a Vitaphone soundtrack featuring synchronized music and sound effects that works well. The trouble with the film is its pace it's over the top characters and downright ignored of 1906 Earthquake itself. Check out the movie if you're a silent movie fan if you want a better movie about the earthquake check out 'San Francisco' 1938 film with Clark Gable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Accidentally came across this film on TCM as Sunday evenings were typically relegated for this film type. Against my better judgement I decided to persevere since one cannot predict what film footage may be used from the 1920's that document the history of a world famous city. I was fascinated with the street scenes and especially the beautiful Dolores Costello. The prologue created an intrigue of mystery and history combined that hooked me into further viewing and with no misgivings! I found the treatment of the Asian community completely horrifying but know there was truth to this aspect of racism that hopefully has long passed. The secret tunnels underground the 'trading' business seemly characters and abusive brothers made for compelling drama.I enjoyed the love story between the Mexican girl and Irish boy. Have interacted with this ethic coupling once in my life and the match made for an eternal love affair. Enjoyed the sweet simple yet heartfelt emotions portrayed on screen in silence save for the perfectly sublime music score.The earthquake scene was most anticipated and worth waiting for as the special effects were profoundly realistic for this time period. I was absolutely amazed at the director's ability to shoot many difficult scenes i.e. underground chase scene tunnel travel exterior city shots close ups and more.Very pleased with this format and will give the silent treatment a thumbs up for future viewing!".

Against my better judgement I decided to persevere since one cannot predict what film footage may be used from the 1920's that document the history of a world famous city. I was fascinated with the street scenes and especially the beautiful Dolores Costello. The prologue created an intrigue of mystery and history combined that hooked me into further viewing and with no misgivings! I found the treatment of the Asian community completely horrifying but know there was truth to this aspect of racism that hopefully has long passed. The secret tunnels underground the 'trading' business seemly characters and abusive brothers made for compelling drama.I enjoyed the love story between the Mexican girl and Irish boy. Have interacted with this ethic coupling once in my life and the match made for an eternal love affair. Enjoyed the sweet simple yet heartfelt emotions portrayed on screen in silence save for the perfectly sublime music score.The earthquake scene was most anticipated and worth waiting for as the special effects were profoundly realistic for this time period. I was absolutely amazed at the director's ability to shoot many difficult scenes i.e. underground chase scene tunnel travel exterior city shots close ups and more.Very pleased with this format and will give the silent treatment a thumbs up for future viewing!";

	schema:reviewBody "Old San Francisco 1927  12 out of 4 Fifth Vitaphone production from Warner is silent all the way through with the exception of some sound effects used in small places. The film tells the story of a Spanish family who moved to what would become San Francisco to set up their ranch but in 1906 an evil Chinese landowner Warner Oland tries to steal it away. The Spanish daughter Dolores Costello must try and save her land even though the odds are against here and all the fighting leads up to the famous earthquake. This is a decent movie at best which works on some levels but is rather disappointing in others. This type of revenge story isn't anything new and had been going on as early as the Griffith shorts at Biograph. Storywise nothing new is really done here but a few nice things happen with the new setting of Chinatown. Today the racial stereotypes of the Chinese folks would be considered racist but what we see here was accepted in 1927. Costello is pretty good in the lead role as she brings some energy to her character that helps the film. Oland is also very good as the Chinese man who pretends to be white in order to try and steal the land. Charles Emmett Mack and Anna May Wong have supporting roles and are pretty good as well. I'm not 100 certain but the final earthquake sequence appears to have scenes borrowed from the Lon Chaney film The Shock which was also set in San Francisco and featured the legendary earthquake. With that in mind the final earthquake sequence really isn't that impressive but there are some newly filmed scenes mixed in of building burning and these effects look pretty good. The Vitaphone sound effects are all rather small and include a few gunshots early on bells ringing and a few screams during the earthquake.".

I know it will not appeal to many people because to some it is not Politically Correct showing the Chinese as bad guys  especially Warner Oland  who later played Charlie Chan as the half white half Mongolian villain Chris Buckwell and  or because it is a Silent Movie. The funny thing is there are equal opportunity bad people in the movie not just Asian. There was John Miljan who played bad guy Don Luis  Hispanic and Andres Randolph  Caucasian Lawyer Michael Brandon. spoilers ahead What the story is really about is the greed of the people from the City Of San Francisco versus a traditional way of life that you see in the Vasquez Family. You see it with the murder of Don Hernandez de Vasquez brother because of the Gold Rush and the death of Don Hernandez because of greed and Chris Buckwell. There are two things that represent the Vasquez Family Their strong Catholic Faith and the family sword that they have used against their enemies. There is also a love story involving Delores and Irish Lawyer Terrence  Terry O'Shaughnessy  Charles Emmitt Mack.He is the hero of the movie who saves the property from his uncle Andres  who is working for Buckwell then saves Delores from being raped by Buckwell and finally rescues her after the earthquake. Basically he will do whatever is necessary for her. Why? Take a look at Delores Costello. She was stunning. The only actresses in silent movies who looked better were Clara Bow and Renee Adoree. My favorite scene the final one with Terry and Delores and their daughter who is playing with the family sword in the family home which is in the Hills over the City Of San Francisco. It almost symbolizes the fact that not only did Delores Vasquez win but the Vasquez Family way of life will continue on. 910 Stars.".

Jade has the greatest car chase I've seen in any film since the last time this director tackled one and it's full of cute little references to the rest of his career. There is even a blatant homage to Cruising Al Pacino for those of you who were really paying attention. When David Caruso takes those cufflinks out of the drawer and looks in the mirror as we fade to the beach skyline...shot for shot and beat for beat it's the last two shots of Cruising and it even conveys a similar meaning. This movie is clever raunchy sexy and fun. It's not the greatest film ever made but it certainly deserves a lot more credit than it is receiving here. When did film lovers become such humorless prudes? And why did Friedkin insist that the DVD be released only in a fullscreen version? Why why why???".

The hitandrun scene was extremely graphic wowwhat a stunt! except to Friedkin fans who expect a certain amount of gratuitous violence.  The final scene with CP and LF was perfect. I could feel the sexual tension jump out from the screen. The beautifully haunting song Mystic Dream by Loreena McKennitt fit the dark mood perfectly.

Jade is not about sex it is about sexual jealousy. The talent of Linda Fiorentino cannot be underestimated here giving depth to a part that amounts to no more than a typical male fantasy  part good girl part whore  that's right it's Crimes of Passion without Anthony Perkins and his bag of dildos. The leads are well cast and all give adequate performances and Friedkin throws in all his usual directorial touches subliminal images and you guessed it yet another bloody car chase. Jade is an enjoyable film with delightfully silly twists and overthetop violence come on you know you want to see Angie Everhart get run over again and is given some class from it's cast and director but in the end proves itself to be a guilty pleasure that makes one feel more guilt than pleasure.".

And most of all Fiorentino smokes up the screen whenever she's on it. Sensual damaged brilliant. She's amazing when given a good script like the Last Seduction but even with a flawed effort such as Jade she still sets the house on fire. The cinematography and art direction were the other thing that made this film. I loved the lavish sets and especially the eerie lighting during the final scene. And as far as the comparisons to Basic Instinct I see it as being about equal suffering from the opposite problems as Jade while the story was far more interesting the acting was pendantic at best.

	schema:reviewBody "Jade hasn't got enough in the way of memorable scenes or entertaining dialogue to be a thriller. My impression is of a that'll do let's get it in the can attitude towards the script the direction and the lack luster air of some of the cast. The video cassette I have says on the packagingAn Erotic Thriller. There is quite a lot of what could be called sex in this movie but the last thing it has is eroticism. I bought my copy from the special offers rack at a local store reduced 70 from retail. There is a hung jury on whether or not I wasted my money!Two of the leading players David Caruso David Corelli and Linda Fiorentino Trina Gavin look uncomfortable in every scene they do. When David Caruso left east coast cop TV to make movies in Hollywood I imagine this by the numbers effort wasn't the sort of thing he had in mind. Linda Fiorentino has made better appearances too. I prefer to remember her in The Last Seduction and Body Count. Body Count also provides an opportunity to see David Caruso doing much better work.Perhaps fortunately Chazz Palminteri and Richard Crenna seem completely at home with their roles of Matt Gavin and  Lew Edwards respectively. The MG characterization is well done. Chazz Palminteri's interpretation with its calculated cordiality and sinister edge makes a decent job of unexceptional material. LE is Governor of California. Richard Crenna gives him just the right amount of ruthless deviousness to be entirely believable as a career politician.Other things about Jade are worth a mention  at least they interest me anyway! The set dressing of the rich man's house has been done in impressive style by people who clearly know how to create visual atmosphere. Some of the soundtrack music is also better than routine. The closing credits are accompanied by an excellent haunting vocal The Mystic Dream performed by Loreena McKennitt. At least I think that's the lady's name the credit is fuzzy on my tape.Being few and far between the good bits don't save the movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jade hasn't got enough in the way of memorable scenes or entertaining dialogue to be a thriller. My impression is of a that'll do let's get it in the can attitude towards the script the direction and the lack luster air of some of the cast. The video cassette I have says on the packagingAn Erotic Thriller. There is quite a lot of what could be called sex in this movie but the last thing it has is eroticism. I bought my copy from the special offers rack at a local store reduced 70 from retail. There is a hung jury on whether or not I wasted my money!Two of the leading players David Caruso David Corelli and Linda Fiorentino Trina Gavin look uncomfortable in every scene they do. When David Caruso left east coast cop TV to make movies in Hollywood I imagine this by the numbers effort wasn't the sort of thing he had in mind. Linda Fiorentino has made better appearances too. I prefer to remember her in The Last Seduction and Body Count. Body Count also provides an opportunity to see David Caruso doing much better work.Perhaps fortunately Chazz Palminteri and Richard Crenna seem completely at home with their roles of Matt Gavin and  Lew Edwards respectively. The MG characterization is well done. Chazz Palminteri's interpretation with its calculated cordiality and sinister edge makes a decent job of unexceptional material. LE is Governor of California. Richard Crenna gives him just the right amount of ruthless deviousness to be entirely believable as a career politician.Other things about Jade are worth a mention  at least they interest me anyway!

	schema:reviewBody "Make no mistake 1 this IS a sordid crime story and 2 is is FAR better than the national critics  and the ones here  would have you believe. I have found it fascinating the three times I've watched it and look forward to seeing it again. It surprises me each time being better than I remembered. It's nicely photographed too. Why I can't get a widescreen DVD of this I don't know but all that seems to be available is full screen.William Friedkin directed this which usually means 1 a riveting story 2 stylish cinematography. That's the case here. I rate this movie so high mainly because it's so entertaining. And it doesn't overstay it's welcome at a short houranda half.There are some stunning action scenes with cars hitting people cars hitting cars and a long wild car chase through a parade in San Francisco's Chinatown.My only complaint is the normal Liberal inyourface bias that Hollywood always seems to show. They just can't help giving you their proDemocrat anti Catholic antiauthority bias. Early scenes provide some cheap shots on Nixon and Reagan and later we see the film's two male starts talking irreverently in church. The governor is a sleaze in the story and the cops are corrupt. I've just come to except these modernday film clichs and not let it interfere with my enjoyment of the film.Speaking of actors and characters David Caruso and Chazz Palminteri are the two male leads I referred to in the previous paragraph. They are both good. Why Caruso didn't make it in the movies must have been due to the roles he took not his acting. Linda Fiorentino does what she does best  plays a whore. There isn't a moral person in here at least with the lead actors. That's no surprise since sleaze king Joe Eszterhas wrote the script. Nonetheless those three actors are very good with Caruso as the cop the best. It's a crude story at times there was a NCversion available of this as well but it's very interesting starttofinish has some memorable scenes nice San Francisco scenery and a nice soundtrack from Celtic singer Loreena McKennitt.".

	schema:headline " Jade is a mess";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked the opening scenes nice camera work. Jade opens with the camera moving through interior of a rich guy's opulent mansion. He's dead in an upstairs bedroom where his SM equipment is located along with his collection of exotic weapons one of which has been used to kill him. Who could have done such a horrible deed? We know right away that the dead rich guy was a morally corrupt creep and probably got what he deserved but the detective character who is really an assistant district attorney Caruso has to investigate. Right away I didn't care much who did it. That's a bad sign in a mystery. Now there's this woman who's not only a psychiatrist but a prostitute and a major psychopath Jade Fiorintino. She's married to the ADAs best friend a rich defense attorney Palminteri and the ADA used to be in love with her. Neither knows that at night she goes out to a highclass whore house in Pacifica and sells her angular body to fulfill the twisted fantasies of rich powerful morally corrupt old men. The plot doesn't so much thicken as curdle. The governor of the State of California Crenna is involved and he's the most morally corrupt of all. Little more than a meaty Mafia boss or tinpot dictator he orders hits and hurls threats. He should have a cigar to chew. And of course he too is a patron of the notorious Jade. He's obviously responsible for several murders but as others have pointed out is never brought to justice.This plot doesn't make any sense. Jade the psychopathic psychiatrist is a cypher we never get a sense of motive or emotion or even of emotional injury. She's as cold as dry ice. Caruso seems to want to save her but really didn't she bring it all on herself? And she is one of the most unlikable and most unsexy femme fatales ever to flounce on the silver screen. She obviously hates having sex with her husband but he wants her even more when he finds out she's rotten. This stylish thriller is just too stylish for its own good. It's all surface. The characters are shallow and unlikable the plot makes no sense the chase scenes are well done but contribute nothing to the story. If you like a glitzy surface you might like Jade but otherwise forget it.".

The writer had previously cashed in with this idea and Hollywood chose to try again but with a real director. This formula isn't just about sex its about turning the noir mechanics on its head. Noir depends on an outside fate that arbitrarily throws strangers together in situations that are designed for and controlled by the values of watching outside the world of the action.Here everyone knows each other beforehand. There are essentially no strangers. The driving force is supernatural as in noir but it is rooted in and owned by the people we see. Its simple sexual desire lust.The story is ordinary the sex unconvincingly simulated. Even the automotive stunts are limp. There's some craft in how it is put together visually though enough to keep me engaged.But there is one remarkable feature. The score is hypnotizing. It is bicameral both halves based on prototypical themes. The male theme lustful uncontrollable and apt to be violent is from almost directly Stravinski's Rite of Spring. Its wildly erotic threatening dangerous. The female side until the end that is is a Celtic anthem soft passive receptive drifting.I do not ever recall something so directly cast so borrowed and yet so effective. I saw this close to a film Duel at Diablo where the score was literally canned bits from old movies and the dialog all dubbed. This part is fun and much more tantalizingly erotic than what you will see.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

I've only seen the theatrical release but just today ordered online the director's cut so I'll be watching a version soon that has about 12 extra minutes and I've heard it changes the ending from a get away with it type of deal to a get arrested instead type of ending.

Why?The last one minute of the film is somewhat like the final minute of The Usual Suspects. The difference is here the punch line is a combination of visuals spoken words and emotions packaged with a dark tragic twist while in The Usual Suspects the final punch line was a combination of visuals and black comedy that provided the viewer entertainment. It is definitely not the usual Hollywood script.While most critics seemed to throw brickbats at Friedkin and Eszterhas a superior supporting performance by Donna Murphy as the investigating policewoman Karen Heller seem to have escaped attention of most viewers. She stood out in a film where performances were not exactly remarkable. Ms Murphy has immense talent and I hope some good director notices her potential.Director Friedkin delivers what he is good atcar chases French Connection and outdoor shots. Nothing more. Screenplay writer Eszterhas more sinned against than sinning actually develops an interesting script with a steady stream of visual clues and interesting statements on psychology that unfortunately does not build up sufficient tempo to take off thanks to poor editing direction and last but not least uninspired acting by the lead characters. The script looks untidy and disjointed because of the lackluster editing and direction. Eszterhas' script may not be topnotch but definitely was not the reason for the end productI blame the director for not being able to lift up the film to a higher plane. Friedkin has extracted great performances from Gene Hackman in the past but in this film save for Donna Murphy he seems to have inspired none else in the cast. The cinematography of Andrzej Bartkowiak always impresses and the murder sequence in the crowded streets with the car was worthy of note of his talent.The film can provide you enjoyment if you attentively view the film.".

I guess that's the difference between the average IMDb user and the average movie watcher . The movie watcher is only interested in the genre of the movie and who stars in it and very little else . Being a regular contributor to this site means I notice names average movie watcher has little interest in . The downside to this is that a name appearing on the credits can prejudice my view of a film Take JADE for instance which was written by Joe Eszterhas . Did my knowledge of Eszterhas mean that I think this movie is very similar in tone to BASIC INSTINCT whereas it's not and any comparison lies in my own biased knowledge of the screenwriter  or is JADE genuinely similar to BASIC INSTINCT ? Certainly this is a movie that seems to have been produced with the same market trend for erotic thrillers that were being made at the time  with the worst one being that one with Madonna and Willem Defoe The plot revolves around a murder and a senior DA is brought in and the main suspect is a femme fatale with dubious sexual tastes . Cue lots of sexual intrigue  sleazy deviants and plot twists  few of which are convincing . And being the sort of guy who makes notes of who the director is I couldn't help noticing that William Friedkin is the guy who made THE FRENCH CONNECTION a film famous for a car chase . We get to see a car chase here which ends in the death of several million Chinese . If someone is thinking of doing a biopic on Chairman Mao they could do worse than hire Friedkin as the director ! I will say a couple of good things about JADE . The first is that Linda Fiorentino is very well cast as Trina Gavin who just oozes an understated smouldering sexuality  she's far better than than Sharon Stone in BASIC INSTINCT and a million miles better than Madonna in BODY OF EVIDENCE . Secondly I just love the very haunting quasi Celtic song The Mystic's Dream by Lorenna McKennitt . But apart from that JADE isn't really worth going out of your way to see".

	schema:headline " Basic Instinct 2 without the quality";
	schema:reviewBody "What a farce.  I think Joe Eszetheras got out his first draft of Basic Instinct and gave this to the producers and they loved it.  They probably did what all execs do that think they have taken a proven formula and try to use it again.  They laugh and think that they can use it again and people will eat it up.  The only problem is William Friedkin is not Paul Verhoeven Linda Fiorentino is not Sharon Stone David Caruso is not Michael Douglas and Jade is a very bad clone of Basic Instinct.  But there are so many familiar similarities in these two films that it makes you cringe watching them.  Fiorantino is a psychiatrist so was Stone.  Caruso is a cop so was Douglas.  Caruso drove a Mustang so did Douglas.  They both take place in San Francisco so that they can have a car chase over lots of hills and almost destroy both cars in the process.  There are lots of underground sexual practises in both films.  And they both try to be sexy. And both open with a violent murder of a very improtant figure.  I honestly can't believe that the producers would buy this and then spend 50 million on it with a B cast.  I'm not one of those people that thinks that Caruso is a bad actor but I certainly don't think that he is big enough from a TV show to open a film and if I as a casual film fan can figure that out for myself then why can't powerful movie executives?  It just makes no sense to me.  Caruso has charisma and he is quite good in this role but he should be happy sticking to supporting roles.  He just doesn't have a name to kickstart a film.  As for the director when was was the last time that he made anything that was good?  I honestly believe that he got lucky when he made The Exorcist although I do think that The French Connection was pretty good.  But that was 20 years ago.  Maybe he has lost his touch. Jade is boring uninteresting slow and laughable.  You want to figure out who the killer is?  You should really have two guesses.  Find out who has the biggest names in the film and consider how much screen time they have. One has two scenes and the other is in it quite a bit but just hangs around in the background.  Of course there is the surprise ending that will just shock you as much as Sixth Sense  yeah right!!!!!!!!  Jade is a really bad film and it is not worth your time.  It is laughable and silly and the only thing that I kinda of enjoyed was when I realized that Caruso and Crenna were once in a film together 13 years before this one.  That was First Blood.  It was probably funny when they first met on the set after all that time.  Back then Crenna had more of a name after all he was Trautman. Caruso was just Mitch.  Now Caruso is trying to make a name for himself with this film again.  I don't think it will work.  Other than that small piece of trivia there is nothing to like abou this film.  It is worth avoiding.".

The photography is good and the sets stylish. David Caruso is much more effective than he gets credit for if a bit charismachallenged and Linda Fiorentino is one of the most interesting actresses working today.Having thus damned with faint praise let me further point out that there is nothing anyone could have done with this material. Orson Welles Brando and Larry Olivier in their primes could only have made a screwedup movie out of this script.It's hard to say which is worse the cliched unnatural dialogue I'm taking you off the case or the incoherent and illogical plot.The author came up with an innovative solution to the ageold problem of the mystery genre. Even the best ones have several minutes of anticlimax when the audience has figured out the solution but the filmmakers haven't revealed it yet. Eszterhas avoided this pitfall creatively by1. Having the explanation to the original murder be completely illogical. If it was done by a guy how did he get the other guy  his wife's lover  to voluntarily get in that SM contraption. So did he offer a false confession for some reason?2. Offering no explanation for some of the other murders. No potential murderer knew where Angie Everhart would be. How could they be there to run her over? Was Caruso in on the whole thing? He knew where she would be? Did Caruso chase himself by driving both cars? Obviously not but what?3. Confusing everyone with unrelated and irrelevant scenes with minor characters. Chazz Palmentieri has a meeting with some anonymous client. Why do we see this? Near the end Fiorentino has a fairly long sex scene with an uncredited extra. Why do we see this?If you really like Fiorentino she is cool and sexy and as competent as ever.I can't think of any other reason to watch this gibberish. Use life's precious minutes for something more rewarding and interesting. Take up alligator wrestling listen to old Al Gore speeches reread Moby Dick. Anything to avoid this movie.".

It is definitely worth noting that Jade is exceptionally well shot. Everything looks rich and elaborate including a car chase sequence that feels like a roller coaster ride. Based on the appropriate lens choice and camera angles cars appear to leap into mid air when driving over San Franscso's many street bumps. The film is also well scored even though it borrows a bit much from Igor Stravinski's Rite of Spring. The only thing I wasn't too comfortable with was the story. It is derivative and cheesy but even at that it could've been worse.

Soon we find out it's Trina not Corelli who's making all the plays which involves the late Kyle Medford's home away from home on the Pacific Coast.

As for the film's star David Caruso it ended his promising after the far more superior Kiss of Death movie career and had him slip back into where he came from doing TV police shows.The movie did have an exciting car chase all over the streets docks and at one point smashing through a Chinese Parade in the Chinatown Section of San Francisco that reminded me of that legendary car cases that Friedkin directed in The French Connection. There was also a number of Xrated scenes between Tria and Mr. Green Robin Thomas who was one of the blackmail victims at the late Kyle Medford's retreat. It was in these scenes recovered from an almost destroyed video tape that showed Tria's real connection to Medford and it wasn't like she said a casual one. In fact Trina was hooking for Medford in getting him people high up in government and business to be blackmailed by him.SPOILERS In the end it was no surprise to anyone watching except Corelli and the SFPD who in fact did old man Medford in since the evidence was there before his body turned room temperature. But it took a full confession by Medford's unsuspecting killer that Corelli illegally audio taped for Corelli to finally crack the puzzling case.".

For example in the first film Chance learnt how to be a faithful and kind dog to Jamie but in this it seem's he's even sillier. Another one of these flaws is that he explains in the first film that he lived on the streets and now Shadow is talking about how he can't live on the streets and he doesn't know how to. WHAT!? Otherwise an incredibly good sequel with romance adventure and charm but just doesn't have the emotion that made the original film so special and captivating.Chance's Sassy's and Shadow's owners are going on a camping trip and taking the dogs with them. However Chance like in the last film becomes incredibly confused with the situation and escapes out of his dog box before all three of them are loaded onto the plane. That means they are lost in San Francisco while the humans go off without them! What can they do?Recommended to people who liked the first film people who were disappointed that there was no romance in the first film and just people who like dogs!Enjoy Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco!".

Not only do our three main characters have to get home but they have to defeat a gang of city dogs outwit two dognappers who are trying to sell strays to the The Lab rescue a child from a burning building and find true love on top of it all!Still not a bad way to spend 89 minutes. Michael J. Fox is again excellent as Chance Sally Fields is full of indignation as Sassy and Ralph Waite does an eerily accurate recreation of the late Don Ameche's characterization of Shadow. Sinbad is wasted as Reilly their new city dog friend. The character seemed to be more of an afterthought than anything.Most pleasant surprise Al Michaels Tommy Lasorda and Bob Uecker as three dogs broadcasting a peewee baseball game. If you are looking for a movie to enjoy with your children without feeling totally insulted Homeward Bound II is a solid bet.

	schema:reviewBody "Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey is a beautiful charming emotional and timeless classic as well as one of the best animal movies. But I can't say the same about its sequel.Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco is not a bad film. For a sequel it's not all that bad. It is still entertaining enough and features the same main cast except Don Ameche who passed away in 1993. But the movie just can't reach the greatness of the first one so the fact that it is disappointing comes to me as no surprise. This movie simply doesn't follow the spirit of the original neither the spirit of others like it.The plot is somewhat similar to the first one's. However instead of the Sierra mountains this one takes our 3 pet friends to the urban life more precisely to the worst streets of San Francisco. Basically it focus more on desert roads empty streets and dirty alleys. We don't see that much of San Francisco neither of its most beautiful things. This is a radical contrast with the first movie's environment which shows us all the beauty of pure nature in the Sierra mountains.In this film our buddies Shadow Chance and Sassy often face city's dangers such as weird people two dog catchers who lock street dogs in their van to take them to one of those creepy laboratories and two rival dogs a vicious boxerlike dog and a goofy bulldoglike dog despite the help of numerous street dogs Riley and his gang.The two rival dogs are particularly annoying especially the boxerlike dog. Most of the street dogs here are annoying either except for Delilah a beautiful Kuvasz and Riley. As for the dog catchers the driver isn't that annoying but his partner is. On the other hand the cute little boy Tucker was adorable and his cute kitten Tiger too.The movie isn't nostalgic emotional or charming like the first one. While it has some funny gags it isn't humor as pleasant as in the first one. The soundtrack isn't as good as in the first one although this one still has some good music.One of the few really good things in this movie is the Golden Gate Bridge the enormous bridge in San Franciso a construction that always fascinated me.".

While it's not as good as the first one I warn you I think this was still a fine family film.The family is going on vacation again but this time they are taking the pets with. But Jamie and Chance's relationship has changed where Jamie isn't playing with Chance as often and Sassy teases Chance that he's going back to the bad place in the dog world that means the pound. So Chance escapes the cage taking him to the plane Shadow and Sassy follow to help Chance. They end up lost in San Francisco and get their butts saved by other street dogs Chance also falls for one of those dogs named Delila. But it's street vs. pet and if humans are really worth risking everything for.Like I said the second Homeward Bound doesn't compare to the original and the plot is extremely similar but I think over all that it worked very well for the kids. The whole family will enjoy the film it has positive energy and fun jokes that anyone could enjoy if they don't have an attitude problem.

But what does compensate hugely is the witty scriptof which Sassy gets the majority of the best lines the lovely soundtrack and the voice acting. Michael J Fox and Sally Field once again do fine work and while the late Don Ameche was a lot more noble and gentle Ralph Waite does an above average job as the voice of Shadow the Golden Retriever.

	schema:headline " Cash in rubbish";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER WARNINGThe original Homeward Bound story is a fascinating story of wide panoramic settings a strong bond between the three animals Shadow Sassy and Chance and a pledge with one another to walk home to San Francisco despite the miles and miles of dangerous wilderness between them. The three main characters are well rounded interesting and you care about them so much that the human characters seem somewhat less relevant though not entirely because they serve as motivation for the characters to when they will return home.This however is not.We're at a point where the family is preparing to go camping in Canada but after a paranoid Chance cocks things up by thinking he's being abandoned the animals stupidly run away from the airport and find themselves down the back streets of San Francisco.The animals seem to meander around the city mindlessly dodging two very thick men working for illegal testing labs and two incredibly irritating strays one of whom dubiously has a voice uncannily similar to Mike Tyson team up with a gang of other misanthrope strays now and again even more insufferable with some of the awful garbagy lines spouted out and in general the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself because as we all know since these animals successfully navigated an entire wilderness for miles and miles last time a city would be pretty small potatoes! We even fill the gap by having a bit where a kid is saved from a burning house! Any minute I would expect RinTinTin to come up with his attorney with a ceaseanddesist note and threats of suing for copyright and to be honest I wouldn't blame him! It is so boneidle that it in fact levers in a cheesy romance plot between Chance and a stray called Delilah! What were the writing team thinking when they cooked this up? My only conclusion They're all raving lunatics! We don't need a stupid romantic subplot levered into these films it's totally superfluous! To make this story aggravatingly boneheaded we even have a love rival by the way of another irritating redneckdrawling stray dog with the brains of a kipper! For some reason they use a GrandBleu De Gascogne for this sadly a very rare dog which would smack of doggie racism unless it perhaps indicates that the writers hate the French and the rednecks. I also wonder why Chance still behaves like a terminallynaive puppy despite his last experiences in the wilderness which would surely have taught him a thing or two! Not forgetting in the first film Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog and was abandoned when still a puppy so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think? The conclusion that wraps up the film's stories is cringe worthy to the point of wanting to put your foot through the telly! I won't reveal it but if you look at the rest of the film a climax of this film will not be worth the case it is carried in! Stick to Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. At least that way you can pretend that this Godawful mess never existed and enjoy the better original. Watching this sequel may result in you hurling yourself in front of a freight train!

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILER WARNINGThe original Homeward Bound story is a fascinating story of wide panoramic settings a strong bond between the three animals Shadow Sassy and Chance and a pledge with one another to walk home to San Francisco despite the miles and miles of dangerous wilderness between them. The three main characters are well rounded interesting and you care about them so much that the human characters seem somewhat less relevant though not entirely because they serve as motivation for the characters to when they will return home.This however is not.We're at a point where the family is preparing to go camping in Canada but after a paranoid Chance cocks things up by thinking he's being abandoned the animals stupidly run away from the airport and find themselves down the back streets of San Francisco.The animals seem to meander around the city mindlessly dodging two very thick men working for illegal testing labs and two incredibly irritating strays one of whom dubiously has a voice uncannily similar to Mike Tyson team up with a gang of other misanthrope strays now and again even more insufferable with some of the awful garbagy lines spouted out and in general the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself because as we all know since these animals successfully navigated an entire wilderness for miles and miles last time a city would be pretty small potatoes! We even fill the gap by having a bit where a kid is saved from a burning house! Any minute I would expect RinTinTin to come up with his attorney with a ceaseanddesist note and threats of suing for copyright and to be honest I wouldn't blame him! It is so boneidle that it in fact levers in a cheesy romance plot between Chance and a stray called Delilah! What were the writing team thinking when they cooked this up? My only conclusion They're all raving lunatics! We don't need a stupid romantic subplot levered into these films it's totally superfluous! To make this story aggravatingly boneheaded we even have a love rival by the way of another irritating redneckdrawling stray dog with the brains of a kipper! For some reason they use a GrandBleu De Gascogne for this sadly a very rare dog which would smack of doggie racism unless it perhaps indicates that the writers hate the French and the rednecks. I also wonder why Chance still behaves like a terminallynaive puppy despite his last experiences in the wilderness which would surely have taught him a thing or two! Not forgetting in the first film Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog and was abandoned when still a puppy so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think? The conclusion that wraps up the film's stories is cringe worthy to the point of wanting to put your foot through the telly! I won't reveal it but if you look at the rest of the film a climax of this film will not be worth the case it is carried in! Stick to Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey.

The dogs are cute the cat is cool and although I personally would have enjoyed the movie more if the animals went insane aboard their owners' flight it's a perfectly passable and inoffensive movie for the kids.

Unfortunately this second effort Lost In San Francisco fails to do likewise on a variety of different counts.First the plot is a complete ripoff of the original. The two dogs Shadow and Chance and one feline Sassy once again are accidentally separated from their familial owners and decide since this IS a film about talking animals! to set out to find them this time on the streets of San Francisco. Essentially all the same basic jokes and sight gags are repeated and the main characters aren't really developed any more than the first try. A few new animals are thrown into the mix but few really stand out as being all that interesting or important to the overall character development.Also the themes in this film are a bit shadier than the much more traditionallyDisney HB1. The concept of racism with some dogs speaking jive and even subtle hints towards sexuality a lone cat feeling uncomfortable among dogs Chance developing a romantic relationship etc. only serve to water down a film franchise which at its best was always dangerously closing to crossing over the weepy cheeseball line. Though those themes will go right over the heads of most youngsters these films are also made to at least keep adults paying attention and somewhat enthused but these darker topics makes the message seem both clichd and preachy.Thus although the kiddies may like this film just as much as the original if you were one of the adults who were surprised to find yourself tearing up at the end of part one don't expect the same sort of emotional material in this effort. It's decent but just fails to capture the innocence and playfulness that was so readily apparent in the predecessor.".

It's about a boy Bodo who's constantly picked on by a group of bullies and to complicate the fact he has a crush on the lead bullies girlfriend Nova. Not thinking he could ever get her he about gives up. He clones himself and the clone is stronger faster and smarter and also talks a lot. The clone is able to defend itself and impress Bodo but does she love Bodo or Bodo 2? Watch this movie it rules.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bodo  Eine ganz normale Familie or The Wiz Kid or Bodo or Das Programm is a West German 1.5hour film from 1989 so this one was released briefly before the reunification. For director Behrens it is perhaps the most known career effort for writers Konstantin and Weber it is the only and the latter is also true for many cast members here especially the children. The film is advertized heavily by the presence of Heiner Lauterbach still among Germany's most known today and while he is a pretty charismatic actor he does not have the biggest range to be honest and that he is still more in the center of it all than everybody else in here says nothing too positive about the film. And the most ridiculous thing is that he has virtually no screen time at all as it is all about the kids especially Bodo and his clone. So yes the clone story means indeed that they needed identical twins for the central characters here which obviously limited the number of potential candidates but honestly they really should have been able to come up with more suitable candidates than the Forbes' especially as apparently they even had to redo his voice. I'm not surprised at all their career was so shortlived from what I saw in here. Admittedly almost all other child actors are just as bad to be honest and sometimes pretty cringeworthy to watch like the bullies early on for example.This film tries to be a lot comingofage story first love modern musical to some extent fantasy movie and you will find other genres too. However it comes truly short in all of these really. Maybe less would have been more here and the lack of talent also by the writers not just the younger actors is something that is really painful to watch. There are only 2 positive things I can say here Kukavica was cute and gave maybe the best performance in here so it is a shame she stopped acting too right away. And the second would be the song I Want a Heart we hear very early and very late during this one. It sounded like hug instead of heart to me which would have been cuter even perhaps. Anyway there is a lot wrong with this film. Nothing makes sense and the fictional fantasy genre inclusion cannot explain most of the flaws at all. You will see them when not if they are there. But best is really to skip this one in its entirety. This is not a film you want your kids to watch and I am baffled that it has received a bit of a cult status by now especially abroad as it was really bad in my opinion. Highly not recommended.".

Only Crane and Pike knew the fence to whom the stolen items were to be fenced for 15M. The balance of the movie consists of the remaining four partners attempting to transport the items to Miami to the fence via car with attempts to take a bus and a train which don't pan out due to various personality conflicts among the thieves and results in one partner killing another who winds up in the trunk of the car.While en route the nowthreesome picks up Natalie Linda Fiorentino who adds another point of conflict among the thieves.  The heist itself is shown in flashbacks during the trip.  There is definately violence in the movie resulting from the conflicts among the thieves and Natalie.  I found the movie to be engrossing throughout with interest in the interaction between the thieves edgy violent keeps you guessing a good ending and good performances by all.    12 out of     ".

The heist itself is shown in flashbacks during the trip.  There is definately violence in the movie resulting from the conflicts among the thieves and Natalie.  I found the movie to be engrossing throughout with interest in the interaction between the thieves edgy violent keeps you guessing a good ending and good performances by all.    12 out of     ";

The 'Godfather IItype' flashbacks are really fantastic. They're an original way to keep you interested the whole time and they're also a perfect choice to add an original style to the story development. For example they make it possible to start the film with the final scenes of the robbery and let you discover the whole story in a retrospective way. This film has many more good things multidimensional and charismatic characters an acceptable music and a very good sound. I can't believe there are people who dislike this film. My rating 78 out of 10.".

As a result the de facto leader Pike Ving Rhames has his hands full just trying to get to Miami in order to sell the stolen paintings so that they can each go their separate ways. However along the way they pick up a woman named Natalie Linda Fiorentino who causes even more trouble. Now while this film is billed as a comedy I found it to be more of a crimedrama than anything else. Even so it was an interesting film which should keep most viewers guessing from start to finish. Likewise even though I couldn't stand the character played by John Leguizamo I must admit that he did an excellent job all the same.

	schema:reviewBody "You'll leave the theater humming the set design would pertain to BODY HEAT yes the 2010 allstar XXX version not the Kathleen TurnerWilliam Hurt classic if it had been a theatrical release back in the day. Instead this expensive video era production delivers sex with one of the corniest plot lines in current memory.I was surprised that a gonzo helmer like Robby D. would get all sentimental on us but that's exactly what happens. Poor little Kayden Kross hey mom my name is trademarked! can't get over the loss of her fellow fireperson lover Manuel Ferrara who looking like John Bromfield in his deepdiving suit in the B classic MANFISH gets blowed up real good while trying to defuse a bomb early in the film but fortunately after he wields his mighty dick on Kayden.Weirdest casting I've seen in a while is Kastuni as the hardboiled police captain Katharine these porn movies generally use actors' stage names for their character names unless the thespian has a goofy name like Stormy or Katsumi or Katsuni. Film opens with a shot of her forlorn at Engine 23 fire station's window and then battling the rest of the running time to save it and her team's jobs in the face of mean developer Ben English buying up all the property around. With plot twists dating back to a Shirley Temple movie starring Arthur Treacher even Evil Ben his character is renamed Cash for obvious reasons turns out to be Gentle Ben a good guy.That's the entire plot with time out for a dumb cameo by Evan Stone and seven hardcore sex scenes mixing and matching a truly allstar cast. My personal favorite was Bridgette B. looking absolutely terrific to us oldtimers with her huge breasts bulging but covered a bit in trashy outfits befitting her role as English's lawyer but fully bare bouncing up  down in a threeway scene with English and cute Riley Steele. Real fire trucks and a helicopter were employed for some action footage and the overall verisimilitude of these famous porn icons playing working stiffs pun intended rises to the level of at least a PORKY'S sequel.I watched as an unplanned experiment the film in its 87minute version as censored by the Australian Censor Board after watching an uncensored hardcore version of an actual Australian movie THE ABC of LOVE AND SEX which had originally suffered a similar slice  dice fate. Adding back all the XXX footage provided on a separate DVD to the soft X Down Under version results in an approximate 150minute running time.".

On a personal note my older brother who was heavily into bands like Kraftwerk during their late '70s reign owned a copy and I often stared mesmerized at the tastefully naughty stills reproduced on its back cover fantasizing about what this movie could possibly be like. So successful was the record that Schulze actually released a followup entitled BODY LOVE 2 though entirely unrelated to Braun's landmark dirty movie now lovingly restored to pristine perfection in Blue One's French DVD version PAL but including an English language track as part of their awesome 3 disc Lasse Braun collection along with his masterpiece SENSATIONS the cobbled together yet essential FRENCH BLUE and no less than 30 of his legendary loops ! An Italian born in French Algeria Alberto Ferro traveled to Scandinavia in the late '60s to benefit from relaxing censorship laws by producing pornography under the Nordic pseudonym of Lasse Braun working from France Germany Holland Italy and even the ridiculously restricted England throughout the next decade until widespread notoriety and carnal collector adulation landed him on American shores. How's that for an international career ?! Strangely the star that had shone so radiantly over Europe seemed to fade stateside after a strong start with American DESIRE and a mid'80s six picture deal with long gone Vidco that yielded a few choice nuggets with in descending order of excellence YOUNG NYMPHO SECRET MISTRESS and FLASHER. Finally unspooling before the tired eyes of this old porn hound BODY LOVE represents the Old Master at the top of his game however. Shot simultaneously with the far more melodramatic LOVE INFERNO at dilapidated Groeneveld Castle a facility rented out by Town Council at nominal fee to artists in search of rest and inspiration in the oh so prim 'n' proper Dutch village of Baarn where they obviously had no idea what was going on Braun employs his bare bones narrative as yet another forum for spouting his often questionable philosophies on free love and the benefits of pornography in longwinded diatribes.

With each scene a perfectly realized tableau in its own right the group climax can't help but feel well just a tad anticlimactic ! Kicking off with a bit of hokey transcendental meditation a sign of the times which will surely amuse other oldtimers such as myself it does offer glimpses of obscure starlets like dirty blond Micky Love the devious daughter in law from Grard Kikone's haunting ENTRECHATTES and matronly Cristel Lauris who played Ringer's pimping mom in Claude BernardAubert's unsettling SOUMISSION along with notoriously bisexual Carmelo Petix as the butler and the ultimate elderly rou Tony Morena from Mulot's enjoyable PETITES ECOLIERES. Group gropes are notoriously hard to get right definitively putting to rest the old adage that bigger equals better and Braun did them better than most never more so than with SENSATIONS' unforgettable final scene which made perfect sense within the confines of that film's narrative but it's nearly impossible to sustain heat with a crowd vying for attention.Its action restricted to a single location rather than the whirlwind tour of sprawling Amsterdam circa 1975 offered by SENSATIONS this narrowed scope inevitably restricts BODY LOVE from achieving similar dizzying heights. On its own comparatively minimalist terms however it works a charm. Ravishing Ringer still fresh to the industry in wake of her debut in the previous year's naughty LA FESSEE by BernardAubert incidentally also making his explicit maiden voyage proves a pleasingly deft comedienne making a meal out of the clichd character of the virgin awaiting initiation. Her scene with Gateau another underrated thespian with a legit theatrical background is particularly good. Tongue in cheek dialog delivery mixes with subtle ironic glances for maximum effect making the scene work both as the threadbare setup it represents on the surface and a simultaneous humorous reflection upon it. As with most of Braun's efforts it's beautifully photographed credited to one Peter Focus but presumably not without considerable input from the director himself.".

When the operation is a success and then its takes weeks for Bill's new arm to be working. In fact he finds his new arm to be much better than his old one. But then it's starts doing things that he doesn't want to do and being having vivid nightmares. He finds out that his arm belongs to Charley Fletcher John Walsh. A violent serial killer who got executed on the operation table. When Bill got his new arm from. But Bill finds out that he's not the only one who got spear parts from the infamous murderer. Then after meeting two people Brad Dourif and Peter Murnik who got spear body parts from Charley. But when Bill wants his arm off the Dr. Webb refused to do it. Bill has a feeling or two that Dr. Webb is not what she seems to be and he feels there's something out there is coming for him.Directed by Eric Red Bad Moon Cohen and Tate Undertow made an intriguing horror film with some effective moments of suspense and thrills. This was an box office disappointment when it was released in the summer of 1991. The critics were not kind to this movie as well. Sure the premise isn't original anymore. But director Red tries to make something different here by adding some neat ideals to the already often filmed premise of the picture. The underrated Fahey gives an strong performance. Dourif gives an memorable small role as the artist who finds sudden success with his paintings. Red does his best work so far as a filmmaker here. Red wasn't made a movie or wrote a script in years but it seems he trying to make a comeback with his latest work 100 Feet. That film will be released sometime in 2008. Like most of Red's works Body Parts has become a cult classic. It's certainly one of the most underrated horror movies of the 1990's. Effective music score by Loek Dikker. Insipred from the novel Choice Cuts by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac Which they wrote the classic book together Diabolique. Coscripted by the director and Norman Snider Dead Ringers Rated X. Screenstory by Patricia Herskovic Producer of cult classics like Deadly Blessing Mother's Boys and Toy Soldiers and Joyce Taylor. Don't miss it. Panavision. .".

A violent serial killer who got executed on the operation table. When Bill got his new arm from. But Bill finds out that he's not the only one who got spear parts from the infamous murderer. Then after meeting two people Brad Dourif and Peter Murnik who got spear body parts from Charley. But when Bill wants his arm off the Dr. Webb refused to do it. Bill has a feeling or two that Dr. Webb is not what she seems to be and he feels there's something out there is coming for him.Directed by Eric Red Bad Moon Cohen and Tate Undertow made an intriguing horror film with some effective moments of suspense and thrills. This was an box office disappointment when it was released in the summer of 1991. The critics were not kind to this movie as well. Sure the premise isn't original anymore. But director Red tries to make something different here by adding some neat ideals to the already often filmed premise of the picture. The underrated Fahey gives an strong performance. Dourif gives an memorable small role as the artist who finds sudden success with his paintings. Red does his best work so far as a filmmaker here. Red wasn't made a movie or wrote a script in years but it seems he trying to make a comeback with his latest work 100 Feet. That film will be released sometime in 2008. Like most of Red's works Body Parts has become a cult classic. It's certainly one of the most underrated horror movies of the 1990's. Effective music score by Loek Dikker. Insipred from the novel Choice Cuts by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac Which they wrote the classic book together Diabolique. Coscripted by the director and Norman Snider Dead Ringers Rated X. Screenstory by Patricia Herskovic Producer of cult classics like Deadly Blessing Mother's Boys and Toy Soldiers and Joyce Taylor. Don't miss it. Panavision. .";

I have never seen a movie with this actor that I have truly been impressed with due to his wooden acting and bland expression. Sadly this movie was no different but it was saved by some very neat performances.The story is simply a rehash of a tried and tested idea  some guy in this case a criminal psychologist loses a limb and a replacement is sewn on  subsequently it comes to light that the limb is of a dead psychopath. The question is who does the arm now really belong to? There are some nice treats given to those who pay attention to the script I have the blood of a murderer running through my body is a chilling line even by the dismal Fahey!. There are some good performances too most notably from the two female leads. Kim Delaney plays the wife very well and her panic at the apparently unexplainable situation feels very real. Lindsay Duncan turns in a fine performance as the doctor who's surgical efforts bring more than GBH to the picture! Loek Dikker ! has composed an interestingly dissonant score that unfortunately goes a little too over the top in places but is good nonetheless. The gore is plentiful and well done. I cannot often stomach realistic surgical drama and I did have to turn away on numerous gruesome occasions!This film will not disappoint a punter who feels like 90 minutes of braineasy escapism.

This is the best horror film I have seen to date August 20 2000 and I have seen many.

So yes this basic tale has been told before but director Eric Red I've never heard of him either makes it all work pretty good. Until that is the aforementioned climax rears its ugly head.

It was and there were other scenes that induced a chuckle in this cheesy entry. Jeff Fahey who looks like a poor man's Ray Liotta with better skin and not as much acting ability plays a nurturing criminal psychologist who spends his days dealing with crazy criminals who say fck a lot. After studying a dangerously wobbling wheel on the car in front of him during his commute to work in the morning he is actually surprised when it snaps off and he gets creamed by an 18 wheeler. Maybe I was in a weird mood but the sight of him flying through the windshield was unintentionally hilarious. After he gets the killer's arm sewn onto his stump he begins to act strangely. He starts to cut himself and curse while shaving with the killer's hand. He cracks his kid in the side of the head while wrestling in the family room. He tries to choke out his wife while she's asleep. I found all of this to be really really funny for some reason. I just couldn't take Fahey's performance seriously. What can I say? It just made me think of the Simpson's episode where Homer gets the hair transplant from Snake the convict. The gore effects where decent and the sound effects unusually enough  were very well done especially the flesh ripping sounds that come into play later in the movie. I dare you to keep a straight face when the killer comes back in a neck brace and tries to get his arm back. He is silent except for his mugging face and gurgling sounds as he takes back what's his.    Yeah this movie is bad but if that is a good thing to you like it is to me it's worth seeing. Plus if you are an unfortunate Blockbuster slave who can't get movies anywhere else I believe that this is one of the few horror movies they carry that was made before Scream and doesn't revolve around Freddy Prinze Jr. or star any Arquette family members.

It really helps you to get into the movie if the actor is into it. And he definitely was. There are some people that don't have the acting skills to tell the story as it should be. Jeff didn't have that problem and I thought he did well. The story was pretty intense at some moments. It wasn't really far fetched. It kinda makes you wonder how it would be if we could transplant whole body parts. I think that how religious you are would affect how you view it very much. I liked the story because it was based on a good and unexplored idea as of today because we don't have the technology to try it. But it's fun to wonder how the world would react and change if we could do it. You should see it if you haven't already at least to know your own thoughts on it. Instead of simply taking mine you should go find your own. Happy viewing!!!".

It really helps you to get into the movie if the actor is into it. And he definitely was. There are some people that don't have the acting skills to tell the story as it should be. Jeff didn't have that problem and I thought he did well. The story was pretty intense at some moments. It wasn't really far fetched. It kinda makes you wonder how it would be if we could transplant whole body parts. I think that how religious you are would affect how you view it very much. I liked the story because it was based on a good and unexplored idea as of today because we don't have the technology to try it. But it's fun to wonder how the world would react and change if we could do it. You should see it if you haven't already at least to know your own thoughts on it. Instead of simply taking mine you should go find your own. Happy viewing!!!";

While he is being sedated he appears to see a decapitation. There are a number of injuries dismemberments and shootings in the movie and they're all pretty gory though the movie is not walltowall gore.Somehow he doesn't notice nor does his wife that he has a tattoo on his new arm until a patient points it out to him. This makes him want to learn where the arm came from along with the fact that he is having nightmares and some violent impulses.In the novel this was very loosely based on the main character is not a person who's gotten a graft. He's a person who's been appointed to keep an eye on people who've gotten grafts to see that they are doing well or not. There are seven people in all who have received them there aren't as many in the film. They all know almost from the start who their parts came from originally. The new parts look better than their old ones while in the film the arm looks like it was taken from an old corpse even though it wasn't. They don't have violent impulses but are exposed to new temptations. For example the man who gets a new stomach among other things eats voraciously since he coincidentally had indigestion before his car accident. The first signs of danger are weird obsessive ideas that some of them get and also when one of them kills himself.The movie is so different than the novel that it has to be enjoyed on its own terms and it can be. The novel The Hands of Orlac is similar in some respects and the movie Mad Love similarly murders the novel though it can be enjoyed on its own terms too.I've read the novel this was based on so I'll mention".

	schema:reviewBody "Effectively uses it's gruesome premise... Jeff Fahey is a great actor calling him awful is just plain ignorant. Awful actors don't get to be in 118 different features. He is not one of my absolute favourites but I have always appreciated his laid back yet edgy style of acting. Brad Dourif! Dourif by name somewhat dourlooking by nature! Brad is one of my all time favourite horror actors. It is always great to see him even in small parts in movies like this. I found it really cool to see him and Jeff Fahey acting together as they are two actors I really like and they usually play intense occasionally mad dudes. Brad plays it with his usual manic flair and Jeff mostly plays it straight but I love it cause' I know that Jeff could outdo Brad in terms of insanity if he wanted to. People moan that the film copies golden oldies like The Hand and The Hands Of Orloc...So? Know a lot of films about evil body parts do you? Because I could count them on one hand! There's not enough bodypart themed horror movies out there... I love the music theme that plays at the beginning a few times in between and right at the end. It starts out kind of silly and then becomes booming and ominous. To me the music represents the film's grotesque sense of fun and it's shock value. The film has a very good slow build up of tension. In my opinion it is not until approximately 44 minutes and 38 seconds in that something actually happens. This film is certainly gory but not very. It doesn't have too many bloody moments but the one that I find really gross is at the beginning when Bill has had his operation. The way that his arm looks all freshly stitched raw and pink...ew!!! I thought it was an okay average horror movie for quite a while but my interest had a boost when it came to the scene where Bill discovers that someone has been grafted new legs.I know that that one is still an impossibility The film's main antagonist is the dastardly Doctor Agatha Webb. It is made very clear early on that Dr.Webb has her own dark agenda. It is indeed confirmed later on that Webb is indeed a real psycho bitch who will not give up no matter what and cares not a damn that people have to die for her experiment to reach it's insane conclusion. The two kids in the movie are not very interesting or effective as they were both such bad little actor's! I remember the boy from Are You Afraid Of The Dark? There is a sequence in a bar that's pretty cool. The three transplantees are philosophizing. Brad and Jeff are sitting there with the other guy in the middle which struck me as funny as everyone knows who the other two are and no one knows who he is. Sorry other guy you were good too! I actually thought he was kinda cute despite those ears! There is also an awesome fighty bit where Bill responding to the pestering and insult of a drunkOuch! That one would get anyone ticked off!proceeds to take on all newcomers with his superstrong evil arm!!! When it comes to the big finale at the end I don't agree that it's crap but it does seem to run out of steam a bit. They could have done it better. It turns out that the evil mantis doctor of death Dr Webb's master plan has been in layman's terms to amputate the arms legs and head?of a serial killer?! transplant them to lucky recipients while still keeping the original torso alive to later restore whether the current owners like it or not the parts back to the original body. Furthermore she has an enforcer for this in the killer who she has kept alive as a head on an unidentified body. All this is for the purpose of proving some great medical advancement in body part manipulation procedures or somesuch. The seen is very impressive because you see all the reclaimed parts strung up in a chamber around the still breathing disembodied torso awaiting reattachment. I saw what I thought was a very similar and for me far more effective scene in another surgery based horror movie that came out 15 years after this one and that movie was Autopsy. I bet a lot of people hated or were very unsatisfied with the ending and I could see why but I personally loved the ending. I thought it was a different and perfect way to end the picture. It ends like this the nightmare is over and Bill and his wife are relaxing in a peaceful outdoor scene. He is writing in his journalSomething that is kind of interwoven that I thought added a lotreflecting on his experience and how the arm is now finally truly his. Anyway they're just sitting there and...nothing happens. No big last minute frightA very nice changeand the credits begin rolling while lingering on the two to the film's theme tune. And it's bizarre and funny and creepy as hell and to me it really brings it home that the film was never meant to be taken too seriously. A cool weird little movie one that makes you wish you never lose a limb and become ensnared in the evil machinations of a mad doctor! Right on the limb!".

Murnau's 1924 expressionist classic The Hands of Orlac in which a pianist who loses his hands in an accident is given transplants from the body of a recently executed murderer with disastrous results.In Body Parts Eric Red's 1991 take on this macabre tale several people receive replacement limbs from convicted killer Charley Fletcher but it is prison psychologist Bill Chrushank Jeff Fahey who first begins to suspect that there is something not quite right when his new right arm exhibits uncharacteristic behaviour hitting his son and throttling his wife Kim Delaney while she sleeps.Bill is understandably shocked when he eventually discovers the identity of his arm's original owner and demands that his surgeon Dr. Agatha Webb Lindsay Duncan remove the troublesome appendage but she refuses unwilling to undo her groundbreaking work. Meanwhile Fletcher whose head has been attached to a new body by the clearly deranged Webb is running around savagely tearing his transplanted extremities from their new owners.The concept might be extremely well worn providing the basis for more than a handful of horrors over the years but Eric Red manages to bring new life to the 'evil transplanted limb' idea by acknowledging its sheer silliness and simply running with it. It takes a while to get into the swing of things but once Fletcher starts to reclaim his lost body parts the fun really begins with Red serving up some great gore and outlandish plot developments.The film's most preposterous moment comes as Bill is sitting in a police car Fletcher drives alongside slaps handcuffs on Bill's wrist and tries to pull his arm off by quickly accelerating away. Fortunately Detective Sawchuck Zakes Mokae is in the driving seat and miraculously keeps up with Fletcher's vehicle as it careens headlong through oncoming traffic while Bill desperately tries to remove the cuffs. It's an extremely dumb sequence but well executed and hugely entertaining.In a glorious Grand Guignolstyle finale Bill confronts the mad doctor and Fletcher in a laboratory where the convict's reclaimed severed limbs and bloody torso are now suspended in a tank of liquid. In a marvellously splattery and absurdly grotesque finish a desperate battle breaks out during which Bill wrests a shotgun from Fletcher and proceeds to blow the crap out of anything that twitches finally destroying the killer's connection with his arm in the process.7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDb.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film some 10 years ago in a movie theatre in Zimbabwe.

Yet scifi lovers seem to have missed out on this neat theory of body parts having a mind NOT mind you a brain of their ownall belonging to the original individual. It appears to be nothing more than nonsense to us in accepted conventional science but I found it more appealing than some of the works of Lucas and Spielberg.I think the film needs reassessment as a scifi filmnot merely as a horror film. I am convinced this film is more appealing in subject matter than Fantastic Voyage or The Flatliners purely as a science fiction movie. Take it or leave itthe subject challenges today's scientific thought however stupid it appears to us today. And as cinema I have seen worse stuff from wellknown Hollywood directors. I would like to read the book Choice cuts before figuring out if the film was better than the work of the author.

	schema:reviewBody "This is more or less a 90's film version of the famous and often retold tale The Hands of Orloc. Normally that would worry me as I'm generally speaking not a big fan of the 90's when it comes to horror and I don't really like seeing classic horror stories ruined by this decade but for some reason I had a fairly good feeling about this one. Perhaps because cowriterdirector Eric Red proved already that he knows a thing or two about creating suspense and atmosphere with his previous achievements The Hitcher and Near Dark. Or maybe because the only truly great version of the tale was Mad Love starring Peter Lorre and that movie is already over 70 years of age. Body Parts is a reasonably good thriller with a handful of memorable suspenseladen moments and gooey Grand Guignol effects particularly near the end. The film starts at out somewhat as a serious toned medical drama but gradually escalates into an outrageous mad scientist horror flick. When family man and criminology shrink Bill Crushank gets involved in a dramatic car accident his wife Karen has very little time to decide whether or not Dr. Agatha Webb is allowed to try her groundbreaking method of transplanting a donor arm on Bill. The operation is a success and Bill can slowly pick up his career and family life again until suddenly the donor arm begins to develop a sinister behavior on its own. Bill discovers he got the arm from an executed serial killer and fears that he inherited his murderous tendencies with it. Nobody believes Bill not even the other patients who received donor parts from the same serial killer at least not under some murders occur. The first half hour is talkative the middle section is mainly tense and mysterious with as a highlight a unique and adrenalinrushing car chase and the climax is grotesque and gory with a few very delirious twists. Eric Red's direction is surefooted enough and although Jeff Fahey definitely isn't bad in the lead role the show is obviously stolen by an overacting Brad Dourif. 90's Bmovie queen Kim Delaney is underused as Fahey's devoted wife. Masterful score by Loek Dikker.".

One of the better parts to this is the amount of care given to the storyline showing his dealing with the new arm from the exercise and family life to the different lifestyle choices slowly creeping into his personality. That last bit is where this really makes the most of itself by not only featuring creepy hallucinations of the killers' memories and the growing paranoia about that history which gives this one some of its best moments as the genuinely freaky visuals are based on some really frightening images of his previous kills. There's a fine sense of creepiness added to the growing mystery of the strange behavior he and his fellow recipients are experiencing along with the film's other big plus in the frenetic action put around that behavior to readily enhance the paranoia. Once the identity and historical significance of the donor is revealed the incidental behaviors rapidly shift to far more dangerous actions around them quickly escalate into rather exciting action scenes from the brawl in the artist' loft that leads into a rather exciting car crash that mixes a clever notion of handcuffing the two together while having to dodge traffic inside the linked cars. Finally the shootout confrontation in the finale makes for a rather grand lasting impression with a lot of bloody violence and frenetic actions which is enough to overcome the few flaws in here. The biggest issues here is the absolutely banal quality of having to spout off the dubious ethics and morality in justifying the reason for the choice of donor for the surgery and how to con the others into going along with the rationale which isn't all that wellthoughtout. That also extends to the other patients who unnecessarily warm up to the benefits of the procedure without really taking into account the side effects and disturbing behavior he brings up even after several visits this never changes their minds and they have no reaction to it. This all tends to make the first half here go on far too long before anything of any real horror shows through. That makes for a difficult time of this getting going and what really holds this back the most.Rated R Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.".

What's worse about the ending is that it fails to resolve any of the film's events. Which almost makes the entire movie a waste of a film.The directing is great way better than this film deserves. The acting was good. I liked Jerry O'Connell's performance. Tara Reid was surprisingly convincing in displaying her emotions. Amanda Peet could have done better. Ron Livingston was great and is shown in a somewhat different light.The film has a lot of wasted potential. I'm surprised that the last half of the script wasn't completely rewritten. It is as if the writer only planned out the first half before starting to write it. If it's a dollar rental it may be worth it. Just to be safe I'd only recommend it if it ends up on a subscription movie channel.".

Ron Livingston was great and is shown in a somewhat different light.The film has a lot of wasted potential. I'm surprised that the last half of the script wasn't completely rewritten. It is as if the writer only planned out the first half before starting to write it. If it's a dollar rental it may be worth it. Just to be safe I'd only recommend it if it ends up on a subscription movie channel.";

In Body Shots' you get an incredibly knittogether group of Americas finest all young actors that has yet to become too big for their own good. That is to say they can still take on riskier projects that perhaps a bigger actor would be forced to turn down by their management because it would not go with the audience'.My personal thanks here to Sean Patrick Flanery and Amanda Peet whom on earlier occasions showed me that they dared or did not get any other offers who knows  commit to smaller and often much more rewarding ventures.Tara Reid hasn't really impressed up till now with movies like American Pie and Urban Legends but here she really gets a chance to act out. Usually dramatic scenes are edited into smithereens but all over Body Shots' you get long really intense sequences with all of the castmembers showing their thespian caliber. I was also pleasantly surprised to be taken in by Chris O'Donnell's portrayal of the horny partyjock since the last time I saw him was in the abysmal movie Dungeons  Dragons' which kinda' put him on my blacklist.Ron Livingstone is just plain weird and therefore marvelous. That AlkaSeltzerbit is going to haunt me for a while The editing is first class. In basically all movies when you see a clubscene you're not convinced at all. YOU know what it feels like to be in a steamy crowded club surrounded by and being people in various stages of intoxication. It's seldom portrayed with as much realism as it was here much thanks to the clever editing. The layout of the story as a whole is also refreshing  not saying that messing up the timeline hasn't been done before  but the cutscenes between the girls gang and the boys gang the constant metaperspective of the actors relaying their personal views of the meat market and the flashbacks helps to make this movie what it is.But what struck me most of all was the sex. I can't think about when I last saw a movie with such convincing sexscenes. It was all the small things YOU do but they never seem to be able to put into a movie. The sucking of fingers the difference of intensity in kissing the touching the grabbing of genitalia. Now I'm not saying that showing more always is the best way to portray sex. But when it's called for by the script and the context then hell yes! And if you're going to attempt to make an honest movie about eight hormonally hyped twentysomething's then most definitively so.All in all I was very impressed. The story has been done before but not with such pathos. Movies like these make me hopeful of the future. Perhaps we're going away from only producing predictable storylines uninspiring actors that deliver lines like they have a nail through their kneecap and dialog that you'd never hear outside of the screenwriters head.".

The evening continues at a singles club where the guys and gals pair off as they dance get drunk on JellO shots and brawl. The limited plot revolves around the possible date rape of Sara Tara Reid by Michael Jerry O'Connell a professional athlete. These scenes of the violent sex between this couple are shown Rashomonlike from the pointsofview of each participant. Rodrigo Garcia has photographed these events shading with darker hues during the first part of the film and gradually turning to brighter scenes as the following morning begins.

No Body Shots 1999 is NOT about the uselessness of the he saidshe said accusations over drunken date rapes. Sure that's a point worth making but it really belongs in another movie all its own. This story if the editor would just leave it alone is about the inability of humans to live amongst each other with any intimacy.The characters have more sex than they appear to know what to do with because their sex lives are still at odds with who they are or aspire to being. All natural warmth is absent. People vaguely comment about their constant loneliness but it doesn't bother any one of them nearly enough.Amanda Peet as Jane is much too stereotypically thin and toothy and it's getting irritating to have that always work. Enough! Why can't she be cast as the girl who gets bedded and not called back?Women who look like her in real life are being used like tissues by men with I.Q.s lower than the tissue. Guys just like Rick Sean Patrick Flanery pathetic professionals who suck at even their own jobs and who are skating on bull but somehow in the corrupt business world they're still paid enormous paychecks that they will never ever deserve.So out here not only is marriage on the way out but so are malefemale love relationships. That's what Body Shots is REALLY about. I don't know how gay relationships are going I can only wish them more luck. Straight men are becoming totally lost subhuman autistic. Arguably abnormal. Alright too many women are as well. Maybe it's something in our food. Some lateonset autism cases were traced in real life to essentially food allergies an inability to metabolize staple foods. Autism affects males 5 times as often as it does females so maybe there's something to all this...The eversoslightlyhopeful approach towards the only really normal nice guy of Body Shots Shawn Denigan Brad Rowe is a ineffectual because he's stopped fighting against the offensivecriminal hosingguy jerk Mike Jerry O'Connell and b even his possible girlfriend Sarah Tara Reid is too stupid to take him for what he is a normal human being complaining that his niceness is just too much for her! Hello! ... She even says an astoundingly stupid thing to camera And you just kinda fall into bed with them. It's safer. It's just sex you know? No you idiot Just sex is diametrically opposed to safe.This is NOT sophistication. It's nave. Getting involved is what we're supposed to be doing! We're supposed to accept people with faults because the real world is not a virtual playenvironment that's not reality's job. If we overcontrol our relationships how will we ever learn to be fair as opposed to a little tool fit for noone like Sarah?With characters this far out of whack and it really doesn't matter what they look like does it? They're all beautiful unhappy lonely idiots I'm pretty sure that's the point it's surprising and laughable that the healthiest relationship happens between the universally amongst this ship of tools disliked Trent Ron Livingston and the sexgoddess Whitney Emily Procter. When she gets kinky on him he reacts with selfdeprecating humour! I really like every bit of thesping Ron Livingston does in Body Shots. It's obvious that he's the best actor among them. The rest are playing characters that are not such a stretch. Livingston's performance is very natural and easy. I especially liked the way he talks about his chew toy. For those who don't know Ron's the elder Livingston his younger brother John did some nice work the same year in The Sterling Chase 1999. Both Livingston brothers are pretty charismatic.But the best scene surely has to be the grittiest and kudos to David McKenna for his gutsy original story as well as Michael Cristofer for his direction. The staccato beat of drumsticks as Shawn allows pure horniness take him and his companion Emily Sybil Temchen over on the bonnet of that car is very very effective it's exactly how I would have done it the soundtrack with the sticks people!. Moreover I really like that the scene happens to the supposedly shyest most normal guy Shawn. It gives him balance and shows us Sarah's ridiculous underestimation of him.But why does he claim he doesn't drink when he does? Is he a recovering alcoholic? If so why is there no mention of that? ...Plus I have to take issue with the sudden appearance of the cndm.There was no time... I need to see the Director's Cut.I am sorry that Emily Sybil Temchen feels ripped off denuded used drunk lost afterwards. She hadn't chosen any of it. Yet again I realize she talks about sometimes not wanting to choose so you don't have to berate yourself for how things turn out but she still ends up berating herself DOESN'T SHE?. So Emily and her selfesteem are back at square one. Watch her rueful facial reaction when Shawn rushes over to Sarah's side. Despite the shared night of shame between him and Emily he can ignore it all because he has someone else to care for to go to to cleanse his guilt. She DOESN'T. So Sybil Temchen is the other great thespian.Once the date rape happens it affects all the close friends. Specifically it suppresses the notwelljustified fledgling relationship between Jane and Rick who are now in opposite camps. Irresponsibility leads to regret. And impotence. Note their ennuichasm in bed.So this is a good cautionary tale. Unfortunately things are already just as bad or worse in the real world and everyone is asleep at the wheel. Sleepers wake! Resist this much selfindulgence!".

I need to see the Director's Cut.I am sorry that Emily Sybil Temchen feels ripped off denuded used drunk lost afterwards. She hadn't chosen any of it. Yet again I realize she talks about sometimes not wanting to choose so you don't have to berate yourself for how things turn out but she still ends up berating herself DOESN'T SHE?. So Emily and her selfesteem are back at square one. Watch her rueful facial reaction when Shawn rushes over to Sarah's side. Despite the shared night of shame between him and Emily he can ignore it all because he has someone else to care for to go to to cleanse his guilt. She DOESN'T. So Sybil Temchen is the other great thespian.Once the date rape happens it affects all the close friends. Specifically it suppresses the notwelljustified fledgling relationship between Jane and Rick who are now in opposite camps. Irresponsibility leads to regret. And impotence. Note their ennuichasm in bed.So this is a good cautionary tale. Unfortunately things are already just as bad or worse in the real world and everyone is asleep at the wheel. Sleepers wake! Resist this much selfindulgence!";

	schema:reviewBody "Warning may contain some spoilers I think there are films out there that the majority of the public may not like and that is not always because they are bad films it could be because they go against everything that they claim to believe in.  I think Body Shots is one of those films.  This is a film that takes a very frank stand about sex and dating rituals not just in the 90's but  in my opinion  of all time.  Sex is almost a necessity in many people's lives.  You may not die without it but some people do change when they are getting it or not getting it.  Body Shots does a very good job of showing the compulsions of sexually active people some of the strange fetishes that other people have how sex with love will always be better than sex without it and it also shows that sex is not a bad thing the way it is portrayed in society even if it is between two people that are just using each other to get off.  This is a very honest film in the way that it speaks and the way it listens.  Not everyone is like these characters but I'm willing to bet that there are a lot more that are like them than what people realize or want to admit they realize.  I am not talking about the  he said she said rape take in the film but the talk and exploration into sexual practises is interesting funny shocking and fun to watch all at once.There are a few true strengths to the film.  First it has to be said the cast is great.  There are so many young bright faces in here and they shine with this controversial subject matter.  I could go on and name all eight of the characters and the people that play them and give each of them equal praise but that would almost be redundant and may bore you so what I will do is tell you some of my favourite performances in the film.  First is Amanda Peel and Sean Michael Flannery.  They play Jane and Rick respectively.  Both are very attractive people  physically and intellectually  and they seem to be the ones that carry the film.  They seem to be the ones that are most serious about starting a relationship. And they like each other so that sets up the love interest.  But then the alleged rape takes place between two of their friends and suddenly what looks to be a sure love connection is jeopardized.  But instead of doing what all films do when they make the two meet like each other break up and then get back together the film is more intelligent than that.  First of all they never really consumated their relationship so they can't really break up but what they do is realize that what they could have may be special and that no matter the circumstances it may be worth a chance to get together.  They play these roles with care and compassion for their characters and I really liked them in this film.Tara Reid is a great new actress on the scene as she was one of the bright spots in the abyssmally awful Urban Legend and she was terrific in American Pie.  Here she is not a very likable person but she plays it so well.  I also want to mention Ron Livingstone from Office Space.  He cracks me up. And Emily Procter as Whitney.  Not only is she beautiful but she can act and she does an admirable job in here with a difficult role.  But she handles it with class dignity and humour.  If you watch this film it is her character that is the most secretive of all of them but she is also one of best parts of the film.  I see her going on to be big in Hollywood.What is also good about the film is the dialogue.  It has a good ear and knows how some people talk.  I was laughing in all the right places and somber and intrigued when I was supposed to be.  Jerry O'Connell has a very powerful and eye opening speech when he is confronted with what he is up against.Body Shots is not afraid to talk openly and crudely about sex and all that encompasses it.  Everything from blowjobs to cunnilingus to raunchy sex to making love it is all in here.  I admire the film for being something different.  This is not a typical entry into the raunchy sex genre.  It is raunchy but it is well done and that is what separates it from the rest of the pack.  It will not be around long at the theater so if you get a chance you should take a chance and see this film.  I enjoyed what it had to say and how they said it.  You may not agree with what it has to say but you may also be entertained and feel a smile creep along your face as you disagree with it.  Not many films can make you do that.".

	schema:headline "  out of 5";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not a huge deal to figure out who you want to fk but who you want to love how do you figure that out?' I believe that you have to be in a certain state of mind to view a film like this. It isn't something that you just pop in and kick back for. One has to be willing to accept as fact what they are seeing and base it not on themselves but what they have come to terms with as being routine and normal. This film is much like the birth cycle. We open with two characters which then divides into three and finally multiplies into eight. Once all of the characters are set and ready to escape their personal pod of existence a story pushes its way through that is sometimes disgusting to watch but uncharacteristically real. We learnt that maybe Darwin was a bit off when making his theory of evolution. We see that mankind definitely formed from apes but how much we have evolved is put into serious questioning.  Eight human beings four males and four females off all different size shape and occupation emerge from everyday life for a wild night of clubbing with sex on their minds and drinks on their tabs.  The film opens with a scene of Rick and Jane lying in a bed clothed. The opening line may simply be the best line to come from a scene like this. Upon awakening Rick asks do you have any Tylenol baby?' Then enters Sara in a drunken state of selfloathing bloodied at the face telling of how she was date raped by Mike. But in the interrogation room Mike's alibi implies that it was consensual sex and Sara was freely open to receive. The first half of the film takes place in the everyday lives of our eight individual minds. It shows us the before effect labelled here as foreplay' the preparation and the journey to the club. The second takes place after the alleged rape. After following the looking into the actual criminal intent of the rape the climax is unlike you would expect from a film of this nature. IT is inconclusive insignificant even but this is not a problem for three reasons. First two people are so drunk that neither of them can remember the full truth of the matter so why should we? Not only should we not know who did it for the simple fact of it would become nothing more than a battle of the sexes film but would shouldn't even care if it happened or not. Second the whole idea of the rape is not what this film is about. It is merely a device used by Hollywood writers to show that the film is moving in a forward fashion and does have some bit of story to provide. The final reason is because this film is about a deep yearning inside that some people posses to find a common medium between unconditional sex and unconditional love. . IT is also about alcohol and how it desensitizes us and robs us of our natural ability to decipher between wrong and right. Lastly it is about consumerism. I'm sure people reading this who have already seen the film will think that I am crazy but it really is. The film is not about consumerism in story or method but in the way it is set up. The film runs much like an infomercial. All of the characters talk openly into the camera realising its presence yet never really feeling the need to acknowledge it grabbing you attention just long enough to sell you a little slice of their reality and maybe even set you inline with your own. But the question is how can we put such an idealistic price value on sex? Buy me a drink and I will sell you a blowjob buy me a room and I will sell you my soul. That famous Sprite commercial says Image is nothing thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.' That is a great consumer statement but this film wants to counter by asking what if it is that image you thirst for? All of these men and women have an image and it is that that draws them to each other. They all have a thirst for living like animals being treated like animals and dying like animals until one day they can all realise that they have drank their life away. He hasn't tried to kiss you because he respects you can't you handle that?' If you haven't guessed it the answer was a big fat no. That is why these people desire alcohol so much. It is a controlling factor n their lives that feeds their image while lightening up their brain mass. I am willing to bet that for every twenty people that see this film there will be at least one who will view this as a huge waste of time. Their reasoning? That they are nothing like these characters. That in itself would be statement enough for me. For one film to make use of an external source in this case you is quite simply a technique we haven't seen since the release of Kids. Because we belong to the obey your thirst generation' we are to ignorant in ourselves to admit that these people as trashy as they are are just like everyone else living on this planet. The ideology is that movies are made to entertain us but when one hits a little to close to home we are first to dismiss it as unrealistic and unbelievable. Personally I marvelled in truly human these characters are. Being as this is Hollywood and everything must be formulistic the second half throws a bold curveball that sets both the idea of the alcohol controlled universe and the search for more for redemption in love are place into subtext while the idea of date rape takes over. That does not make these two issues any less important though. Alcohol is a cancer that eats away at the mind until nothing is left but the body and all decisions are left up to chance. I think the running theme of the alcohol in this film is that it's funny how people think that they are living the high life when put under its endurance yet what do you really gain from it. Is being raped a contributing factor to your idealistic dream world? What is the point in sex when you aren't even going to remember it the next mourning? Rick on the other hand in all his drunken splendour seems to be reaching out for help in Jane. The first scene in the bedroom is truly a great piece of description towards the films entire theme. Did we do anything last night?' Asks Rick. After hearing the answer no his reply is good.' Good why good?' Asks Jane. Because I would hope that if we did do something that I would have remembered it.' This film could have taken a turn in the downward direction were it to pit the two groups against each other in a battle of the sexes which I was praying would not happen in the end. For the most part it wasn't. We are allowed to examine both sides of the sexual coin from the very beginning and the account is surprisingly unbiased. The acting in this film is nothing that will stir up any talk around the table come Oscar time. All of the actors do a good job of making the characters just slimy enough to be believable and just likeable enough to hold the audience. Other than that it is nothing really less than you would expect from an underground film such as this. I must hand it to director Michael Cristofer and writer and David McKenna for the way they did this film came out. Films like this are very hard to do because they often find themselves walking the line between compelling and voyeuristic. Yet this film seems out to challenge the voyeurs of the world. Instead of analyzing the lives of a specific group of characters we seem to be analyzing ourselves we just don't realize it because it appears in the form of a film. Probably the best film of this nature would be Kids. It thrust us into a day in the life of a group of teens bent on sex drugs and living a free life. This film is very much like Kids the scene in which the females are discussing the art of oral sex while getting ready for their night out seems to be taken right out of Kids. Yet it is not copyright infringement rather I felt that we are allowed to see that some people just don't know when to grow up. These people all on the paths to mature adulthood are still not content that they are all grown up and that my friends is a scary thought.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's not a huge deal to figure out who you want to fk but who you want to love how do you figure that out?' I believe that you have to be in a certain state of mind to view a film like this. It isn't something that you just pop in and kick back for. One has to be willing to accept as fact what they are seeing and base it not on themselves but what they have come to terms with as being routine and normal. This film is much like the birth cycle. We open with two characters which then divides into three and finally multiplies into eight. Once all of the characters are set and ready to escape their personal pod of existence a story pushes its way through that is sometimes disgusting to watch but uncharacteristically real. We learnt that maybe Darwin was a bit off when making his theory of evolution. We see that mankind definitely formed from apes but how much we have evolved is put into serious questioning.  Eight human beings four males and four females off all different size shape and occupation emerge from everyday life for a wild night of clubbing with sex on their minds and drinks on their tabs.  The film opens with a scene of Rick and Jane lying in a bed clothed. The opening line may simply be the best line to come from a scene like this. Upon awakening Rick asks do you have any Tylenol baby?' Then enters Sara in a drunken state of selfloathing bloodied at the face telling of how she was date raped by Mike. But in the interrogation room Mike's alibi implies that it was consensual sex and Sara was freely open to receive. The first half of the film takes place in the everyday lives of our eight individual minds. It shows us the before effect labelled here as foreplay' the preparation and the journey to the club. The second takes place after the alleged rape. After following the looking into the actual criminal intent of the rape the climax is unlike you would expect from a film of this nature. IT is inconclusive insignificant even but this is not a problem for three reasons. First two people are so drunk that neither of them can remember the full truth of the matter so why should we? Not only should we not know who did it for the simple fact of it would become nothing more than a battle of the sexes film but would shouldn't even care if it happened or not. Second the whole idea of the rape is not what this film is about. It is merely a device used by Hollywood writers to show that the film is moving in a forward fashion and does have some bit of story to provide. The final reason is because this film is about a deep yearning inside that some people posses to find a common medium between unconditional sex and unconditional love. . IT is also about alcohol and how it desensitizes us and robs us of our natural ability to decipher between wrong and right. Lastly it is about consumerism. I'm sure people reading this who have already seen the film will think that I am crazy but it really is. The film is not about consumerism in story or method but in the way it is set up. The film runs much like an infomercial. All of the characters talk openly into the camera realising its presence yet never really feeling the need to acknowledge it grabbing you attention just long enough to sell you a little slice of their reality and maybe even set you inline with your own. But the question is how can we put such an idealistic price value on sex? Buy me a drink and I will sell you a blowjob buy me a room and I will sell you my soul. That famous Sprite commercial says Image is nothing thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.' That is a great consumer statement but this film wants to counter by asking what if it is that image you thirst for? All of these men and women have an image and it is that that draws them to each other. They all have a thirst for living like animals being treated like animals and dying like animals until one day they can all realise that they have drank their life away. He hasn't tried to kiss you because he respects you can't you handle that?' If you haven't guessed it the answer was a big fat no. That is why these people desire alcohol so much. It is a controlling factor n their lives that feeds their image while lightening up their brain mass. I am willing to bet that for every twenty people that see this film there will be at least one who will view this as a huge waste of time. Their reasoning? That they are nothing like these characters. That in itself would be statement enough for me. For one film to make use of an external source in this case you is quite simply a technique we haven't seen since the release of Kids. Because we belong to the obey your thirst generation' we are to ignorant in ourselves to admit that these people as trashy as they are are just like everyone else living on this planet. The ideology is that movies are made to entertain us but when one hits a little to close to home we are first to dismiss it as unrealistic and unbelievable. Personally I marvelled in truly human these characters are. Being as this is Hollywood and everything must be formulistic the second half throws a bold curveball that sets both the idea of the alcohol controlled universe and the search for more for redemption in love are place into subtext while the idea of date rape takes over. That does not make these two issues any less important though. Alcohol is a cancer that eats away at the mind until nothing is left but the body and all decisions are left up to chance. I think the running theme of the alcohol in this film is that it's funny how people think that they are living the high life when put under its endurance yet what do you really gain from it. Is being raped a contributing factor to your idealistic dream world? What is the point in sex when you aren't even going to remember it the next mourning?

You must see this movie. I have seen plenty of teenage based films more than any other genre lately this film is in its unique way a pleasant change. Yet the cast make me feel right at home because of previous teen flicks they have appeared in.I thought the cast blended perfectly. The character I knew immediately was Sara played by Tara Reid. I loved her in American Pie and Urban Legend. In this flick her character was one I felt for. Then there was Jerry O'Connell who played footballer and tough guy Michael. I enjoyed his role in the 2nd instalment of the scream trilogy as the boyfriend of stalker victim Sydney Prescott. Again his role in this one was someone who I felt sorry for even though the situation was probably his fault as much as anyone's. Amanda Peet is also another character that has recently hit the big and small screen. Her role of Jane was one of compassion and sensibility. She doesn't rush into things which in today's world is very important. Amanda also stared in the funny film the Whole Nine Yards alongside Hollywood legend Bruce Willis a film I loved. She also stars in the TV series called Jack and Jill. Her character's name in the series is Jacqueline 'Jack' Barrett. I look forward to seeing her in more movies.Each character in Body Shots gives their view on the main topic that we all grapple with in life  Sex. The men from the guys point of view and the women from the girl's point of view. They talk about everything and anything and boast about every sexual experience they have had. Here is where this gets like one of my favourite TV shows and a lot of other people's as well  Sex and the City. Body Shots has that feel to it in my opinion and I enjoyed the way the message was delivered. They're some scenes that relate to this topic which made me laugh and also sit up and take notice.Then the film moves onto the night on the town which for me showed how vulnerable people can let themselves go. In fact some characters say that losing or not being control is the best way to be. But in my opinion the film shows that doing this is leaving yourself open for to many unknowns to happen. I have no problem with people having a good time but don't let it ruin the rest of your life.In the end this film for me has taught one thing. What makes a relationship is love and companionship not sex. Sex completes it by making LOVE. To finish the summary by the cosmopolitan magazine sums this one up for me.'A sexy and sinful look at being single in the new millennium. Body Shots hits it dead on'. I agree. Being single isn't such a hassle or shouldn't be a problem it's how you handle being single and the risks you take to avoid being the odd one out. If you can do yourself a favour and put this one on the top of your 'must see' list!CMRS gives 'Body Shots' 4 Very Good Film".

It's so 200O this movie which is colorfully if deliciously entertaining and involving. Over the course of the night things really get out of hand for two players if instigated by a fracas with a bouncer earlier. What ensues for O'Connell and Reid is sex gone wrong. O'Connell is charged with the rape of Reid who back at his palatial spread started coming onto him and he returned his affections forcefully against her will. But did he really rape as we have two sides to each story as it appears Reid her character a wannabe actress here has had a really bad history with booze. So really the film becomes in a lesser extent a dramatic thriller. Who's bullshitting who. The film cleverly shows the different POV from our two where Reid could of even made it up where some flashbacks weren't authentic or a little misrepresented that's the fun in the story here. Like in Jerry Macquire O'Connell matter of fact here plays another big shot athlete where only his best friend Rick Sean Patrick Flannery stands by him as really the other guys really don't know him. The dorky Trent Ron Livingston cracked me up and stole the film. Besides the part where he tries to sneak back into the club cause of his dress sense wait to you see his hilarious flashback later before returning his crib which he shares with the guy that completes our foursome. Oh I didn't mention another short flashback involving him with a much older woman which you have to see. All performances are good here and well as a sexy female cast we have a couple of sexy bits but this pic will surprisingly involve you. Quite a potent film if only for a unsatisfying or displeasing endingresult that I highly recommend especially to fans of some it's actors. Check out a scene of originality where the druinken O'Connell after his crime temporarily takes over a hamburger shop. Obviously he really had the munchies.".

	schema:headline " Blends the best components of gritty British filmmaking with a heavy dose of Hong Kong style action!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Bodyguard A New Beginning' focuses around the story of Leung the bodyguard of a Chinese Triad boss Wong to whom his loyalty is unrivaled. Living in Hong Kong Wong requests that his bodyguard travel to the UK to protect a young British woman whose true identity is known only by Wong himself. Even his own errant son Yuen is kept in the dark which leads to a betrayal that threatens to destroy the family and all that his father has worked hard to protect.This energetic piece of low budget filmmaking highlights some of the best components of gritty British filmmaking with a heavy dose of Hong Kong style action and attitude. To top it off the film features an allstar cast incorporating the talents of both iconic veterans and rising stars  all working under the watchful eye of a bold and multitalented young director! Leung Vincent Sze is the loyal bodyguard of Wong Richard Ng the boss of a powerful Hong Kong Triad. Amidst growing tension between Wong and Kai CaryHiroyuki Tagawa the vicious head of a rival family Leung is sent to the UK to protect a British woman whose identity is known only to Wong. As the Triad war in Hong Kong spills out into the streets Kai working with Wong's treacherous son Yuen Carl Ng sends enforcers to the UK to kidnap the mysterious woman Leung is protecting.After Leung finds her the pair struggle to evade Kai's evergrowing army of thugs on the streets of London. Meanwhile in Hong Kong Wong desperately tries to keep his organisation intact as the business' foundations are weakened by his son's disloyalty and Kai's relentless pursuit for Wong's territory. A final confrontation in Hong Kong will bring about an end to the carnage but at a price none of them could have predicted.Following his previous work in Underground director Cheung Chee Keong proves once again he is one of the most skilled technically capable young independent actionfilm directors working in the UK today. Capturing a dark unsettling tone of drama and a fast paced brutal and stylish flair for the action sequences the film treads new ground and blends multigenre conventions.Shot neckdeep in the urban metropolis of both London and Hong Kong the visual style benefits from the diverse range of settings and captures a unique visceral energy that could never be achieved filming in a studio. Although the story doesn't necessarily present anything new there are enough innovative ingredients incorporated into the mix to deliver something fresh and exciting for both oldschool and aspiring fans of Asian and action cinema.In addition to the sights and sounds of the locations the cities are captured in an honest almost homely light perhaps an indicator of the director's sentiment towards London and Hong Kong Cheung was born and bred in England while his folks are from Hong Kong  despite the obvious inclusion of the criminal underworld who exists there. For residents of either city many locations will be familiar and instantly recognizable making the action appear all the more real and immersive.With a variety of athletic acrobatic movements and brutal closequarters fighting the action offers plenty of variety courtesy of action directors Anthony Carpio and Chan Man Ching. To top off the high calibre actors in the film the physical stars are equally impressive and serve up a nice variety of loathsome villains and noble heroes. Mark Strange makes a particularly intimidating villain and seamlessly embodies the image of a human wrecking ball relentlessly pursuing Vincent Sze with monstrous attacks and thunderous force.One of the strongest elements of the film can be seen in the wonderful range of actors representing a crossover between different generations of Hong Kong stardom. Richard Ng is far removed from his comedy persona made famous in the Lucky Stars series and shows his range as a great character actor. Portraying Wong he is both humble and when he needs to be incredibly ruthless and aggressive.In all the movie offers up a wide range of stars stepping into characters outside normal typecasting. This elevates the story beyond expectation and injects a new characterdriven quality of drama into the action and gangster themes.Veteran actor the late great Shing FuiOn even features in a cameo role further evidence of the possible homage to good old fashioned Hong Kong gangster moviemaking. Certainly one of the most appealing points of the movie is the range of stars appearing together on screen  a real achievement in casting this many talented high profile actors in a single project.Bodyguard is a great achievement as a lowbudget piece of multinational action cinema breaking new boundaries while still managing to deliver traditional conventions for genre purists. It is seeing these traits veteran actors and rising stars or classical stories with fastpaced filmmaking that gives the film its integral character and identity. Cheung Chee Keong is reinventing British action cinema as we speak and trust me you don't want to miss out.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Bodyguard A New Beginning' focuses around the story of Leung the bodyguard of a Chinese Triad boss Wong to whom his loyalty is unrivaled. Living in Hong Kong Wong requests that his bodyguard travel to the UK to protect a young British woman whose true identity is known only by Wong himself. Even his own errant son Yuen is kept in the dark which leads to a betrayal that threatens to destroy the family and all that his father has worked hard to protect.This energetic piece of low budget filmmaking highlights some of the best components of gritty British filmmaking with a heavy dose of Hong Kong style action and attitude. To top it off the film features an allstar cast incorporating the talents of both iconic veterans and rising stars  all working under the watchful eye of a bold and multitalented young director! Leung Vincent Sze is the loyal bodyguard of Wong Richard Ng the boss of a powerful Hong Kong Triad. Amidst growing tension between Wong and Kai CaryHiroyuki Tagawa the vicious head of a rival family Leung is sent to the UK to protect a British woman whose identity is known only to Wong. As the Triad war in Hong Kong spills out into the streets Kai working with Wong's treacherous son Yuen Carl Ng sends enforcers to the UK to kidnap the mysterious woman Leung is protecting.After Leung finds her the pair struggle to evade Kai's evergrowing army of thugs on the streets of London. Meanwhile in Hong Kong Wong desperately tries to keep his organisation intact as the business' foundations are weakened by his son's disloyalty and Kai's relentless pursuit for Wong's territory.

	schema:reviewBody "La Guerre est Finie aka The War is Over 1966 from French master Alain Resnais is a taut intellectual yet very much visual thriller. Yves Montand is in his mature prime and Ingrid Thulin so quietly sensual while Genevive Bujold gave an impressive debut performance. Resnais' creative cinematic approach in rich visual play mixed with voiceover narration aptly intensified the suspense. We're literally inside Montand's character Diego's head  thinking with him seeing through his eyes having memory tracking along with him in either flash back or flash forward. We feel Thulin's subtle moves as Marianne  a slight turn of her head gentle extension of her neck every movement so delicately modest yet sensual in volumes. Bujold's Nadine has such delicious youthful verve befitting the character  she is the exciting accent. Thulin and Bujold each has an intimate segment opposite Montand delivered in Resnais' unique and refreshing points of view. It is cinematic nuance truly savory and appreciation optimal.Cinematography in black and white by Sacha Vierny is poignantly appropriate  suspense would probably be lessen if delivered in color. Music score by Giovanni Fusco further ensured the distinctive quality of this film. You can tell this is no Hollywood thriller formula. In fact the film can very well be a character study of Diego or a visual journey through the interplay of character relationships yet it's suspenseful nonetheless. The beginning segment with veteran actor Michel Piccoli as the shrewd custom inspector questioning Montand's Diego certainly is tense as any other spy thriller yarn.The war in the title can very well be within Diego to decide whether to continue this life of 'professional revolutionary' or to start anew a 'normal' life with Marianne. The dilemma also carries over to Marianne to decide to stay in Paris or love conquers all in pursuit after Diego to the point of being a matter of life and death indeed. The War is Over may seem complex but it's actually an easier to follow film than other Resnais endeavors. Give it a try. It's available on DVD. Caution do ignore the dubbed in English alternative  it would not be the real thing definitely nonflavorful. Experience the film in French with English subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yves Montand plays Diego Mora a Spanishborn refugee living in France but working for the underground resistance trying to overthrow Franco's fascist regime. He's been in this life for years and is becoming disillusioned with the futility of his actions and the inability of his colleagues to change their modus operandi.The story starts at the FrenchSpanish border Diego is stopped by the authorities. He was meant to meet a contact in Madrid as part of a plan to organise a general strike in Spain. The police let's him go but he feels something's wrong and his suspicions are confirmed when his friends start being arrested. So he returns to reorganise himself meet the leaders of the resistance and spend some time with his love Marianne played by Ingrid Thulin.It may sound disappointing to say that not much more happens in the course of the movie but this movie is not a traditional political thriller. A viewer expecting suspense and tension will certainly find better options. The War Is Over is in fact a character study and an illustration of how futile and unpleasant fighting for one's convictions can be.Through the life of Diego Mora we discover a world of freedom fighters that cinema seldom portrays it's boring it requires patience it hardly achieves anything and it's bogged down in rhetoric and theory instead of inspiring action and no one is thanked for their personal and emotional sacrifices. This is the life of ordinary people who've given up their personal lives to fight for something they believe is worthy but who live forever in the uncertainty is it all worth it? There are some scenes that stand out for its contrast of ideas for instance when Diego meets the leaders of the resistance he suggests cancelling the general strike. His views are criticised for being too blinded by reality. It seems that Diego spending too much time in Spain can't see the big picture anymore as opposed to the bourgeoisliving leaders in Paris with their ideas and quotes from Lenin and other Marxist theorists. If you can't appreciate the black humor of this situation this movie won't do anything for you.In another scene Diego meets through a teenager who admires him several young men who are planning to use explosives to fight Franco. It seems they're more in tune with his line of thinking preferring action over theory. But Diego can't see eye to eye with them either. Exactly what does Diego want? That's the great existential mystery of the movie.I watched this movie because Jorge Semprn wrote it. Most viewers will come to it via Alain Resnais' name but this director has never done much for me. So I have little to say about the editing or the cinematography. For me the quality of this movie is focused mostly on the screenplay and the acting.Jorge Semprn was perhaps more interested in politics than Resnais as we can see by the movies he wrote later Z Special Section The Confession. In these movies I admired his subdued approach to political thrillers. Rather than glamorising making things exciting he preferred to dismantle things and analyse them get to the core of them. That is precisely what he does in The War Is Over in showing perhaps the most realistic portrait of life in an underground resistance in cinema ever.".

What gives this film its vitality is the screenplay written by Jorge Semprun and it resonates today as well as it did in the mid60s.  Semprun had just written his classic The Long Voyage in 1963 and the crisp trenchancy of his narrative style is just as evident in this film as it was in that story of his 1944 voyage to Buchenwald as a captured fighter of the French Resistance.  Though we may not feel any longer the need to reassess the strategy of how to overthrow Franco we still know what it's like to feel you're at the end of the rope with no place to leap to both politically and psychologically. What Semprun reminds us both in this film and in The Long Voyage is that it's the opportunities to experience solidarity with and support for others over the course of the journey that matters in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alain Resnais was part of the socalled Left Bank of the French New Wave alongside with Varda Marker and Demy who were politically much more aware compared to the film fanatics of Cahiers du Cinema Rohmer Truffaut Rivette Godard Chabrol. Alain Resnais has always been interested in past but here he focuses on its impact with regards to the future. The War Is Over was his fourth feature following Hiroshima mon amour Last Year in Marienbad and Muriel and still remains as one of the finest films of political cinema. The film builds around the theme of how to come to terms with one's past in order to live in peace with the present. No other place  maybe Germany or Poland  offers such a great setting for this but Spain because the shadows of the Civil War are so present. It is a milieu that has become the symbol of the war so to speak.Diego Mora Yves Montad is an old man who spent his youth as a revolutionary in the Spanish Civil War. Now thirty years later he's part of a group that wants to redeem the dreams of the revolution in Paris. All the members of the group are living in the past and so is Diego. But soon he has a moment of realization and breaks himself away from the chains of illusion and decides to make a change. Thus The War Is Over is really a story about a man who is living a lie. It tells rather bleakly in a melancholy tone about old communists who can't let go off the past.The War Is Over might just be Resnais' most satisfying work when it comes to somewhat coherent viewing experience. It's his first film with a clear storyline which is relatively easy to follow even if the editing was deliberately but not selfdeliberate! ambiguous and confusing. Resnais has succeeded perfectly to relay the flow of time. Moreover through the character played by Yves Montand the viewer can understand the director's thoughts and emotions no matter how shattered because he holds the pieces together. It is he through whom the viewer constructs the big picture.In The War Is Over memories are created for the future. Alain Resnais doesn't try to build the horrors of the past by newsreel footage. He relays the tragedy of the conditions by showing how people are still living in the past how they are left with unredeemed dreams in their hands. The dream has died in Spain. Of course Spain is still there but merely as a concrete place full of tourists. People don't understand each other. There is a major breakdown in the communication between the old and the new left. Both are dreaming of a revolution but in their own ways. The legacy of the past torments the protagonist. However he is not only forced to recall the past endlessly but also to be unable to understand the present reality.".

After 36 long years I am able to show my friends what I have so often argued is the most horrible example of film making in all human history. I recently viewed it for the second time the first being in 1966. Perhaps I was too young then to appreciate the subtleties or nuances of the film its textures and complexities. Gimme a break this thing plays worse now than it did then.The reason I firmly believe that this is the worst flick I've ever seen is that it actually takes itself seriously It has a respected director Resnais stars the greatest French actor ever Montand and introduces the beautiful and talented Genevieve Bujold oh those eyes. Throw in Ingrid Thulin Bergman freaks know this talented woman and the movie shouldn't miss. It does it is just bad.There's a story in there somewhere wrapped around a few steamy for the times sex scenes and a delightful bit of oncamera puking always fun. Mostly the movie tries to insult your sensibilities while engaging in a pointless and confusing character study of a frustrated middleaged antiFranco Marxist. The problem is the guy is shallow there is no character to study. The rest of the people are very '60s Eurolefties very chic and very uninteresting to all but themselves and Resnais in 1966  I can't begin to imagine how boring they must be to modern audiences. If you want to be entertained while battling against old rightwing Spanish dictators grab yourself some Hemingway. Now there's a guy who could study character.When we left that theater in 1966 my date turned to me laughingly and said that if I lived a good life God would never make me see a movie that bad again. Apparently I've lived a good life. Listen I've sat through Ed Wood productions and AnneMargaret's Kitten With a Whip but La Guerre Est Finie remains the worst flick I've ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many folks who watch this film today might be a bit confused about the context so I'll try to explain. When the Spanish Republican army was defeated by Francisco Franco's troops at the end of the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s many Republicans many of whom were communists and socialists were jailed or killedand many more poured over the border into exile in countries like France.The character Yves Montand plays in this film Diego Mora is one of these communist exilesone who regularly sneaks back and forth between the countries on missions for his cause. Exactly what he does on these missions is never talked about very much in these films but he and his comrades are trying to keep alive a small dissident group within Spain. However during one of these many trips he is taken in for questioning at the border. Somehow the police have become suspicious but with the help of a young French lady Genevieve Bujold he's able to extricate himself from custody. But others in the organization weren't so lucky and were arrested. Because of this Mora plans on returning to Spain to try to alert others in his cell so they can escape. However instead of doing this he spends so much of the film doing nothing in particular. In fact that is a HUGE problem with the film. He learns about the possible leak in his organization and the arrests early on in the film and yet doesn't return to help the other agents until about 90 minutes later. In the interim he meets with several women he cares about or wishes to have sex with before his return to Spain. In addition he talks and talks and talkstoo much to keep the film interesting or wellpaced. Overall an interesting and well acted curioespecially since Montand himself was a communist and much of the story seems ironic in light of his own background as an Italian expatriate. But not a particularly enjoyable curio.Oddly the first sex scene in the film was one of the most unintentionally funny I have ever seen. Instead of showing any real skin the camera kept showing everything BUTand with all sorts of artsy angles and composition. It made me laugh and seemed bizarre in light of the very ordinary and nonprudish sex scene later in the film. Why they did this I have no idea. Perhaps the first nude scene with Bujold was done this way because she was uncomfortable with nudity and I'd sure love to know why they handled it in such a silly manner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Funny would be a word that comes to mind naturally for describing this very retrolooking French comedy in black and white and small screen that is at once witty and idiotic both. Four separate stories of varying lengths from 20 to 40 minutes are loosely linked to a motifserving cafeteria on the outskirts of Paris. We first see a witless robber wannabe trying to hold up the cafeteria ending up in a conversation with a sensuous waitress who turns out to be his kind of people. The brief flashback of her story is actually shot in the traditional silent movie mode complete with captions. Following this short first chapter is the story of two kidnappers who have the heart of a Boy Scout leader. The teenage girl they have kidnapped turns out to be suicidal being neglected by her father and also perhaps simply because it is fashionable. The brief connection with the cafeteria is that its parking lot is the venue where they are to receive the ransom from the father who never show up. While they wait there is a very brief but outrageously hilarious link back to the first story if you had been paying attention.The third story is a chance encounter in the same night of two pop band leaders both stopping for coffee at the cafeteria en route to Paris. While the band members sit at the counter the two find themselves a quiet corner to chat. During a very engaging and extremely wellacted conversation we discover gradually what had happened between them some years ago. The final story starts with four old timers looking up a patient in a hospital with the intention of murdering him which must reminds you of The Godfather when the Don is in hospital. When it comes to light that this is all a misunderstanding the five reminiscent on the good old days and head out to look for their old hide out which stores for them so much treasured memory. You've got it  the hideout or where it used to be is the cafeteria. While they are enjoying a beer there they decide to do just one more job for old time's sake. They choose a bank that they have robbed 3 times before thinking that it would be a cinch only to find that this place is now something else.In full circle we come to an epilogue back to a continuation of the first story learning more about the wouldbe robber and the waitress. What's more they are made for each other. The end credit rolls while we follow a continuous long take of them from the back walking side by side along the highway. They didn't hold hands but their shoulders occasionally brush each other. That is so sweet. So is the five old timers' reminiscing.An enchanting gem this movie is.".

No color beautiful naive stories funny gangsters Anna camera work music. Well sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops. But this is not a musical after all. I like Anna's acting this naive wannabe gangster girl how she speaks holds the gun everything makes me smile. No it's not that funny though i have laughed a bit at some moments it's just so subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Though 3d nouvelle seems weaker but they are also gangsters maybe even worse cause they are stealing ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. Makes me feel so warm and.. romantic. Yes i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such arthousish movies. And i don't agree with those comparing it to Pulp Fiction. It's not about action and twisted story though all vignettes intersect. It's calm and maybe too slow movie for most of the people. It's about characters their feelings very subtle. Anyway probably this review won't be of much help to anyone my first just wanted to express my appreciation.SPOILER This movie doesn't have a Goofs section. Wonder didn't anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the kidnappers decided to go home? Looks like a part of crew hehe. I know i should better post this in forums but i don't agree with some policies here.".

We actually were disappointed that some of the stories were left hanging so to speak and we were left to wonder about their characters. Another pickypicky complaint and perhaps this was just our theater was that the subtitles got lost in the white counter tops at the bottom of the screen. They were very difficult to read at times.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the London film Festival. Structurally it has been compared to Pulp Fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the slacker mood of Kevin Smith's Clerks. Four stories intersect at a French motorway diner. The first vignette has Franck Edouard Baer bungling a hold up at the diner. The waitress Suzie Anna Mouglalis takes pity and tell him her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers Leon Bouli Lanners and Paul Serge Lariviere take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them she is suicidal and her family don't appear to want her back. The third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner Alain Bashung and Arno playing themselves. The final part is about four excriminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into  the diner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story not really an epilogue more a conclusion.The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. Nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of the individual stories varies. The hideout story is a cute idea with a couple of good gags but does not come off and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull. On the other hand the kidnap story is hilarious although its connection to the diner is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and Suzie one.This film isn't entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of Writerdirector's Samuel Benchetrit's work.".

This is not for the squeamish. Bitorajac is excellent as the evil doctor surrounded by the mundane and equally corrupt physicians and police officials on the take. At one point he bribes the pathologist to change his report to clear his obvious responsibility for a patients death so much for the Hippocratic oath.

Like the famous Madonna song Danko is a material guy and he is living in a material world.But the sht is about to hit the fan for the good doctor when the chicken come home to roost in shape of sloppy malpractices and investigation into his conduct by both the clinic and later the police. In particular when he starts performing dangerous abortions on sex workers owned by a dangerous criminal. But does Danka even care about the consequences or feel remorse at all? The answer is left to the viewers to decide.Paints an unflattering view of Croatian professionals in general. Doctors are depicted as either corrupt or inconsiderate folks worrying more about lawsuits than about the patient. Nurses are portrayed as equal opportunist though it's more of a unrequited love in case of Babic's loyal assistant Lana talented Natasa Janjic in a thankless role. Disgusting jokes and racial taunts seems to be the norm. The less said about the police the better.It seems Branko Schmidt writerdirector is using the character of Danko as some sort of a templatea mirror of Croatian crumbling moral values amid selfserving greed. The nobility of the titular profession is tainted by Danko's employing his abilities as a gynecologist for reprehensible purposes. Unique resolution will divide viewers.The gory and surgical procedure segments are mostly implied. That actually makes it tougher to watch more so if you're prolife.".

Luckily for Branko Schmidt the piece is too obscure to actually get a Razzie. So that's one upside of living in Croatia eh?That and maybe the fact that Croatian cinematography isn't renowned for spewing out masterpieces in general so maybe within the scope of that environment this film even compares as okay. On a more global scale I don't think it deserves any attention. In short I would describe it as a very sketchy shallow piece whose story line lacks development and is poorly narrated through sporadic and thin dialogue between superficial grotesque characters whose motivation is at best  unclear. Many mediocre films suffer from lack of idea how to end a story even if their beginning was promising. Cannibal Vegetarian lands in medias res with a chaotic speedsequence that is supposed to reflect the frantic personality of the main character. Perhaps this style may appeal to younger generations. This form of narration continues throughout the film. Unfortunately the director seemed to be so preoccupied with painting the pathology of the main character's psyche that he forgot to develop any other character or even give a flow and some direction to the actual story being told. Just when you think the plot is about to culminate it ends abruptly as if the writer had just given up. You get dragged through 85 minutes of painful forced interactions between allbadguys characters to be given no resolution and no message?What an unfortunate collision of bad writing and unimaginative directing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love Jirachi's story. No spoiler intended but it is certainly a selfless story. What amazes me most is Jirachi's personality. It is probably thousands of years old according to the animated feature since it awakens every one thousand years to absorb the Millennium Comet's energy but it is still so pure playful and childlike like a newborn baby. It would be kind of exciting if it wakes up berserk and wreck havoc though but thankfully it didn't I prefer it this way!Max is one of the protagonist and his friendship with Jirachi is pure and innocent too. Too bad that the Millennium Comet plot passes rather fast seven days in about or less than one hour of screen time... I would prefer the creators of this animated feature prolong the plot and make it more meaningful but that's just me. Moments are short in Jirachi Wish Maker 2003 but it is still sweet and enriching!Lessons that can be learned from this animated feature are quite straightforward but what's weird is that no one else seems to know about the Jirachi except The Great Butler and his other half. Wouldn't people from all over the Pokmon world go look for Jirachi? It should be a big thing. I also find the lullaby scenes awkward or uncomfortable most likely due to the performance of the voice casts English dub but that's probably also just me.In brief Jirachi Wish Maker 2003 is sweet selfless and enriching. It is about lifelong friendships a little of love and a lot about life. It also have hidden messages such as what science backlash can do and the negative effects of certain obsessions. Therefore I think this is one of the nicest Pokmon films out there what about you?".

If you don't know much about pokemon you wont get the small team rocket parts and the powers pokemon have such as Pikachu's thunder attacks but you wont miss much of the story. Go back and watch the TV series or play a gameboy version if you're a bit lost but I doubt it.A better name for the magician could have been better though it was original.

There are some things to enjoy but there just wasn't much that was great or notable about it.There wasn't much plot to be honest. Most of the movie takes place at a circus and the last half hour was mostly spent on getting Jirachi to his home.Jirachi was kind of cute but rather annoying for the most part and I felt that his relationship with Max was kind of forced. It had the basic message of lasting friendship that while nice has already been done before.There wasn't much excitement until the last 20 minutes and the animation is still good but a definite step down from Pokmon Heroes.However I will admit that there were some funny moments involving Jirachi and Butler was fairly interesting as a villain. Even if a lot of the magic show scenes went on a little too long some of them were quite entertaining.Groudon is another cool legendary Pokmon and the final 20 minutes are exciting enough. I also loved the Make a Wish song at the end credits.Easily the worst Pokmon movie up to this point and in my opinion one of the least memorable. However even though it's nothing special at least it's never boring. It's not the worst Pokmon movie and it's still worth a watch but don't expect anything mindblowing.RATING C".

SAMMY IS PROFESSER OAK!!!!!!!!!!!!! In Pokemon Heroes I cried when Latios was killed. SPOILER! At the very end of the movie I saw the dead brother Latios the dead father Latios and the live sister Latias yes her name is Latias not Latios it varies depending on gender boys are Latios and girls are Latias flying above the ocean!!!!!!! What's up with that!!!!!!!!!! And in this movie when Jiraci left Max Ash May and Brock I almost cried with that. The end song was wonderful I love listening to it over and over and over! All in all this movie is very good and actually has emotional scenes between the semivillain Butler and the one he loves Dianne. Well bring on Pokemon Movie 7 coming out in Febuary!!!!!!!!!".

Why don't you get up and give this movie a ten. The graphics have also gone vastly up from the last film. And the music is also so much better. Also notice Ash and Misty will always have that little bond that no one talks about. The voices are also major parts of the rolls. If you had Jude Law do Lorenzo yuck!".

Why don't you get up and give this movie a ten. The graphics have also gone vastly up from the last film. And the music is also so much better. Also notice Ash and Misty will always have that little bond that no one talks about. The voices are also major parts of the rolls. If you had Jude Law do Lorenzo yuck!";

	schema:headline " 5th Pokmon movie is the shortest one yet.";
	schema:reviewBody "At 70 minutes as timed at a press screening POKMON HEROES is the shortest Pokmon movie yet. This may be a relief to parents and Pokmonhaters everywhere but it leaves Pokmon's target audience hungering for more. The big action climax never quite delivers and the great triumphal note the earlier films ended on never quite comes. This is especially disappointing because the film's first half offered a most exciting buildup involving two spectacular new Water Pokmon and two clever and attractive new villains. Thanks to these elements the film is still worth seeing but you may want to wait until the DVD release when it will be accompanied by the Pikachu short that played with it when it ran in Japanese theaters last summer.The film does at least make its new Pokmon characters Latios and Latias a little more powerful and more layered than most Pokmon get the chance to be. Shaped somewhat like dinosaurs and able to both fly at high speeds and swim underwater they're colorful graceful creatures a brotherandsister team who are thoroughly devoted to each other. Aside from Ash's faithful Pikachu they get the most screen time of any Pokmon in the film.Annie and Oakley are the new bad girls in town and they completely blow their colleagues Team Rocket out of the water well actually INTO the watera running gag throughout the film. They're fashionable if somewhat snobby teen villainesses with eyecatching outfits and hairdos who get ample opportunity to wrap the audience at least the older male part around their little fingers before their illfated and somewhat rushed attempt to take over Alto Mare an island city that hosts the annual Water Pokmon Festival the draw for our heroes Ash Misty and Brock. As master thieves Annie and Oakley seem to be a lot more efficient than Team Rocket and should be given more to do in future Pokmon entries.The design of Alto Mare deserves note for being the most extensively detailed urban setting yet seen in the entire Pokmon series. Largely created by CGI and modeled after Venice Italy it's quite visually stunning and deserves greater attention from anime fans than it's likely to get.The big mystery surrounding this film and the previous one POKMON 4EVER is why Miramax has chosen to distribute it in theaters without the 23minute Pikachu short that normally accompanies each Pokmon movie and did so for the first three Pokmon movies when they were released by Warner Bros.. Certainly given the short running time of this one the addition of the delightful Pika Pika Starlight Camp as it was called in Japan would have gone a long way to giving fans their money's worth.".

Why are they beating this 'dead' franchise?  Though it's far from the powerhouse that it once was Pokemon still enjoys a level of popularity in the U.S. that justifies the release of a new movie every year the cards and videogames still sell briskly to this day.  Cross the ocean to Japan and you'll see that Pokemon is STILL going strong after all this time the 6th Pokemon movie has just been released over there and Japanese Pokemon merchandising continues heartily.Pokemon Heroes finds our protagonist one Ash Ketchum his ever present Pikachu and pals Misty and Brock traveling through the Venicelike city of Alto Mare.  It is said that Alto Mare is guarded by the spirits of Pokemon siblings Latios brother and Latias sister whose father long ago brought water to the city and saved the people from rogue Pokemon who had been terrorizing the city.  Once again Alto Mare is in danger but the threat comes not so much from evil Pokemon but from the ever dangerous Team Rocket.  However it is not the blundering Jessie James and Meowth and now also Wobbuffet who pose the threat but the graceful and stylish Annie and Oakley who look to rule Alto Mare and eventually the world and capture Latios and Latias to present to the Team Rocket boss as prizes.  Latias who has been roaming the city disguised as a local girl takes a shine to Ash who inevitably becomes involved in the siblings' struggle against Annie and Oakley for the fate of Alto Mare.  Can Ash and his friends help Latias and Latios protect Alto Mare from the evil of Annie and Oakley?  Will Jessie James Meowth and Wobbuffet ever be more than just comic relief?  Will Brock ever get the girl?As with the previous 4 movies those who are already Pokemon fans will derive the most enjoyment out of Pokemon Heroes.  Those who are not already fans may still enjoy the movie if they let themselves.  I know what it is like to not have any emotional investment in a movie to the point of apathy or even distaste for the subject matter or the actors within yet I have seen and actually enjoyed quite a few movies in spite of my initial impressions.  Why many people including kids who once were rabid Pokemon fans but now for whatever reason claim to now hate it do not approach Pokemon in the same way is quite unfortunate.What is also unfortunate is Miramax's marketing strategy for Pokemon Heroes.  As with Pokemon 4Ever Miramax has decided to release Pokemon Heroes in only a handful of theaters 196 on opening weekend with a minimum of promotion.  I am guessing that it is because they are trying to bolster sales of the future VHSDVD release by firing up anticipation for it and what better way to get anticipation up than by making the movie available to only a small number of theaters?  Personally I think it's a lousy way to market a popular franchise and I hope that 4Kids Entertainment will find another distributor for the 6th Pokemon movie because this socalled dynamic marketing strategy Miramax claims to have had for Pokemon 4Ever and Pokemon Heroes is a bunch of hooey.".

Action is at the high level that this movie seems like it goes forward and back between limited animation and full animation. Tsunami at the end was the highest level that prove this. Musics are the best. If this movie had soundtrack it would be the best. I really need it. Especially the one that was done via accordion. It really gives the atmosphere of the city and properly fit.

It was supposed to contain a half hour minmovie as well but for some Unown reason it was not included. The main thing I like for in a movie is quality not quantity. This movie certainly has quality.The streets of Alto Mare were rendered to look amazingly realistic. A Pokemon movie has never looked so good! The new villains Annie and Oakley were also a very clever crafty colorful duo. Though Jessie and James are still the BEST Pokemon villains ever!This movie does have a very emotional scene at the end where the courageous Latios sacrifices himself to protect the city. It was among the best movies I have ever seen in my life!Pokemon is truly awesome! I look forward to the sixth movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great movie one of the movies I grew up with. It was excellently done a decent story and great characters. I love the bonds shown or developed throughout the movie especially Latios and Latias. These two are the closest Pokemon duo I have seen and they were quite well done. So you ask why is it 9 stars if you enjoy the movie so much? Well I have quite a few problems with the movie. First I would like the clear up that this is the shortest Pokemon film released so far and will probably stay that way as long as Pokemon is running. If you skipped directly to the race and watched to the part where 2 Latios and 1 Latias fly towards Alto Mare it would be about 30 seconds under an hour. This leaves Pokemon fans hungering for more and I myself wish this was a longer film.My second problem is that the English version should have had a more similar story to the Japanese version. The Japanese version was a very successful film with a brilliant story. So why just why was this all changed up? This isn't a question I've seen many people ask but I am wondering. Why was Latios's voice changed in the English dub. It helped distinguish Latios and Latias's differences better which is one of the things I liked about the Japanese version.These are only three problems but they are big enough to knock the movie down a star for me. But the movie is still kidfriendly and entertaining. I love it until this very day and the movie itself was very emotional. Latias and Latios are adorable and cool at the same time just the Pokemon I love the most. Latios's death set a new course for the Pokemon world and it still affects some today. Annie and Oakley were funny and unusual villains. I like both of their characters Oakley's desire for power and Annie just the more girly of the two wanting to steal pretty things and wear nice clothes. I wish they were given another role in the future.I am not denying that this was a great film but it could have easily been better. But this movie is unique for its design focus. I like how Alto Mare is loosely based off of Venice which is a gorgeous city. Latios and Latias will always have a special place in my heart as well as this movie.".

It helped distinguish Latios and Latias's differences better which is one of the things I liked about the Japanese version.These are only three problems but they are big enough to knock the movie down a star for me. But the movie is still kidfriendly and entertaining. I love it until this very day and the movie itself was very emotional. Latias and Latios are adorable and cool at the same time just the Pokemon I love the most. Latios's death set a new course for the Pokemon world and it still affects some today. Annie and Oakley were funny and unusual villains. I like both of their characters Oakley's desire for power and Annie just the more girly of the two wanting to steal pretty things and wear nice clothes. I wish they were given another role in the future.I am not denying that this was a great film but it could have easily been better. But this movie is unique for its design focus. I like how Alto Mare is loosely based off of Venice which is a gorgeous city. Latios and Latias will always have a special place in my heart as well as this movie.";

Meanwhile Annie and Oakley a couple of cat burglars from Team Rocket this affiliation is only in the Western dub attempt to steal a special jewel called the Soul Dew which powers the city.It takes just a little too long to get going. Jesse James and Meowth are featured but they don't really have much to do. However there are still some lovely moments a bittersweet ending and in the end they do add up to more than the sum of their parts. The animation and architecture of Altomare echoes the look and feel of Koriko from Kiki's Delivery Service. I just wish that Miramax didn't tamper with it before releasing it to Western audiences. There is about 5 minutes missing and its inclusion might have made the film a little bit stronger.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is what I look forward to see ever bluemoon on Encore Family or Starz. As of now Pokemon is a mess of an anime and I refuse to watch or nor any of the new movies which brings nothing but disgust to me. The new movies doesn't appeal to me at all it has the same plot the new higher quality doesn't appeal to me at all it appeals more to HD users and looks different from Pokemon Heroes movie and you can literally compare it to the last movie being the same but held in different townscities with different plots. I'm tired of hearing Pokemon talk which is getting old and overused Jirachi Victini Shaymin etc. The animation quality in this movie differs from what it does in current movies it looks more detailed and beautiful and Pokemon Master Quest in general the series which this movie was currently being held in as far as time period. I love the connection that Ash had with Latias the terrific music in the movie such as secret garden and hot on the trail. The soundtrack should've won multiple awards the genres was slammed packed with emotional action and beautiful music. It appeals to any Pokemon fan the action music is probably the best out of the entire series. This movie is my childhoodI watch it til this day with pride and gets excited every time it's on TV jumping for joy. If anyone from a TV station such as Starz or Encore Family is reading this please reair this movie more often. I LOVE it and out of Pokemon the Movie Pokemon 2000 Pokemon the Movie 3 and Pokemon 4ever I love this the best all are GREAT movies and this is the last. I don't care if this movie is short or not it's irrelevant when you watch this movie you will forget about time. To me this movie feels like it's 2 or even 3 hours long. And I'm glad this is the last good Pokemon movie others like Pokemon Jirachi Wish Maker was ALRIGHT but I mean perfect and fitted well with the plot and scenery. Also the scenery for this movie was PERFECT I can tell they put a lot of effort into it from the scenery like the secret garden the model of the city and the docks. This is a much watch. Thanks for airing it on television!".

	schema:reviewBody "As you can guess this movie was my childhood in fact every Pokemon movie up until Lucario was mine and my siblings childhood these Pokemon movies were just so engaging endearing and awesome despite being corny  come on its Pokemon i always felt i would never be the same without these films. I love this movie and all the others so much my siblings and i always try to watch them at least once year. But enough about my childhood lets get on to the review. So this movie takes place in a city called altomare which is basically Venice in Pokemon world but just as gorgeous you could tell the animators took their time designing the city. There is a story that legendary Pokemon called latios and latias would protect the city from evil people with evil Pokemon and that they had to flood the entire city drowning the evil Pokemon  yeah dark right and there were only 2 survivors a brother  latios and sister  latias from the get go this movie establishes some very interesting lore and i only wish there was more of it. The movie starts off with ash and misty in a water Pokemon chariot race with the master quest song playing  This song and this moment is so awesome and memorable i got into wake boarding just to try to replicate it through the race you notice that latios and latias have the power of invisibility and watch over the city latias is revealed to be able to look like a human girl. Ash and his friends then explore the city and visit the museum which has the fossils of the evil Pokemon and a weapon that was used to protect the city using the soul of a latios  very rich lore. Meanwhile we follow 2 sexy cat burglars who work for team rockets boss Giovanni these 2 women are named Annie and Oakley let me just say that these 2 became some of my favorite Pokemon villains just their intro is awesome  its a spy car that can turn into a jet! their spy like style is very cool they even have cool Pokemon a espion and ariados who also become antagonists. Annie and Oakley's goal is to capture both legendary Pokemon find the crystallized soul of a latios and use the city's weapon for their own agenda. The 2 end up being very intimidating as they ruthlessly pursue latias through the city  they can even see through the Pokemon's invincibility using spy glasses. The movie is very short and cuts right to the final climax very quickly Annie and Oakley use the weapon to control the city and resurrect the evil Pokemon making  gasp ZOMBIE Pokemon!!! So... as always ash is the only one who can stop them and there is a very impressive chase scene involving ash latias and the zombie Pokemon. And just when you think the day is won the weapon actually causes a tidal wave to occur as it comes closer to destroying the city latios give up his life to stop it  yes an actual death in pokemon! This leads to a bittersweet ending involving latias saying goodbye to ash which unsettling leads to a kiss from latias to ash  in human form Brock was really jealous the movie then ends with ash seeing the ghosts of latias's family in the sky. Also it shows Annie and Oakley in prison looking at a book with a picture of the collector from Pokemon 2000 establishing continuity between these movies. The story is simple but engaging almost whimsical in fact but the music is awe inspiring it haunts me the end credits sequence doesn't have 1 but 5 different songs that are all very good songs. The animation looked good but nothing special there was a lot of CGI used in this  that wasn't very good but as your traveling through the CGI halls of altomare there's this beauty and atmosphere about it i think this sort of CGI worked really well with this movie. i love this movie and despite it having its flaws like being too short i couldn't imagine living without it! May it touch your soul as it has touched mine.".

One day while we were there we watched this movie. Rewatching it brings back memories from those years ago but judging it on its own I still think this is a stellar Pokmon movie.This in my humble opinion is one of the top 3 Pokmon movies. It does everything right. It's not quite as big in scope as some of the others but yet it's a more engaging movie. It has everything you could want in a Pokmon movie and much more.The story is very interesting. Team Rocket members Annie and Oakley are after the jewel that protects the city of Altomare and it's up to the guardians Latios and Latias and Ash and the gang to save the day. Annie and Oakley while a little ditsy at times are aboveaverage as far as Pokmon villains go.Latios and Latias are wondrous Pokmon and the bond Ash grew with Latias is one of the best the series has to offer. I thought Lorenzo and Bianca were really nice supporting characters although I would have liked for them to be a little more developed.The animation still today is breathtaking. There is wonderful scenery in Altomare. It gives you a sense of wonder and even at times feels like a Miyazaki film. It also has some of the best music and one of the best soundtracks in a Pokmon movie which also adds to the movie's feel.There is plenty of action and excitement from the opening race scene to the climax. The ending where Latios sacrifices himself to save Altomare is genuinely heartwrenching and has the kind of emotion rarely seen in a Pokmon movie. Along with Lucario and the Mystery of Mew this is my favorite Pokmon film. This is an essential viewing for anyone remotely interested in Pokmon.RATING A".

I also thought they wouldn't differ a lot from the original Japanese version since Pokmon is a renowned franchise but now after reviewing them in 2014? That thought have been proved completely wrong especially from this film.Pokmon Heroes Latios and Latias 2002 is beautiful it sets in a refined city and it has great music. It feels romantic. It feels otherworldly at times. Unfortunately in the English dub the entire backstory introduction has been removed and ultimately making the whole story altered. It is a wonder why the Pokmon company allows this or the production company decided to do this for the English version but it is evident that their creativity isn't fruitful.In the beginning it appears to have an interesting storyline. It also seems that they have played more with camera movements and angles which are refreshing and fun to watch as the city is beautiful. In the end the story and concept is not and it isn't satisfying. They could have been done so much better. I won't say there isn't story there is but it isn't well developed. There are female villains that appears to be promising too but well the overall character and story development is just unfortunately terrible.Sad to mention the last half of the movie seems like casual work. There are a lot of thoughts put into the visuals and music but certainly not the story. There are several scenes that are quite sudden too. For instance what happened to all the other citizen? They just disappeared and even the Alto Mare city is facing doom no one even comes out panic ever. It seems like as if people from the entire world has vanished. I understand it is night time when that happened but it feels like as if the whole movie is about these several characters only. Honestly the story could have been so much better if they put more effort into it did not decide to alter it completely and remove the introduction segment from the original version. This animated feature could have been one of the best Pokmon films out there with its beautiful music and settings but it just didn't make it.Ending this post if you are not bothered by the lack of depth and weak story Pokmon Heroes Latios and Latias 2002 should be good. I love to watch Latios and Latias and all the other Pokmon coming to life through animation but I will be honest with you it may disappoint if you're watching not solely for Pokmon.".

Honestly the story could have been so much better if they put more effort into it did not decide to alter it completely and remove the introduction segment from the original version. This animated feature could have been one of the best Pokmon films out there with its beautiful music and settings but it just didn't make it.Ending this post if you are not bothered by the lack of depth and weak story Pokmon Heroes Latios and Latias 2002 should be good. I love to watch Latios and Latias and all the other Pokmon coming to life through animation but I will be honest with you it may disappoint if you're watching not solely for Pokmon.";

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly don't get the critic bash for this movie. This is not the next critically acclaimed highly anticipated blockbuster from Christopher Nolan. This is not a interesting concept that has the potential to redefine cinema. This is Pokmon.Pokemon Heroes takes place in a city of Altomare obviously inspired by Venice where the trio of Ash Misty and Brock goes into a plot to destroy the city in the world of the iconic little cute monsters Pokemon. The characterization fit the bill finely. The characters and the legendary Pokmon Latias and Latios are given reasonable background information to build you familiarity into understanding Altomare's secret. Latias and Latios are a beautiful combination of tender love and charming style. Many people don't like the sounds they make but I personally reckon they're the cutest and most endearing sounds you'd wish your puppy makes more. Many of the ways this film is presented has implausibility and childish overtones but then again this is aimed at children before they go to high school. Animation and background art is superb and only a few steps behind Studio Ghbli. However the CGI is quite a nono they stand out and do not look all that natural at all. In my opinion this story has great style. It presents action that does not feel too forced and an emotional drama that did hit me when I was a little boy. Just the other day I suddenly thought of Pokmon and having a watch the nostalgia sounds wonderful sensations throughout your body. The soundtrack also fits well to this film's environment and gives it a great natural wonder. For dedicated Pokmon fans this film is actually slightly more disappointing due to the lack of Pokmon action. Ash doesn't use his Pokmon and gets magically saved by the Pokmon of Brock and Misty as they just so happen to find Ash in trouble in a city that spans a thousand streets and creeks. However Pokmon is a fun film for kids. It gives them that wonder that makes them wish to escape into an alternate universe and the voice acting and characterization does a fine job in conveying a story. Although the mums and daddies would snore before this film hits its first quarter Pokemon Heroes does its job and that's exactly what it should do.".

For example in the first movie during translation the entire plot was dumbed down and changed and a twenty minute sequence was deleted. 3. The names of the characters were changed in the English adaptations to appeal to younger audiences. Name of the main protagonist is Satoshi a normal Japanese name. But we got a boy called Ash. That is just epic fail.4. The names of the movies themselves were almost always changedfor the worst. This one was called Guardians of Altomare not Heroes. 5. The music in the original versions is very good. But in the dubs usually we get some really low quality stuff. 6. Don't complain that the whole Pokemon franchise is cockfighting. Don't say the concept is immoral. Remember that it came from Japan where they have a different view of the world. There friendly battles are considered a key to individual's growth Karate anyone?. We fight each other to win only to give a helping hand to the defeated opponent. That's not so hard to understand. 7. In the end Pocket Monsters Jap. name movies are great and should interest any anime fan out there.P.S. We should do something to stop animation in from being aimed towards small children only in the US. Teenagers and adults should be able to enjoy it too. American companies must leave the original music and plots intact to keep foreign animated movies interesting to us as they were originally made.".

If you are not a Pokmon fan anime fan or someone who is a fan of Japanese pop culture you will probably have a hard time enjoying this movie and there are some reasons why that I do agree with.First of all the introduction of the climax characters Latias and Latios came a little too early. One of my favorite parts of the movies is building the anticipation of seeing the special Pokmon later on in the movie. I believe the concept of Pokmon being able to adapt human forms is a cool concept and one that could have been very well expanded upon for this particular movie which would somewhat take care of the problem I found with the movie it's length. There is a lot of interesting work and content that would have made the movie longer and even more enjoyable.But on the other hand there were a lot of things about the movie I enjoyed. First of all I know that Jesse and James are starting to become irrelevant at this point but they do help provide comic relief and they are characters recognizable to all Pokmon fans. I enjoyed the CGI work done in the movie it was not top notch but it added a nice feel to the movie and it made the city of Alto Mare look quite nice. The storyline was only somewhat unique but the fact that it was being used in a Pokmon setting gave it a breath of fresh air.If your a Pokmon fan I recommend this movie for sure. If your a Pokmon hater I'm sorry but if you don't know much about the series which is sort of hard to believe unless your a parent maybe I would at least watch it to try and understand why your kids enjoy Pokmon and so you can be almost knowledgeable on the subject of Pokmon yourself.".

This is one of the best Pokemon movies I've ever seen so far.  I had this feeling that I must buy this movie. The best thing I really like about this movie is that the movie followed up on the plot perfectly. The song Oracion turned out to be a beautiful inspiration to me. The special effects in 3D turned out great.  best of all it had such a sad but cute happy ending to it. I totally disagree on how the star rating turned out to be. I think this movie deserves something better. I would give this movie an 8.5 star rating. From all the Pokemon movies that I've seen they have been starting to improve quite a bit. Great job! Keep up the good work!".

This is one of the best Pokemon movies I've ever seen so far.  I had this feeling that I must buy this movie. The best thing I really like about this movie is that the movie followed up on the plot perfectly. The song Oracion turned out to be a beautiful inspiration to me. The special effects in 3D turned out great.  best of all it had such a sad but cute happy ending to it. I totally disagree on how the star rating turned out to be. I think this movie deserves something better. I would give this movie an 8.5 star rating. From all the Pokemon movies that I've seen they have been starting to improve quite a bit. Great job! Keep up the good work!";

	schema:headline " A Great Addition to the Pokemon Movies";
	schema:reviewBody "With each new entry the Pokemon movie series seems to get a little better. While the first movie was just awful all of its sequels keep topping each other somehow. So Movie 10 The Rise of Darkrai may be the best one yet.After the introduction the movie literally starts out with a bang as the dragonlike legendary Pokemon Palkia and Dialga battle in some strange otherworldly dimension. After the scene ends but the battle doesn't the story goes over to Ash Brock and their new companion Dawn. They're on their way to Alamos Town to take part in a Pokemon tournament and see the sights in particular the SpaceTime Tower and the town's gardens. But strange things are happening and the mysterious ghostly Darkrai is being blamed. A local scientist says otherwise but a posse is formed to capture or destroy it. But before our heroes can resolve that crisis the battle between Dialga and Palkia spills into Alamos Town threatening to destroy it completely.The animation not surprisingly is very good and the best yet movements are quick and fluid while the CGI and regular animation are blend together pretty good. The plot moves along at a good pace keeping the action coming while slowing down at many of the right places.What I really like is that this time almost everyone helps out. Not only do the one shot characters and almost every Pokemon shown make themselves fairly useful it's a treat seeing Ash and Co.'s sidekick Pokemon play a decent role something that doesn't happen as often as it should. And it's rather refreshing seeing Dawn play the hero alongside Ash as I do tire of him saving the day in many of the movies even when other characters are given a lot of focus see Movie 9 Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea for a prime example.The downside? For starters if you've seen all the other movies in the series you'll have some deja vu. Pokemon The Movie 2000 Movie 2 and and Pokemon Destiny Deoxys Movie 7 quickly come to mind. And Dialga and Palkia's fighting will cause flashbacks of many Godzilla films. Also some might not like the new voice cast. While the cast from TAJ Productions ended up being something of an improvement over 4Kids the voice actors of DuArt are a slight step back.But despite its flaws which don't bother me too much this is the best Pokemon Movie yet. Can't wait to see what Movie 11 brings to the table.".

I thought it was good but for me there are some flaws that keep it from achieving greatness.The story is pretty good but it is weighed down by several clichs such as the perceived bad guy actually being the one who saved the girl years ago. There are some concepts that are rather interesting and the mythology of Dialga and Palkia is pretty cool.I liked Alice as a character but some of the other supporting characters are less appealing. There were a lot of stupid moments with Antonio and Baron Alberto is a total clich not to mention that the scenes where he became Lickilicki were occasionally painful to watch.I liked Darkrai a lot. He has quite a presence and is a compelling character. However it was pretty disappointing that he ended up being alive at the end because it kind of undid the impact of his heroic sacrifice. The real emotional sacrifices at the end of Latios and Latias and Lucario and the Mystery of Mew were part of what made them so great.Things got really good in the climax though. The battle between Dialga Palkia and Darkrai while Ash and Dawn trying to make it up the tower to tune the bells provided some real excitement and really elevated the film. By far one of the best climaxes in a Pokmon movie.In my opinion this is the most overrated Pokmon movie. It didn't do it for me the way 2 3 5 and 8 did. I would have probably considered it one of the best if a few things were fixed. It's still a good film though and it's certainly better than most of the later Pokmon movies. Well worth checking out for fans of the series.RATING B".

But this time its 2 Pokmon Dialga  Palkia who are battling and destroying the universe. Never fear Darkrai is here to save the day. Darkrai tries to stop them from battling but they always keep fighting. With the Yellow Rat and Ash helping however things get solved. Again.I found it rather pointless that somehow this battle was causing all of reality to disappear. And somehow the Pokmon fighting the disappearing universe slows it down.I am amazed that Ash hasn't grown up yet. And I am amazed that he has been kissed more than once when you look at all the films. But yet he doesn't do anything about it.As they say in Israel Next Year in Jerusalem!. I will watch the next one just because I can.Overall this was bad. Typical Pokmon. F";

The program is very tolerant of people's differences and celebrates everyone's unique talents. And I like the different Pokemon creatures and my son and I enjoy playing the N64 Pokemon Stadium 2 game together. He really enjoys explaining the different Pokemon to me as we play. I have a friend who runs tours at a local science museum using the Pokemon as a way to get the kids into natural history and sciences. It really sparks some of the children into learning more.That said the movies have been a different story. The first was a very dark movie and the second although better still had a strange apocalyptic undercurrent more typical of Japanese animation for older audiences. I missed the light hearted nature of the TV show. The new one is different the story is more suited to young audiences and it's mostly more coherent to adults who are with the young ones. Although the kids will have to explain some plot elements to you if you haven't kept up with the show. The film also has a much better story than the first two. There is still quite a bit of large scale fighting at the end but it's not the end of the world stuff of the first films.Do I recommend the film to regular audiences? No but I do suggest to parents that you don't make excuses to not take your child. This should not be the torture you may have experienced with the first two.".

The feature however is great.  Entei is now my second favorite character from these movies second only to Mewtwo.  Like Mewtwo Entei has a reason for doing what he does even if it is misguided.  Also he again like Mewtwo is one of the reasons why you must experience this film in the best sound system possible because his voice comes out of all the rear surround speakers. Ralph Schuckett does another good job with the musical score and the two songs I heard I LIKED.  I also liked the use of the little girl Molly and her imagination as the reason for the happenings and the inclusion of Ash's mom no doubt making this a more personal battle for Ash.  Oh yes the animation is quite nice best of the three and the action rarely lets up once it starts!No doubt some will bash this simply because it is Pokemon but all I can say is if you can get past Pikachu and Pichu TRY giving it a chanceeven if you know nothing about Pokemon you might still enjoy it.

The whole landscape was turned into ice and her home was a castle. The Unown created the legendary Entei who took the place of Molly's father. Ash Team Rocket and everyone else tries to convince Molly her world isn't real and she needs to get back into the real world.I really adored how innocent Molly was and how her parents loved her. She is my favorite pokemon movie character. Entei was well done and I liked his purple fire balls and the battle he had with Charizard. Great to see Charizard back by the way! It returned again when Ash was getting the Rising Badge from Clair in Master Quest but that's another story The computer animation with the Unown was nice as well. The crystal tower was good and it was kind of reminds me of Emerald City from The Wizard Of Oz. We also see Molly become older and the first animemovie appearences of Kingdra Teddihursa and Flaafy. Watch the credits and you'll see she got a real TeddihursaPikachu and Pichu was another good short with LOTS of interesting pokemon and allaround cuteness. Pokemon The Movie was pretty bad with the 2nd and 4th movies better and this WAY better. Go see it! You won't be sorry! A 910.".

As usual the short this time entitled Pikachu and Pichu is a throwaway.  Pikachu goes exploring the big city and meets up with the Pichu brothers cute little Pokemon who resemble Pikachu.  Together they have a series of misadventures mostly running from a large dog Pokemon named Hounddower.  This short serves only to introduce new Pokemon for the kids to get excited over.  What makes it worse is that the short's running time clocks in at a lengthy 22 minutes.  However if you can survive that you are in for a treat. The feature entitled The Spell Of The Unown begins with a young girl named Molly and her father reading a bedtime story.  We can see that the girl loves her father very much.  We soon learn that the father is a famous Pokemon researcher who is investigating the ancient Pokemon call Unown.  While escavating a temple where the remains of the Unown were found he mysteriously vanishes.When Molly learns about her fathers disappearance she sinks into a deep depression feeling that she is truely alone her Mother had also disappeared several years earlier.  Molly happens upon the remains of the Unown which resemble letters of the alphabet in her father's study.  She spells out the names Mama and Papa with the Unown and begins to cry.  The Unown come to life and give Molly the power to create her own dreamworld where she can have anything she wants.  She brings to life an ancient Pokemon called Entei to be her surrogate father and promptly begins to turn her house and the rest of the countryside into a magnificent crystal palace.  Enter Ash Misty Brock Team Rocket all those cute little Pokemon and some old friends and you have the beginnings to a great movie. This movie has a lot going for it.  The animation is well done the colors are exceptionally vibrant and even the American added CGI effects look much better in this as compared to the first two movies.  The story line in Pokemon 3 which borrows liberally from Star Trek Alice in Wonderland and The Neverending Story has a much more dark tone than the first two and feels more like an actual movie rather than an extended episode of the TV series.  It deals with such adult oriented issues as loss loneliness and depression.  However it is still perfectly suited for kids as there is no language and very minor cartoon violence. All in all Pokemon 3 is  a great movie to take your kids to or just to take yourself to if your in the mood for a great actionfantasy anime movie.  I give it an 810.".

To me the humor could have been left without as usual the sad scenes were not as tearjerking like in Pokemon 4Ever and the first movie and the action was watered down a bit than what it was in the first two. There was really nothing spectacular but every Pokemon lover has to know that it doesn't take a masterpiece to entertain because of course the Pokemon series aren't masterpieces but they still deliver great entertainment. The plot to this movie was that the new legendary Pokemon Entei in this movie was able to speak with his mind. He was guarding over this girl Molly for she believes he's her father. There's the Pokemon called the Unown who are causing chaos all across this little town in the mean time. This movie's plot sounds so corny and stupid but it's really not. This was a great film and anybody who's fans of the first two feature length films or Pokemon in general absolutely needs to see the third and fourth installments.".

The film does feel short though so additional scenes and increment of total running time would be nice because the story moves a little too fast in the beginning which may be confusing to those who are new to the Pokmon Universe. Thankfully the whole movie turns out an interesting fantasy dream. The visually pleasing animation and beautiful imagination would appeal the majority especially dreamers. There are also more action than before more variety of Pokmon and it is fun to watch. Ending this post I must mention that I certainly loved the animated short Pikachu  Pichu that comes with Spell of the Unown 2000. Featuring the Pichu Brothers and plenty of other second generation Pokmon it is super endearing and lighthearted! Their lively adventure makes the whole animated feature perfect!".

	schema:reviewBody "It still lacks the cinematic style from the first however it is a definite improvement from its predecessor. As always this is slightly biased as I am a massive fan of the franchise. A young girl who's father mysteriously disappears is left alone and sad. Through her sorrow the mysterious Unown feed off of this and grant her the ability to create a dream reality where she can find happiness but at a cost of destroying the world. Instantaneously you are thinking well that just sounds like the fable 'The Snow Queen' to which you are right. Substitute a snow castle for a crystal palace add in Pokmon and surreal dream manipulation and you are in for an imaginative adventure. The reason why I like this instalment the most is because it has a story that feels complete. It's creativity and rapid runtime way too short in my opinion makes for an emotional plot that revolves around the fear of loneliness. In order to keep this consistent with the franchise we have energetic Pokmon battles embedded within the narrative a corny pop song for the introductory credits I just despise them... and a childfriendly message about friends and family. Plenty of battles in this entry the most in the trilogy and all of them feel electrifying as the monsters fight to the sound of pounding electronic pop music. The final showdown between Charizard and Entei was well animated and chaotic. The sweetness and innocence that exhumes from Molly was a nice addition and the dream worlds she creates looked creative. The animation of the Unown to make them look 3D was terrible I hate it when animation includes 3D textures on a 2D background. The plot structure does start to become formulaic and after this entry the future of the series continues the trend of utilising a legendary Pokmon as the pivotal plot point of a story. Overall this third instalment rounds off the original trilogy in an creative and emotional way.".

In order to keep this consistent with the franchise we have energetic Pokmon battles embedded within the narrative a corny pop song for the introductory credits I just despise them... and a childfriendly message about friends and family. Plenty of battles in this entry the most in the trilogy and all of them feel electrifying as the monsters fight to the sound of pounding electronic pop music. The final showdown between Charizard and Entei was well animated and chaotic. The sweetness and innocence that exhumes from Molly was a nice addition and the dream worlds she creates looked creative. The animation of the Unown to make them look 3D was terrible I hate it when animation includes 3D textures on a 2D background. The plot structure does start to become formulaic and after this entry the future of the series continues the trend of utilising a legendary Pokmon as the pivotal plot point of a story. Overall this third instalment rounds off the original trilogy in an creative and emotional way.";

This was a great Pokmon film for several reasons not the least of which is it being a darker and stranger adventure than usual.The plot involves a little girl named Molly who lost her parents and is granted wishes by the unknown. She now lives in her strange little world with Entei as her father. Entei captures Ash's mother to grant her wish to have a mother.The story is more serious than you would expect from Pokmon and the film benefits from it. The sense of tragedy was there as you could really feel for Molly. Of course it was also quite personal for Ash.The weird dreamworld Ash and the gang go through is very strange and gives the film a surreal quality. The whole film takes place in virtually one setting but they really manage to make it work.The Pokmon battles were top notch. The battle between Charizard and Entei in particular is one of the best and most nailbiting battles ever in the series.The ending where Molly finally comes to her senses and is reunited with her real parents during the end credits is very moving and the music is as good as you could expect.This is about on par with Pokmon 2000. Both are great for different reasons. The dark tone of the movie might not appeal to younger fans of the series but for older fans it really is a standout.RATING A".

If you hate Pokmon and your insist on down voting go do it on 7 or 8 where everything is bright cheery linear Hollywood garbage. This is beautiful.The story isn't complex but it's much more layered then other animated films. The colors are beautiful and the animation is very well done with tastefully placed CG but mostly wonderfully detailed classic animation. The story contains good lessons about faith and family. The battle scenes are long and epic. The style is so dark and artistic that it's simply a treat for the eyes.My only complaints come with some the dialog being a little cheesy and that it's way to short. The feature itself is only 70 min With more time they could have gone more places and really developed the characters and story arcs more. But all in all a wonderful film defiantly among the best of the Pokemon series and among my favorite anime films of all time. A must see for all young people anime fans Pokmon fans and anyone with a general interest in animated film! 1010 as far as Pokmon is concerned".

Now I know its the main part that she bends the world to her will as her father died and she never knew her mother. But for me that never quite did it. She just ended up annoying me. Entri also REALLY annoyed me carm down dear irmalicious your getting a little annoyed over a cartoon you probably haven't watched for the best of five years anyway couldn't the unknown created a better father figure? I mean kidnapping Ashs Mom Delia was probably not the smartest thing to do. After seeing Ash and his trusty crew save the Pokmon world wouldn't be the smartest thing to do. It would be like kicking a rhino in the backside. Also Entri sounded liked a microphone!Not a bad movie for a Pokmon fan.

	schema:headline " As we bid a fond farewell to our favorite voice actors we are left with this...";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a review of the latest in the long lasting line of feature films that have spawned off the widely recognized Pokemon franchise. How does it stack up against its Pokemonmovie brethren and against other movies in general? Let's find out shall we? When we start up the movie we are introduced to the kingdom of Orudoran some centuries previous to main character Ash's time. A cataclysmic war has broken out across the barren landscape one that threatens to destroy the kingdom. We are also introduced to Sir Aaron and his Pokemon apprentice Lucario. The main premise of the film builds off of the events that take place in its first few minutes that is Sir Aaron tells Lucario that he is forever abandoning the kingdom never to return and imprisons the confused Pokemon inside of his crystal staff.After the opening title we jump ahead a few hundred years where Ash and his sidekick pals are attending a festival at Orudoran palace held every year in honor of the legendary guardian Sir Aaron. Wait what? Yeah you see the legend held at this point in time suggests that Sir Aaron was able to find some way to stop the war that would have otherwise destroyed the place. Our young hero Ash accidentally provokes the sealed Lucario enough for it to emerge from the preserved crystal staff altogether and as you may expect it is very confused to have awakened so many years later. The body of the film consists of Ash's journey to a fossilized wonder called the Tree of Beginning where Pikachu had been taken by the ever popular Mew.The story itself is fresh and welcome to the series on all accounts. There are some well choreographed twists and a convincingly apocalyptic scene that builds up to the movie's sincerely touching conclusion. If you can stomach another painfully lengthened Pokemon remorse scene similar but thankfully about a quarter as long as the one found near the end of the first movie this is a magnificent story befitting the world of Pokemon quite well.A large part of appeal an anime gets is determined by how it presents itself graphically. Lucario is a monumental upgrade in terms of... well everything in terms of animation really for the series including previous feature films. The graphical presentation is astounding with detailed smooth character animation fantastic background images and some neat effects. By far the biggest update to the scene is the broader use of 3D rendering which is used widely from moving 3D models of people to rendering full 3D environments. Near the beginning we are treated to a scene where a Tailow a small bird Pokemon is flying around a fully 3D rendered Orudoran castle. The blending of 2D handdrawn anime and 3D rendering effects is crisp and clean and it works very well with the show. With as much as is used it never feels like overkill.The movie's soundtrack is equally intriguingly abovepar. A full orchestra provides a stunning array of background music and makes this seem like an authentic medieval adventure. Good composition and orchestration all around and it really adds to the experience to hear it loud. You'll want to turn your volume up for this one. Sound effects are also very well choreographed with animationmatching foot steps and the like. There are as well some novelties in the sound department the obvious of which are the vocations of Regirock Regice and Registeel. These will send shivers down your pants and get my vote for producing the first truly out of this world sound from a Pokemon I've ever heard. I'm going to reiterate about the soundtrack I liked it so much I imported the CD from Japan. It's that good.The acting is... well Pokemon. These are all the old voice actors so you know pretty much what to expect. I will say to newcomers of Pokemon that these actors are truly excellent. Especially in this feature it seems as though they gave an extra little something and the screenplay seems to have been thought of to a greater extent than previous feature attempts as well. Ikue Ootani pulls off an extremely believable crying Pikachu here which must have been hard to do and from all fronts you'll receive top notch performances by Taylor Lillis Stuart and Blaustein Meowth. A very enjoyable English dub.This film establishes itself as a children's adventure but there are some sincerely touching moments and some real laughs along the way. I know I'm not the only one who lowers my head and shakes it when Brock goes hopelessly head over heels for the series's next pretty girl and at one point near the end I broke out in laughter when Ash catches long separated Pikachu in his arms. A euphoric cry of delight turns slowly into a pleading yell of despair as he realizes that he is falling down a chasm of indiscernible height. Things like that make this an already good package even better.Overall Lucario and the Mystery of Mew is an excellent endeavor by Pikachu Project. I wasn't sure what to expect but I sure as hell wasn't expecting this and that's what made it even more special. It may be a little on the childish side granted but don't let that keep you from watching this film. You see that 810 score up at the top of the page? That's not comparing this movie to other Pokemon films. That's comparing it to the world. And you know what? It deserves that. It deserves that all the way. This is a great children's film to begin with sure but after adding a thought out story a memorable soundtrack and a wonderful cast performing their roles with perfection you have a masterpiece in animation. I give Pokemon Lucario and the Mystery of Mew a well deserved 9 out of 10 A.".

In the original they made Lucario sound like a noblemedieval sensitive ninja which he is but in the dub they made him sound like a constantly angry monster. Lucario is no monster! He has feelings too! Anyways if you've ever liked anything about Pokmon or are willing to give it a try then I highly suggest you watch this movie.But alas even though it is fantastic it is still relatively immature and is nowhere near as deep as some other movies.".

I was a little curious as to why the main theme I'm Unbeatable was postponed until twenty minutes into the movie but it went well with that particular scene.

Computer generated images and sceneries blend seamlessly with the twodimensional artwork and create a fantastic effect and feeling. The music is amazing. Shinji Miyazaki truly went all out with his score for this movie. To see what I mean check this out httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vZmhN4UlfkhUfeaturerelatedThe score is far superior to what one would ever expect to find in an animated movie and lends a great part to my above rating. Now this movie was the last act of the English voice actors of the series and they really put something special into this film that has been previously unseen from them. They certainly went out in style.The story is also solid and enjoyable. There is clear character development and the dialogue and pacing is just right. However one point I must whine about is Lucario's voice actor. He is meant to sound much more mysterious but since the actor did a good job I can't really complain that much. Sure the movie is somewhat childish but it's Pokmon and I for one enjoyed it even though I am above Pokemon's target age. This film is superior to all other Pokemon movies in my opinion and I highly suggest you see it. It is truly epic.".

Both films have similar elements that make them great.This film has one of the more engrossing story lines in the series. Ash and the gang meet Lucario and travel to the Tree of Beginnings to find answers regarding his master Sir Aaron betraying Lucario and to find Pikachu who had been captured by Mew.Lucario is a nicely developed character and his relationship with Ash was very well played out. It was also nice that the AshPikachu dynamic was toyed with. It was a good way to raise the steaks.Like Heroes there are times when this film feels reminiscent of a Miyazaki picture. The Tree of Beginnings was a very imaginative setting and the backstory behind it is intriguing.The action and chaos taking place at the Tree of Beginnings is some of the most exciting the Pokmon series has ever done. The climax where Lucario saves the tree and sacrifices himself is not only thrilling but also filled with pure emotion. He is then reunited with Sir Aaron who was the hero after all.Another thing Kidd was a pretty cool character and We will meet again is another great song.A great film that deserves its praise from the Pokmon fans. This and Heroes are my two favorites of the series because they combine great story lines and emotion along with the fun and adventure you expect from Pokmon. This is an absolute mustsee for all Pokmon fans.RATING A".

The story was very genuine and one that resonated on a personal level with me.Pokemon is childish I'll admit but I truly believe that adds to some of the power that certain scenes have. You really don't expect these kinds of things to happen and when they do it hits you much harder than you would think.This particular title adds a lot of history to the Pokemon universe and is definitely a mustwatch for any Pokemon fan. My only qualm with it was the part that Mew played in it. It felt somewhat detached from The First Pokemon Movie almost to the point that it had me believing there is more than one Mew especially with the number of times that the characters said a Mew? as though it wasn't THE Mew. However that is forgivable because the story animation and dubbed voice acting was all completely on point!1010 would recommend to any Pokemon fan hardcore or otherwise! Expect tears!".

This movie has a very confusing plot with way to many subplots. Too many things have to be introduced in a world where a lot of things are already hard to accept. The movie could even be the same even without Pokmon in it. It has absolutely nothing to do with the games and barely something to do with the TVseries. But if you consider it to be independent it is not a movie that shows many new things. A lot has been seen in other better anime movies. Pokmon already has an interesting world that can be explored. It can show great action in Pokmon battles. Non of that is shown in the movie. Battles are only shown shortly in the beginning. Also every Pokmon movie seems to rely on telepathy. I would like to see a movie that is expressive enough to let Pokmon be able to not speak. Overall a movie that is watchable but only a mustwatch at the utmost for very young Pokmon fans.".

However after that it begins to go down hill and becomes another advanced generation episode with the same old paperthin immature predictable plot annoying characters like Max and May and same old thirdrate pop songs from the show. I did like the animation though and how Lucario had to understand humans but with the inclusion of Mew it kind of lost its umph. I only recommend renting it to see what it is like.

	schema:reviewBody "Lucario and the Mystery of Mew 2005 sets in a charming medieval themed location named Rota. It has a special adventure and a balanced mixture of fantasy history nature and science. They are exactly what makes the animated feature unique but they could be interpreted in different ways.I personally feel Lucario and the Mystery of Mew 2005 has one of the best Pokmon backstory and concept but it's a little confusing in terms of plot. Let me explain why as brief as possible.With spoiler minimised at first it is Lucario's story but then it shift the focus to the villainwhoisactuallynotavillain who is hunting down Mew. After that the focus is on searching missing Pokmon. Nature comes in naturally as the plot progresses but all of the sudden at one point it feels like as if the whole plot turned into a scifi horror. It's not really scary it's pretty interesting in fact due to the science elements but well too much focus change!There are a lot of flashbacks throughout the animated feature and there are several different types of relationship story going on too. It's not a big deal I guess since there are plenty of unique characters and a lot of other fantasy going on. With all that Pokmon and the newly introduced spiritual energy Aura which is the essence of every living creature as they have said it to me all these sure seems to be a great effort but it feels confusing even though I get the story in the end.In the end I feel that the results of the efforts are less effective and there are plenty of other minor issues as well but I do not want to be too analytical since this is not a movie analysis! No fun isn't it if the review is all criticism?Now what is great about Lucario and the Mystery of Mew 2005 are the Pokmon stories themselves. They are super cool and cute. For instance Mew who was once an extremely rare Pokmon which supposedly almost no one have ever seen it before in present Pokmon time shows more of her true playful behavior and her many transformations. There is cosplay involved in this one as well Pikachu is even dressed up for a while! Pikachu also seems to be much more animated or much more himself compared the previous Pokmon films and just like the TV anime series as his sweet personality does stand out here. Last but not least Lucario's story is unusually interesting and the sight of the Legendary Titans Regirock Regice and Registeel are also amazing! I can't be spoiling it for you you have to watch it yourself!If you are easily moved there are several touching scenes that would make you tear a little. I guess ultimately this is Pokmon's shot at something different than all of its previous films a special adventure with a balanced mixture of fantasy history nature and science!".

Dennis Hopper plays one of his best sleazes ever. Viggo Mortenson is great as Hopper's mindless attack dog. The story deals with a Secret Service sting gone bad. One agent is killed and Wesley Snipes Agent goes about finding out who did it. What I liked about this movie was that it was smart. The author did some great research and that was reflected in the movie. You see it in the dialog and you see it in the story. Moreover the acting was first rate with many talented performers acting at the top of their trade. Ignore the bogus reviews. What I think happened is that the movie did poorly at the theaters. There is this misconception that failure at the box office is an indication of a bad movie wrong! Plenty of good movies bomb and plenty of terrible movies do well some even win the Academy. Good story good performances and good movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I skimmed through the other reviews about this film and it's unbelievable that none of them made mention to To Live and Die in L.A.. First of all both films were based on novels written by former Secret Service agent Gerald Petievich and if you look closer the plots are very similar there's a whole police investigation on a dangerous counterfeiter then there's the death of an undercover agent and his partner will revenge his death doing whatever it takes to get the bad guy. And once again it's all criminals doing fake money and spreading all over...Los Angeles!But the thing Boiling Point doesn't imitate from Friedkin's movie is the quality the surprises the plot twists. And there's so much life in that movie that it's really difficult to make something so close to it. Not to mention that Warner changed the game and edited down the film in order to generate a bigger hit after their success with another movie with Wesley Snipes who plays the hero in this one. Maybe this could be a different kind of film with an unusual approach on the villains played by Dennis Hopper in one of his best efforts I must say and the then unknown Viggo Mortensen who plays one of the most deadly and mean guys I've ever seen as the original project conceived by directorwriter James B. Harris was.Most people don't like comparisons but it's hard not to. One must compare to have a full idea of what's going on. The main difference between To Live and Die in L.A. and this in terms of plot is that the bad guy is quite sympathetic despite his frightening looks and his strange yet confident walk. We kind of trust this guy because there's worse guys than him people of whom he owns a lot of money. We look at him thinking he might kill someone just to get what he wants but no he refuses to do so even when we're sure he's about to do it. Willem Dafoe in To Live... was a real artist who used of his kraft to be a criminal but he was also a unmerciful stone cold killer. What connects both films is one character named Max Waxman here played by Jonathan Banks a corrupt lawyer who meets his fate in the other movie. Boiling Point is a fine movie although a little bit dated more dramatic than what's not supposed to be. The few action scenes the engrossing tension built in all the business transactions scenes worth the view just as seeing the good cast giving solid performances. Dan Hedaya Paul Gleason Lolita Davidovich Seymour Cassel Tobin Bell James Tolkan made the show very enjoyable. Entertaining but only just another average picture. 710".

Dennis Hopper is fantastic as the sleaze ball and i really liked the gritty location plus it was quite thrilling in some places!. However it does have a couple dull spots and i felt it could have been a lot better then above average as it didn't take advantage of it's vast potential however it's still an above average Cop thriller that's enjoyable to watch and one that will keep you interested. Wesley Snipes is extremely charismatic and it also had a great supporting cast as well plus i wish Paul Gleason had more then 1 scene. Wesley and Lolita Davidovich had good chemistry together and i thought the finale was quite exciting plus it usually keeps you guessing with only a few predictable moments here and there. This is an above average cop thriller with fantastic performances and a story that keeps you interested and i say it's well worth the watch!. The Direction is good. James B. Harris does a good job here with good camera work good angles and keeping the film at a pretty good pace. There is a tiny bit of blood. We get a bloody corpse blood and quite a few bloody gunshot wounds. The Acting is awesome. Wesley Snipes is AMAZING as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable fantastic in the acting department is very charismatic had good chemistry with Lolita Davidovichwas quite intense an just did an amazing job overall! Snipes Rules!!. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as always and is fantastic as the sleaze ball his character is quite pathetic but he did such a good job of portraying it this man can play anything! i loved him Hopper Rules!. Lolita Davidovich is very hot and quite sexy and did a great job here she had good chemistry with Snipes and did a good acting job as well wished she had more screen time though. Viggo Mortensen is excellent as Hopper's partner his character was very interesting and he was quite spiffy overall i liked him lots. Seymour Cassel and Jonathan Banks do well in there small roles. Christine Elise is extremely cute and did fine with what she had to do also wished she had more screen time. Paul Gleason is fantastic in his 1 scene however he should have been used for more then that!. Dan Hedya does what he has to do adequately and had okay chemistry with Snipes. Rest of the cast do okay. Overall well worth the watch!.  out of 5".

The viciousness of the deadline did not seem to serve the greed that should have been the main motivation of the gangster who was owed 50 thousand. If he had the money and wasn't paying up then the viciousness would have served a purpose.Other than that small plot point I thought Dennis Hopper was brilliant and the relationship between him and the murdering thief kept me on the edge of my seat as I thought that at any moment the hitman would find out he was being used or conned. But Dennis Hopper laid down a sweet story each time.Leslie Snipes did a fine job as a Cop. And I liked the Duo he had with his partner of ex Cheers Fame.".

If the plot had thrown more twists offered more insight on the characters psyche or had a much more involving story the movie could have sufficed even as a decent thriller. Had there been explosives chase scenes and other good action ploys this movie could've made a decent action film. However it is not much of either category thus suffering from mediocrity.Police detective Jimmy Mercer Wesley Snipes and his partner Brady Dan Hedaya are investigating the shooting death of an undercover U.S. Treasury agent who investigating a counterfeit ring. The two guys who he was dealing with gunned him down and fled the scene before Mercer and Brady could intervene and save their partner. Mercer and Brady don't know who the two men were but spend the remainder of the movie looking for him.Actually they are fasttalking Red Diamond Dennis Hopper so named because of his red hair. He owes fifty grand to another gangster within seven days. He and his partner Ronnie Viggo Mortensen an eerie kind of guy who is never sure if Red is just handing him a line of garbage with all the schemes he involves him in. Although for Ronnie he would have no problem shooting Red. Why Ronnie remains faithful to him at all given Red's consistent failures is beyond me. These two guys need a get rich quick counterfeit scheme.Meanwhile Mercer and Brady are going from one informant to another trying to get them to give up information about Red and Ronnie a description their location anything. Sometimes they're successful and sometimes not. The movie goes on and on like as the two trail one person after another trying to get close on the trail of Red and Ronnie. It is wholly uninteresting offering no real suspense and even less action to fill the time. The movie fails to deliver any real substance in between which is sad when you consider the possibility of your characters and especially the potential of the actors.".

A documentary about real boiling points would've had more thrills than this wannabe actioner.Almost nothing about this movie made me want more. Wesley Snipes put on an okay performance but nothing more than marginal. Dennis Hopper acted weird the whole movie with overexaggerated hand movements that made his character very offputting. Except for a few killings there was literally no action in this movie. The story could've been interesting but instead it moves slow and lags at many places. The cinematography was nothing interesting no better than any other average movie. And the script was dull and didn't move the story at all.Overall this movie was well beyond average not Snipes best at all. Even The Art of War and we all want to forget he was in that wasn't as bad as this movie. This movie has already found its way to giveaway shelves and .99 bins all over the country.

	schema:reviewBody "Maddeningly pointless violence is what killed off martial arts movies in the 1980s. Bruce Lee it cannot be argued is the singular individual who opened our eyes to the beauty of martial arts with his movies in the early 1970s. Bruce Lee's stories unlike those in the same genre that followed him would have a slow buildup to a great fight towards the end of the movie. This is why his movies remain the standard of great martial arts movies to this day. The fate of subsequent generation of martial arts movies lavishly crowded with violence is now threatening Hollywood productions because of gratuitous depiction of violence.Take a step back and consider both the first and second parts of the Godfather trilogy arguably the best storyline ever put into film! What makes The Godfather so appealing is its depiction of implied rather than expressed violence. Truly! The director Francis Ford Coppola would later disclose that he and the script writer Mario Puzo were under tremendous pressure from the producers of the first movie to add more violence to the script or he Coppola risked being fired from completing the directing the movie. Those who have read the original novel by Puzo would agree that the book on which the story was based is much more suspenseful and entertaining than the movie even with less violence.So it is that a great movie is not so much about the amount of TNT pyrotechnics blood and gore that are freely depicted but much more about the story of ordinary guys in this case crooks and law enforcers whose actions and plots are motivated by the mundane things in life that we can all relate to such as strained interpersonal relationships debts deadlines job insecurity as in the case of the two police officers in this storyetc. which make up the story  a great story in my opinion.To me this is a great movie told with measured and tamed violence. Granted that the story it aimed to tell should have been accompanied by other parallel stories crisscrossing the main plot over an added 30 minutes or so because at approximately 90 it came up too short for a good time frame.The cast is great Dennis Hopper Seymour Cassel Lolita Davidovich Viggo Mortensen and of courseWesley Snipes who radically departs from the portrait of the apostle of gore like in the Blade trilogy earlier. The character played by Mr. Snipes is one we can all relate to and thus immerse ourselves in the story for maximum entertaining pleasure. Each one of the listed actors gave a betterthanaverage performance to make this movie one I expect to watch a few more times. The soundtrack is great.".

However if you're looking for some lower key but interesting character development juxtaposed with a cops vs. hoods scenario with a fairly linear plot line then you may like this.The character development is done in a somewhat parallel fashion where each of the principals is shown in the light of his dysfunctional relationship with his significant other. It is in this light that we see the cops and the hoods looking not at all dissimilar with respect to their personal lives. This adjunct to the melodrama in the story although not entirely original embellishes the overall plot and entertains as well as some good lines flow freely in these scenes.All the actors render justice to their roles especially the swaggering highstepping redheaded Dennis Hopper whose nostalgialaced alter ego to his criminal self finds solace and peace on the Palace Ballroom dance floor. Also I found Wesley Snipes to be in good form here as he displays a nicely rounded range of emotions and the acting maturity to give credence to his character. He is mellower yet still very cunning and direct in this role than in many of his prior melodramatic offerings.Lastly I would be remiss not to include the Danny May Orchestra and singers for the lush harmonies and melodies and the overall mood that act as a fitting counterpoint to the criminal goingson perfectly set up in the opening sequences where the tune Dream was played behind the nighttime L.A. skyline.

I am not sure when it will be open to the public but I hope it can come out in a notsodistant future because it's definitely a must see. Rebelle is not for everyone. It's hard to watch and may be too much for some. But what's so terrible about this film isn't what is shown. It's what isn't. The story is about a 14 yearold girl telling her story to her unborn baby before giving birth. It spans the two years preceding the opening of the film when the girl was abducted from her village by the rebel army and turned into a child soldier. As every step something terrible happens. But somehow leaving the theatre you simply know that in real life it may have been even more horrible. I won't spoil anything but as you can imagine as she lives with the rebel army she is forced to do unspeakable things. She is somewhat protected by the leader as he believes her to be a witch. Throughout the film she has visions of the ghosts of people killed by the rebel army including her own parents. It doesn't seem unrealistic or made up. It makes the film just this more bearable to watch as we're let into the mind of a child and her ways of coping with the events around her. She befriends another kid believed to have special powers a boy barely older than she is. As their relationship evolves you find yourself within their own personal haven their escape from the atrocities of the life they are forced to live. You understand why child soldiers do what they do how a human being can be turned to commit inhumane crimes. From their adventure together you will laugh at times and cry at others. It's really hard to write about this film without giving away anything. All the emotions you will feel watching time come from the characters around the kids and the small things that happen to them that give them the strength to go on. The 'butcher' may be the best character in the film. His kindness to the children his understanding of what they have been though and his acceptance of what they have become is incredibly touching. It's a tough film. A beautiful film. A film that stays with you long after you've seen it. Most of the actors hired had never acted before but they are all fantastic. Rachel Mwanza in particular is unforgettable. I hope she goes on to have a brilliant career because she was fantastic. If ever you have an opportunity to see Rebelle take it. You won't regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I learned about this film War Witch because it was nominated for the Oscar in Best Foreign Language Film. It is in French and was submitted by Canada. It is not an easy movie to watch. It chronicles two years in the life of a female child warrior in civil wartorn Africa.Set in an unspecified African village and country Komona is a 12 year old girl who was forcibly abducted by rebels to be a child warrior among many other children in her village. She had a unique talent of seeing spirits of the dead which gave her the distinction of being a War Witch and thus a sacred member of their band of rebels. Despite this she would still live a harrowing life of constant violence and anguish. This would be interrupted by an interlude of love but sadly it would not last too long. We hear the story in Komona's point of view so we can share in her very thoughts through her narrations. Young Rachel Mwanza bravely and compellingly played Komona. We literally see her face age from the first time we see her on screen to her final scene. We see a child forced to mature beyond her years in the most brutal ways possible. As you watch this you will be thankful you do not lead Komona's tortured existence. The direction screenplay cinematography and makeup of this film are outstanding. The depiction of the dead spirits Komona sees are very effective in its simplicity. This film succeeds to bring the heretofore unknown hell as experienced by children in warravaged Africa into the consciousness of the rest of the world. Are you ready to see this hell?".

Despite this she would still live a harrowing life of constant violence and anguish. This would be interrupted by an interlude of love but sadly it would not last too long. We hear the story in Komona's point of view so we can share in her very thoughts through her narrations. Young Rachel Mwanza bravely and compellingly played Komona. We literally see her face age from the first time we see her on screen to her final scene. We see a child forced to mature beyond her years in the most brutal ways possible. As you watch this you will be thankful you do not lead Komona's tortured existence. The direction screenplay cinematography and makeup of this film are outstanding. The depiction of the dead spirits Komona sees are very effective in its simplicity. This film succeeds to bring the heretofore unknown hell as experienced by children in warravaged Africa into the consciousness of the rest of the world. Are you ready to see this hell?";

	schema:headline " Sensitive realistic character study drama";
	schema:reviewBody "We are rebels. Respect your guns. They're your new mother and father.War Witch also known as Rebelle is a Canadian film directed by Kim Nguyen that has been nominated for this year's Academy Awards for best foreign picture. It is an enlightening film about the horrors that some children have to face in Africa when kidnapped by rebel forces. Nguyen who also wrote the screenplay did it in a very sensitive manner without relying on melodramatic or shocking moments. This is more of a sensitive drama focusing on a character study of a young girl's life when forced to kill her parents and join a rebel army. The harsh and violent reality of her life is softened by her innocence and supernatural mystic powers. The film combines these two elements in such a way that it makes the movie a much lighter and pleasant viewing experience. The addition of a sweet love story between her and one of the kids in the rebel army is what balances out the ultra realistic violence in her world with a touch of magical romantic moments such as the search for the white rooster which gives the movie a much more lighter touch in midst of all the drama. The performance from Rachel Mwanza feels so real and authentic that it makes the film work as we see how this innocent girl's life changes as she becomes a woman in the midst of war. War Witch wouldn't have worked if it weren't for her unique portrayal of this character. This is a powerful film because there is no denying these things are happening in real life and we need to put an end to this senseless brutality. Kim Nguyen does a great job with the direction of this film by adding some unique touches in the sound department and the cinematography works really well. The movie takes place in an undisclosed country in Africa where Komona Rachel Mwanza a young 14 year old pregnant girl decides to tell her unborn child the story of her life. When she was 12 rebel forces raided her village and forced her and other children to murder their parents and join them. They were all given guns and prepared to fight for the Grand Tigre Royal Mizinga Mwinga. She was the only child from her village to survive an early encounter against government army forces after being warned by the ghosts of her parents to run. After this she was considered to be a War Witch due to her mystical powers. She befriends another boy from the rebel army who is also considered to have some sort of mystical powers and is known as the Magician Serge Kanyinda. Together they decide to run away and hide at the Magician's uncle's home. He is known as the butcher Ralph Prosper and is very kind to the young kids who fall in love with each other. The Magician asks Komona to marry him and she says that she can only marry him if he finds her a white rooster which is extremely rare to find in that country. Despite the pleasant life she seems to be living the ghosts still torment her and after a brief moment of peace the rebels are back again to haunt her. Will Komona ever find peace in this senseless and brutal society she's living in?War Witch is only about 90 minutes long which was perfect because it could have gotten heavy handed if Nguyen had decided to expand the screenplay more. I really enjoyed that he decided to include this world of superstition in the midst of all the violence because it is a great part of the African culture which is left out sometimes. Despite the violent world in which Komona was introduced too she also was able to find love although it was short lived. Nguyen found a perfect balance between this horrific world and the magical romantic one that Komona lived in. This will not win the Oscar because Amour is a lock at this point but it still is a unique film that is worth checking out if you 're into foreign films. I really enjoyed this film although I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. It isn't groundbreaking but is worth seeing for the story and performances alone.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

The movie details the horrors she subsequently faced from the ages of 12 to 14.On her first mission as a child soldier the ghosts of her parents appear to warn her of an impending ambush from government forces. The leader of the rebels named the Grand Tiger anoints her as his war witch due to her supernatural powers which can help them in combat.

When Magician warns Komona that the Grand Tiger has killed the last three war witches she agrees to run off with him and escape the rebel forces. With their bond deepening Magiciain asks Komona to marry him but her father had told her that he must present to her a white rooster before any wedding can take place. This becomes an interesting and rather touching part of the story as Magician tries to find her the extremely rare fowl. Komona eventually marries Magician and becomes pregnant with his child.I won't go into more plot details as I'll leave them to the viewer. However I will say that the rebels come looking for their war witch and that Komona must resort to increasingly desperate and brutal measures to try and save herself and her baby.In summary despite the film being difficult to watch at times with its' starkly depicted violent realism I found it to be well worth hanging in there. The powerful performances writing and direction made it a movie that stayed with me long after it was over.".

The unintended consequence of these shocking images presented for the heartfelt purpose of raising awareness is this the single story. We have a few images serving as one generic story representing an entire continent of countries and cultures.The complexities variations and even just the common middleclass everyday lives that exist in African countries are reduced to this single story of starving wartorn people waiting for the rest of the world to save them by donating a few dollars or by buying a buy one give one pair of Toms shoes.War Witch embodies the single story that many Westerners think of the country of Africa because we simply meld all African countries together into one homogeneous wartorn state. In fact War Witch doesn't even differentiate which country or war the story represents. The setting is simply Africa. The Beauty of War Witch As I watched the first few scenes of the film the tragedy of the child soldier story quickly become apparent as the movie's story. I was initially disappointed as it is a story with which I'm already familiar. Luckily the beauty of this film's simplicity also became apparent. Without much dialogue we as an audience were able to suspend our disbelief and appreciate the supernatural aspects of the story as a child's attempt to cope with the tragedies she faces. We watch as she deals with death separation and heartbreak while she is haunted by ghosts of her parents. The ghosts aren't cheesy nor are they scary they are simply haunting reminders that the soul of the main character is not at rest.While the child conveys strength through each atrocity she faces we as an audience are reminded by the white ghosts that she is not at ease. Title slides appear at different moments throughout the film and denote our young protagonist's ages throughout the film 12 13 and 14 years old. Displaying her age rather than a date and time reminds us of the innocence robbed as we travel with the main character through her struggles as she forces tears back into her eyes. Were it not for these displays of her age we would forget that the strength shown by the young woman is actually shown by a child. Nguyen excels at reminding the audience of this in portraying the child's coping mechanisms through supernatural visions and at having us witness tragedy without astoundingly gory scenes that while they may be more accurate would distract from our journey with the child.Visit aMovieaCountryaJourney.com for more.".

	schema:headline " A TooShort Look At Child Soldiers";
	schema:reviewBody "Kim Ngyen's Rebelle is everything that a Canadian film should be a confident nonAmerican distinctly Canadian look at the world around us. Ngyen's film succeeds in presenting vignettes of what a war child is presumed to go through the indoctrination through brutalization clinging to an immature version of humanity whilst expected to do very adult things and ultimately trying to exit the soldier's life and find a life of normalcy. The magnificent Rachel Mwanza is the absolute centre of the film richly deserving her Canadian Film Award as best actress delivering far more depth of performance through her expressive face than delivering any of Nguyen's dialogue. It is incredible that a young woman of 13 can portray all of the experiences her character undergoes including the rigours of childbirth. I hope that she is allowed to appear in more films a major world talent. The film was made in the Democratic Republic of Congo for a reputed 3.5 million. The actors are local though the film never indicates what country it is set in so as to better represent the African whole I expect. While not the film's fault it is disheartening to see yet another film about Africa that presents the continent and its people as wholly dysfunctional. Yes there are conflicts bad governments poverty blood diamonds and child soldiers BUT there is also everyday life beautiful cultures and struggles of 'people just like us'...just trying to get by day to day. Where the film falters I think is in trying to have or at least imply a happy ending for Mwanza's protagonist. After undergoing what she goes through it is difficult to believe that she has the inner resilience to return to a normal 'teenage'life let alone one of motherhood. PTSD has a way of rendering impossible functional relationships. Also as noted in my review title the film is much too short. I was reminded of Apocalypse Now in the themes that Nguyen deaves into and I think REBELLE needed Apocalypse's length. Maybe we will eventually get 'Rebelle' REDUX. Note to the Producers the film is a Canadian film not a product of the Nation of Quebec. So do not put Quebec as the country of origin on the DVD case. You took Canadian tax dollars to make the film and submitted it to the American Academy of Film Arts as the official Canadian entry. I am proud that Rebelle is a Canadian film IN French one of our two official languages.".

Note to the Producers the film is a Canadian film not a product of the Nation of Quebec. So do not put Quebec as the country of origin on the DVD case. You took Canadian tax dollars to make the film and submitted it to the American Academy of Film Arts as the official Canadian entry. I am proud that Rebelle is a Canadian film IN French one of our two official languages.";

	schema:headline " Disturbing and gripping expos of child soldiers in Central Africa";
	schema:reviewBody "'War Witch' is set somewhere in central Africa but no particular country is identified. It's by a Canadianbased writer Kim Nguyen who has a proffered up a most harrowing and disturbing tale of the abduction of a 12 year old girl by a band of criminals who call themselves 'rebels' and how they transform this girl and other children into armed and vicious soldiers.The film begins with an unbearably difficult scene to watch. Komona the protagonist played by the very talented newcomer Rachel Mwanza is forced to kill her own parents and later she and other abducted children are issued AK47s where they're forced to fight government soldiers who are pursuing them.An albino childsoldier Magician gives Komona a tree sap that induces hallucinatory visions. Throughout the film Komona has visions of her murdered parents painted all in white. Early on she escapes from the government soldiers after she's warned by these visions of her parents. Due to this escape the leader of the socalled 'rebels' Great Tiger declares her a 'war witch' and none of Great Tiger's soldiers are allowed to whip Komona. Nonetheless she still is forced to dig for coltan a metallic ore which is considered one of the blood minerals which these roving gangs of criminals are fighting over.At a certain point Komona runs off with Magician who is determined to marry her. At the midpoint there's some comic relief where Magician must find a 'white rooster' to consummate the marriage ritual. Before the young couple attains marital bliss Great Tiger's men track down Magician and kill him with a machete for running off with Komona. She's returned to Great Tiger and she kills him inside a tent by castrating him as he attempts to rape her.The final third of the film has Komona escaping from Great Tiger's men and giving birth to Magician's baby. I suppose the ending is meant to be sort of a hopeful release from all the horrible things we see earlier in the film. But is it realistic? Wouldn't Great Tiger's men come after Komona as they came after her lover before? Despite the shortcomings of the film's climax it's still a powerful chronicle of what's going on in some parts of the world today. While you may expect some entity to come in and save these forsaken children in the near future you probably should hope again. Outsiders don't want to get involved since they'd be putting their own lives on the line for people they're not connected to. The local government forces are so ineffectual or overwhelmed that they're impotent in the face of these dangerous hoodlums. In this case offering up some prayers might be the only logical course of action when dealing with this overwhelmingly tragic situation.".

I've seen several documentaries about this especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda and the films have been absolutely heartbreaking to watch due to the evil being perpetrated by these groups such as the Lord's Army. Yet inexplicably War Witch seemed far less hardhitting and interesting.When the film begins the main character later dubbed the 'War Witch' is narrating about her life two years earlier. An unnamed rebel group in an unnamed African nation comes on a small village and they kidnap the children who looked about ages 1014 and they forced these victims to murder their own parents! Then they are taken to a rag tag rebel camp and indoctrinated. The rest of the film follows this girl's adventuressuch as her strange ability to see dead people as well as her illfated marriage.Considering how tough the film began I was really surprised that over time the film just seemed to fizzle and seemed to lack direction. The film SHOULD have been a strong indictment of the evil forces on the continent that rob children of their childhoods but it got lost a bit with the ghosts white chicken marriage and other distractions.

I felt completely lost at the beginning of the film. I was not able to follow everything that was going on at the beginning of the movie. On the other hand it was extremely exciting when she was forced into the decision of killings her parents herself or having the army kill them at just 12 years old. When she did choose to shoot her parents it was a shocking and scary wake up call that showed us just how crazy things can get in these African countries. I personally was a big fan of the ending. Though it was sad when magician died it showed a good representation of how disappointing life can be at such a young age there. As a side note I thought it was really cool how they made the ghosts look pretty creepy especially their grey eyes. I also liked how the movie went in a full circle and ended with her returning back to where she killed her parents so she could bury them. Also the baby provided a small glance at a happy ending driving off into a new life leaving the past behind her.".

The plot than changes to Komona and the Magician travelling around to find the White Rooster until they find somebody who knows where it it. The man who knows where the Rooster is drives them to a village where a group of albinos live. You can tell that the Magician feels more at home her seeing that he is also albino. After they get the rooster they go the Magician's uncle named the Butcher. The movie slows in pace until the Rebels of Great Tiger find them again killing the Magician and kidnapping Komona again.

Though I didn't really understand why she was able to do everything that she could. Why was she able to see ghosts and why was she able to kill all of the soldiers? I understand that most of it was just for effect but why was it able to happen in the first place? Also I was confused about all of the spiritual aspects of the story. The magician had a large amount of talismans that he would give away like a sort of currency but what were they? Also why did the uncle continue to let the magician and the witch back into his house after they repeatedly destroyed his life? It probably has to do with the weight that family has in African culture but I couldn't imagine anyone in America doing that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rebelle was a very interesting movie in my opinion. I knew a lot of African countries were struggling economically and in terms of civil unrest etc. but I never really thought of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mainly after the events in Libya and especially what is going on in the Middle East right now I didn't really pay any attention to how any other country was doing. After this film however I now see how many countries are currently going through tough times all at the same time also! It's crazy to think how blind we can become to other problems in the world that don't directly affect us in any way. I thought this film had a lot of similar characteristics to other films we've watched. There is this reoccurring style of long periods of silence that we have gotten in many movies along with very little dialogue. This movie has little internal dialogue and most of the speaking is in the form of the main character telling a story of her life. I find this type of movie to be pretty interesting because its so different to what we are normally exposed to in movie theaters here in St. Pete or elsewhere. I didn't really like how there were quite a bit of unexplained things. For example where specifically she lived what the governmental situation was at the time the towns they would go to while looking for the white rooster etc. Another thing I found interesting was that when they showed the ghosts every so often it wasn't CGI effects it was real people that were painted white. I thought this was a clever use of resources.".

This movie is about a young girl named Komona who describes her life and her situation that she is in. In this movie the rebel army takes her in and brainwashes her to kill her own parents this eventually affects her throughout the film. Komona was seen as a girl with special powers and was seen as a Witch to the rebel force. My favorite character in the film was Komona because despite the fact that she had to murder people one of them being her parents she was still brave throughout the movie and managed to survive on her own towards the end of the film after the Magician perished. Overall I thought that this movie was great and would not have changed anything. I would give this film a 45 stars.".

The story outlines a young teenage girl from the ages of 12 to 14 who is abducted by the rebel army. When her hallucinations protect her from war with the government soldiers they pronounce her as a witch and she is highly regarded especially by the Great Tiger himself. During the film she develops a close relationship with a fellow child soldier known as the Magician who through great lengths to find a white rooster to propose marriage to her. After he dies she gets abducted again by a war commander and after having conceived his child she manages to avoid getting raped and kill him by shoving a razor blade inside of her bodywhich in my opinion is really cool. It's rare to find such a strong female protagonist in film nowadays especially in foreign films so that made it all the more refreshing. Overall I enjoyed this movie immensely and would rate it five stars.".

The way that the director portrayed the ghosts was very creative and made it seem more real. The various magical and spiritual elements that were woven into the movie made the plot even more interesting. Komona is a young girl who gets kidnapped by rebel forces and forced to murder her parents. The strength that she exudes throughout the movie is very impressive especially based off of what she has seen and done in her short life. At first I was worried that the Magician's love for her was not reciprocated but it was evident that it was especially in the scene where they are laughing in the woods. I thought that was a very sweet part. I found the balance between the positive and negative in the film to be refreshing because I feel like there has been a lot more negative in many of the foreign films that I have seen. Yes this film was sometimes gruesome and upsetting to the point where I had to look away in some scenes but those scenes were short and usually balanced by some positive scenes later. Overall I was really engrossed in this film and would give it 55 stars.".

It is the story of an African girl whose village is overrun by Rebels and then is forced to kill her parents and fight for these self same rebels. She is haunted by her dead parents throughout the film. First they warn her about the government soldiers who are laying in wait in the forest and then they begin to haunt her for not paying proper respect to their remains. This is the interesting part of the story it mirrors Henry James's Turn of the Screw in a simpler manner and it is dynamically acted by the lead actress. The conflict runs throughout the film until she is ready to confront her burned out village and her parents remains.The rest of the story is unsatisfying. There is a War Lord named Tiger who the script builds up to be important but his character is never fleshed out. The same is true for all the other characters.I watched it in its original language and then with the captions in English and much is missed in the translation. In other words the translation is really poor. I give it three points for effort.".

It's characterdriven centered on the relationship between Val PAcino and Doc Walken both of whom are spectacular.There's some great dialogue between the two and despite what you may read on here the story is quite solid if simplistic. I don't think people have fully grasped these characters in some reviews or the meaning of the title Stand Up Guys. They're throwbacks and the situations they encounter represent the direction the world has headed over the years a world that Doc is forced to be a part of despite wanting a quieter life.I won't go on any further but I found the characters endearing and the relationship between Val and Doc kept me on the hook.Nice soundtrack too.Cheers".

	schema:reviewBody "Stand Up Guys is a reunion of elderly gangsters. Alan Arkin Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are in their twilight years after long careers as mobsters. This Noah Haidle scripted black comedy is a treat for the ears as these New York wise guys reminisce about the past. The soundtrack of blues greats and Jon Bon Jovi songs is perfectly on point.Impressions of Walken are fun but Walken himself does the best Walken. You crave more lines from him. Pacino is at his best here and great Pacino? Forget about it. After serving 28 years in prison Pacino is released. His best friend played by Walken picks him up in a car that was probably new when Pacino began his sentence. Walken takes his friend out for one last night of partying before Walken must kill him to fulfill a contact put out by the mob boss.Walken and Pacino rescue Alan Arkin from a rest home where he is fading away. Arkin is resurrected to be the wheel man to drive a stolen car on their last night out. Along the way they meet a variety of quirky and interesting people. Understated extremely fine acting make this one of the best films of Walken's or Pacino's careers. Seeing them together is like savoring the finest of fine wine. See it.Great script great acting great music. What else do you need?".

Although this is not the type of comedy that will have you spilling your drinks in your laps from laughing it is the type of lighthearted comedy that will make you feel good.The story is about Val played by Al Pacino who comes out from prison after 28 years of incarceration. Meeting him at the entrance is his old friend Doc played by Christopher Walken. Doc has been hired to kill Val and has a time limit until the next morning and during this time the old friends start up old habits and revisit old friends.The characters in the movie were nicely fleshed out and nicely detailed. There is a really good chemistry between Pacino and Walken and this really reflects well on both characters that they play because there is a very good sense of friendship and intimacy's with one another as they are on the screen.The movie offers drama action comedy and even a high speed chase.Stand Up Guys is a fun and great movie which offers 95 minutes of great entertainment. If not for the good story then the movie is well worth watching for the three stars of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing about Fisher Stevens' Stand Up Guys is that how lonely not only the primary characters are but also how the locations are. Take for example a simple scene where Val Pacino and Doc Walken walk down the barren street in the middle of the night as if both represent a bygone era.Not long after Val is released from prison one of his two only friends Doc greets him at the prison gates. Doc actually is hired by an old employer to kill Val out of revenge but Doc cannot bring himself to even long after Val discover the plot. Surprisingly Val is content with it but Doc isn't this tension tests and strengthens their friendship further as the deadline becomes closer.What ensues is a fun romp through the city along with the last of the trio Hirsch Alan Arkin involving brothels car chases bars beating up punks and breaking into stores just like the good ol' days Hirsch says. But it's better now since we can appreciate it retorts Val. It might all seem silly and out of place but it fits the characters and it supports the notion that they want to go out with style instead of dying broken and alone in some old folks' home. Just like the good ol' days one last time.Al Pacino is a magnificent actor amongst the greatest ever. He isn't called a legend without reason. In this film performing at his best in a long time he embodies Val's solitude and longing for companionship perfectly. Here in one scene after crudely remarking a young woman in a bar since it's his first night out of prison his body language and tone changes in his apology his eyes become more focused. His gravel voice speaks in a somber tone of the years that have passed of missed opportunities of lost friends and loved ones. I just wanna dance he says longing for the passion of a woman's beauty. The seemingly perverted old man has disappeared completely into this haunted soul of a human being.Complementing Pacino's performance is Christopher Walken as Doc also gifted also great here. Doc paints for a living and he is subtly in joy to be hanging out with his best pal before the deadline ends  and he is personally conflicted not just with killing Val but with his own personal demons. In a diner Val and Doc discuss their predicament Val sees right through him Doc coolly tries to deny it although there's no denying his facial and vocal expressions which say otherwise. A later scene in the movie briefly showcases Walken's underrated talent in playing vulnerable broken characters.Alan Arkin rounds up the Wild Bunch his presence smoothens the tension between Val and Doc in a lighthearted humorous way. He is more than eager to leave the nursing home once Val and Doc arrive and he shows he 's still got it after eluding the police in wild car chase. Hirsch looks at life in a whatever happens manner and Arkin hilariously does very good with his underscored performance of an adrenaline junkie who longs for a rush.This is a good film but it's not a great film. Fisher Stevens directs the film with ease allowing the actors to have a blast and come out guns blazing while they dance around Noah Haidle's sortatypical screenplay. I doubt that the film would be better if they were to cast younger and more dashing actors in the role  it just wouldn't work. Steven's handling of the progression between the serious and the silly A They Live reference? Really? doesn't quite gel together and the ending it would seem is too gungho for a movie which builds up dramatic tension. Nevertheless I would suspect that that's how Val and Doc would love to end it all  with a bang. Bon Jovi's solemn song Not Running Anymore perfectly sums up the movie's atmosphere.Good solid dramedy with a crime setting. This movie is not for everyone though. For a few generations Pacino and Walken are iconic for being tough gangsterlike criminals who doesn't take crap from anyone. See this if you want to see them reveal their true depths as actors and show bits of how good they can really be.".

I wasn't expecting anything crazy here but I got a lowkey drama featuring three very fine actors admittedly in their twilight years a relatively good script some good comedy and the theme of friends being reunited after 28 years.Fisher Stevens directs a film about a man named Val who has been released from prison after 28 years for being a stand up guy or a loyal friend. His best friend and partner named Doc has been ordered to kill him but before he can follow that order Val Doc and their other friend Hirsch decide to have one last night together.As many people pointed out I will admittedly watch anything onscreen featuring these trio of actors. They all done much better roles but they are still good here. Al Pacino is of course a screen legend and his performance gave me some flashbacks. Christopher Walken is another screen legend and does a great job as the calm Doc. Alan Arkin who seems to be having a career resurgence does an excellent job in his limited role.Overall Stand Up Guys is not the greatest movie about friendship but it is effective enough. The direction seems a little faulty at time and I was a little disappointed with the ending. It didn't end the way it should have. But the chemistry between these three acting greats is skyhigh and it's nice to see together for one last hurrah. It wouldn't be a film featuring these older actors without those Viagra jokes. But the film can be funny sweet and dark and it also has some killer songs by Jon Bon Jovi. I rate this film 910.".

It turns out that Walken has only been allowed to live all these years on the condition that he whack Pacino for killing the only son of an equally decrepit mob boss played by Mark Margolis.The humor in Noah Haidle's screenplay consists mainly of jokes about the men's various ailments with a special emphasis on impotence and medications. When they're not trying to procure Viagra they're lamenting the good old days banging hookers or going off on little escapades like breaking their buddy Alan Arkin out of a retirement home for some justforoldtimessake tough guy funandgames on the road.Directed by Fisher Stevens the movie feels as wheezy and creaky as the characters it's depicting. The whole thing is based on the premise that there's nothing quite so amusing or heartwarming as watching an assortment of septuagenarians behaving as if they were still in their 20s. The result is patronizing and condescending to both the actors and the members of the audience regardless of their ages.There's also a sequence at a cemetery with a hapless Julianna Margulies bearing witness to it that's a strong contender for Least Plausible Scene of the Year Award.As to the performers themselves Walken's effective underplaying is not sufficient to counteract Pacino's nonstop scenerychewing.And while it's nice to see actors of a certain age getting movie roles these days does it really have to be in a vehicle of roughly the same vintage?".

	schema:reviewBody "It looks like this is the season for comebacks with old timers and veterans proving a point that they still have it in them to pull off a film at least with their charisma being top draw and a bonus if the story does justice to their big screen return. Christopher Walken may had made his mark this year with Seven Psychopaths but it's not until Stand Up Guys playing opposite Al Pacino and Alan Arkin that truly brought out a finer performance making this Fisher Stevens directed movie one of the best this year so far in a tale about what it means to be friends.Written by Noah Haidle the story centers around Doc Walken who becomes the only one to meet long time friend and collaborator Val Pacino when he comes out of prison after 28 years. And while you'd like to think that's what friends are for there's another agenda to this almost three decade wait that he's the appointed hit man by a cruel mob boss who wants to settle scores with Val for killing his only son. And to wait that long for revenge is to ensure Val knows what's coming for him after serving his long sentence. To spice things up in a diabolical way why not threaten one's best friend to finish the job? Doc is given a deadline until 10am the next day or face further consequences that don't need any spelling out.So in what would be like a last hurrah to celebrate their friendship reminisce about old times and essentially complete one's last supper with meals drugs getting laid and the whole shenanigans Stand Up Guys follow the duo which became a trio once they pick up Alan Arkin's Hirsch through a night filled with a series of random adventures from stealing cars to picking up girls and spend what would be their best time together before the inevitable had to happen. And it was such a pleasant ride that you'd hope it would have moved in real time instead and more with regular pit stops made at different points in the narrative that was as funny as they were necessary to move the plot forward.The success of this movie came from the story by Haidle who had created quality characters filled with humanity in them that they become a lot more than just characters on screen but closer to people you would truly and easily care for especially as the clock goes ticking away towards the deadline. The script's witty and comical when it wants to providing Pacino's Val with some of the best lines in the film sometimes tinged with melancholy especially his eulogy about death  which you would have heard over the trailer  and often times filled with wry humour as a dead man would in knowing that his end is near.Christopher Walken playing off opposite Pacino was the relatively serious counterpoint to Val and I felt he stole the show from the more showy Pacino character through quieter moments with plenty of emotional baggage of his character being worn on his sleeve given Doc's family issues and the weight and pressure of having been assigned to bump off a good friend which is something nobody should be put through. Alan Arkin's role may be the relatively smaller one but when these three veterans get together it's nothing but pure magic in the way cinema lights up when well written and developed characters get fleshed out by A list performances making it almost direct itself  no intent meant to take the shine from director Stevens for a job well done.And the expanded supporting characters also added a little something special especially those that dealt with family because after sitting through this and being dispensed with plenty of words of wisdom about love and life you can't help but to fall in love with a film that had plenty of heart and soul. I'm clearly going to get this on DVD at least to relive the experience again and hopefully with a little bit more extras being packaged together. A definite recommend!".

	schema:reviewBody "Three legends. Three Oscar winners directed by another Oscar winner Fisher Stevens won as producer for a documentary. United in one movie. That should be enough and one should expect maybe just a decent script and then fine. Stand Up Guys promises too much while securing Al Pacino Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin in the front row but delivers less than expected with its usual crimecomedy elements focusing on aging criminals and very few to say. The cast chemistry is good but Pacino already had movies with the other guys sharing scene with Arkin in Glengarry Glen Ross and with Walken in Gigli although they don't share scenes in that thing and it's probably the only reason why everybody wants to see this movieBut it's terribly generic. Pacino done his sentence and is released from prison. Walken is waiting for him for two reasons 1 to see his old friend again and 2 to kill him contracted by another criminal boss Mark Margolis who wants to revenge his son's death. Soon they rejoin Arkin and the gang is back on action. Besides the fact that they all have fun together after a long time without seeing each other what's most important here is their reflections on life and time and enjoy the little moments. It's all very simplistic told  a little let down since we're delighted with great and powerful stars  but it achieves some effect. The drama takes a long while to be really gripping and the comedy only gets truly good when Arkin finally appears despithe top billing with the other guys he's there for very briefly showing up after long thirty minutes. He made this something almost remarkable efficiently funny. I think the actors presence and relative brilliance compensate the script's lack of real premise lack of more movement and characters and even lack of challenge for everyone involved. Enjoy their company and that's it. That must be enough sometimes. 610".

That should be enough and one should expect maybe just a decent script and then fine. Stand Up Guys promises too much while securing Al Pacino Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin in the front row but delivers less than expected with its usual crimecomedy elements focusing on aging criminals and very few to say. The cast chemistry is good but Pacino already had movies with the other guys sharing scene with Arkin in Glengarry Glen Ross and with Walken in Gigli although they don't share scenes in that thing and it's probably the only reason why everybody wants to see this movieBut it's terribly generic. Pacino done his sentence and is released from prison. Walken is waiting for him for two reasons 1 to see his old friend again and 2 to kill him contracted by another criminal boss Mark Margolis who wants to revenge his son's death. Soon they rejoin Arkin and the gang is back on action. Besides the fact that they all have fun together after a long time without seeing each other what's most important here is their reflections on life and time and enjoy the little moments. It's all very simplistic told  a little let down since we're delighted with great and powerful stars  but it achieves some effect. The drama takes a long while to be really gripping and the comedy only gets truly good when Arkin finally appears despithe top billing with the other guys he's there for very briefly showing up after long thirty minutes. He made this something almost remarkable efficiently funny. I think the actors presence and relative brilliance compensate the script's lack of real premise lack of more movement and characters and even lack of challenge for everyone involved. Enjoy their company and that's it. That must be enough sometimes. 610";

There is a Viagra joke early on in the movie that is not only not funny but has been ton a million times in other movies. Even worse they milk the joke dry by forcibly bringing it up constantly within the first 30 minutes of the film. Alan Arkin has a very small role in the film and one of the few scenes he's in was one of the few parts I actually enjoyed in the film. The whole film is pretty much 90 minutes of OH LOOK HOW OLD THESE ACTORS ARE HA HA HA except none of the jokes are wellwritten and the film has no build up or pay off. It just keeps going on and on until it leads up to one of the worst most anticlimatic endings i've ever seen. The worst part of it might be though is having to watch these legendary actors go to new lows to the point where it becomes embarrassing to watch them.After seeing this i'm really not surprised Lionsgate is dumping it in February and not even really making any attempts to market it. They obviously know that it's a stinker and want to get it in and out of theaters as fast as possible without anyone noticing.

If that is what they intended to portray then fine they got what they wanted. Arkin is great but literally has about 13 minutes of screen time.The simple and boring plot of this film is set up within the first 8 minutes and never deviates one iota except for one completely foreseeable twist 23 of the way through. After watching this film I felt like I had just spent an hour and a half at Hometown Buffet watching senior citizens nosh on the early bird special because a huge portion of the film is dedicated to meals. Pacino and Walken particularly Pacino eat like 8 meals in just over a 24 hr period. It gets rather annoying. Overall I found this movie almost unbearable and completely forgettable.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a truly beautiful film. The story is essentially this a Hindu man and a Muslim woman from a small village in India fall in love and decide to marry. The villagers disapprove of this marriage to the point that they are ready to incite a riot. Given the circumstances the man and woman elope to Mumbai Bombay.Everything is okay there and the two have twins Kamal Bano and Kabir Narayan the names are a mix of Hindu and Muslim to represent their heritage. The grandfathers while still in the village naturally argue with each other and vow to make the children Hindu or Muslim depends on who wins. Suddenly the 1993 riots erupt and the whole family is caught in the middle. The twins are almost burned alive but they survive thanks to police intervention. Both grandfathers show up in Bombay out of concern for their children and grandchildren and continue to compete there.When another riot ensues and the Hindu grandfather and grandson are approached by a group of Muslim men the Muslim grandfather arrives in the nick of time and tells the men He is my brother. Later in the film one of the twins is separated from the other and is taken in for about a day by a member of the hijda community this is a community in India that is essentially composed of eunuchs or hermaphrodites but they wear women's clothing. In a conversation with one of the twins the hijda says Religion is a way to God. The child asks him Then why are all of these people killing each other? To this the man replies I have no idea. And I've been thinking about it for a long time.You don't necessarily have to be Indian to appreciate this film but I think it helps. The underlying message is that We as residents of India should be Indians first and HinduMuslimwhatever second. The film also conveys the message of tolerance and humanity. It is really an excellent film.".

What a shame that Bombay haven't got such a big audience.The true life epos tells us the story of the MuslimHindu conflict 1995 in Bombay from the viewpoint of a young MuslimHindu couple doomed to leave their home town and families. This movie was made in the south in Madras shortly after the riots and was immediately synchronized in Bombay to Hindi for the big audience. During the next three hours the typical hindi movie length everything works out fine until the last thirty minutes where the Bombay riots suddenly break up everything. Mani Ratnam is the one and only director how dares to bring a song every Hindi movie is a musical during the very realistic war scenes where such a scene actually works. Scenes where you are immediately reminded to how you would have shaken your head or laughed if this was just Schindler's List. Imagine the jews singing in the last 30 minutes. Or the Trier train dance scene for which you have to see Dil Se cut to the end. Not so here. They sing about the cruelty of war. Stop fighting. Crying laughing singing dying very close together. Where Trier sinks into unbelievable and childish antidead sentence pathos Ratnam is still with the people full of positive power. Incredible. A must see from one of the most important directors worldwide.".

Ever since the early days of the multiplex Indian cinema has been dominating the cinematic machine early films often dealt with social and economic strikes mostly the 50's and before with the Indian cinema moving more towards the romantic feature which most people associate in the mid 60's. As the decades passed by the Indian film industry moved as a whole through several topics and thought provoking genres of course a LOT of crap was released as well this is the typical all singing all dancing 5 hour epic which most people associate Indian cinema with until in the 90's film makers finally started focusing on terrorism as a genre and in particular the strife and violence engaged between Hindus and Muslims within the Tamil speaking area of India.Bombay begins as your typical Indian romance the protagonist male and female fall in love yet are separated by different religions and families. After a moving Eden like opening song number the two work hard to stay together through their families approval eventually moving away form their small villages and into the city of Bombay.After an interval the film takes a much darker tone focusing primarily on the Bombay bombings and showing how the couple now with children are caught up within the racial attacks. Strikingly disturbing and realistic one scene involves radicals pouring gasoline over the two crying children as they refuse to speak which religion they belong to the film touches on dangerous soil as it shows the riots with no remorse or sugar coating. The lead actor delivers a compelling performance and in the end delivers an incredible speech in the middle of the riots putting himself between the warring factions screaming 'I am neither Hindu or Muslim I am Indian we are all Indians!' A must watch for someone interested in good Indian cinema.".

Ratnam has struck all the right chords here as nothing in this film looks out of place and almost all characters have given their very best. Arvind Swamy shows that he has what it takes to be the numero uno in the industry after his superb performance in Roja while Manisha Koirala is indeed very good here as a Muslim girl torn between her family and her Hindu lover and then a distraught mother of lost twins. None of the actresses portray vulnerability on screen like she does. Nassar is good as the hero's father while Kitty pitches in another believable performance as the heroine's Muslim father. Music is excellent and I understand why after Bombay Ratnam chooses A.R. Rahman as the music composer for most of his films. Cinematography is breathtaking and the scenarios of the rural India and the suburban Mumbai have been captured genuinely and beautifully. Bombay easily goes down in cinematic history as a classic and it does show some disturbing pictures of the aftermath of the HinduMuslim riot like charred deformed bodies of little children after being burnt down which is truly heart wrenching and might melt even the stonehearted.Just brilliant! Give it a shot.".

The film sets an example of a technical brilliance and superb handling of a heart touching story for which it stands out as one of the best achievements of 90s which got pretty forgotten in the usual buddy buddy movies like Dilwale Dulhaniyan Le Jayenge or Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. The harshness and the human sentiments found in this movie haven't been so far achieved to this date.The film is set under the Hindu Muslim riots enraged in 19921993 which engulfed many innocent people and families. One such family shown in the movie is that of Arvind Swamy a Hindu and Manisha Koirala a Muslim who get married despite the fury of their families as they belong to different religions. They have moved to Bombay from a small village of south India and have a twin sons. The riot shatters the family kills the parents in laws and the couple search the lost children under the horror of riots where the people are slain in the light of day houses burned and goods looted. The film ends with the end of the riots and uniting of the family.The horrors of the riots that mutilated the innocents were the best realized parts of the film. The film just disgusts showing the inhumane activities done in the name of religions and criticizes the leaders who are killing hundreds of innocents enraging such riots. The film nowhere becomes mild in showing this for which the film deserves a full commendation. Besides the film remains outstanding for the brilliant performances and technical aspects. Manisha Koirala looks pretty innocent and just gives a beautiful and touching performance. So is Arvind Swami. The acting of Master Harsha and Hriday is full of innocence and touches you. Either the depiction of the beautiful village near the sea beaches or the terror of the riots or the choreography of the song numbers the film is excellent in every aspect of techniques.Rating 4 stars out of 4".

They settle in Bombay where Shekhar works as reporter and have twin boys. The story is written in the backdrop of the Auyodha mosque attack during the 1990's and a communal riots breaks out. The director Mani Ratnam has handled the story very well with realistic scenes of the riot with the burning of vehicles and rampant killing on the streets as well as the chaos and confusion of the people and the government. Both Arvind Swamy and Monisha Koirala gave commendable performance in the two leading roles with good support from the others. The music and cinematography is above average.

	onyx:emotionText "it makes me sad to see that so many people were so easily impressed by this film. this film is a totally wasted opportunity the makers had a chance to say something but completely blew it yet still managed to fool many people into thinking it actually had a message....the first TWO THIRDS of the film is basically romeo  juliet  a formula that has been DONE TO DEATH in Indian films since time immemorial. the same old tired clichd 'Muslim boy loves hindu girl and their family won't accept it' storyline which basically writes itself and in this case allowed the writers to write perhaps a page of storyline that lasted about an hour and a half of screen time... we go through all the clichs the argument between fathers the lovers eloping the children being born the silly syrupy fun and games with the kids the parents returning and everyone forgiving each other.... i've seen this exact same film HUNDREDS of times before....finally after what seems like an eternity of stupid cookiecutter bollywood formula a weak storyline emerges about the hinduMuslim riots in bombay in the early 90s... it makes a few points but doesn't do nearly enough to address the reasons behind it or make statements about the stupidity of religion and how it poisons everything... it would have been great to see the grandparents survive and tell each other that it was attitudes like theirs that led to the riots and deaths of so many innocents but no instead the kids had to get lost and we had to worry about them instead....this film cheats the audience in so many ways that it's CRIMINAL. instead of commentary about religion we get an overdone love story. instead of addressing the violence of religious people we get two lost children. instead of addressing the issues in mixedreligion families we get songs about having a baby girl.... with a precious few exceptions this film is a totally wasted opportunity avoid it!for a MUCH BETTER look at these riots a much better story and for an actual discussion of the issues involved see mahesh bhatt's superb 'zakhm' 1998 it's everything this movie should have been and a lot more!";

	schema:reviewBody "Marion Michael was 20 when she made this film next to Eddie and as I can read in imdb's list of films Marion was in her most famous film when she was only 16 Liane. I don't remember having seen the girl in the jungle in the 50s but I remember that one was sort of a scandal. Now in this Monte Carlo comedy I was reminded of her and strangely enough I recognized her after 45 years immediately. She is the one and only beautiful and entertaining decoration in this long forgotten German production. It is really a pity that Marion didn't enter the ladder of at least European success. She was a natural born comedian and definitely capable to follow the steps of for instance Lilo Pulver. She was obviously an amateur but once in a while I love to watch amateur stuff especially when they show early a maximum of future talent. Eddie is as usual in his early films Gunther Philipp is quiet and has not so many lines but sings a song with the American in Paris Eddie. The mentioned director I don't want to mention. But Vive Marion ! But sorry She died 40 years ago. Instead of Constantin Hans Albers was in the first version but I don't remember the girl.Michael Zabel".
