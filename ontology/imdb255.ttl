A debt of over a billion dollars to the Banco Ambrosiano is discovered and it serves as the catalyst to various highstakes maneuvering by Calvi and others to solve their problems.Even if you're like this viewer and some of the details and story threads may fly over your head Ferrara and company do a capable job of storytelling in this long but very well acted crime drama.

	schema:reviewBody "Once again somebody has decided that a film is 'lost' ... and once again a film that has allegedly vanished into oblivion for all eternity turned out to be in a wellknown film archive all along the one where they keep the Oscars in fact. I saw 'Sorrell and Son' recently at Cinecon 41 in L.A. ... and if anyone doesn't believe me there were several hundred other people in the room with me. Actually the last reel was missing from the print that we viewed so maybe that much of this film really is lost. For the moment at least.'Sorrell and Son' was once an extremely popular novel by someone who rejoiced in the name Warwick pronounced 'Warrick' Deeping but the book is now exceedingly out of fashion. This 1927 movie was in its day the film version of a recent bestseller. The cast are excellent notably Lionel Belmore Louis Wolheim Nils Asther and Mary Nolan.The central role is played by H.B. Warner. In my reviews of several other films I've made some very unfavourable comments about Warner's acting ability. My only real gripe against Warner is that on a consistent basis he utterly fails to convince me that he is romantically or sexually interested in a woman ... yet he is often cast in roles which require him to convey precisely that passion. Here in 'Sorrell and Son' Warner is less handicapped than usual by that inadequacy. His character's wildoats days are firmly in the backstory.Warner plays the front half of the film's title role Stephen Sorrell who was decorated for valour in the Great War and is now trying to raise his son Christopher whom he loves dearly. In an early scene father and son exchange a vow that they will have no secrets from each other. As Christopher matures his doting father quietly makes tremendous sacrifices for his son's education. Eventually Christopher Sorrell graduates medical school and becomes a doctor.The narrative is rather muddled branching off into several subplots that lead nowhere in particular. I suspect that director Herbert Brenon and his screenwriter Elizabeth Meehan were intimidated by the extreme popularity of Deeping's novel and were reluctant to prune the story for fear that Deeping's readers would complain. The one subplot that was truly relevant here was the one raising the issue of medical euthanasia. Sadly the film drops the ball on this ethical question. But I seem to recall that Deeping's novel was blurry on this point too. I tried to read 'Sorrell and Son' once about 35 years ago and gave it up as a bad job.Brenon was not a good choice for this material which probably would have been better directed by Edmund Goulding or Frank Lloyd. Brenon did his best work in fantasy films and melodramas in locales slightly removed from reality such as the circus. 'Sorrell and Son' is a prosaic workaday story about realistic people and that's just not the sort of story suited to Brenon's talents.I was eager to see 'Sorrell and Son' because it was photographed by the great cameraman James Wong Howe. Sadly the print screened at Cinecon with one reel missing was struck from a nitrate positive that had seriously deteriorated and it was often quite difficult for me to suss out the visual compositions. Some of the exteriors appear to have been filmed in southern England.Despite the deterioration of the print several actors' performances came through very impressively. Nils Asther gives possibly his careerbest performance as Sorrell's son in young manhood. I wish I could be as enthusiastic for the twee child actor who plays Christopher Sorrell as a boy. Louis Wolheim is good in a supporting role but seems to be in the wrong film I kept expecting him to strip off his shirt grab a stoker's shovel and head belowdecks for the boiler room.By far though the best performance on offer here is given by H.B. Warner. He expertly conveys his love for his son. Warner is quite convincing here as an embittered war hero who was traumatised by his ordeal in the trenches. Just five years after starring in 'Sorrell and Son' Warner would appear in 'Tom Brown of Culver' playing a very similar role  a hero of the Great War  except that in the latter film Warner's hero turns out to be a coward who deserted under fire. In that movie H.B. Warner overacted shamelessly as a phony hero. In 'Sorrell and Son' cast as a genuine military hero the very unmacho Warner is quietly believable and he brings great authority to this role. The vehicle suits Warner splendidly and he again played Stephen Sorrell in a lowbudget British production in 1933.Due to the extremely poor condition of the print which I viewed and the absence of its last reel I shan't rate this film. But I will say that H.B. Warner's performance in this drama easily makes up for the bad performances he's given elsewhere.".

I went to this movie worried that it would end up like just about every Peter Framptom Album after Frampton Comes Alive they were all pitiful albums only because Frampton comes alive did not leave much room for improvement. The original Ghost in The Shell is a classic. It was a good action film that had some deep undertones. Well made to say the least full of memorable characters. Ghost in the Shell 2 was so different that there could be no comparison. As opposed to an Action film with deep undercurrents this is a philosophical film that occasionally had some action sequences. The basic plot is very simple Android created for pleasure killing their owners. Cyborg cops trying to get to the bottom of these strange crimes. The cops section nine operatives Batou and Togusa spend more time quoting everything from Bazooka Joe to Milton as long as it serves a purpose. This is not Ghost in the Shell. This is a Mamorou Oshii original with his own ideas and philosophies not being bound by the original manga. I venture to say that I actually prefer Innocence to the first one because it struck chords in me the first one did not. Somebody who has a different outlook on everything however would disagree. If you have seen the first one remember how there is more or less a quest for humanity? THis one takes an opposite spin on things. As well as takes a look at how humans feel this need to immortalize their own image. The animation was enough to prove that traditional and computer animation could work together and create a beautiful picture. However the underwater and in air scenes seemed to rely too heavily on the computers which then completely made up the world. The world itself was not the world I remember from Ghost in the Shell. THis was a whole new futuristic world as opposed to a slightly more advanced modern setting. This film also focused a lot on the relationship between Batou and the now 'missing' Kusanagi.This film seemed to be lost on many. There are many scenes of complete silence which are intended as 'breathing time' and and other points really to build tension. The film also slows down at a few points so that the audience can absorb the scenery and gives extra time for the audience to catch the symbolism. The film ended with so many angry groans. It would seen that the film was lost upon those who wanted to see a sequel to Ghost in the Shell with the same themes and ideas. The only similarity to the first film would be that most of the story is superficial and what the film is really about is the deeper meanings.This was an excellent film and though it can be seen as superior it will never be as well known and recognized as the first film.

I remember not liking the first one when I first saw it too many scenes of nothing moving while we listened to voiceover but I give this one an enthusiastic thumbs up plus a wink and a smile. It FEELS like the middle chapter in a story... there is too much left unresolved and while seeing the first one isn't necessary to understanding this one there ARE many references the original Ghost in the Shell. It's not so much a continuation of the story as it is a continuation of the characters. Which I think is the better call.Constant quotes from literature is not a sign of intellectual weakness I don't think. People accuse the movie of not having a brain of its own but I think any movie that engages the brain of its audience needn't make apologies.

	schema:reviewBody "A new Japanese cyberpunk masterpiece that makes the original GiTS look primitive by comparison. Mamoru Oshii and his crew did a masterful job creating a worthy successor to their 1995 adaptation of Masamune Shirow's original manga.As in the original movie  as well as in that other quintessential protocyberpunk movie Blade Runner  the movie explores human nature in a world that is becoming more technological all the time to a point where people ARE technology the boundaries are rapidly fading away. What does it mean to be human? If we join with technology would we become something else? Should we welcome it or fear it? Will humanity lose or gain from the changes? After the events of the first movie Major Motoko Kusanagi has seemingly disappeared focus of the second movie has shifted to Bateau who is still working for the secret government Section 9. This is by no means a bad thing since Bateau is at least as interesting a character as Kusanagi ever was. Going beyond your basic cyberpunk cyborg tough guy with attitude he is very intelligent and has some nice human touches like the dog he loves taking care of. At various points he and other characters routinely indulge in philosophical debate often quoting literature from Milton to biblical psalm verses. Just to say this isn't your typical scifi action movie although there is some action and when it comes it's fast brutal  violent.The actual plot involves an incident with a sophisticated robotic pleasure model if you will gone berserk. The investigation leads us through the darker parts of nearfuture Japanese society including yakuza companies with questionable ethics and mysterious hackers.Visually the movie is stunningly beautiful using a combination of traditional cell animation and state of the art CGI. Many of the movie's backgrounds are gorgeous to just look at even dark and dirty back alleys are shown so rich in color and detail you could gaze at them all day. Like in the first movie Oshii lets the movie halt at times immersing the viewer in the richly detailed world he created. Many of the computer screen readouts resemble those seen in Oshii's Avalon a lot  which again is not a bad thing as they look both hightech and yet elegant  artistic.Last but not least the music by Kenji Kawai is hauntingly beautiful adding more layers to the sophisticated richness of it all.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. Anyone who likes science fiction anyone who was blown away by movies such as Blade Runner and of course the first Ghost in the Shell which you should see before watching this one will enjoy this.".

The plot although very complicated and often convoluted is rich and laden with allegories philosophy analysis and even theology. At first glance the characters appear to be static and somewhat stoic but when one thinks about it the characters are that way to represent the similarities we share with dolls. Does an effigy infused with meaning and symbol constitute as a being on it's own accord? Or are we simply defined by the mere fact that we are alive? The film is laden with imagery suggesting the warhybridization of nature vs. machinessynthetic life how machines mimic nature how tradition becomes assimilated by it and how reality may or may not be a virtual construct based on our own perspective. This is an intellectual symbolic film that not only gives eyecandy galore but also delivers more cerebral fare than most films. Although the characters are ultimately forgettable save the expressive dog owned by Bateau one can perceive that too as being a tool to suggest that ultimately we are all drones living our predictable lives...perhaps unaware of more intricate powers and forces surrounding us.

Its a head trip.I'm finding it hard to express what I feel about this film. Visually this film pushes animation and visual story telling to new places. I know that some of the look of this film can be found in video games but never has the current state of art on many levels been brought together to rattle nay destroy the cage of the status quo. Much of this film had my jaw hanging open often with tears welling up at the beauty of the imagery. This film rocks and then some. The computer generated worlds of Immortel and Sky Captain are blown away by the magic worked here.The plot is too murky. Frankly I was lost half way into the movie as to what the plot was however I was seriously getting off on the visuals and most of all the ideas that were being batted about. How do we know whats real and what isn't? This film makes it very clear that we can never know nor can we know what it is to be alive. Certainly not all of it works but enough does and all I can say is wow.I have no idea how to adequately rate this film. I'm sure some people will find it form over substance and others will think little of the visuals. Me they rocked my world and I gave it a 9 out of 10 but I'll add that your mileage may vary.".

I know that some of the look of this film can be found in video games but never has the current state of art on many levels been brought together to rattle nay destroy the cage of the status quo. Much of this film had my jaw hanging open often with tears welling up at the beauty of the imagery. This film rocks and then some. The computer generated worlds of Immortel and Sky Captain are blown away by the magic worked here.The plot is too murky. Frankly I was lost half way into the movie as to what the plot was however I was seriously getting off on the visuals and most of all the ideas that were being batted about. How do we know whats real and what isn't? This film makes it very clear that we can never know nor can we know what it is to be alive. Certainly not all of it works but enough does and all I can say is wow.I have no idea how to adequately rate this film. I'm sure some people will find it form over substance and others will think little of the visuals. Me they rocked my world and I gave it a 9 out of 10 but I'll add that your mileage may vary.";

For whatever reason you think you might have missed something important. Image Hosted by ImageShack.us That's more or less Ghost in the Shell 2's 100 minute running time in a . . . ghostshell. It doesn't help that the dialogue is in subtitles the way it should be and the animation is some of the most beautiful I've seen since . . . ever. Your eyes pull double duty straining to digest polysyllabic words stacked 10 deep while soaking up animation of unrivaled scope and grandeur. Beauty and the Beast has nothing on this.It's a much more assured and revelatory work than it's 1995 predecessor.Credit Mamoru Oshii with improving upon every facet of an already intelligent and fascinating premise. Yes. Everything is better.Much of the first Ghost in the Shell felt like a fleshing out of the various philosophical topics woven into the game of Artificial Intelligence. It was about debunking the line of demarcation between man and machine. It was about finding something unique in humanity amidst the clamour of our technological nearfuture. Oshii was struggling with this right alongside his characters and it showed in a somewhat lackluster visual presentation a jumbled thesis and a messy ending. The plot itself a technonoir murder mystery felt tacked on. Still the original Ghost in the Shell was something to behold.In the 9 years that have passed though Oshii definitely did his homework. In a time when everyone needs a kickass firewall for that lumpy grey mass between their ears knowledge is immediately available to all and the section nine detectives Batou and Matoko use all the net has to offer in contemplating their place in the vast jackedin world they inhabit.They drop anecdotes about Descartes quote Confuscious the Old Testament reference Rabbi Judah Low ben Bezalel and the Golem of Prague. They quote Milton. I studied English literature and I can't quote Milton.But then maybe it takes someone like Milton someone with sympathy for the devil to live as a human in a world where men are ever more becoming mechanized and the machines they build take on the characteristics of their creators.Maybe it took Oshii a few years slogging through the quagmire of western skepticism and selfdoubt to realize that.The plot this timeanother nod to noiris more focused and accessible except for the beginning of the third act when someone hacks Matou's brain. Things get a little fuzzy then but they're supposed to.I don't believe the philosophy involved can totally reveal itself in one sitting. Certainly trying to flesh it out here would be pointless and boring. Suffice it to say that in Oshii's future humanity has angst to spare and it looks like things are only getting worse.Even the animation choices reflect a feeling of alienation and shows such painstaking love on the part of Oshii. The movie is dominated by advanced computer graphics and lush matte paintings for its backgrounds and many of the dolls see also robots see also gynoids see also sexroids etc etc. Cars library Stacks great postapocalyptic landscapes are by turns vivid and dingy and exploding with detail. They burst off the screen. Batou and Matoko and the rest of the humans as well as the gynoids who have been given ghosts souls in contrast are cell animated the old fashioned way. In this environment they seem helplessly two dimensional out of place and almost inferiorwhich is just the way they actually feel. And when a gynoid through pursed lips and with seductive langour pleads help me the hackles on your neck are at full attention. Brilliant.I took notes during this movie. I felt compelled to. I think I'm going to find some popculture doctoral program and write my thesis on it. The depth and breadth and sheer complexity of the imagery and symbolism in Ghost in the Shell 2 is crippling. It feels at times like Heart of Darkness but is careful to remain far less turgid and depressing. It fully warrants a second or third viewing to mine the depth of what Oshii is offering.At a time when the vast majority of filmseven arthouse flicksopt for allegorical poverty rather than alienate potential ticket sales it's all the more refreshing to see a beautiful selfassured movie that's content to do more talkingabout Milton for godsakethan shooting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Influential animation director Mamoru Oshii returns with a follow up to the impressive if disjointed Ghost In The Shell which to be frank is even more impressive and possibly even more disjointed than its predecessor. Ghost In The Shell 2 Innocence is a creation of great beauty intelligent thought that throws up some very interesting sensible and above all engaging points on which to debate the nature of humanity what constitutes being human? When are we deemed as being alive? However for all the reasoned debate Ghost In The Shell 2 unfortunately follows and falls into the trap so many Eastern stories  in particular many mangas and anime do which is an incoherent storyline which proves the ultimate irony seeing as how this a film which engages your mind you're forced to switch it off in places and just 'go with the flow'.Innocence is an extremely visual film and you will be awed into watching from a seamless combination of 2D and 3D animation techniques which to be frank makes Sky Blue look like the work of a preschooler. It is simply ravishing and you find yourself hooked intently and intensely to what is simply a blisteringly well constructed piece of animation and is worth a viewing by all fans of the genre on this basis alone. But is that enough?Well to be honest no it is not. As with Sky Blue the animation was painstakingly created over a long period of time and as with Sky Blue the plot suffered slightly for it. Yes the philosophy is interesting poignant and it does make you think this I am not denying but it's sometimes thrown around complete uncontextualised just for philosophy's sake. I'm not arguing against the introduction of philosophy and metaphysics into the medium of films I'm all for it but when characters are throwing around Descartes name like he's going out of fashion instead of developing what little plot there is within the film it does tend to lend itself to the criticism that this film is for pubescents coming of age who wish to expand their minds. Mamoru Oshii is an influential director and his works have always included a degree of philosophy mostly he tends to tackle the constructs of humanity and reality and the link between the two can one define another? are the two linked at all? can one survive without the other? However the original Ghost In The Shell was philosophy crammed and yes again the story had an air of incoherency about it but the philosophy was not driving the narrative the narrative was driving the philosophy and this is where the sequel fails in its intent.Ghost In The Shell 2 is indeed impressive but seeing as it was coproduced at the remarkable Studio Ghibli and was a selection for the Cannes film festival you can be forgiven for asking for something with a bit more bite to it. There are a great number of positives to take away from this experience as the animation is impeccable it is so sublime it just makes it so fantastically easy to slip into the world and enjoy the feast and yes a summary can't be made without a nod in the direction of the thought put into this film. However If you'll forgive this rather audacious metaphor think of this film as a sandwich and all this wonderful philosophy provides the contents the filler the real taste to go inside this sandwich. Think of the most ridiculously packed sandwich you could possibly imagine with everything on it and then imagine no bread with which to hold it all together.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the saying goes you don't have to have a degree in philosophy to enjoy Ghost In The Shell but it helps. Well I'm sure it's a saying in some circles anyway  Mamoru Oshii has always been a pretentious director but also a very talented one. The original Ghost In The Shell and his liveaction Avalon in particular can be viewed as much as philosophical essays as they can actiondriven films. However in those two he is content to use the philosophical ideas as a foundation to build the film's story and aesthetics on as layers to ponder if you are familiar with the ideas and inclined to ponder. In INNOCENCE perhaps he was afraid people wouldn't understand the philosophical references so he makes them very explicit  characters respond to almost every event that happens with a quote from Descartes or Milton or some other respected source. In the end one is forced to conclude that this is less to help the viewer understand the philosophical ideas in the film as to make sure everybody knows how well read Oshii is I don't think the quotes would help anybody understand the ideas that wasn't already familiar with them. In other words he lays it on a bit too thick for his own good... yet from a first viewing at least the film seems to have less of real substance to say than part 1 or AVALON. Neither of those films presented any real answers or new theories but they were very effective artistic framings of the questions they addressed at least. INNOCENCE perhaps seems like it's trying to offer answers and explanations for issues that do not really amean themselves to answering but more to a thorough considering of the questions and an abandoning of preconceptions based on a very narrow perspective that of human existence.But criticisms aside Oshii also knows that the audience is not really there to hear a lecture on philosophy  they want to be dazzled with the highest possible production values and animation standards and he does not disappoint. The work from Production IG exceeds even their own incredibly high quality standards and the soundtrack from Kenji Kawai complements the visuals perfectly. If the scene where the film's title is accompanies a surreal parade through a desolate hightech urban landscape doesn't send chills down your spine then... well that's your business but I am surprised. It has absolutely nothing to do with the plot or any particularly clear point regarding the philosophy but it's an aesthetic thrill of the highest order. Oshii knows that the viewer is expecting some action with his philosophy too and the film offers a few scenes of shockingly powerful violence especially with a big screen and modern cinema sound system. They're inserted almost arbitrarily though there is an attempt to make one of the middle scenes more meaningful but the climactic scenes especially have little point except the celebration of destruction. The first film's action scenes were a huge influence on THE MATRIX and through that film were highly influential on world cinema in general  Oshii probably wanted to make sure his newest and costliest film would not go unremarked on this front too.Conclusion the film must be admitted as flawed but what Oshii work isn't?The first GITS was the closest to flawless he has come and part 2 definitely doesn't put him any closer. It does raise the bar aesthetically though and is the new benchmark for animators to beat.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie hoping for the best but expecting the worst.  I got the worst.I'm sure the anime otaku for whom anything anime anything Japanese anything Mamoru are untouchable will love this movie.  They will read deep meaning into lines that really have none and into ideas that have been covered far far to often and much better already by more talented writers and directors.But let's just get into the technical parts first.We all know one joke about Japanese animation is it's not animated. Japanese animation is the art of making a story with as little animation as possible. Cut to an image of the moon during dialog so nothing has to be animated. Cut again to their feet.  Then there are the shortcuts only animate the mouth walks are 2 steps use lots of panning shots animate only machines smoke and explosions since they are far easier to animate.Well this movie more than any anime I've seen recently takes those things to extremes.  It's like it was actually written to use as little animation as possible.  A couple of the characters are robots and when they talk their voice comes out of a speaker in their mouth so they just open their mouth or not and the voice comes out.  No animation needed.  In some of those same scenes even the human's mouths stop moving.The movie is padded as well.  There were severals 5  10 second scenes where nothing moved and there was no dialog as well it was just padding.  And it wasn't even for dramatic pause or even paused on some impressive visual.Then there was the artistic masturbation scenes.  There was at least one 10 minute long well it felt like 10 minutes of a Chinese parade. It had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the story the movie the plot nothing.  It was only there to show off art.  It was pretty but it was also completely boring since it had no relation to anything.There were several other scenes like this.  Long scenes to show off art most of which were pointless and in fact they just are not impressive anymore. How many thousand neoTokyos with giant skyscrappers etc have we already seen?  It's lost its effect.Another sad part although the setting is some future NeoTokyo all the cars are early 20th century.  Can anybody say Highlander 2.  Sure they are pretty cars but they make no sense at all.  It might and that's a big might make sense if one character was a car collector and had an old car but in this movie all cars are pre1940.  Some artist might think that's cool but in the movie it's just a distraction because it is so clearly unbelievable.The best and only good part of this movie is the dog.  The dog is actually animated.  Although having almost nothing to do with the story.My suggestion avoid this movie.  Don't reward this kind of ego trip.".

I got the worst.I'm sure the anime otaku for whom anything anime anything Japanese anything Mamoru are untouchable will love this movie.  They will read deep meaning into lines that really have none and into ideas that have been covered far far to often and much better already by more talented writers and directors.But let's just get into the technical parts first.We all know one joke about Japanese animation is it's not animated. Japanese animation is the art of making a story with as little animation as possible. Cut to an image of the moon during dialog so nothing has to be animated. Cut again to their feet.  Then there are the shortcuts only animate the mouth walks are 2 steps use lots of panning shots animate only machines smoke and explosions since they are far easier to animate.Well this movie more than any anime I've seen recently takes those things to extremes.  It's like it was actually written to use as little animation as possible.  A couple of the characters are robots and when they talk their voice comes out of a speaker in their mouth so they just open their mouth or not and the voice comes out.  No animation needed.  In some of those same scenes even the human's mouths stop moving.The movie is padded as well.  There were severals 5  10 second scenes where nothing moved and there was no dialog as well it was just padding.  And it wasn't even for dramatic pause or even paused on some impressive visual.Then there was the artistic masturbation scenes.  There was at least one 10 minute long well it felt like 10 minutes of a Chinese parade. It had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the story the movie the plot nothing.  It was only there to show off art.  It was pretty but it was also completely boring since it had no relation to anything.There were several other scenes like this.

If you enjoy watching the TV Series Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex do NOT watch this movie. You will pine for the days when Togusa wasn't a little fraidy cat and makes nonenhanced humanity respectable.Here's the more indepth versionI thought Ghost in the Shell the first movie was decent. It was made better by the fact that they had a pretty enjoyable video game that followed it up but I'm not one of those people that would consider using the word masterpiece to describe it without using not in the same sentence.As far as this film it could do with a bit of dialogue. Apparently Oshii doesn't understand the difference between having a conversation and playing a game of Pretentious Quote Battle 2 Electric Boogaloo. Somewhere along the line he must have gotten the idea that perhaps the audience wouldn't understand how smart his films was supposed to be so he has the characters repeat the same concepts over and over again just quoting different authors. What makes this so horrendously annoying is that the film's concept is so simple. The heart of the film is the question of existence. What is is and do these malfunctioning robots have it? If so does that cheapen humanity because humanity is capable of being broken down into 1s and 0s? While this may seem like a spoiler it's fully explained within the first 10 minutes of the movie and done so over and over every 510 minutes after then each time with an exchange of literary quotations. Heck Batou even tells Togusa that it's hard to follow his conversation since all he does is sport random quotes. When you have THAT many quotes in a movie it's time to rewrite the dialogue...perhaps giving some of the characters their OWN lines.The movie IS visually stunning however it is only that and the little bits of fun piecing together the connections between this movie and the first that make this movie barely worth seeing.

From the onset the viewer is slammed with a philosophical quandary this is given by the cyber coroner and feels so out of context that it appears forced. Whereas in the original it was subtly woven throughout the film and its context. You just don't get that here.I don't know if this is Disney's influence at work... The first film was a little convoluted though with a little brain power you could figure it out. For Innocence they give it to the audience in black and white.Then you have the appearance of digital artwork fused and mixed with the more original. For most of the time this works though it does have less effect on building atmosphere as does the setting and direction of the scene. The worst scenes containing digital art are the cars driving down the street. The street backgrounds are dark with a mat lustre howbeit the cars are ultra shiny bright metallic. The reflections flowing over the surface of the car doesn't tally with their surroundings. This draws the viewer out of the story to register the imperfection of the scene this hurts the movie as you want your viewer to feel as though they are apart of the story and not a third party just watching.The story was a nice followup even though I don't think is was told all that well. Something is happening to the sexbots! For some reason they are malfunctioning and killing their owners and whoever's in the vicinity before committing suicide. Section Nine is called in as this could be an act of terrorism since robots cannot kill humans or themselves.Under better hands this could have been as great as the original film had they decided to entwine the philosophy the mystery and thriller elements and mood and ambiance into the story and artwork instead of segregating them and lessening the power of the piece.Worth watching if you've seen the original but be warned it's not as good.".

Basically it's really boring.Consider the following 1 While Ghost in the Shell had interesting riffs on cyberspace and cybernetics Ghost in the Shell 2 has a lot of Star Trekkish jargon about networks that adds little to the basic framework. There is actually a sequence of scenes that apparently consisted of humanshaped machines hooked into other machines talking about what was going on in their networks. I'm not sure who thought that long periods of still shots of blooping machinery with voiceovers would be equivalent to climactic action but they were wrong.2 Anime movies often have plots that make no sense. Like in JinRoh Wolf Brigade where everyone at some point is like Oh well I don't think there is a plot at all but those drawings sure are darn nice to look at. You can't do this in Ghost in the Shell 2 because a the pictures aren't that nice to look at and b the movie is trying so hard to maintain a cohesive plot that you want to try along with it. There are long periods where the writer clearly wanted the audience to be confused so you would naturally assume that it would be explained. So you listen to what the characters say afterwards but become frustrated at how reasons are hedged with madeup technology and a lot of talk about dolls.3 The success of the first Ghost seems to have convinced the writer that he is now free to expound upon his topics of interest at length and the viewer will remain entertained. While there are interesting topics touched on here albeit somewhat clichd and overused ones actual reflection has been passed over in favor of an astounding number of random quotes ranging from the Bible to John Milton to some that may have been overheard on the street. I may be a philistine but it seemed as if there was no greater plan tying these quotes together than the simple goal of having a lot of quotes and the result borders on the inane. Especially because almost every character in the film is a complete and utter nihilist delivering their lines as if they had long ago resigned themselves to death the dialogue becomes intensely uninteresting. And I wouldn't hold my breath for badass action scenes to pick it up eithermost of the time the only punctuation to these listless conversations is the whizzing of some random mechanical part.This is all very sad because clearly there were high aspirations for this movie. The animation is very well intricate and at times almost aweinspiring. The movie keeps its own pace and the characters stay true to form. It's possible that a lot of these complaints are the product of awful awful subtitling and it was pretty awful since it was actually closed captioning with lots of noise and silence.

	schema:reviewBody "OK so The Matrix part ONE the sequels just shouldn't have happened! used to be my absolute favorite movie of alltime ever since I'm a computer nerd and into eastern philosophy and all that. Now this movie comes along takes all I liked about The Matrix and does it even better!It is compared to The Matrix Visually more stunning. Loads of beautiful eyecandy even more than Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon Broader range of philosophy. While The Matrix mostly focused on getting the western part of the world to understand what the Hindus are talking about when they say that the material world is an illusion this movie contains explanations of quotes from The Bible Confucius and Buddha. To name a few. Now I'm just waiting for a movie explaining the monotheistic firmament of the Qu'ran but as long as the U.S. keep pursuing the worthless War On Terror such a film isn't going to make it big anyway. More impressive weapons arsenal. OK so it's sciencefiction whereas The Matrix had to stick to conventional weapons at least in the cyberworld.

All you CounterStrikers out there know what I'm talking about!In total it rules! Also there is no need for major Kusanagi to show her nipples for this movie to work out.

	onyx:emotionText "OK so The Matrix part ONE the sequels just shouldn't have happened! used to be my absolute favorite movie of alltime ever since I'm a computer nerd and into eastern philosophy and all that. Now this movie comes along takes all I liked about The Matrix and does it even better!It is compared to The Matrix Visually more stunning. Loads of beautiful eyecandy even more than Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon Broader range of philosophy. While The Matrix mostly focused on getting the western part of the world to understand what the Hindus are talking about when they say that the material world is an illusion this movie contains explanations of quotes from The Bible Confucius and Buddha. To name a few. Now I'm just waiting for a movie explaining the monotheistic firmament of the Qu'ran but as long as the U.S. keep pursuing the worthless War On Terror such a film isn't going to make it big anyway. More impressive weapons arsenal. OK so it's sciencefiction whereas The Matrix had to stick to conventional weapons at least in the cyberworld. But there are also some oldtime 20th century weapons being put to good use! How about Bato the lead character of the movie cleaning out a mafia caf with an M249 PARA?

	schema:headline " A Really Bad Movie For Those Who Thought Matrix 2 Was Great";
	schema:reviewBody "Innocence is a visual feast that shouldn't be missed for this reason alone but the stunning and seemingly endless scenes of slow moving flocks of birds flying around sky scrapers and three dimensional environments alone couldn't save this movie from it's none sensible proverbs and it's horrid story neglect.SpoilersWhen I went into this film I believed that it would be about a man whose soul's installed into a robot and he and his bassinet go searching around the distopic city to unravel the cyborg's lost past which involves homicidal robotic concubines and the mafia. Of course it wouldn't be fair to criticize a film on what it isn't but I find absolutely no difficulty in criticizing what it which remains unbelievably unclear throughout the film.The story begins with our hero the hardnosed philosophical cyborg police officer who discovers a robotic concubine within an apartment who is fresh after killing and our hero coldly slugs her with three shots from his gun. The concubine goes down and is taken to forensics where our hero and his nervous human partner speak with an elderly robot either robots age she was made to look elderly or she was elderly when modifications were put in who fills us in with how and why these concubine robots named sexoids were made. That sounds good enough except for one problem the whole time we are told philosophical insights with more holes in them than your regular robot concubine. Almost all of which take away from the plot and force the audience to deal with them when they'd rather deal with the story. And they NEVER stop! Every scene we are bombarded with about fifteen proverbs or fifteen minutes of CGI imagery gracing the city as well as horrible Japanese singing!Finally there are three scenes that contribute to the plot.The first we enter into a murder scene of a wealthy man who was killed by a Yakuza cyborg with illegal weaponry and has a holographic photo of a girl who looks eerily similar to the sexoids.In the next scene our hero decides to 'speak' with the Yakuza by beginning a senseless shootingemup scene followed by a hand to hand combat with the illegally armed cyborg. Yes that was to me the greatest evidence that the movie isn't about searching into the very essence of man's soul through the eyes of a robot but to do a shootemup movie filled with mundane proverbs to make the audience feel like they're watching Shakespeare while they're really watching Die Hard. And finally there's the scene where our hero's shopping for dog food and his brain is hacked into causing him to rampage but is cured before any true damage is done. This was truly interesting for introducing this device into the psyche of the robots thus rekindling my curiosity over the inner workings of their world. But soon enough the concept gets swallowed up by an endless amount of inane proverbs and only comes back later in like a Frankenstein.In the next scene where after about thirty minutes of swooping around the city in wide shots a quick intermission of unnecessary and ridiculously mundane Myron Confucius and Biblical proverbs...and that horrible singingthe two detectives end up at the front steps ancient hacker's mansion. There they walk very slowly across a bridge through the heavily latched doors and into the ballroom where our hero spies a hologram sexoid robot and bassinet and feels that it's only economical for him to make these images appear in zoomedin style with a few factoids appearing at the top. I'm sorry but isn't it easier to look at things as a whole and gain instant insight from that without the use of such useless devices as a ticker? Frankly if that's how the robots live it must be hell. Well anyways they walk up the stairs wake up the hacker who is feigning death and start what I earlier stated as the birth of Frankenstein.Over and over the minds of the two are hacked into and the audience is forced to watch them approach the mansion exactly the same way again except with minor variations. This sequence takes about thirty minutes and ends when our hero tears the cables running into the dream hacker's head in reality What use is there in the cables if they didn't hinder the dream tapper in any visible way?. Then our hero reveals that he was hinted by a guardian angel that his tappeddreams were false. Then the too end up at the doorstep again and speak apathetically about the value of reality and perception.The next scene our hero latches tightly to a submarine driven by a robot which tells our hero not to let go because if he did he'd sink to the bottom. Why the robot was in the cockpit when an auto pilot would suffice is beyond me. But our hero held on tightly throughout what proved to be a much tagged on scene. All the while his partner and the hacker were hacking into the security system of the secret base where the sexoids were being manufactured so our hero could slip in and pull a Wolfenstein on those robots. And then a couple of soldiers went in as well through the front door. So bang bang shoot shoot lop lop the soldiers retreated or were all killed and our hero was left getting overwhelmed until the nick of time The Major who was spoken of regularly dropped in while possessing a sexoid robot and helped our hero survive the ambush. For a while she was very reliving to have until she gave an analogy about mirrors creating evil and evil creating mirrors. Agggh!Then at long last the film ends with a final appearance of the greatest character in the film the bassinet. Hooray!End of SpoilersGhost in a Shell 2 Innocence310Really bad movie for those who thought MatrixReloaded was great.".

It's actually very cerebral in its message... the setting plot and characters are secondary to the investigation of the concepts of self selfdetermination and one's personal attachment to perception and interpretation of reality. I imagine those aspects may be quite provocativeor perhaps even inaccessibleto those who have not already contemplated those features of one's own subjective existence.However even on a superficial level the plot seemed relatively uncomplicated and was definitely appreciable for its character development action sequences visual effects and the futuristic vision of the setting.The Dreamworks subtitles on the DVD are very good but you may have to skipback a couple times if you're not a speed reader  I'm curious about the original in the series now as I have not seen it however I had no trouble enjoying this film immensely despite some vague references to elements of the 1998 film Kkaku kidtai.".

	schema:reviewBody "9 years and a great deal of fan anticipation later we are presented with the sequel to the Mamoru Oshii masterpiece Ghost in the Shell. And well was the wait worth it? Technically things have improved greatly and the visuals in Innocence are quite simply mindblowing particularly the parade sequence with it's various layers of detail the five minutes of footage took a year to animate and 2D and 3D have been incorporated in a sympathetic manner styled very much like the Korean animated feature 'Wonderful Days'. The character designs are more in line with those featured in the Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex series and are all superbly animated. The scenery is also stunning with many of the environments being beautifully rendered in 3D along with a host of retro 1950s cars that fit in to the quasiBlade Runner look of the film. But what of the most important element the plot? Well in truth this is a fairly different kind of film when compared to the original. Far less emphasis has been placed upon action sequences and far more of the focus has been shifted to certain intellectual and philosophical issues particularly surrounding the purpose of human propagation and it's true agenda. These musings seem far more relevant to the average person than those raised in the original and though I could not deride it's predecessor of which I am a great fan Innocence feels like a far more personal intimate and thoughtful film. And where as Ghost in the Shell was unquestionably the tale of Major Kusanagi Innocence is very much Batou's story. As he searches for the truth behind a series of gynoid sex droid perpetrated murders we not only learn more about the world in which he lives but far more about the man himself. Perhaps seen as a hardened soldier we learn there is far more to him than this that he is thoughtful determined but also very lonely and is starting to have issues with his own existence. Issues that are akin to those of the Major's in Ghost in the Shell. Complex and deep he provides a perfect vehicle for the film's storyline. Personally I believe that the wait was truly worth it and that Oshii his team and Shirow for conceiving the characters we know and love should be congratulated on their hard work which has brought about a modern anime masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ghost In The Shell Innocence was simply the best anime I have ever seen. It is the secret payoff after having to sit through and enjoy I'll admit I Robot and The Matrix movies. Now don't get me wrong I enjoyed the Matrix trilogy. And I even thought I Robot was passable Saturdaymatine popcorn entertainment. But as of GITS I I can honestly say that all those movies  and Spielberg's AI as well  can just sit right down and shut the f up. Acclaimed anime director Mamoru Oshii has just sent y'all a digital bitchslap to last generations. You wanna be subjected to an intelligent mesmerizing vision of the future that incorporates the idea of AIs in effective and stunning ways? Innocence is the movie all diehard cyberafficionados have been waiting for all their lives. If one were forced to rely on comparisons with previous such cinematic fare one could not avoid noticing the similarities in style to certain seminal works in the genre as Blade Runner and Star Wars only as filtered through the clinically focused depiction of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey and at the same time defying all these in favor of its own particular ideology. Anyone who sees Innocence and maintains the director is ripping off Ridley Scott stylistically has missed the somewhat unnerving point it is merely that both auteurs have aimed for the same artistic truth and arrived near enough to their target to bring about certain undeniable analogs and parallels. Innocence is not derivative of Blade Runner so much as it is merely analogous to it's central themes certain urban  global trends become inescapable in any futurist's carefully aimed predictions of where mankind is taking his collective urban environments. But Innocence strives to achieve something that its predecessors only hinted at that the essential difference between robots and humans is something imbedded firmly in the eye of the beholder. The way it achieves this noble vantagepoint is nothing short of pure artistry in that the audience is not led to this conclusion via traditional plot device rather we are gradually led to this inescapable conclusion only after having soaked up the ambiance of this highlydetailed futurist vision of the world and technology to come and arrive there by a sort of osmosis after having soaked up the detailed minutae of how artificial intelligence has proliferated throughout a wide variety of takenforgranted applications. What I found most fascinating about Innocence was it's unrelenting sense of crystalclear focus on the realism of what could be considered realtimeaction and I found it ironically satisfying that an animated film could strive for a realism and achieve it more focused than that which a movie like say Matrix Reloaded for instance strove for despite it having been filmed with real actors and sets. In other words Innocence was a glorious example of finely honed stylism in that it achieved degrees of realism even beyond that of the Matrix movies with all their flesh  blood actors and tangible sequences. This in itself propels Innocence high above the farthestreaching ambitions of its predecessors in the AI genre and results in a visually stunning film that comes across like a mutant hybrid of 2001 A Space Odyssey Blade Runner the Matrix movies and Final Fantasy The Spirits Within and then trumps them all with the careful introduction of our protagonist's basset hound pictured in the movie poster a remarkably alive animerendered pooch if there ever was one. This tailthumpin basset becomes the mascot of the film and also the keystone which secures for the filmmaker the winning card in his RoyalFlush homage to science fiction robot movies everywhere. I had to watch Matrix Reloaded twice to even begin assembling any sort of meaning to the story and with Innocence the fact that I'd have to watch it 5 times to even begin unravelling all its connotations speaks more for its inherent simplicity than it does for any sense of harrowing complexity the details are packed into its subatomic structure just like life itself. The story is quite straightforward actually it's the connotations of the story's details which linger on to haunt your memory for days if not years to come.".

The story is quite straightforward actually it's the connotations of the story's details which linger on to haunt your memory for days if not years to come.";

Sadako just friggin' pops out everywhere like some mentally challenged CGI jackinthebox. There's no emphasis on creepiness or atmosphere at all. The storyline is also haphazard and totally boring.

	schema:headline " A pointless attempt at revisiting a classic horror with the addition of 3D this poorly conceived return of Sadako is missing everything that was good about the original";
	schema:reviewBody "Back when the world was first introduced to the creepy longhaired girl in white that came after a viewing of a cursed videotape the goggle box in the living room was probably the only device one needed to fear. Today the invasion of the electronic screen into every nook and cranny of our lives is so pervasive that we'd probably be staring at fear itself no matter where we turn and it is precisely this reality that 'Sadako 3D' the fifth official entry in the 'Ring' series exploits.In one of the more effective sequences of the movie our protagonist Akane Ishihara Satomi flees the allgirls school she is teaching at to get away from the multitude of computer screens within only to be confronted on the street by electronic billboards above and around her. It is a clever reflection of the world we live in today dominated by second third and fourth screens of different sizes and dimensions. Speaking of dimension an additional dimension of fear has also been added in the form of depth another phenomenon that 'Sadako 3D' gladly takes advantage of.Yet despite these virtues director Hanabusa Tsutomo's adaptation of original creator Koji Suzuki's newest addition to the series is a hugely disappointing entry that sullies the reputation of the franchise. Instead of the grippingly eerie atmosphere of Hideo Nakata's first film we get cheap 'boo' scares that dissipate as quickly as they appear. Instead of a genuinely spinetingling central character in Sadako we get a young teenage girl with superimposed red eyes and inexplicably numerous spiderlike 'Sadakos' that end up unintentionally amusing. And instead of some intriguing village folklore surrounding Sadako we get some lame excuse in the form of a limp revenge plot concocted by a vengeful artist. Yes Tsumoto's 'Sadako 3D' is such a deeply flawed movie that one can't help but lament at the caricature the central character has become at the hands of a clearly inept director. Tsumoto was also behind the screenplay and he and cowriter Fujioka Yoshinobu are just as incompetent in sustaining any dramatic momentum in the storytelling. Despite hewing closely to the template of the original movie in having a female protagonist on the hunt for Sadako the duo fail to replicate the former's riveting buildup of fear or dread chiefly because Akane isn't given much of a mystery to decipher in the first place. Couple that with a haphazard manner by which various supporting characters chance upon the said cursed footage and meet their death and you have a narrative that basically makes little sense. But none of that compares to the appalling CGI employed for Sadako. It says a lot when the Sadako of fourteen years ago looks more realistic than the Sadako here and that is apparent right from the opening shot with a woman falling down a well. Even if we are willing to overlook the perspective issues of this oftrepeated shot the use of CGI in Sadako's appearance from a computer screen or smartphone is simply awful driven solely from the perspective of the third dimension with little thought of other spatial considerations. Most dreadful and worthy of reiterating is the laughinducing climax where tens of Sadakowannabes go after Akane in pure arachnid fashion. For no other reason other than the fact that it must have been hard crawling out of smaller modernday screens our supposedly fearinducing character has suddenly been reduced to a longlegged creature monster that moves with extraordinary speed. Not only that Akane also makes the transformation from scared schoolteacher to spiderbuster vanquishing her pursuers with a simple wield of a metal rod. Humour was probably not Tsumoto's intention for this drawnout ending but there's little else it offers. Regrettably then this seemingly prescient entry into the 'Ring' mythology is a complete letdown. Instead of offering a new dimension in horror it careens into unintentional humour and just about erases any lasting memory of why Sadako was so terrifying in the first place. Like most franchise entries with '3D' prominently displayed within its title it is no more than a cashgrab attempt at exploiting the extra dimension with a lame rehash of a previously successful horror that did just fine in 2D. With such a feeble return this Sadako might as well have stayed in the well which is where you want to kick it under after you've seen it.www.moviexclusive.com".

When the high school student Noriko Morisaki seeks the video in classroom her teacher Akane Satomi Ishihara takes her cellular to return it after class.

When Akane's boyfriend Takanori Kji Seto is captured by a woman in the video and Koiso witnesses Nakamura committing suicide they investigate Kashiwada and discover that his intention is to bring Sadako Ai Hashimoto back to a new body and Akane is the chosen one. Now Akane has to fight against Sadako to bring Takanori back and save her life.Sadako 3D is a very bad Japanese horror movie with a senseless story. The plot is silly with Kashiwada releasing the video to find a strong body to revive Sadako and they actually want Akane's body. Akane uses her superscream to get rid of the supernatural creatures as if it were a comedy. So why do they need to make a video to kill people? They are very powerful and wouldn't be easier if they simply find Akane and use her body to revive Sadako? The conclusion is awful and in the end only the gorgeous lead actress Satomi Ishihara is worth to be watched in this terrible movie. My vote is two. Title Brazil A Invocao 3D The Invocation 3D".

SADAKO 3D couldn't hope to be anything like that original brooding masterwork so instead it's a largerthanlife monster horror flick one that simply isn't meant to be taken seriously.Instead this trashy movie is all about the effects doing its best to frighten the viewer with jump scares and all manner of creepy creations. The story is updated to the 21st century with Sadako's curse now spread via the Internet and mobile phones. Cops investigate a series of weird suicides while the main character a school teacher finds herself pursued by Sadako's spirit which is searching for a new human host.The film has a dark greyedout look and a fastpaced story that doesn't give the characters time to be anything more than cardboard cut outs. However the 3D effects are what this movie is built around the plot merely leading to the next scare. It gives you a chance to see Sadako popping out of various screens for yourself so that you the viewer experience the horror of RINGU. Personally I thought these bits were great and the sustained thrills of the climax in which Akane is pursued by an army of spiderlike Sadako critters is great fun too.

The acting was terrible the cast should have concentrated on their acting skills instead of spending so much time on their hair and clothes. No thanks to the script writers the storyline was just stupid laws of physics didn't make sense how does a huge hand pop out from an iPhone ? timeline didn't match and some parts were just down right funny Sadako really went to town with the whole gadgetHighDef technology part. Throughout Sadako was a supernatural being able to magically appear across the entire country popping up anywhere and everywhere there was a screen but was unable to sense the heroine hiding behind the cupboard in the same damn room!The original film The Ring used tension great acting and simplicity in the storyline to give a great scare. This new film had so much potential but unfortunately the person putting it together probably just graduated from film school or probably failed it. The special effects deserved special mention it was just ridiculous to see the main actress suddenly becoming Xena and smashing the xerox of Sadakos popping up all over the place. It was quite funny to see the scores of Sadako skittering around like an over excited schoolboy. Obviously the director watched matrix and decided to add some of the special effects to this school project.Shame on you Mr Director for turning a great horror film into a comedy.Acting 210 Storyline 410 Cinematography 310 Special Effects 344210 Overall 439334210".

This new film had so much potential but unfortunately the person putting it together probably just graduated from film school or probably failed it. The special effects deserved special mention it was just ridiculous to see the main actress suddenly becoming Xena and smashing the xerox of Sadakos popping up all over the place. It was quite funny to see the scores of Sadako skittering around like an over excited schoolboy. Obviously the director watched matrix and decided to add some of the special effects to this school project.Shame on you Mr Director for turning a great horror film into a comedy.Acting 210 Storyline 410 Cinematography 310 Special Effects 344210 Overall 439334210";

It's an insipid horror flick that's as bad as Seram Sejuk which I reviewed last month.Sadako is the fifth in the series of horror flicks originating from The Ring 1998 in which those who watch a cursed videotape will die no matter if they saw it on VHS or Beta. Okay the last part is my judgment.Now those who watch a cursed videoclip of someone committing suicide will themselves commit suicide. Before I continue I just want to say that Sadako is uninspiring tame unoriginal and downright silly.I don't find it scary to see a thin white hand with long fingernails reaching out of a computer towards me. It even gets boring after awhile. All the victims will then shout and scream at the top of their lungs but to no avail as they will all commit suicide.The movie starts off slowly and viewers may be mistaken into thinking that they are watching a documentary. A videoclip of someone committing suicide is making the rounds and everyone wants to watch it it's as if it's a sex clip of Kim Kardashian.However those who watch it commit suicide. This goes on for awhile before teacher Akane Satomi Ishihara decides to intervene after her student falls from her condo unit. There are also a couple of detectives lurking in the background.Her boyfriend Takanori Koji Seto also gets dragged into this mess that is dragged into the computer.Sweet Akane the one with the shrieky voice that can break glass which happens in this flick goes underground to save her lover but not before she runs around in an empty warehouse avoiding an army of gargantuan and uglylooking hairy spiders. They may look dangerous but all our heroine has to do to destroy them is to give them a hard whack and they'll disintegrate into smithereens. Finally what's this flick without long and dishevelled hair smothering our hero?After this movie is over viewers will want to seriously consider committing suicide.".

And in the spirit of the previous Japanese movies I was thrilled when I happened to fall across Sadako 3D by sheer luck. Preparing for a good old fashioned Japanese scarefest I settled in on the couch to watch Sadako 3D.And now that the end credits have finished I sit here with a very very empty feeling and a rather bad taste in my mouth. This movie was quite far from the original trilogy both in plot and in scares. Not to mention the 3D effects were not particularly impressive.For a Japanese horror movie then Sadako 3D was frightfully lacking spooks and scary moments. And a poorly animated CGI version of Sadako didn't really help the movie along in any great way. Nor did it help when she came out of the well and had strangely mutated legs. Or when there were several of those creatures crawling around. It was just horrible to witness.The acting throughout the movie was adequate despite the actor and actresses had very little to work with. And Satomi Ishihara playing Akane did carry the movie all by herself actually. Without her in the movie it would have been even more gutwrenching to sit through.At 96 minutes you get very little worth for your money. The movie is lacking that tradition dark sense of foreboding doom and horror that usually permeates the Japanese horror movies. Sadako 3D was too much of a reshined attempt to cash in on an otherwise great series and try to brighten it up with 3D effects.Having seen Sadako 3D I am somewhat hesitant about sitting down to watch Sadako 2 3D. Why? Well aside from the lack of creativity in the title then from the fear that it will turn out just as dull lifeless and boring as the first Sadako movie was.Sadako 3D is more of a slap in the face of fans of the original Ring movies than it is a wellworthy addition to the legacy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Ring film is a horror movie classic. Its central character is Sadako a girl in a white dress with very long black hair who climbed out of a well and into the living rooms of her victims through the TV. The creepy way Sadako's disheveled tresses covered her face and the jerky way she would creep and walk were copied shamelessly in several other Asian horror flicks even several years afterwards. When I first saw the ads of this film it was pretty exciting. This movie promised to bring Sadako in all her 3D glory and I could not wait to see her crawl right through the silver screen right at us. However when I got to the theater earlier it turned out that locally it would only be shown in Digital 2D. In fact it had been retitled The Ring 3. Groan.Anyway The Ring 3 is about Akane a young teacher in a Catholic girls school. One of her students gets obsessed in searching the internet for a certain cursed suicide video which rumors say allegedly showed someone committing suicide and resulted in the viewer in getting killed as well. That cheerful student unexpectedly commits suicide one night by jumping through a glass window and falling to her death. More and more people inexplicably take their lives. When Akane's own boyfriend Takanori gets lassoed into a giant advertising LCD screen she was hooked into a search for the truth behind this cursed online video and find a way to stop its deadly consequences.First the positives. Akane is played by a very pretty young actress named Satomi Ishihara. She really pulled off the sympathetic character of the tormented teacher. She is very charming and great to look at amidst the horror and despite the weird super power the writer gave her. There was also a little puppy love flashback episode to show how Akane and Takanori first became friends. That was a nice touch.There is really something so clean about Japanese cinematography. The contrasts are so stark and simple they look beautiful. Those scenes where Akane was simply walking under the arches of a lonely corridor or when she was walking on the rooftop against the bright blue sky. So nice and calm. Next the negatives.While the first Ring films successfully conveyed dread and fear with the simple and even crude special effects of Sadako creeping towards her prey. This film goes OVERBOARD with its ridiculously unbridled use of excessive fakelooking computergenerated imagery! Despite this supposedly advanced computer graphics the parts that were supposed to be 3D like the hand or the hair that popped out of the computer or cellphone monitor looked very bad indeed. The most absurd and overthetop idea of them all is the terrible idea of transforming the iconic scary image of a lone Sadako into a HORDE of monstrous spiderlike Sadakos with very long jointed hind legs and vampirebatlike mouths. The ironic kicker here is that they apparently can be easily subdued by sweet little Akane after which they simply dissolve into a swarm of black moths! Senseless and stupid. Certainly less is more.Overall this is a disappointing movie undeserving of being called a sequel of the original Ring films. I am giving it a couple of extra stars solely because of the beauty and performance of Ms. Satomi Ishihara as Akane. As for the character that gave this movie its name Sadako sadly lost her edge and practically became a caricature of her original self because of this film's indulgent director.".

This greatest plot ever thought to upgrade the Ringu premise is unfortunately misused in Sadako 3D which is surprising coming from the JHorror genre full of such great films Ringu itself included that left Hollywood jealous and out of attention forcing them to remake several Asian films. Sadako 3D has a plausible plot for this hightech times but is visually absurd and spends most of its length focusing more on action and abusing of 3D effects forgetting the new kind of thriller the story should provide.

She was actually pretty good at screaming and acting shy like a teacher. She was also smart using her wits to trick the Sadako spiders on top of being pro at using spears. He was mainly quiet at first until the stakes became high. And no matter how dangerous it is to stay at her side he still did it showing his love for her. The film was also quite scary what with moths and all. The bad Watching the eponymous film in 3D was horrible. The film looked like it was shot IN THE DARK all the time. I mean if I knew I was being haunted I would either on all the blazing lights all the time or travel to Africa where there's no chance of people with screens. Also many explanations were not givenwhat exactly was Ayukawa's power? Screaming so shrilly that glass breaks? Why did their friend die? What happened to Sadako? I guess they're waiting to show us in a sequel. On top of that the ending was anticlimax because it's like the Sadako spiders were so weak they need like an army to overwhelm a skinny teacher? Overall quite interesting and scary but confusing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Ringu franchise gets a 21st century update in this fourth instalment of the classic horror series. Coming over a decade after Ring 0 Sadako 3D was a real chance to kickstart the ailing series and give renewed life to Koji Suzuki's classic story. Sadly although the film starts well and manages to update key elements of the Sadako folklore it is ultimately let down by a bizarre finale and its completely pointless use of 3D. We are left to wonder whether Sadako should have perhaps stayed down the well.The film begins with the suicide of a disgraced artist broadcast via webcam to a handful of people on a video sharing website. Although the video is promptly deleted it soon becomes notorious throughout Japan as the cursed video after rumours emerge that all who watch it take their own lives shortly thereafter. The legend is particularly popular among teenagers who scour the net 247 trying to find a working link among the '404 not found' error pages.The film's protagonist Akane is a high school teacher drawn into the legend after one of her students apparently commits suicide while watching the clip. As more and more of her class expose themselves to the danger Akane learns of a connection between the suicidal artist and the notorious Sadako legend from a decade earlier. Could Sadako be behind this latest cursed video? If so what does she want this time? And how can she be stopped?For fans of American horror Sadako 3D is to Ringu what Scream 4 was to Scream a reimagining of the original story transferred to a modern setting with modern technology and with characters who are aware of the previous films' events. Where Scream 4 failed was in trying to merge the original premise  of teenagers being isolated and stalked in a small town  with the modern setting never really answering the question of how a 21st century teenager can ever be 'isolated' in an era of smartphones and mobile internet. By contrast the writers of Sadako 3D recognise that the original film's premise would seem dated today and use advances in technology to their advantage. For starters Sadako no longer needs a television set to wreak her revenge the creepy longhaired girl appears from smartphones laptops and even electronic advertising boards. It's a useful ploy that means characters are never really safe wherever they are and it works well. What also succeeds is the uncertainty of the 'cursed video' instead of a tape that characters either watch and be damned exactly seven days later or don't watch and be safe the video is an online stream that moves about the internet appearing at random on computers or smartphones that have previously searched for it. This means you are never really sure when or if a character will be next giving a breath of fresh air to what could have been considered by now a tired concept.All of that though is completely undermined by the final act where the director for some inexplicable reason decides to crossover a decent paranormal ghost story with a creature feature  with predictably terrible results. Without spoiling the full details in this review nuances from the Sadako legend are reduced to Silent Hilllike zombie creatures almost leaving the viewer unsure if they're still watching the same film. Of course genre crossovers are popular in Asian cinema and can be done successfully see e.g. Spellbound but this just fails miserably. Things do get back on track somewhat for the ultimate finale which satisfies to a point but the damage has already been done by that stage.Mention must also be made of the 3D effects. Although often a gimmick at the best of times the extra dimension serves no purpose whatsoever here being restricted to shots of Sadako's hand emerging from screens of various sizes  and that's about it. Moreover since most of the modest budget appears to have been spent on the 3D apparatus the film looks decidedly lowbudget when watched in 2D with some truly laughable CGI effects. I appreciate that the 3D 'gimmick' may have been required to get this film made at all but I do wonder whether the final act would have strayed so far from the Ringu folklore had the director not being able to cheat his way out of proper storytelling with the cheap gimmicky effect.Ultimately then we are left with the feeling of what could have been. With its decent overall premise and its intelligent use of technology to update the original story this could have been the refreshing reboot needed to kickstart the Ringu franchise. As it is Sadako 3D is a mere curiosity worth a watch for the first hour at least if you enjoy the original films but more likely in the final act to alienate existing fans than win over new ones.5 out of 10  disappointing.".

During the conversion process from analogue to digital much of Sadako's backstory appears to have been left behind and some plot points from Ringu 2 and 0 are inexplicably forgotten.As a film in general Sadako offers a considerable amount of entertainment both eye catching and original. As a horror movie however sometimes this particular feature fails to satisfy its audience and though the first half of the film offers a unique feel when in contrast with its predecessors there are some moments when the attempts at horror are too abrupt. Sadako has always been most terrifying at her subtlest so when she decides to appear on several televisions at once or broadcast herself on the largest screen she can find the mode of terror the Ringu series is known for ceases and is instead replaced with quantity over quality.In a world dominated by internet technologies to transfer Sadako onto mainstream media seems like the logical next step in revitalizing the fear. The first time you witness Sadako's hand erupt from a screen you cannot help but lean back in fear of her grabbing you. However as this happens more and more you inevitably feel slighted that other original concepts were not included.When it comes to the effects these cannot be faulted which offer some dark if not occasionally disturbing images. Even when these are used to produce clichd scare tactics a decent amount of fear can be realized but unlike the previous films that stayed with you after the credits rolled Sadako despite the inclusion of 3D effects fails to continue materializing after the film is over.In previous installments the heroine has been an intellectual using brain rather than brawn to investigate the horror which is why it may seem strange the lead in this film is representative of the stereotypical victim screaming hysterically while been pursued by her opponent. Satomi Ishihara portrays Akane a high school teacher whose students begin to fascinate over a cursed video circulating online.Rather than dying with their faces contorted in fear those who view the footage are instead drawn to suicide much like the man in the video the tape that terrified audiences in the original feature been replaced with a new model. After one of her students takes her own life Akane and her partner Takanori Koji Seto are drawn deeper into the new nightmare that has been created. Though there is meant to be an included love story the affection between Akane and Takanori is only envisioned through dialogue and character choices rather than through physical interaction with even a peck on the cheek apparently been too much to ask for.Part Ringu part JuOn part Pulse and part Silent Hill Revelations Sadako potentially does its best to conclude the franchise but in this story of vengeance and decisions where choice is a paramount factor is its best attempt enough?

	schema:reviewBody "13 years after the events of the original film a rumor about a cursed webstream is going around in urban Japan. A white clad man announces an obscure plan and a woman's voice announces It is not you. After this you die. From this point on we follow both the investigation on a larger case of serial suicides by a detective named Koise Tayama Rysei as well as Akane a young teacher Ishihara Satomi trying to cope with her students death. But everything comes back together within the plan of artist Kashiwada Seiji Yamamoto Ysuke trying to call upon the mysterious S.When I went to see Sadako 3D I actually wasn't expecting much. The Ring movie franchise had a pretty good start but quickly lost control of what it was trying to do. Two disagreeing sequels Rasen 1998 and Ring 2 1999 a prequel Ring 0 2000 that does not really connect to either sequel. Still all the films managed to built a rather solid atmosphere of dread that managed to work so well it inspired an Gore Verbinski to create his own American take on the lore creating The Ring in 2002. But this chain of movies has some loops along the way and it all started with a novel by a Japanese author called Suzuki Koji and its sequel Rasen which also build the basis for this movie. Because actually this movie is a sequel to the first two books and none of the movies being apparently based on Suzukis novel S released only one day before the movies release and almost ignoring the sequel he had already written in 1998. This movie was not off for a good start. Now Sadako 3D seems to strive less for atmosphere and is instead all the more about the little shock moments that are supposed to make you jump. All together it plays out more like the bastard child of a hundred JHorror catchcopies that littered the shelfs in the 90s and early 2000s. Screaming schoolgirls a pretty lead and jump scare after jump scare. Only the finale gives a slight twist on the usual formula and transports us into an almost anime'esque setting complete with superpowers monsters and defeating the big bad through the power of love. As a horror movie there is not much to recommend. The scares are all beentheredonethat and if you've seen 2 or 3 Japanese mainstream horror films in your lifetime you can probably reek them from a mile away. Not helping is the awkward use of 3D which frames the jump scares like popup pages in a comic book warning you about them almost a minute before they actually happen.But still I can't completely hate this movie because of its aforementioned connection to the original novels. It does put a rather clever twist on the question what had actually happened after Sadakos rebirth. There are some interesting nods to the old Sadako stories here and there and if you pay enough attention you actually notice that the Sadako from 13 years ago is in this movie. The sad thing though it has almost nothing to do with the main plot and serves only as a gimmick. All in all though the movie delivers solid JHorror which would probably have been greatly appreciated 10 years ago. It doesn't add anything new though and even the aspect of technology which always played a big part in the Ring series is largely underused. If you care for a slightly gimmicky entry in the Ring series with some interesting nods to previous installments you could give it a go.".

The Ring movie franchise had a pretty good start but quickly lost control of what it was trying to do. Two disagreeing sequels Rasen 1998 and Ring 2 1999 a prequel Ring 0 2000 that does not really connect to either sequel. Still all the films managed to built a rather solid atmosphere of dread that managed to work so well it inspired an Gore Verbinski to create his own American take on the lore creating The Ring in 2002. But this chain of movies has some loops along the way and it all started with a novel by a Japanese author called Suzuki Koji and its sequel Rasen which also build the basis for this movie. Because actually this movie is a sequel to the first two books and none of the movies being apparently based on Suzukis novel S released only one day before the movies release and almost ignoring the sequel he had already written in 1998. This movie was not off for a good start. Now Sadako 3D seems to strive less for atmosphere and is instead all the more about the little shock moments that are supposed to make you jump. All together it plays out more like the bastard child of a hundred JHorror catchcopies that littered the shelfs in the 90s and early 2000s. Screaming schoolgirls a pretty lead and jump scare after jump scare. Only the finale gives a slight twist on the usual formula and transports us into an almost anime'esque setting complete with superpowers monsters and defeating the big bad through the power of love. As a horror movie there is not much to recommend. The scares are all beentheredonethat and if you've seen 2 or 3 Japanese mainstream horror films in your lifetime you can probably reek them from a mile away. Not helping is the awkward use of 3D which frames the jump scares like popup pages in a comic book warning you about them almost a minute before they actually happen.But still I can't completely hate this movie because of its aforementioned connection to the original novels. It does put a rather clever twist on the question what had actually happened after Sadakos rebirth. There are some interesting nods to the old Sadako stories here and there and if you pay enough attention you actually notice that the Sadako from 13 years ago is in this movie. The sad thing though it has almost nothing to do with the main plot and serves only as a gimmick. All in all though the movie delivers solid JHorror which would probably have been greatly appreciated 10 years ago. It doesn't add anything new though and even the aspect of technology which always played a big part in the Ring series is largely underused. If you care for a slightly gimmicky entry in the Ring series with some interesting nods to previous installments you could give it a go.";

Cheesy creature effect jumpscare!Nonsensical filler fluff scene.Setup. Setup. Another laughable 3D jumpscare that looks silly when viewed in 2D!...that pretty much sums up Sadako 3D' the 2012 film from director Tsutomu Hanabusa. Essentially an attempt to revive the muchbeloved Ringu aka Ring franchise in the modern internet age this stinker is pretty much a deadonarrival thriller that is more likely to induce unintentional giggles and an occasional yawn than inspire chills in audiences.I was actually fairly excited to hear this film was being released. I'm an enormous fan of masterdirector Hideo Nakata's original film and I even enjoyed the various sequels prequels and remakes to an extent. Though I have sadly thus far been unable to read the original Koji Suzuki novels that inspired those films. The prospect of a more modern take on the Ring mythos was intriguing... and to be honest I didn't have a problem with the idea of the film being in 3D. Some of the iconography and famous images of the franchise would frankly lend itself well the added depth provided by modern 3D technology.But alas it wasn't to be. Director Hanabusa trades in the wonderful sense of pervasive dread that the original film oozed to make room for nonstop effectsheavy scares that come off as wonky and funny due to the overlygimmicky nature of the 3D. And it's all made even worse by the fact that... it's kinda hard to find a 3D copy of the film meaning the obvious obligatory 3D Comin' at ya! effects look all the cheaper and lazier when viewed in 2D.The plot is a messy forgettable affair. And I'm not joking. I watched the film about a year ago and I couldn't really tell you what happened looking back on it. Something about a video released online that drives people to commit suicide and an evil plot to resurrect the spirit of the dreaded Sadako. But trying to recollect specifics of the plot... it's just a blur of nonsensical imagery and flat characterizations. The prior films would stick with you. Even after a single viewing you could vividly recall every major detail of the plot. Every twist of the story. Every single eerie moment. But this film leaves as little impact as the viral videos it seems to be drawing inspiration from. Like every supposedly big YouTube clip you've seen... you'll forget it within days once the next big thing comes along.Although to give credit where it is due there are a couple of stand out moments. Including a fairly accomplished sequence involving a slew of genuinely disturbing spiderlike Sadakos in a pretty suspenseful little sequence that makes good use of bodyhorror imagery. While it didn't contribute much to grand scheme of the film it was a pretty zany creepy sequence and horrorfans who are disturbed by things like the alteration or unnatural changes of the human form should get a kick out of it.But outside from that and a couple other moments that work this is otherwise an enormous mess. The constant jumps get predictable to the point you'll be giggling in anticipation and the plot is a thin excuse for nothing but special effect after special effect. And the fact it appears to have the production values of a lowbudget TVmovie doesn't exactly help.It's odd. I've been wanting to review this for some time now. But I could never quite put together the words to describe it. And I realized that's the big problem for me... there just isn't much to say about it. It's an underwhelming followuplightreboot that adds nothing to the Ring franchise outside of stylistic betrayals of the prior films.And that's about it.I'm giving Sadako 3D a weak 3 out of 10. It's not the worst horror film ever made. But it's a shocking fall from grace given how good the franchise was in its prime.".

Unfortunately my excitement was drowned out by an offensive mish mash of A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and The Exorcist The Version You've never Seen.A high school teacher named Akane Satomi Ishihara hears rumors of a cursed video clip circulating online. The clip is said to show a man Kashiwada Ysuke Yamamoto committing suicide. Supposedly anyone who watches the video is driven to commit suicide themselves. Akane refuses to believe the rumors until one of her students mysteriously dies after viewing it.Akane soon discovers that Kashiwada intends to use the clip to cause chaos and death which will help the spirit of Sadako Ai Hashimoto find a host body for her to possess. Akane and her boyfriend Kji Seto must find a way to stop Kashiwada from accomplishing his terrifying goal.I can't believe for one second that anything in the last act of this film is taken from the novel S which it's based on. Judging from the other entries in the Ring series writer Koji Suzuki seems way too sophisticated to stoop to the monster movie clichs we get in the climax of Sadako 3D. I can believe the first and second acts of the film might be based on the actual source material. However I can see producers and writers trying to up the scare ratio for audiences and completely ruining the film.The general idea for Sadako 3D isn't the problem. The cursed video tape from Ring being converted into a file and uploaded to the internet is a natural progression that is very believable. The spirit of Sadako being able to manifest through any wireless device or computer hookup makes complete sense and is justifiably frightening. I just wish filmmakers would have spent a little extra time and money on CGI and practical effects to successfully convince me that what I was watching was authentic.This is the perfect example of business executives and studio heads taking a simple sacred and tragic concept like the ghost of a vengeful girl and turning her into a monster movie icon the likes of Freddy Jason and Michael Myers. It's not enough that Sadako climbs out of TV or computer screens. Now she has the ability to extend her long black CGI hair and wrap people in it as she pulls them to their deaths. As if that's not ridiculous enough she also causes her victims to turn into spiderlike creatures.Sadako 3D does have a few chilling moments where we see traces of the main character we got to know in the first few films. Unfortunately it's not enough to merit someone wasting their time on this. Do yourself a favor and rewatch Ring or Ring O Birthday and witness Sadako the way she was originally conceived to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the 1998 film Ringu aka Ring hit theaters it took the world by storm becoming not only the highest grossing horror film in Japan but spawned two sequels a video game as well as two American versions. With not much word of the series for some time it's back with an allnew installment named for the famous focal point of the series Sadako 3D but can it live up to the creepy nature that made the original film so great or is it just another forgettable sequel to a once great franchise.Sadako 3D follows a high school teacher who discovers Internet footage that her students have been watching of someone's suicide that is rumored to drive anyone who watches it to commit suicide as well. While she doubts it at first she soon discovers that it is actually of a man whose intention is to create chaos in the world by bringing back Sadako and her curse. Initially this film takes some interesting directions shifting the curse from the VHS to update it to the current Internet nature. There are some creative moments using cell phones and computer screens that should have delivered but never really push the envelope the way it should have. Even with these issues the film still could have worked pretty well but due to the decision for 3D they opted to over saturate the film with CGI effects that were not all that great. Part of the charm of the original films was just the pure creepy especially the Sadako character. She did very little in the originals other than climb out of the well and inch towards you but the look and vibe was very effective. Sadly that is all gone with the exception of a few moments until the end when things change completely. This series has always been a cursed haunted genre film but this entry takes it out of that all together at one point turning it into somewhat of a monster film losing the entire point of this series. While it loses the Ring aspect it still could have been pretty cool had they not used some pretty poor CGI to bring these creatures to life.This movie had lots if issues but all stuff that could have still worked well had they not gone complete CG for everything. Fans of the original film will most likely have some real issues with this film as it plays more like a reboot than a sequel and fails to live up to the classic that came before it. Word is that there is a sequel to this film coming as well and hopefully they will take some of the good ideas here and deliver something a lot better.".

	schema:headline " Forget about the original films and you just might enjoy it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Well to start off I haven't really seen the first movies since they came out on video here in Sweden. And I kind of avoided the americanized versions while hearing that they were actually sort of decent. I usually put the original one very high up in my mental list of greatest horror movies but wouldn't say that I'm a rabid fan of the franchise. So when I saw that they made a couple of new ones... in 3D. I actually giggled a bit agreeing that if there's any franchise that would be screaming out for a 3D reimagining it would be the filmseries that is famous for a ghostly figure crawling out of TVsets. So last night I sat down donned my 3D spectacles and fired up the projector to experience this thing on my fairly new 120 inch screen that fills up a good portion of my viewing angle... And afterwards I can say that I really enjoyed it. Honestly yes. I did. But just like the latest Universal Soldier I think it's best viewed forgetting completely that it was supposed to be a sequel. Why? Simply because they aren't even trying to go for the same creepiness that the predecessors went for. Also. I really think that you shouldn't even bother with it if you don't have a 3D setup at home. This movie knows exactly what it is. And its makers aren't fooling themselves about any pretense. It's a 3D horror flick that relies heavily on the 3D for it's impact. Some would say it's cheap in it's scare but if you're in the mood and right mindset it succeeds in its simple startles.Hands hair CGIshatteredglass they all reach out towards the viewer almost as much as the victims in this simple plot. Again. It's a decent ComingAtYa! flick and doesn't try to be anything else.Another thing that I noted while viewing is the camera work. I have seen people criticizing it for being very flat and boring. But I would say that it fits and is very... uhm... Japanese? It is a style that reminds me very much of other rather pragmatic movies and series from the country. They let dialogs play out in masters and the scenes with the almost clichd older policeman reminds me of that kind of really straightfaced almost comical style of shows like Odoru Daisosasen. It also very much reduces the 3D effect to almost 2D at times and I was wondering if this was shot with double cameras or if it was a conversion. It also contrasts wildly to the CominAtYa!shots with out really feeling too much out of place. But yes. I won't fault people who think it's boring. But for me it was a breath of fresh air to see horror with a steady camera that didn't try to only sell the scares with a camera that is constantly jumping around.Finally its plot was an interesting way to move the franchise into a modern world that is quickly forgetting how magnetic tape video was operated. It's quick filled with simple thrills and when I want the creepy I can always go back to the first films. Try it out but again throw out your expectations of what a Ringumovie is supposed to be.".

Again. It's a decent ComingAtYa! flick and doesn't try to be anything else.Another thing that I noted while viewing is the camera work. I have seen people criticizing it for being very flat and boring. But I would say that it fits and is very... uhm... Japanese? It is a style that reminds me very much of other rather pragmatic movies and series from the country. They let dialogs play out in masters and the scenes with the almost clichd older policeman reminds me of that kind of really straightfaced almost comical style of shows like Odoru Daisosasen. It also very much reduces the 3D effect to almost 2D at times and I was wondering if this was shot with double cameras or if it was a conversion. It also contrasts wildly to the CominAtYa!shots with out really feeling too much out of place. But yes. I won't fault people who think it's boring. But for me it was a breath of fresh air to see horror with a steady camera that didn't try to only sell the scares with a camera that is constantly jumping around.Finally its plot was an interesting way to move the franchise into a modern world that is quickly forgetting how magnetic tape video was operated. It's quick filled with simple thrills and when I want the creepy I can always go back to the first films. Try it out but again throw out your expectations of what a Ringumovie is supposed to be.";

The great freedoms of the United States are no longer as the once great nation has sealed off its borders and become a militarized police state censoring all film art literature and communications. Even so a small resistance force led by two revolutionaries manages to fight the oppression. With full control over the media the government attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is The Running Man hosted by Damon Killian. When a peaceful protest of starving citizens gathers in Bakersfield California a police officer named Ben Richards is ordered to fire on the crowd which he refuses to do. Subdued by the other officers the attack is carried out and Richards is framed for the murder of almost a hundred unarmed civilians. Following a daring jail break months later Richards is...";

	schema:headline " A classic futurustic sports scifi action flick  one of Schwarzenegger's decent and underrated films";
	schema:reviewBody "I do not think this movie is average bad slow or terrible I disagree with critics who dislike this movie. This movie is fast paced entertaining decent scifi futuristic action flick from the 80's that Schwarzenegger started it and he was decent! I love this film to death and it is my fourth personal favorite Schwarzenegger movie. You want to dislike Schwarzenegger movie? Go and watch Maggie Sabotage Aftermath Terminator Genisys The Expendables 3 and Killing Gunther those movies incredible suck!!!!!!! The Running Man is near bad as people are claiming. No the movie is a classic futuristic sports scifi action film that evolves around a game show in the future it is filed with action and blood squibs. I grew up watching this movie I have this film on Bluray I used to had it on VHS but not anymore. It is part of my childhood and I have grave up watching this movie. I have enjoy it and I still do. I am huge Schwarzenegger fan from my childhood and I am definitely going to consider this movie as my all time favorite film. It is decent and excellent performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger in which he has to play against his will in a game show called The Running Man and he is the only man who can survive the game. The film is very loosely based on the 1982 novel of the same name written by Stephen King. The film's story set in a dystopian United States between 2017 and 2019 is about a television show called The Running Man where convicted criminal runners must escape death at the hands of professional killers. The Running Man has convicts in which they have to run while the stalkers are chasing them and are killing them. The Stalkers are Subzro Professor Toru Tanaka Dynamo Erland Van Lidth Captain Freedom Jesse Ventura  Buzzsaw Gus Rethwisch and Fireball Jim Brown. The Runners are Ben Richards Arnold Schwarzenegger William Laughlin Yaphet Kotto Harold Weiss Marvin J. McIntyre and Amber Mendez Maria Conchita Alonso. Maria Conchita Alonso was a great babe as Ben Richards love interest I love her in this movie so much. She was also in Predator 2. Jesse Ventura was excellent as Captain Freedom he played in Predator with Schwarzenegger and he played in Batman  Robin third time with Schwarzenegger in the row. You have Kurt Fuller from Ghostbusters II in this movie and he is excellent. Paul Michael Glaser directed well the film and showed us a future we living it. Richard Dawson as Damon Killian was a great bad guy and I have enjoyed him as an actor in the film. I really love this film to death I love the music from Harold Faltermeyer which was an excellent score. I love the soundtrack to this movie Restless Heart by John Parr in which it is badass song I have ever hear about it. I love showgirls in this movie I love the action. I love Ben Richards fighting with Buzzzsaw Gus Rethwisch with a chainsaw like in a horror slasher movie. Ben fighting against Subzero Professor Toru Tanaka in which Subzero was a hockey player. Those stalkers chassed their competitors. While Ben Richards and his friends are trying to out run them. The show host was Damon Killian Richard Dawson who pit it Ben Richards against his stalkers. Of course Richards Arnold Schwarzenegger said Killian I will be back. I really love Schwarzenegger famous lines. Ben Richards is an ex cop who was framed for a massacre he never committed he escaped from prison but got captured and pitted in a game show. 9 score this movie not bad or average like people are claiming it is Schwarzenegger's solid scifi action entertaining film and yea not a and one at all. It is my fourth favorite Schwarzenegger film the first one will always be Terminator 2 Judgment Day second one will be Predator Third one will be Commando and the fourth one will be The Running Man. I really miss movies like this special effect are good for the 80's it is Rated R it has bloody squibs it come out the same year as RoboCop Predator and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 The Dream Warriors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all Arnold's mid'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been farfetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn't more controversial as the last it's a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have 'courtappointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.The biggest message of all is 'You are being lied to'. It's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. It's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. Usually it's far from the real truth.Although rather different than Stephen King's book the ending is completely changed the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula. Yes he does have numerous and very corny oneliners and he does say 'I'll be back' which he never REALLY said that often anyway when you think about it in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not.The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself Paul Michael Glaser. It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis not a director I particularly like was attached before Glaser though no matter who directs the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.First of all Harold Faltermeyer's score remember him? is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. Apart from the dated feel the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shootout that passes as the climax.This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hidefinition 1.851 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best remasters I've seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries a trailer and a 'Meet the Stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.".

The Running Man is always all time Entertaining very fast entertaining SciFi Action by novel ever made. My in depth movie review and retrospective of the underrated 80's scifi action classic and one of my personal favorite films. As a kid I always loved this movie is the third best action movie in my opinion I love The Running Man to death this movie was also made after success of Predator with co starring Jesse Ventura who opposite started with Schwarzenegger in Predator. Very underrated 80's scifi action classic and one of my personal favorite films I love this movie to death is my number 3 best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.The film is very underrated and very bashed and hated from the other critics and fans. In my opinion is very great fun Science Fiction Action film about a convicts who has to fight for survival in a game show. The film set in a dystopian America between 2017 and 2019 is about a television show called The Running Man where convicted criminal runners must escape death at the hands of professional killers.1987 was a busy year for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Given his meteoric rise into the ranks of Hollywood's action elite he accepted the opportunity to play the leading role in two science fiction films within the same year Predator and The Running Man. The themes and setting couldn't have been more distant yet they both garnered widespread acclaim and helped bolster the former bodybuilder's career. I've always felt Predator is a superior picture to The Running Man and imagine most scifi fans would agree but when it comes to pure mindless entertainment this is the disc to reach for.The action sequences were great outstanding the CGI wasn't in it at all it was barely in it. The film is fast and very Entertained. The Running Man may not be the greatest 80's action flick but it's still a relevant entry in the genre and well worth your time. Arnold Schwarzenegger was very very skeptical of Paul Michael Glazer been the director of the movie. And he thought it was terrible choose for Pal Michael Glazer because he was the last replacement. For me the film is fine and It doesn't look like a TV show. I don't think it is a TV show. I have enjoyed very much as anyone else did. I think The Running Man it's a film that it is a lot of deeper than people are giving a credits for. I really enjoy this underrated 1987 Scifi action film with Arnold Schwarzenegger! It was fun pure adrenaline pumping game showtyped flick that's set in a futuristic time loosely based on a Stephen King novel. It was great to see Richard Dawson coming from the original Family Feud to played an evil game show host. Lots of great action scenes all around. Arnold delivering his one liners w perfect timing....such a shame this film wasn't a big hit...but its now a cult classic. I always think Maria Alonso Arnold's hottest co star. They have great chemistry. Maria is Arnold's typeI wish they had more scenes together.THE YEAR IS 2019. Television is now ruling people's lives. The most popular audience participation game show is The Running Manwhere convicts can win pardons instead of parting gifts by defeating murderous henchman known as stalkers. The stalkers haven't had much of a challenge lately...until Ben Richards Schwarzenegger comes along.The Running Man 1987 is a cult classic film with Arnold Schwarzenegger based on Stephen King's Novel the most underrated film and one of my all time favorite films I love this film to death. The stalkers in the game show Pofessor Subzero Buzzsaw Captain Freedom Fireball and Dynamo are one the most memorable characters in the film Professor Toru TanakaGus Rethwisch Jesse Ventura Jim Brown and Erland Van Lidth De Jeude did a wonderful job portraying the stalkers in the game show in the film.

Dawson is perfectly irritating as the TV presenter and all the 'Stalkers' are suitably camp. The action is violent but its an action film. That's the point. The film is fast paced and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. With Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser at the helm and made in the wake of the success of The Terminator previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for Arnold and very far fetched. But today anyone who watches a lot of TV could see how the film is getting closer to reality. I wouldn't be surprised if I turn on the TV in the 'near future' and see a show not to far from this.On that depressing note I must however recommend 'The Running Man' to anyone who likes the 80s Arnold ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film. 9. 5  10".

	schema:reviewBody "Arnold stars as a wrongly convicted federal criminal who escapes a futuristic prison. Once out he promptly is recaptured and put on a television show called the Running Man. A show where one must make his way through a labyrinth being pursued by trackers that include a chainsaw wielding maniac to a hockey playing sumo. It makes for an entertaining ride though it differs greatly from the Richard Bachman novel from which it came from aka Stephen King. In that story there was no game show arena rather you just went to the outside world trying to elude the trackers as best you could and the longer you kept hidden from them the more money your family got. Here it is different and look who is in it. With Arnold you need larger than life villains to go against him and also of note is Richard Dawson who is actually rather good as the host of the demented show. Let's face it though he isn't exactly differing drastically from what he used to do all the time. So what do you get here? Lot's of action and wham bam finish and a little social commentary thrown in for good measure.

	schema:reviewBody "The Running Man is based on a story by Richard Bachman a.k.a. Stephen King writing under pseudonym. It takes place in the near future where everything is run by the media and the government. Kind of like right now. In the future there isn't much selection on television. All there is is The Running Manhosted by Damon Killian Richard Dawson host of Family Fortune in real lifea show that features convicts or runners being chased by madmen or stalkers. It's a bit like a futuristic gladiator sport. No one ever ever wins the show. But Schwarzenegger has yet to play. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards also known as The Butcher of Bakersfield for firing upon a crowd of humans in a food strike. Only one problem. He's been framedhe never shot anyone. After Arnie escapes from jail Damon Killian wants his hands on him for the showso they hunt him down and bring him in. Damon offers Ben a dealif he goes on the show he'll let his friends from jail go free. But if he doesn't...he puts his friends on. So Richards agrees to play the game only to find that Damon has put his friendsfromjail in the show anyway. Right before being launched in the arena Ben Richards says to Damon Hey Damon. I'll be back. There is a pause. Only in a rerun Damon says. Yeah right.This movie is about as actionpacked and adrenalinepunched an action movie you're going to see in a while. We see an excuse for Schwarzenegger being thrown into an arena with killers where he must use his brains strategy and most of all muscles to kill the stalkers. But the thing is the excuse for throwing Schwarzenegger in the arena is a good one. They didn't completely ignore the plot they don't even throw him in the arena until at least a half hour into the film. They set up the plot first which is nice.Arnold proves his acting talent is not just in his muscles once again. Too many people make fun of Schwarzenegger's acting skills but to tell you the truth I prefer him over Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone any day. Bruce and Sly are mumblers in my opinion. Anyway I like Arnold in this movie because unlike in The Terminator where he is an indestructible cyborg he is a vincible human with emotions in this film. We see a different side to Schwarzenegger and it's pretty nice.Richard Dawson is surprisingly good as Damon. I love his charisma on screen. Of course he's good at playing a gameshow hosthe himself was onebut he also has a very good acting talent. Check out the scene where he offers Arnold a deal for going on the show. Look how smug he is in that scene and how well he delivers his lines. He envelops his character very well. An underrated actor if ever I saw one. He comes off slightly creepy and slightly likable.This movie is good fun no matter how you slice and dice it. I've often noticed it has a bit of a weird vibe to it but then I realized that's just the scififuturistic vibe of the film. I've felt it before when watching scifi films. There's something about them. When I watch a film or a certain genre I get different vibes. Scifi gives me a weird vibe that is undescribable. This film gives that vibe to me. It sounds weird but I think a lot of people get vibes and don't realize it.I recently viewed this movie twice in less than a day once at night and once in the morning. It just goes to show how easy it is to watch. It is strictly a fun action film with lots of imagination and charisma. Easy to watch with a high rewatch factor.What would you rather do with 90 minutes of your life on a Friday night then watch Arnold Schwarzenegger get to knock some skulls together in a gladiator arena? Exactly.45 stars ".

It's set up like a game show where the audience votes for their favorite stalkers trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky contestants. Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is played by none other than Family Feud's Richard Dawson who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. When Ben Richards Arnold is falsely accused of mass murder he is forced to play this sadistic game.This movie is chock full of classic Arnold oneliners such as his famous I'll be back right before he enters the arena. And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with How about a light? I could go on and on but I don't want to spoil the movie. It's funny stuff!Whether it was intended or not this movie serves as a great parody of today's Reality TV craze. Already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are televised for their entertainment value. Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom and it is a scary picture. One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far.Overall this is a fun film  I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!".

	schema:headline " Cheesy prophetic and classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films.But give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book true but I doubt whether Hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and socalled 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current form.But on with the review.Ben Richards Arnold Schwarzenegger is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a governmentmedia conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like Jumping for Dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is The Running Man a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian played by the entertaining Richard Dawson where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical prowrestingesquire 'stalkers'.Some however try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield California a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' i.e. kill the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader Yaphet Kotto and goes on the run.However his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez Marita Conchita Alonso in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man.And there of course the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the postapocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds? and forced to run from the 'stalkers' along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her then? So as Amber Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent.Yes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns 'He had to split' being my favourite and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host watch out for the cursing old lady! and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.If you expect a highbrow intelligent film you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick well this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.If you look at the entertainment we have today you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays  shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV.

	onyx:emotionText "The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films.But give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book true but I doubt whether Hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and socalled 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current form.But on with the review.Ben Richards Arnold Schwarzenegger is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a governmentmedia conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like Jumping for Dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is The Running Man a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian played by the entertaining Richard Dawson where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical prowrestingesquire 'stalkers'.Some however try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield California a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' i.e. kill the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader Yaphet Kotto and goes on the run.However his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez Marita Conchita Alonso in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man.And there of course the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the postapocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds? and forced to run from the 'stalkers' along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her then? So as Amber Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent.Yes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns 'He had to split' being my favourite and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host watch out for the cursing old lady! and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.If you expect a highbrow intelligent film you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick well this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.If you look at the entertainment we have today you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays  shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that however with the ghoulish alQaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.With that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the farsightedness of this film. Of course we haven't reached there yet as it's terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...";

	schema:reviewBody "If you were a child of the 80s there's a good chance that at school you were lent a copy of The Running Man. And there's also a pretty good chance that you thought it was the nuts. But now that the decade of excess homoeroticism has been left behind and now that easily pleased children have grown up it's clear that The Running Man is pretty well crap.The Running Man's most obvious shortcoming is its production values. Runners run around in quilted suits that resemble mattresses glass lollipops serve as the ominous warning beacons that mark the point of no return for prisoners who don't want to have their heads blown off Dynamo drives about in a car that appears to be made of Lego fascist soldiers capture criminals with the terror that is a small red net the wasteland that is the game quadrant appears to repeat itself HannaBarbera style computers resemble BBC Micros and the opening crawl looks like it was typed on the aforementioned computer. It's a cheap cheap film.However despite the fact that it's cheap despite the fact that it looks like sludge was smeared over the lenses despite the fact that it was filmed by Detective Dave Starsky and despite the fact that the film repeats the words 'uplink' 'relay' 'network' 'interface' 'satellite' and 'resistance' so many times that I want to remove them from the dictionary Newspeakstyle there's still plenty to enjoy. The film's the epitome of a guilty pleasure.What you most expect from a 80s Arnie film is homoeroticism and in that regard the film certainly delivers. The first shot of Arnie post Bakersfield massacre is of him carrying a massive steel girder on his shoulder it's a repeat of the shot in Commando where you're introduced to Schwarzenegger with the visual of him carrying a huge log. And no sooner has the film started than he's grabbing men by their privates and smoking unfeasibly large cigars.But there's also Killian the Bobby Heenanstyle game show host. When he first sees Arnie running musclesabulging in dreamy slowmotion he says Hello gorgeous. And in the course of the scene he also says Isn't he beautiful? and shouts I want him! I bet he's got a steel girder in his pants. But when he first meets Arnie face to face he coos Hi cutie pie. Now I've got a steel girder too.But as logfriendly as this banter is it's amateur league punk stuff when you compare it to the Captain Freedom workout. Jesse Ventura appears on the screen shouting Are you ready for pain? Are you ready for suffering? If the answer is yes then you're ready for Captain Freedom's workout. Tent city.Another great detail is Arnie's disguise when he's on the run from the law. He walks around with a thick beard a gym tshirt which is ripped to show off as much of his neck and biceps as possible and a yellow builder's hat. Maybe he ransacked the local YMCA.But the film also delivers in terms of amusing deaths. Of course the most obvious are the stalker deaths. You've got Fireball exploding SubZero wearing a barbed wire necktie Dynamo being electrocuted midrape in his saggy kecks and best of all Buzzsaw getting castrated  I love his falsetto scream. But you've also got a prisoner having his head blown off while his body keeps running and my personal favourite Killian going through a sign in that toboggan thing. But what makes the Killian death my favourite is the way the sign explodes when Killian goes through it. It's totally unnecessary but that's what makes it great.Just as unnecessary are Arnie's atrocious puns. But their awfulness is what makes them so brilliant. He had to split. What a hot head. Yeah he was a pain in the neck. Even Roger Moore would be proud. But Arnie's best piece of dialogue is considerably more subtle. After Yaphet Kotto dies and after he's made an offer by Killian to become a stalker Arnie grabs a camera and yells I live to see you eat that contract but I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine! Poetry.Not quite as poetic though is the final shootout. Basically Arnie and a bunch of soldiers who look like members of Culture Club invade the studio and reveal the truth. It's a dull action scene although I like the way that Arnie like Charles Bronson can avoid bullets simply by ducking. Plus Arnie for some reason spares the bloodthirsty mob. Surely I can't be the only one that was hoping he'd open fire on the crowd  especially on that old granny  and establish a Ben Richards dictatorship? But no in a typically unRepublican way Arnie wants freedom. And he also gets the girl and walks off with her to the sound of some abysmal 80s power ballad. Personally I think it would have been more convincing if he'd walked off arminarm with Killian's bodyguard Sven.".

Gone.A real shame and a missed opportunity for a truly great film and given the events on 911 probably missed permanently now  certainly no one is going to finance a remake with the original ending intact these days.So my advice is to see the film before you read the book.  If you like the film then the book will come as a revelation and you will see my point of view but if you have read the book already then give the film a wide berth as you are bound to be disappointed.However it is not a total loss  viewed independantly of the book it is a reasonable Arnie movie PMG does a pretty good job directing and the effects are OK for the time too.

	schema:reviewBody "The Running Man is everything a film should be. It has copious amounts of violence plenty of oneliners and a clever storyline. Arnie plays his usual type of character the badass strongman up against the system. Running Man was made in the late 80s one of the glory eras for action films. Back then violence counted and in this film there is more than enough to keep you entertained. There are plenty of highlights but the best scene is probably when Arnie chainsaws his enemy a rather fat and sweaty 'chaser' between the legs. Suffice to say said 'chaser' does not enjoy the experience...... Other highs include the big shootout at the end when Arnie leads a small Army of computer geeks into battle with his trademark cigar taking pride of place in his mouth. Richard Dawson is superb as the sleazy game show host Killion and his teteatete with Arnie at the end is excellent! The music is your typical 80s pumping rock and suits the tone of the film very well. Of course the writers are assuming that in the future there will be a huge 80s revival but there you go.... This is certainly one of Arnie's best outings. Its just a shame that today's movies are so tame. They would do well to replicate Running Man's levels of action.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Running Man is very silly. They use silly sound effects the helicopter has a jet sound effect the M16s have hand gun sound effects and there were a couple more examples I laughed about but can't remember now. The plot is a ridiculous but irresistible near future dystopian society that uses gladiator games to quell the masses and take their minds from their empty bellies. I've no doubt this movie would have been long forgotten if not for some very charismatic and memorable performances by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson. Jesse Ventura also appears with what looks to be a very bad toupee but isn't given much to do. My biggest pet peeve with this movie is the poor editing we jump from scene to scene at times too abruptly. It isn't as if you'll have trouble following the story but five minutes edited back in would have given the movie much better flow. Still this is an action movie and Arnold delivers while also delivering his trademark one liners.".

Inmates are given a chance for pardon  all they have to do is survive an on going game with specially trained gladiatorsassassins . Arnold and his friends taking on a series of massive opponents armed with flame throwers  spikes scythes chainsaws . This exciting film contains action  thrills suspense  blood  a little bit of humor and is plenty of graphical violence . Special effects laden adaptation of the Stephen King novel  under his Richard Bachman pseud  he wrote the story in 72 hours and was screenwritten by Steven Souza  the film is based very loosely on the novel of the same name . The story deals with a futuristic TV game show in which each game are selected some convicts to participate in a brutal manchase wherein felons are given the chance to run to freedom but have to elude the stalkers  men who hunt them down and kill them in gruesome manners . 'The Running Man' game seen in the film was based upon an early 1980's Japanese game show called 'Trans American Ultra Quiz' in which contestants were tortured in various ways and the prize went to whichever contestant could stand the painhumiliation the longest . The movie displays strong and realistic fights and excellent action sequences with bloody attacks and violent  blistering struggles . The picture belong to dystopian world genre as well as the tyrannical control by the government of 1984 and death games films such as Battle Royale Kinji Fukasaku and the recent Hunger GamesGary Ross. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an appropriate and powerful warrior  he steals the spectacle as one army man  as enemies are dispatched in turn  in addition  he holds the brief comic relief . Dolph Lundgren and Christopher Reeve were interested to star in the movie and Patrick Swayze had also been considered. Arnold  Governor of California  along with Maria Conchita Alonso have both starred in the Predator movies. Jesse Ventura  Governor of Minnesota  starred in the first Predator film . Ample plethora of secondary actors give bouncing performances as Professor Tanaka  Jim Brown  Yaphet Kotto  Zappa  Fleetwood and SvenOle Thorsen . Furthermore  Erland van Lidth's and Richard Dawson's last film. Thrilling and commercial musical score by Harold Faltermeyer  it was composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth . The motion picture lavishly produced by Rob Cohen was well directed by Paul Michael Glaser Starsky and Hutch . Rating  Good . Well worth watching .".

Hosted by the extremely smarmy Damon Killian Richard Dawson incredibly well cast it offers convicted criminals their own chance at freedom  IF they can evade the executioners who dress in colorful costumes and who are referred to as Stalkers.The Running Man offers a fair bit of food for thought. Now that we've actually reached the year in which this movie takes place it makes us think about the world we live in and where we're possibly headed. Much like Network 11 years before it The Running Man became a prophetic movie depicting the advent of socalled reality television in our society. And it also makes us think about how the media may be constantly manipulating information before we ever get to see it.Not that The Running Man is all substance and no style of course. It's also a tried and true Arnold vehicle in which he gets to strut his stuff and offer up a oneliner every time he overcomes an antagonist. Here is Sub Zero. Now Plain Zero! The lighting the sets and the costumes are a delight to behold in this portrayal of a Dystopian future where the unruly lower class are held in check by being delivered the lurid thrills of this game show. Harold Faltermeyers' music is catchy as it always is. There is some potent violence although the squeamish should know that the gore doesn't really get all that hard for them to handle.Arnold is supported by a pretty eclectic mix of performers Maria Conchita Alonso as his feisty leading lady Yaphet Kotto and Marvin J. McIntyre as his prison associates Jim Brown Jesse Ventura Erland Van Lidth whose final film this was Bernard Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka as assorted Stalkers and musicians Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa. Familiar faces in small roles include SvenOle Thorsen Edward Bunker Kurt Fuller Ken Lerner Dey Young Thomas Rosales Jr. and Lin Shaye. Although designed as an Arnold vehicle it's Dawson that really makes The Running Man come to life.A very fun movie that if anything looks better today than it did when it first came out.Loosely based on a novel by Richard Bachman a.k.a.

	schema:headline " Without a doubt one of Arnolds top five films.";
	schema:reviewBody "Arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives. But as the tag line says Arnold has yet to play! The movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen controlling every aspect of life through TV and a police state. It's most popular game show is The Running Man in which criminals are forced to survive against Stalkers that live to kill them.The movie opens with Ben Richards Arnold leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress. He is ordered by his superiors to fire on them refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help. The government blames Richards for the massacre earning him the name Butcher of Bakersfield. Eighteen months later Richards along with two friends William Laughlin Koto and Harold Weiss McIntyre breakout of a detention zone they worked in. They make their way to the underground led by Mic Mick Fleetwood. Mic quickly identifies Richards as the Butcher of Bakersfield and refuses to help him but his friend's convince him otherwise. They want him to join the resistance but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job. Soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name Amber Mendez Alonso has taken his apartment. Knowing who he is she won't help him but he convinces her but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out.Meantime The Running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill. Damon Killian Dawson the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees Richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture. Richards refuses to play Killian threatens to use his friends instead of him so he signs the contract. You'll love that part. But soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure Killian knows he'll be back. The Runners begin to make there way through the Zones and fight characters that are memorable SubZero Buzz Saw and many others. Eventually Richards is joined by Amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too. Together they find the underground and make there way back to Killian and give him a farewell send off.The running man is another one of Arnold's great movies from the 80's. The movie was apparently somewhat based on Stephen King's book of the same name. Some have said that the book is better. I'm sure it's not and I don't care anyway I loved the movie. As in all of Arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from Arnold and even Ventura gets a couple in. But without a doubt Richard Dawson is the standout in this film. Being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded. The whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you. Keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows hate boat among others. Also the cast was great besides Arnold Koto and Alonzo don't forget Professor Toru Tanaka Jim Brown Ventura and SvenOle! With all the reality TV nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now but I'm sure the Hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the Evil Bush. The new DVD had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one. Some how the ACLU managed to get some of there communism into the DVD and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an Arnold movie of all things. Blasphemy! Overall for any Arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him you can't miss this. Its one of the first ones I saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day. The futuristic world and humor are great. Overall 10 out 10 stars definitely one of his best.".

And times are toughinsufficient box office mounting company debts no money to pay performers train fares hotels restaurants. Much of the film involves the lives of three of the women performers. There's Franca Tamara Lees who is engaged to Carlo Marcello Mastroianni in one of his earliest appearances.  She leaves him to attempt to find fame and fortune in show business. There's Vera Delia Scala who finds true love during the course of the movie and Margherita Gina Lollobrigida who has show business in her blood is devoted to Martoni during good times and bad and ends up by film's end with a first rate company.  Franca on the other hand in marrying a rich industrialist for his money and realizing she has lost her true love in the process commits suicide by jumping out a window.The cast is an incredibly good array of the Italian screen's top performers. Fabrizi's weaselly manner is a wonder to behold and his scene with a hotel manager unwilling to accept a check in payment for the troupe's stay is a little masterpiece. Nino Rota did the nice musical score as well as providing some of the song numbers along with Fabrizi and Mario Ruccione. They have real appeal.  Directed by Mario Monicelli and Steno Stefano Vanzina both major directors of comedy for many decades to follow the movie deserves to be resurrected and shown in  commedia all'italiana programs.".

Karan Shergill played by Hrithik Roshan a very sincere actor is like any other person who wants to know what he wants to be. Inspired by his friend he applies for military school and joins it and then his journey of becoming a MAN from a BOY starts... Performances Hrithik Roshan Great performance just awesome. This actor is the brightest actor in Bollywood today. His performance in KMG was highly appreciated and this performance is on par with his KMG act. Om Puri great actor.. some of the really great dialogs were given to him.. He is a living legend. Amitabh Bachchan Great performance His eyes and silence in the movie say a lot more than words. Preity Zinta good performance the character wasn't wellsketched but still good efforts from her side in some of the scenes. Sushant Singh This actor is superb one more underrated great performance of him after his awesome acting in TLOBS. Boman Irani This man is good in everything. His telephone scene with Hrithik Roshan was great. One of the best scenes in the movie.Overall A very wellmade movie. Great acting by almost everyone in the cast. Great choreography great cinematography and fantastic direction. Keep it up Hrithik Farhan and Ritesh the young producer 9.510 Almost perfect".

The movie has a very good story and the director has done a very good job. Priety and Rhitik acted magnificently. The songs are very melodious and really make sense to the movie. The movies is picturized brilliantly with the optimum use of special effects. Few scenes from Kargil are truly breathtaking. Its a family entertainer which has everything for everyone. You got to be either a fool or a propakistani to hate this movie. I am rating it as 10 out 10 because it deserves that. I wish to see more movies like this in future.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is all about having a LAKSHYA aim in our lives. It would'nt be inappropriate at all to comment that this film in one way points out at today's indecisive youth who are not clear about what they are going to do of their lives and change their focus every now and then.The story is about Karan Hrithik Roshan who is very talented but utterly confused about his future. Rather his girlfriend Romila Preity Zinta has since the very beginning ambition of being a news channel correspondent. Karan's indecisiveness widens the gap between him and his father Boman Irani who expects nothing from his son and the same thing ultimately results in his breakup with Romila too. This changes Karan's life and he gets determined of getting in the army and passes out from the IMA Indian Military Academy with a very enviable record. At the same time Romila too becomes a successful news channel correspondent. But both of them don't know what their futures has in store for them. They meet again after the turmoil in Romila's life from a broken engagement and this time the backdrop is the picturesque Kashmir valley and the event being the Kargil war. Karan has been deputed there as an army officer and Preity comes for a live coverage of the war. The story now flows ahead with the attempt of Indian forces to get back peak no.5179 from the Pakistani forces and the intersection of Karan's and Romila's lives at many instances acting as the currents. The ending is predictable but yet you would love to watch it.The movie is yet another masterpiece from Farhan Akhtarthe Director after the tremendous success of Dil Chahta Hai. This is also yet another testimony of Javed Akhtar's writing prowess. The lyrics and dialogues are superb. Moreover the choreography Prabhu Deva and photography Christopher Popp are worthy of praises. Hrithik Roshan gives another flawless performance after Koi Mil Gaya. Another attraction is Colonel Sunil Damle Amitabh Bachchan. Amitabh Bachchan gives those dialogues a beauty and charm which is so characteristic to himself. Preity Zinta is good in her role too. You can't pinpoint anybody or anything specifically as that would diminish other's efforts as all of them have performed commendably. The backdrop of Kashmir valley and the Himalayas has been so beautifully captured in the frame. Also the war scenes look so much authentic which is very tough job to do. The running time of the film is above 3 hours but you can't realize that  you can't help it as you get fully engrossed in the film...... Hrithik's dancing skills are unveiled so beautifully yet again. He can easily claim to have a rubber bodyso flexibleso much in tune with the rhythm. Good music from ShankarEhsaanLoy trio once again. Actually i could'nt think of any flaw in the movie as every aspect has been given it's due attention.I would claim it to be a must watch movie and rate it a hefty 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "When your first film is 'Dil Chahta Hai' a movie that not only clicks with Urban audiences all over India redefines cool amongst the aspiring yuppie crowd and stylistically influences the Chopras Johars and other filmmakers in terms of what GenNext wears and does there are going to be huge expectations from your second effort.Director Farhan Akhtar does not disappoint with Lakshya the story of an urbanite Delhi slacker named Karan Shergill Hrithik Roshan who's just graduated from college and is still not sure what he wants to be when he grows up. His patient girlfriend Romi Preity Zinta loves him and is confident that he will excel in whatever he sets out to do but even she is beginning to get weary of his attitude towards his life and their relationship. On a whim Karan decides to join the Indian Army clearing their grueling entrance exam with a friend. It's a decision that puts further strain on Karan's relationship with his overbearing father played masterfully by Boman Irani.Once in boot camp however Karan is unable to withstand the pressure  discipline that army life places on new cadets. He drops out of the academy after a few weeks and reunites with Romi at their favorite spot. Romi is however devastated to hear Karan has dropped out and decides to end their relationship once and for all citing that Karan has no aim in life whatsoever. This turn of events pushes Karan to return to the army and to finish what he started  for Romi and more importantly for himself. It is at this point that the fatherson pair of Javed  Farhan Akhtar make things interesting by weaving the fictional story of Karan together with an actual piece of 20th Century Indian Army history.Fans of 'Dil Chahta Hai' may be surprised at how less lighthearted the tone of the movie is especially in the second half where it strays into the realm of pure action. What Farhan displays here is how adept he is at managing realistic action and provides a fresh look at the war genre free from the clichridden plots of J P Dutta. Amitabh Bachchan makes a memorable appearance as Karan's superior officer who leads our protagonist to a final tangible Lakshya aimgoaltarget. Cinematography in the mountain ranges of Kashmir is wonderful and as is becoming apparent with Farhan's films the story in extremely grounded and rarely leaps into the realm of 'farfetched'. The music by ShankarEhsanLoy suits the tone of the movie and Farhan wisely limits the number of songs to carefully selected arenas. He does however recognize that in Hrithik Roshan he has the most gifted dancer in Bollywood and in the song 'Main Aisa Kyon Hoon' he lets his star cut loose in a wonderfully choreographed piece by Prabhu Deva. I think it is Hrithik's greatest performance on the dance floor to date.Finally onto Hrithik himself someone who I've admired more for his dexterity in dance scenes than for his acting chops. Hrithik delivers his best performance to date in Lakshya I thought he was over the top in Koi...Mil Gaya and manages to capture the initial confusion and eventual determination of Karan wonderfully. When his character returns to military training you see his metamorphosis into a man obsessed. The scene where he reconciles with his father over the phone before setting out on his mission is dignified and soulful. You really believe that Karan's dad has accepted his son's decision. Finally when Karan reunites with Romi after years of army service and points out to her with sincerity This is my Lakshya you believe in the conviction of this young man. This it truly Hrithik's movie all the way and for once his theatrics outshine his foot skills.Lakshya is mainstream Bollywood cinema with a difference. Just as with 'Dil Chahta Hai' there is a 'hatke' quality about this film which audiences should appreciate. Farhan doesn't make conventional 9 song love stories and he doesn't need to. His unique vision is a welcome addition to Bollywood. With Lakshya there is a lot of maturity in his storytelling and direction. The actiondrama quotient has been upped in favor of humor which was a smart decision considering how sensitive and serious the final act is.In a final note some people have commented that the factual incident weaved into the storyline  Javed Akhtar's remarks on the matter means that 'Lakshya' is an AntiPakistan film. I would suggest instead that it is a proarmy and prodetermination if that's a word film. Karan's example shows us that if we focus our minds onto achieving one task then no power on earth can prevent us. If we look inside ourselves and dedicate our energy on achieving our Lakshya then nothing is impossible. One now expects great things from Farhan Akthar's 'Don'.".

The music fit perfectly I have never heard Indian music like this before this is something new for Bollywood a lot different than A.R Rehman's style.Shanker Eashan and Loy produces great music Dil Chata Hai Kal Ho Na Ho and now Lakshya! The music brings the movie to life especially the background themes. I wish you could buy the background themes on CD. I will definitely be buying this movie on DVD!!!I give it a rating of 1010!

	schema:reviewBody "Farhan Akthar has to live upto his debut 'Dil Chahta Hain'  a feat which will be difficult to match. FA will carry the DCH label forever much like Ramesh Sippy was labeled with the Sholay tag. Comparing Lakshya with DCH is inevitable. And FA does score in many places. The story is quite simple. The setting is in late 1990s  just prior to the infamous Kargil. Roshan is Karan Shergill the younger sibling in a well to do Delhi business family. Karan is a happygolucky naive kid who has nothing to worry about in his life. His lady love Romila Gutta aka Romy Zinta on the other hand is a career minded young lady who has a clear idea what to do with her life. When placed at crossroads when all his friends are deciding about their future career prospects Karan is influenced by one of his friends' decision and plans to join the Army. And to his own surprise finds himself in the Army training school. However this sudden transition from his Bohemian lifestyle to army life proves to be more than he can handle and he quits the course. However Karan realises that things will never be the same again with Romy who clearly sees him as a quitter a loser with no ambitions no goalsThat's Lakshya in Hindi in life. Hurt and dejected Karan joins the Army training again and comes out as a hardboiled Lieutenent.Karan is posted in the volatile Dras sector Kashmir. Here meets the stiff focused Col. Damle Mr. Bachchan and his troops who make Karan realize that his Lakshya is to serve the country. Before long there is a war brewing in the mountains with Pakistani insurgents blocking out the supplies to various army bases high up in the mountains. Karan suddenly finds himself responsible for his country's safety and plays a key role in winning the battle against the intruders. His Lakshya is met. Technically the film is brilliant. One of the first army movies made in Bollywood without an overdose of jingoism. German cinematographer Christopher Popp captures the night war sequences beautifully. The natural beauty of the rugged Ladakh has been brought to the screen in its whole. FA is a fine eye for the minor details e.g. the name plates on the vehicles are in white letters written on black boards like they were prior to 20012. The tense screens between Roshan and his father played by the inimitable Boman Irani are excellent. The film was conceived very very well. However since nothing is perfect no review is complete without some criticism. Lakshya has its faults  and most of these are because we had expected otherwise from the director of DCH. For one there is not much of a script so people watching for killing time will be bored. Unlike most wararmy movies this is more of a drama. Unlike DCH we hardly have a lighthearted moment in the movie. Javed Akthar has returned to script writing after a long gap BUT I had expected more. Second there are too many characters. Many actors in special appearances prove to be more distractions than integral elements of the story. Amitabh has his moments but Om Puri Lillette Dubey and Shushant have been wasted. At points we feel that FA had a hard time to decide whether to keep poppatriotism away from the movie. Songs distract and do not fit in the script unlike DCH. My rating  6.510  for the sincerity with which the movie was made for FA's dedication to his work and for Hritik Roshan's performance.".

His motivation is love he decides to stop drifting and joins the army after a false start he does shape up and then realizes he might have lost his love Romi  Preity Zinta to someone else in the process. Posted near the Kargil border his bravery and dedication to his country is amply tested. He also encounters Romi as a war journalist. In the end he does reach his Lakshya  his goal and achieves personal growth in the process.The movie is beautifully shot in locale in Delhi Dehradun and in Kashmir. The scenery is stunning and some of the war footage is mind blowing. There is a rock climbing episode that will remind the viewer of the Guns of Navarone but is spectacular all the same. Mr. Roshan make a very believable war hero and seems well capable of the heroics he performs. Miss Zinta is good in a not so major role.. The big B is very restrained as Col. Damle and the rest of the cast does their job really well. The music is good except for the first song with Hritik dancing in front of all the mirrors  that is just bad. The story has some inconsistencies  why is she the only journalist at the front line? How did they let her in so close to the fighting? But in the end Lakshya is a serious story about the journey into adulthood and becoming man enough to shoulder responsibilities that come your way. Watch it  but be warned it is not a popcorn flick!".

	schema:reviewBody "Hrithik Roshan brilliantly plays the role of a young man and unlike most Hindi movies a young man everyone can relate to as he is not someone from a different world. this is the story of that young man Karan Shergil and even though war takes the center stage for the better part of the movie. this is not just a war movie this is a movie about the quest of a normal young man the quest to give life a meaning and transformation of a immature youth to a mature man this is about the power of the ego of a man. born with a silver spoon he is indisciplined and aimless then he stumbles and faces the harsh reality of life. Lonely and lost he tries to pull things together and go on to achieve things nobody believed he ever would. One of the most moving scenes of cinema history he calls his father just before embarking on a mission where chances of his survival are next to nothing he apologizes to his father but in reply his father says that he is proud of his son. For me this is the best Hindi movie of all time. Farhan Akhtar's direction is crisp and precise the cinematography of the movie stands out so does a couple of dance sequences. Preity Zinta has tried to look like Barkha Dutta and she is OK Om Puri is impressive in his little cameo but i feel he was underused Amitabh Bachchan is there just to add some extra star power. But this is a Hrithik Roshan movie from start to finish and he manages to pull out the performance of his life. five stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Farhan Akhtar Dil Chahta Hai outdoes himself on his sophomore directorial effort the lesser successful Lakshya which deals with a young man coming of age and trying to find himself in the world. The ever charming Hrithik Roshan plays Karan Shergill a preppy happygolucky slacker who is just comfortable going to school hanging out with his best buddy Romila Dutta Preity Zinta sporting really bad hair in the first half of the film and just taking it easy in his parents house. Everything is fine until one day his father begins to pressure and pester him about what he intends to do with his life then he compares him to his brother who lives and works abroad which brings down Karan's spirit. He Karan tries to seek comfort with Romila but in the long run she stands up to him as well and tells him that if he doesn't give up his slacker ways she cannot continue to hangout with him. Most of this is told in flashback as present day Karan in a quest to prove himself to all of him friends and loved ones has already joined the army and is about embark on a very dangerous journey to secure the Indian perimeter and get rid of Pakistani terrorists. Romila is the reason for most of the flashbacks as her present day self is now a famed reporter and is engaged to somebody else. The chemistry between Zinta and Hrithik is as solid as it has been which is probably why they have starred in so many films together. Every song and piece of music in this film is great especially the song and dance between Karan and Romila and not to mention that knockout 'Main Aisa Kyu Hoon.' Amitabh Bachchan Om Puri Sharad Kapoor Amrish Puri in a very special appearance among others round out the stellar cast in strong supporting roles. It's a great film and cinematographically stunning! India should have been proud but instead the movie was ignored at the box office.".

He is maturing to be a great actor apart from his physical versatility akin to Circe du Solei performer. The Production is good but I am dismayed to the fact that the Indian Producers are not adept at portraying the battle scenesthey all sound like dejavue from the previous movies like LOC. The Enemy is not identified well. The well intended efforts of the young and upcoming director suffers from poor editing. The continuity is disjointed so much so the the relations are fragmented and lack an emotional depth. Preity Zinta who matches Hrithik's acting prowess but she is just average and her short hair makes her look boyish. The Music by SEL is superlative except the background Singers for the team song for the Soldiers should have sounded more Machoit just does't fit the screaming voices as in their training. The pallbearer is Hrithik Roshan who in the few scenes seems to be confused between his Jadoo role and the role of a teenager but does comes out with flying colors towards the end. This is undoubtedly a great actor in making. The movie suffers from a Script writer who is as confused as Karan and drifts between family drama to slopes of Kashmirit gets very predictive. The characters or mere caricature detached and cold as a mountain. Overhaul this is a good Pic but there is nothing to be gungho over it.".

	schema:reviewBody "My romance with Farhan Akhtar's Lakshya started in 2004 when I saw the flick for the first time at a Delhi cinema theater. 4 years down the linethe affair continues. It was an instant connect. The cinematography the characterization the modern 21st century look fantastic news hairdos of the lead actors and the haunting background music that just grows on you. For me Lakshya is definitely in the league of some of the best movies I have ever seen. The Godfather Rocky Pulp Fiction E.T.Extra Terrestrial Million Dollar Baby Gladiator  Forrest Gump were all amazingbut none of them had the soul and the intensity of Lakshya. The film's protagonist Karan Shergill Hrithik Roshan is a rich aimless laid back individual with no ambition or drive in life. Much to his father's dismay while his peers are busy making decisions about their careers and lives in general Karan is happy chilling and just going along with the crowd. His only form of stability comes in the form of Romy Preity Zinta his girlfriend who has a completely different take on life. Independent and ambitious she knows exactly what she wants and how she plans to achieve it. Exasperated by his father's consistent digs and comparisons to his older brother Karan decides to join the army only to give up a few days later. Appalled by his poor attitude Romy dumps him driving Karan to return to the army once again. This time round the experience proves to be a turning point in his life. His attitude soon changes which gradually transforms him into a man who discovers both himself and his future goals. And then from his goal of joining the army to his goal of winning the battle for his countryto his goal of getting the love of his life.he just goes on to achieve things he always wanted. Its not that I have a fondness for underdogsor anything but it's the sheer intensity the sheer energy of this movie that attracts me towards it. There are only two reasons I love Lakshya. One superb characterization by Farhan Akhtar and second Hrithik Roshan looks just perfect as Karan Shergill. Lakshya is without doubt technically exhilarating. An inspiring and polished piece of cinema the movie gets an altogether new meaning due to the cinematography of Christopher Popp which mesmerizes. The peaks of Ladakh and ruins of Delhi have been captured with such finesse it makes you wonder why Bollywood filmmakers shoot abroad when there are such stunning visuals nearer home. The cliffhanging scene coupled with some of the battle sequences too are mind blowing. The music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy though not chart busting matches the mood of the film. It is difficult to forget the thump in the title song Lakshya and the determination on Hrithik's face. Despite good performances by Big B and Zinta the star of the show is undoubtedly Hrithik Roshan who does an excellent job as Karan Shergill. What I like about his character is his transformation from a lazy lout to a man.with determination visible on his face. His performance is so believable that for a moment I really forgot I was sitting inside a cinema theater watching a movie. The first sequence of the movie where Amitabh Bacchan talks about how important it is to do things perfectly and asks Karan Shergill to adjust a painting on his wallthat looks tilted towards one sidereflects the attitude with which the film has been made. Lakshya for me depicts Karan's transformation. It shows how the Army and its disciplined selfless and spartan existence molds an impressionable young individual accustomed to a hedonistic lifestyle into a mature human being who can think and act for himself. A movie I have seen countless number of timesand have enjoyed every bit of.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not many movies have been made in India about someone growing up as a person although every other film is being promoted so. The film according to the director Farhan Akhtar depicts his own life before he ventured out into film making. This is also his second film as a director following the culthit Dil Chahta Hain.The film depicts the story of a person Karan Shergill and how he transitions from being an aimless youth to a mature and confident person. Karan Shergill is a collegegoing guy who has no aim in life. But when he inadvertently takes up an exam and gets selected for IMA Indian Military Academy his life is about to change. He is not aware of the military discipline and ultimately one fine day he runs away from the academy. His parents mock him and his girlfriend scolds him for this decision. What follows is how he corrects his mistake and his ultimate challenge the Kargil war.The movie does not just depict Karan's change but also runs a parallel story of his girlfriend Romi who is a successful and confident woman but who also has to deal with issues of her own. Ultimately both the stories collide on the warfront. The story moves at a relatively slower pace and the both of halves of the movie are completely opposite. It is extremely tough to tell by looking at the other half that this is the other half of the same movie. But that is what the movie is all about!!!!! Directionwise this is the best effort from Farhan Akhtar yet. Many people felt that if it is possible to himself to surpass his directorial debut Dil Chahta Hain. But Farhan Akhtar does a brilliant job does a brilliant job of it. It is really surprising to note that the movie got extremely favourable reviews at the time of its release but was still not a boxoffice hit.Actingwise Hrithik Roshan excels in his portrayal of Karan Shergill. He has brought out the transition of irresponsible aimless youth to a determined and focused person extremely effectively. This should definitely be marked as one of the highlights of his career. Preity Zinta carries on her strong character from DCH and is as important to the story as Hrithik Roshan's character is. Boman Irani and Amitabh Bachchan do splendid jobs of their short on screen time. The rest of the supporting cast specially Sushant Singh are also fabulous.The technical department has done a wonderful job in bringing out the beautiful but deserted locales of Ladakh and Kargil. The war sequences are brilliantly shot. It is the first time in Indian cinema that a war movie looks like a war movie and not like an action movie. But finally the heroes of the movie are Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar.".

Nick is convincing in every way  in this movie even though he has a very hard part playing an ItalianAugusto Odone.Susan Sarandon plays the mother of Lorenzo. It's incredible how she plays the part of a mother near the end of her powers pushing away everybody that does not share the same faith in saving the life of her son.This movie is underrated and should be given a chance.  I seen a lot of movies and normally i do not watch this kind of movies they cannot hold m y attention for long. But this one is different and really heartbreaking.I had never heard about ALD. So today i did some investigation and found out that Lorenzo still lives and you can write him if you want".

Had they not been the exceptionally educated and intelligent people that they were I don't know if they would have been able to accomplish such an unbelievable feat.  Who knows?

At the end of the movie Augusto was involved with a group of scientists who were about to begin trials that would put the myelin back into some puppies who were born with this defect.  I along with others pray for those suffering from this disorder as well as for people with other diseases such as Multiple Schlerosis that this therapy could help that they will be successful.      Sadly Michaela passed away not too long ago.  Being from Virginia the Odone's are considered heros in this state so her death made the papers here.

Even Michaela's own sister is told to leave because she thinks Michaela is losing it. Susan exquisitely shows the pain and sacrifice of a mother watching her son deteriorate while she is basically powerless to stop it. How can I enjoy anything when he enjoys nothing? This question truly reveals Michaela's agony. I think she was criminally robbed of an oscar. I would watch this movie for her performance alone. However this is not all the movie has to offer.

	schema:reviewBody "Scientists have found the gene for shyness. They would have found it years ago but it was hiding behind a couple of other genes.  Jonathan KatzSusan Sarandon and Nick Nolte act their hearts out in Lorenzo's Oil a drama about a couple whose son suffers from Adrenoleucodystrophy ALD a fatal disease that progressively destroys the brain. Directed by the always reliable George Miller and based on a true story the film watches as the couple's son worsens before our eyes the boy eventually becoming paralysed blind and unable to speak.With ALD having no cure and the entire medical profession giving the kid no more than a few months to live Nolte and Sarandon are thus faced with two choices accept the fact that this rare genetic disease will soon kill their child or focus all their efforts on finding a cure.Of course the couple refuse to accept the medical establishment's grim prognosis and instead go off in search of a cure. They spend countless hours in medical libraries days talking to doctors and weeks teaching themselves about the human body. Like detectives reverse engineering a crime scene the couple parse the human body down to its segments and constituents. Afterall biology's nefariously deterministic. Every cause has its effect. If you look hard enough deep enough think ten steps further twenty thirty even then maybe just maybe you've got your miracle.Eventually where the entire medical profession had failed the two ordinary parents succeed. Using an oil which contains a specific chain of fatty acids the couple produce a treatment which helps keep their son alive though the film's happy ending masks a dark truth. Yes in real life the couple's son would live a further 26 years but his brain damage and paralysis would prove irreversible. Likewise though the couple's oil has helped other families and sufferers of ALD over the decades no cure for the disease exists at present.Still forget about the film's Hollywood ending and melodramatic hurdles. Think instead of Lorenzo's Oil as a sadistic horror movie. Like The Exorcist we watch as a previously normal childhousehold is torn apart by a horrific evil. Unlike most horror movies though this evil resides not in the realm of the supernatural but the biological. The genetic your body wants you dead.And so the child degenerates into a mass of paralysed limbs violent convulsions and tormented breaths. Nature  cold and indifferent  has revealed itself to be a horrific ugly thing every organism but one DNA strand away from unimaginable pain and torture. Life's a genetic lottery and there's no worse horror than when biology strikes.So at its best Lorenzo's Oil offers an epic battle between nature our own biochemical makeup DNA RNA a malevolent universe which knows only indifference and science human ingenuity resolve creativity sheer will. Indeed you might say the film reverses the message of Friedkin's reactionary The Exorcist. Whilst The Exorcist asks us to shy away from science and toward religion as a cure for our supernatural demons Lorenzo's Oil demands that mankind focus its Promethean efforts on ending the suffering imposed at birth by nature. That man direct brain body and spirit toward conquering the monsters that pump through the veins. Aesthetically George Miller delivers a melodrama akin to Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life. Always a dynamic director he shoots his tale with canted angles stark compositions and bombastic camera work. It's Mad Max meets ER Miller was himself a doctor a tone which will strike most viewers as being a bit too heavyhanded. Look closely though and Miller's operatic style works perfectly if we take his film not as a domestic drama but a kind of 1950s horror movie in which glitched biocode replaces rubber suited monsters. This is German Expressionism in suburbia Nosferatu playing with Xray machines.8.510  Worth two viewings. Makes a good companion piece to Barak Goodman's The Boy In The Bubble Lightning Over Water Near Death Cries And Whispers Maborosi Ikiru and The Fire Within.".

Like detectives reverse engineering a crime scene the couple parse the human body down to its segments and constituents. Afterall biology's nefariously deterministic. Every cause has its effect. If you look hard enough deep enough think ten steps further twenty thirty even then maybe just maybe you've got your miracle.Eventually where the entire medical profession had failed the two ordinary parents succeed. Using an oil which contains a specific chain of fatty acids the couple produce a treatment which helps keep their son alive though the film's happy ending masks a dark truth. Yes in real life the couple's son would live a further 26 years but his brain damage and paralysis would prove irreversible. Likewise though the couple's oil has helped other families and sufferers of ALD over the decades no cure for the disease exists at present.Still forget about the film's Hollywood ending and melodramatic hurdles. Think instead of Lorenzo's Oil as a sadistic horror movie. Like The Exorcist we watch as a previously normal childhousehold is torn apart by a horrific evil. Unlike most horror movies though this evil resides not in the realm of the supernatural but the biological. The genetic your body wants you dead.And so the child degenerates into a mass of paralysed limbs violent convulsions and tormented breaths. Nature  cold and indifferent  has revealed itself to be a horrific ugly thing every organism but one DNA strand away from unimaginable pain and torture. Life's a genetic lottery and there's no worse horror than when biology strikes.So at its best Lorenzo's Oil offers an epic battle between nature our own biochemical makeup DNA RNA a malevolent universe which knows only indifference and science human ingenuity resolve creativity sheer will. Indeed you might say the film reverses the message of Friedkin's reactionary The Exorcist. Whilst The Exorcist asks us to shy away from science and toward religion as a cure for our supernatural demons Lorenzo's Oil demands that mankind focus its Promethean efforts on ending the suffering imposed at birth by nature. That man direct brain body and spirit toward conquering the monsters that pump through the veins. Aesthetically George Miller delivers a melodrama akin to Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life. Always a dynamic director he shoots his tale with canted angles stark compositions and bombastic camera work. It's Mad Max meets ER Miller was himself a doctor a tone which will strike most viewers as being a bit too heavyhanded. Look closely though and Miller's operatic style works perfectly if we take his film not as a domestic drama but a kind of 1950s horror movie in which glitched biocode replaces rubber suited monsters. This is German Expressionism in suburbia Nosferatu playing with Xray machines.8.510  Worth two viewings. Makes a good companion piece to Barak Goodman's The Boy In The Bubble Lightning Over Water Near Death Cries And Whispers Maborosi Ikiru and The Fire Within.";

I did not expect Lorenzo to have disabling symptoms just 10 minutes into the film. The scene where the parents reading about the disease is so effective. Seeing Nick Nolte crying helplessly on the stairs is probably the most effective scene in the whole film. It really conveys to the audience about how it feels to find about the inevitable fate.In the film we can see how love shines in the dark. The love of parents is truly unconditional. One can easily feel the love and be touched by it. Susan Sarandon is so convincing in portraying the relentless mother! Her performance deserves an Oscar award!I was also particularly impressed by the child actors who played the diseased children. Their performance is so convincing that I would easily say that the symptoms were real and not faked. I wonder how these children manage it!Lay people may find the technical and scientific details overwhelming and hard to follow.

Nick Nolte wasn't bad either but I have to admit that as a Nolte fan a thought his performance was some what disappointing. His Italian accent made him look like an idiot. Maybe Nolte wasn't optimal casted here. Maybe it would have been better if they had chosen an actor with an Italian look which would had made the accent much more believable.But in general Lorenzo's Oil was a nice picture with good performances. Maybe it's a little underrated as well on IMDb. I think it should at least deserve 7.2. I personally gave it an 8. Certainly worth watching! 810".

	schema:headline " A heartbreaking yet uplifting film of family ties and a determination that knows no bounds";
	schema:reviewBody "'Lorenzo's Oil' is a rare film that is intelligently produced in a manner that portrays the sadness poignancy hope triumph and courage of the story it tells.It centres on the true story of Augustus and Michaela Odone a doting couple who cherish their fiveyearold son Lorenzo. However in 1983 their happy family unit is shattered when Lorenzo exhibits various worrying symptoms that culminate to him being diagnosed with the devastating and rare metabolic condition Adrenoleukodystrophy ALD. However frustrated by the lack of research into the illness the Odones' refuse to accept their son's condition is terminal and take on the medical world in their determination to save Lorenzo.The quality of acting in this film is absolutely first class. Nick Nolte plays Augusto Odone depicting an adoring intellectual and resolute father who is willing to do whatever it takes to find a cure for his child. Michaela Odone is brought to life by Susan Sarandon in a manner which shows a mother who loves her only son but borders on a stifling obsession to save him due to her misplaced guilt over the fact the ALD gene is passed onto the afflicted child from their mother. Zack O'Malley Greenburg's performance also has to be noted in his role of young Lorenzo. He gives a harrowing portrayal of a bright sweet little boy whose mind and body gradually fail as the ALD progresses.'Lorenzo's Oil' successfully captures the grief and devastation that parents must endure upon learning their child has a condition that results in death as well as the determination spirit and hope of rallying against illness. It also nicely touches upon many different reactions that parents with a terminallyill child might display as while the Odones' strive to rise above their son's condition and seek out hope other parents especially those with more than one ALD child and have seen their elder children die are too disenchanted by watching their sons' painful lingering death to think a cure is possible. While parents like the Odones' are to be commended the film does show that the latter group of parents are not this way because they are cruel heartless monsters but rather they have seen too much pain in their sons that they believe death is only way to give their children release.What this film ultimately shows is that sometimes we cannot just place blind faith in doctors and drugs' companies and we have to fight for the ones we love and that the bond between parents and their child is enduring. 'Lorenzo's Oil' not only advocates the disease that is not widelyknown although sadly in the UK it has recently gained publicity when three young brothers were diagnosed with the condition but also presents the subject matter in a way that is quite easy to understand for lay people I was about fourteen when I first saw the film and was able to understand the jist of how Augusto discovered the Oil.In fact the only reason the film drops a point for me is because of the way the Oil is depicted as the alltime cure for ALD. Unfortunately that isn't the case and it does give false hope for parents of ALDsufferers. Although Lorenzo's Oil can prevent onset of the illness in boys diagnosed before the symptoms develop it doesn't always help children who are already showing signs of the condition. That said this is a brilliant film that will leave you crying and joyous as you watch the Odones' struggle through their son's condition to find light at the end of the tunnel. Don't expect to crack out the popcorn for this film though as it is not meant to be thrills and fun the message it is trying to convey go far beyond entertainment for the masses. Lorenzo is still alive today although paralysed and mute and is now twentyeight years old. Given what his parents already accomplished for him so he could grow to adulthood it is not impossible that perhaps his father may one day find a way to see him recover to full health.".

What impressed me was the father's incredible journey into medical research on a topic that was beyond him. He persisted even using paper clips to explain his ideas. This gives a lot of credence to alternative medicine which used extracts from 2 food sources. It also shows the stubborn determination and egos I suspect of doctors and researchers. It's marvelous that these parents have laid the groundwork for future young males who suffer from this disorder. I just wish this family and all families affected by this terrible disease much happiness in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Coming from the United States I was interested in some insight into the experiences of young people in Denmark. Maybe what is seen is not representative but I could easily identify with the culture. I always imagined that the Scandinavian countries were much advanced to the United States in the area of sexuality but I was surprised to see that at least in 1987 as portrayed in this film the attitudes toward gays was on a par with the U.S. That being said the nudity the one scene of gay sex and sex among teens would never have made it into a movie for general release in the U.S. That pretty much goes for 2012 as well.Upon reflection I find Kristian the main character more complex than I initially gave him credit for. When his mother moves to a different school district Kristian has to attend a new school. That is always difficult since the cliques have already been formed and it takes some time to see where you fit in. Kristian first takes up with Henrik the odd kid out. Though Henrik never makes any physical advances it is clear that his interest in Kristian is more than just simple friendship. At first Kristian seems to respond to that but then he flips and shuts Henrik off and pursues getting in with Patrick the leader of the ingroup. In view of what happens later in the film with Kristian having several heterosexual experiences I was still left with some doubt about his sexuality. When Kristian discovers Patrick's homosexuality he is initially repulsed but ultimately comes to an acceptance. Perhaps that is the point the movie was trying to make.I was confused by some parts. It was never clear to me what the story was on the living arrangements where Patrick moved. Was it some sort of community living a boarding house or an apartment with shared space? Maybe this is a type of living situation that is common in Denmark but not in the U.S. We don't get much information on either of Kristian's or Patrick's family. No mention is ever made of Kristian's father so I assumed he was living with his mother. Whatever the situation he was not all that close with his mom. Patrick commented that his family was driving him nuts and he needed to get away so he could see whomever he wanted whenever he wanted. It was not made clear whether his family did not accept his sexuality. I would have liked the story to have been fleshed out more. The relationship between Kristian and the older singer who was his mother's age was farfetched. And Kristian's skillful lovemaking with her was hard to believe given his youthful inexperience.Nothing special about the filming. I thought the young actors were quite good. It's odd that this is the only film most of the actors ever appeared in.The scenes at the end that had the kids tossing leaflets opposing the school head Ms. Kallenbach provided a frivolous ending. However I found the final bizarre scene that had the entire cast in costume singing on stage to be delightful and it ended things on an upbeat note. I wish this final scene had been subtitled for us English only speakers.".

I wish this final scene had been subtitled for us English only speakers.";

Atmospheric fantastical tragic and hopeful the film chronicles the parallel fates of Jacqueline a young mother with a disabled son in 1960s Paris and Antoine a recently divorced successful DJ in present day Montreal. What binds the two stories together is love  euphoric obsessive tragic youthful timeless love. In 1960s Paris a working class woman gives birth to her first child Laurent  a Down Syndrome son. Undaunted she embraces the challenge of raising her beloved offspring as normally as one would any other child. Her husband abandons them both. She bravely brushes this additional hiccup aside as Laurent replaces her spouse as the perfect man of her dreams. As Laurent approaches school age Jacqueline's aplomb becomes obsessive and cloying. Her increasingly selfdestructive attachment to her son is raised to a fever pitch when at the age of seven he meets a Down ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Read the full review at nickplusmovies.blogspot.comJeanMarc Valle returns to his beloved Qubcois roots with his latest work Caf de flore one of the many films that screened at TIFF back in September and that I was lucky enough to see. The story is composed of two interwoven narratives that only at first glance seem completely unrelated to one another.The first story is set in presentday Montreal and centers on a recently divorced father of two girls Antoine Godin Kevin Parent who leads a successful life as a professional DJ. Despite having found true happiness in his relationship with his girlfriend Rose Evelyne Brochu he feels a little remorseful for having left his exwife Carole Hlne Florent for whom he still cares deeply. Antoine understands that she continues struggling to move on with her life heartbroken. And to make the situation in which they find themselves even more difficult their eldest daughter persistently plays their nostalgic love song with hopes of reuniting her parents.The second story is set in Paris in 1969 and focuses on Jacqueline Vanessa Paradis a selfsufficient loving single mother who becomes the embodiment of perseverance and selflessness as she promises to devote herself both physically and spiritually to her son Laurent who has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. She spends every minute of spare time with her beloved young boy with the goal to elongate his limited life expectancy. One day when Laurent begins to be infatuated by Vronique a new girl in his class who incidentally also has Down syndrome Jacqueline is struck by an overwhelming feeling as she fears that her inseparable bond with the only person she loves will be be lost with time.Up until the very end of the film it seems like the only link between both stories is the music the characters listen to the jazz album Caf de flore appears in the second story while a certain remix is featured in the first one but as we progress further into this mystical mystery we learn that there is something much deeper tying together the characters and their stories of love and loss. Knowing that Caf de flore would be composed of intertwined stories I was initially a little reluctant to seeing it and very worried that its structure would collapse within the first few minutes of the film. To my pleasant surprise this modern approach to storytelling proved to be ultimately rewarding. I believe credit is due to the film editor who is believe it or not JeanMarc Valle again. It's nice to hear that he had control of almost every visual aspect of his own work of art. With Valle's perfectly orchestrated editing the audience is able to follow the story without ever sensing an abrupt switch between story lines. In the film's entirety not once did I feel that some scenes were fragmented or disjointed from others. Valle always progresses deeper into his creation by carefully and seamlessly shifting between narratives just at the right time creating a smooth fluid tempo. Briefly everything flows like a river. Just like in C.R.A.Z.Y. music is a vital element to this film. Jean Marc Valle selects many tunes with ethereal ambient qualities to match the profound thoughts and feelings of all the characters. While he features some more Pink Floyd Speak to MeBreathe he makes of Sigur Ros's Svefngenglar the film's most haunting musical piece by far.There are far too many impressive performances in Caf de flore to name. Valle must be what one would call an actor's director because he seems to continuously squeeze out the most confident natural performances from all of his actors young or old in order to achieve his goal to craft a realistic family drama. He even went to the lengths of finding two children who have Down syndrome in real life for the roles of Laurent and Vronique these are two performances that will make your jaw drop. This is proof of his everlasting adherence to realism as a filmmaker.In sum Caf de flore is a sensual deeply touching chefd'oeuvre that will have you shivering every minute in pure emotional awe. It never comes across as overly sentimental but rather genuinely heartfelt. I can't recall the last time I found myself on the verge of tears while simultaneously smiling at the bittersweet beauty of a film. Come to think of it there isn't a single movie from 2011 that I could recommend seeing more than this one. I believe it's an essential viewing for anyone who has felt the most fundamental of human emotions. That means you... I hope".

However if you truly want to see this film ignore other opinions otherwise you will miss out on a potential Oscar nomination.There are two separate stories occurring. One is about a woman in the 1960s Paradis who has to raise her son on her own because he has Down's syndrome. The other is about a music jockey named Antoine Parent who is ready to marry again despite the bond he shares with his exwife who was also his first love. His eldest daughter purposely plays certain songs which remind him of their marriage since the central idea is how music recalls certain memories. Every time a certain song is heard in the background one is bound to step inside the characters memories.The other story is the beauty of a motherson relationship. Paradis is genuine in this role especially being a reallife mother herself. Her makeup ages her to portray her role well. We see how she encourages her boy to learn despite his disabilities. Remember this was an era where children like him were discriminated and often sent to institutions.'Cafe de Flore' is truly a story about the power of love. You have to follow closely therefore if easily distracted the flashbacks may confuse you. The constant repetition of Pink Floyd which was also a signature band for JeanMarc Vallee's 'C.R.A.Z.Y.' is synchronized to perfection. The visuals and acting performances are moving as the film unfolds by layer to at last reveal how both stories are connected.".

There is no question that this movie asks a lot of one's suspension of disbelief. But I think that movie goers should give it the benefit of a doubt. This is a very unconventional love story and it may be the most thoughtful movie every made about the idea that one person can be another person's soul mate. The tension of course arises when what does one do when one finds a deeper more meaningful soul mate. This is a complex work with a totally different way of investigating its romantic themes. It uses music beautifully as a thread that joins elements of the film together binding emotional themes together and providing transitions between the two stories that it tells.

Anonymous Love is about holding on to someone but it is also about knowing when to let go. This theme defines JeanMarc Valle's Caf de flore his second film since the 2005 hit C.R.A.Z.Y. and one of the most poignant films in recent memory. Not only does Caf de flore repeat Valle's earlier success but goes far beyond it in its extraordinary ability to capture the intensity of deeplyfelt human emotion. The title refers not to the famous Paris caf but to a jazzy song with the same name that serves as a connection between each of the film's two parallel stories. In addition to the title song music plays a large role in the film as it did in C.R.A.Z.Y. with songs from Pink Floyd Sigur Rs and The Cure supporting key points in the narrative.Unfolding with a nonlinear script that includes multiple flashbacks flashforwards and crosscutting the stories take place in two time periods over forty years apart. In the present day Antoine Kevin Parent is a welltodo middleaged disc jockey who lives in a suburban home with his partner Rose Evelyne Brochu and his two daughters from a former marriage Joanny CorbeilPicher Rosalie Fortier. Everything looks wonderful on the surface except that Antoine is visiting a psychiatrist to handle his feelings about what he feels is betrayal of his family. Antoine's first wife Carole Hlne Florent is distraught and yearns for reconciliation with the man she has always thought of as her soul mate since they came together as teenagers out of a shared love of music.Carole is urged by friends to let go of Antoine and move on but she is obsessed with getting him back telling her friend I've never kissed another man. She takes drugs to help her sleep sleepwalks in the middle of the night and has dreams and waking visions of a strange woman in Paris many years ago experiencing a similar pain in her relationship. To help her understand her visions Carole visits a spiritual adviser who tells her that her dreams are not a coincidence. The parallel story is set in Paris in 1969 Jacqueline Vanessa Paradis a single mother cares for her young son Laurent Lucas Bonin who was born with Down's syndrome. She was abandoned by her husband after Laurent's birth because he did not want to be a missionary.Jacqueline is a devoted mother showering her son with love and intending to ensure that he lives past the norm of twentyfive years for a person with his condition. When she enrolls him in a normal school she constantly protects him from bullies and also from teachers who are not willing or able to deal with him. Jacqueline wants to train Laurent to defend himself by learning how to box but when he rebels at the idea she teaches him to strike back through words which he uses to peak efficiency at the right moment.When Laurent is seven he develops a close attachment to Veronique another Down's syndrome child an attachment that threatens his mother's obsessive protection and leads to an unforeseen turn in their relationship. Caf de flore is a passionately performed and spiritually resonant film one of the best I've seen this year. Reminiscent of Terence Malick's Tree of Life with its voiceovers reflecting the inner thoughts of the characters it is a haunting experience and the mystical connection between its two stories will keep you in a Donnie Darkolike state of puzzlement long into the night and beyond.".

This is a film about dream and love and what are you supposed to do if your dream is all about the one you love and what if you spend all your life protecting a dream that never meant to belong to you. This is the question in front of Jacqueline and Carole. After all having a dream that connected to human beings is a dangerous thing to do.Using two parallel story lines is no more a novelty in film making. Yet the film does not give us much information on the relation between the two very different storiesa single mother Jacqueline with her Down's syndrome son Laurent in 1960s and a couple Carole and Antonio facing betrayal and the sequential mental stress today. The only correlations between them are Carole's strange dreams and Cafe de Florethe songs with the same name that people from two spaces and times happened to play. Two and a half hours is a long duration for an independent art film and in most of the time these two stories are separately told slowly and beautifully and I thought maybe that's it there would be no overlap between the two stories until Carole figured out her connection with the mother and son from the last life.I watched Cafe de Flore by myself in a small cinema in the suburb of London. Tranquillity is all you need when encountering a beautiful film like this. Crying like a baby in the cinema I had to sit there for a while until the film credits finished in order to give myself some time to look normal before going out. And the film is such a great comfort for some reason it's cathartic. The original soundtrack is another important reason to make the film so moving. Interestingly Sigur Ros's music video svefngenglar featured with Down's syndrome dancers could be the initial inspiration of Cafe de Flore?".

Two and a half hours is a long duration for an independent art film and in most of the time these two stories are separately told slowly and beautifully and I thought maybe that's it there would be no overlap between the two stories until Carole figured out her connection with the mother and son from the last life.I watched Cafe de Flore by myself in a small cinema in the suburb of London. Tranquillity is all you need when encountering a beautiful film like this. Crying like a baby in the cinema I had to sit there for a while until the film credits finished in order to give myself some time to look normal before going out. And the film is such a great comfort for some reason it's cathartic. The original soundtrack is another important reason to make the film so moving. Interestingly Sigur Ros's music video svefngenglar featured with Down's syndrome dancers could be the initial inspiration of Cafe de Flore?";

You can't explain it. You have to experience it. And whether you believe in past lives or not i don't and the director says he doesn't either you will go on an unsettling emotional journey watching this visually stunning amazingly acted movie. Vanessa Paradis is heartbreaking and almost unrecognizable. The addictive Cafe de Flore music inspired the director to write direct and edit this film himself.

On the other hand I found the misogynistic tale of Antoine very offputting. A narcissistic man leaves his beautiful intelligent wife of 20 years for a vapid tattooed insecure younger woman with whom he appears to have no common interest other than sex. How original. Great role model he is for his teenage daughter who hates him by the way. Big surprise. Unfortunately the daughter is the only female who stands up to him and calls him out for the cochon that he is. The other women in his life are just waiting with bated breath to see whether he chooses to allow them to continue making him the center of their worlds.

	schema:reviewBody "The first story is set in presentday Montreal and centers on a recently divorced father of two girls Antoine Godin Kevin Parent who leads a successful life as a professional DJ. Despite having found true happiness in his relationship with his girlfriend Rose Evelyne Brochu he feels a little remorseful for having left his exwife Carole Hlne Florent for whom he still cares deeply. Antoine understands that she continues struggling to move on with her life heartbroken. And to make the situation in which they find themselves even more difficult their eldest daughter persistently plays their nostalgic love song with hopes of reuniting her parents.The second story is set in Paris in 1969 and focuses on Jacqueline Vanessa Paradis a selfsufficient loving single mother who becomes the embodiment of perseverance and selflessness as she promises to devote herself both physically and spiritually to her son Laurent who has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. She spends every minute of spare time with her beloved young boy with the goal to elongate his limited life expectancy. One day when Laurent begins to be infatuated by Vronique a new girl in his class who incidentally also has Down syndrome Jacqueline is struck by an overwhelming feeling as she fears that her inseparable bond with the only person she loves will be be lost with time.Up until the very end of the film it seems like the only link between both stories is the music the characters listen to the jazz album Caf de flore appears in the second story while a certain remix is featured in the first one but as we progress further into this mystical mystery we learn that there is something much deeper tying together the characters and their stories of love and loss. Knowing that Caf de flore would be composed of intertwined stories I was initially a little reluctant to seeing it and very worried that its structure would collapse within the first few minutes of the film. To my pleasant surprise this modern approach to storytelling proved to be ultimately rewarding. I believe credit is due to the film editor who is believe it or not JeanMarc Valle again. It's nice to hear that he had control of almost every visual aspect of his own work of art. With Valle's perfectly orchestrated editing the audience is able to follow the story without ever sensing an abrupt switch between story lines. In the film's entirety not once did I feel that some scenes were fragmented or disjointed from others. Valle always progresses deeper into his creation by carefully and seamlessly shifting between narratives just at the right time creating a smooth fluid tempo. Briefly everything flows like a river.".

Its rarely you see a movie about Love  Soul Mates these days so Cafe De Flore is completely refreshing in bringing the purity of love. Caf de Flore is a love story about people separated by time and place but connected in profound and mysterious ways. Atmospheric fantastical tragic and hopeful the film chronicles the parallel fates of Jacqueline a young mother with a disabled son in 1960s Paris and Antoine a recently divorced successful DJ in present day Montreal. What binds the two stories together is love  euphoric obsessive tragic youthful timeless love.Even though the movie runs in NonChronological manner still you would appreciate how it amalgamates two stories beautifully. I'm not huge fan of nonchronological movie because it makes you depressive like Burning Man We Need to Talk about Kevin  Memento off course.Vanessa Paradis gave a brilliant performance she lived in that moment and her chemistry with the syndrome child is superb. You completely forget that it's not even real. Kevin Parent is mesmerizing and exudes passion. Can't believe that's his first outing as an actor. Evelyne Broche is beautiful  her chemistry with Kevin Parent is amazing. Helene Florent is great along with syndrome kids Marin Gerrier  Alice Dubois.On the whole Cafe De Flore is a beautiful heartening movie which will bring you in tears.".

The two leads are likably goofy they do bring a 70's flavor to these 30's characters which may or may not be to your taste and male viewers will be glad to know that Cybill Shepherd spends the entire running time wearing a white dress that reveals her sexy back arms and shoulders. If I can point one flaw in this movie it's that the script doesn't build enough ambiguity  even people who don't know the story won't think for a moment that it could all be in Cybill's head.

Both are thrillers one more somber and tense and the latter version more of a melodramatic mystery with comedic touches. What I would suggest is that the viewer simply watch both versions recognizing the strong and weak points of each. Both are enjoyable but to interject a personal note I tend to lean toward this 1979 version for its tone that's more like other mystery films such as Charade or North By Northwest.

	schema:reviewBody "Almost all the ingredients are present for this to be a charming and colorful remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic stunning scenery lovely music and talented behindthescenes craftspeople. Unfortunately a pair of anachronistic lead actors does everything but sink it. Shepherd plays an American heiress in the late 1930's continually marrying and divorcing as part of a plan to glean her inheritance. From Bavaria en route to London she boards a train still hung over from a night of revelry and wearing her evening gown. A kindly nanny Lansbury takes her under her wing inviting her to lunch and seeing that she gets a nap during the long trip. When Shepherd awakes Lansbury is gone and what's more no one will admit to ever having seen her! Gould a magazine photographer begins to assist Shepherd never quite sure if she has actually seen this woman or if she's hallucinating after a drunken night that continued into a tipsy morning. The duo is also aided by doctor Lom. Practically everyone else seems in on some grand conspiracy to cover up Lansbury's existence. Gould and Shepherd delve further and further into the mystery as the danger escalates. Despite her presence in other noncontemporary films such as Daisy Miller another flop Miss Shepherd has no business acting in a period piece. Though she does look nice in her dress her manner is far too brusque and her carriage is far too contemporary to pull off playing someone from another era. Apart from that her horrible flat voice is completely at odds with the material and she simply can't muster up any enthusiasm for the proceedings. At one point Gould accuses her of being hysterical and yet she's just as sedate and unexcited as she was before. Her makeup looks at times clownish with all the highlighter applied under her eyes paired with bright blush. Gould another actor who should only be cast in present day projects gives into one concession for his period role. He parts his unruly hair and tries to mush it down. Otherwise he too is all wrong for this time and setting though at least he attempts to give a performance. They share precious little chemistry and their misguided performances threaten at all times to derail the movie. Lansbury offers up a characterization that would soon become very familiar to viewers of Murder She Wrote as her work here and that of the early years of the TV series are quite similar. Lom is dependably solid. Old pros Lowe and Carmichael ably portray a couple of cricketobsessed fussbudgets who alternately help and hinder the investigation. Harper and Runacre are a pair of secretive lovers. Nedeva does well in a small role as a nun. Some exquisitely beautiful Austrian scenery helps add a bit of luster to the film but it's not enough to plug all the holes. While the plot line is creaky and has been used in countless other films and TV shows it would still be irresistible if not for the jarring presence of the two leads. Fans of theirs will be far more forgiving but those who like a little class and authenticity in their films will be put off by their frequently obnoxious characterizations.".

It avoids many of the tedious moments of the original film especially during the first half hour or so in the hotel and introduces a lot more humour. I mean Arthur Lowe and Ian Carmichael are nothing short of EXCELLENT far funnier than the tedious idiots of the original. In addition we have better sound quality superb picture quality an extremely sexy Cybill Sheppard and a BEAUTIFUL sound track !! What more could you ask. I know little about the main mail character Elliot Gould and indeed found his performance the least interesting but this is more than compensated for by the other performances. The Nazi Helmut played his role very well and rendered himself thoroughly dislikeable. And I have always loved Angela Lansbury in whatever rle I have seen her. This is good quality cinematic entertainment from 1979 without special effects something which is in very short supply in these initial years of the twenty first century. Thank God it's been issued on a DVD !".

Changing the male lead to that of American war correspondent Elliot Gould instead of a British musician researching European folk compositions was also a good idea even though the part in the 1938 film was smartly played by Michael Redgrave in his debut film role.The rest of the casting is very much true to the 1938 version and all the parts were played beautifully especially Herbert Lom and Daphne Anderson playing the Nazi doctor and the politically motivated Baroness.Also I should not forget Arthur Lowe and Ian Carmichael as the characters of Charters and Caldicot respectively who were originally played by Basil Radford and Naughton Wayne in the 1938 version. It should be noted that these two characters were featured in three more films Night Train to Munich Crooks Tour and Millions Like Us and were even featured in a 1985 BBC Television series where they were played by Robin Bailey and Michael Aldridge.It was unusual to see Gerald Harper in a less heroic role as the character of Todhunter when we are used to seeing him in such roles as Adam Adamant Hadleigh and various other roles as a more intrepid character. The character was originally played in the 1938 version by the everreliable character actor Cecil Parker.All in all this was a very good and exciting film and I always enjoy it every time I watch it.".

E.g. the very effective motif of the Hitlermoustache  and the whole idea of transferring the story to nazi Germany. The settings  real train real land  the camera work the music are all great adding to the thrill of the ride. The cast is a jackpot Cybill Sheperd throws out sparks.

But her performance is terrific  she throws herself into the part with enthusiasm and lack of embarrassment even when she has to do fairly embarrassing things. She's tough and tomboyish and beautiful really starry. And because of this the film's just fine.

When she enquires no one else can remember any such woman being on the train  did she imagine it or is something more sinister afoot?Of course it isn't rubbish but no matter how OK this film it it simply isn't comparable to the much much better Hitchcock original  sadly a statement that I consider true of all aspects of the film. The plot is held as in the original but for this story to work the delivery needs to be good. Hitchcock did it well producing a pacy and enjoyable film that was light but engaging at the same time. Here the film isn't too much longer than the original but my gosh it drags by comparison. The lack of tension was a real surprise to me and the film failed to draw out the mystery  of course I knew it was not in Amanda's head but I do when I watch the original as well  this familiarity doesn't totally account for the lack of tension in the film generally that is more to do with the lack of urgency and the starry feel of the film generally. Filmed in lush colours and a postcard presentation of Europe the film looks professional but the brightness undercuts the tension yet again. Page generally doesn't do much with the direction to help the material or cast out  it all looks OK but doesn't do that much. Viewers who have not seen the original might enjoy it but anyone coming to it second will struggle to find much added value in this retread.Gould and Shepherd both overegg their performances and lean too heavily on the side of humour without doing enough on the side of the mystery. Of course neither of them are helped by their lack of chemistry with one another. There is no spark at all and they generally just bluster around each other. Lansbury is OK as the lady of the title but you can't help feel that she's doesn't really deserve to share the same role as the much better Witty. Lowe and Charmichael dominate with a rerun of the amusing English clichs from the original although Lom is worth a look. The rest of the cast however just fill in the background without too much effort or style.Overall this is a distracting and OK film in its own right but I simply cannot see any reason why any viewer would find this a more worthwhile venture than the original. In every way from direction and tone through to performances and cinematography the film is a poor photocopy of the original. If you haven't seen it then you should be watching that if you have seen it then I don't understand why beyond a morbid sense of curiosity you'd want to watch this remake.".

But the finished product turns out to be more of a comedy than the suspenseful WhoDunnit like the original masterpiece this was supposed to have remade.Blame the absurd casting of Elliot Gould and the horrid direction Sybil Sheppard was given.. Sheppard can be a good actress. But this is one of her more unfortunate performances. As a madcap heiress she comes off more like Meg Ryan's flibbertyjibbet character in Joe vs. the Volcano. Muchmarried madcap heiress she corrects Gould in his reprisal of her performance of the night before.Gould just isn't Peter Ustinov or Albert Finney for that matter which seems to be the men he attempts to mimic. If that is the case he missed the mark by a country mile. He in no way even begins to fill those shoes.The European antiAmerican sentiments are well displayed and conveyed here and Sheppard's character does little to change that.While this is still a fun suspenseful film it is nothing like the original in that it captures none of the fantastic suspense lent by Hitchcock's direction. Although the spoof is unintentional this is more like the It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World version. Amanda Kelly Sheppard is befriended by the kindly Miss Froy Angela Landsbury a motherly type who lends a hand and offers the British solution for most ailments chicken soup and a nice cup of tea. Kelly dozes off on the train and when she awakens Miss Froy is absent. The other members of the car in which they are seated seemingly have no memory of Miss Froy and they begin to Gaslight Kelly. Even the waiter who served Miss Froy and Ms. Kelly in the dining car has no memory of Miss Froy. Indeed he presents Kelly with a ticket indicating that she paid the bill herself was alone and unattended.Robert Condon Elliott Gould also a passenger aboard the train is somehow whirlwinded into a search for the elusive Miss Froy and before you know it he is sleuthing the mystery with Ms. Kelly. Where is she what has happened to Miss Froy and why? Unfortunately while this is a fun adventure it's more funny than fun. It lacks in wit and your humor is more at the expense of Gould's and Sheppard's performances than the dialog. It lacks the intelligence and careful direction of the original. Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express is a much better endeavor and I highly suggest it in place of this poor remake. Hitchcock must have puked upon seeing this.What should have been an epic homage ended up being a sad parody of a great masterpiece of suspense. While it is still enjoyable it could have been ohsomuchmore and was in other versions.It rates a 4.310 from...the Fiend .".

He in no way even begins to fill those shoes.The European antiAmerican sentiments are well displayed and conveyed here and Sheppard's character does little to change that.While this is still a fun suspenseful film it is nothing like the original in that it captures none of the fantastic suspense lent by Hitchcock's direction. Although the spoof is unintentional this is more like the It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World version. Amanda Kelly Sheppard is befriended by the kindly Miss Froy Angela Landsbury a motherly type who lends a hand and offers the British solution for most ailments chicken soup and a nice cup of tea. Kelly dozes off on the train and when she awakens Miss Froy is absent. The other members of the car in which they are seated seemingly have no memory of Miss Froy and they begin to Gaslight Kelly. Even the waiter who served Miss Froy and Ms. Kelly in the dining car has no memory of Miss Froy. Indeed he presents Kelly with a ticket indicating that she paid the bill herself was alone and unattended.Robert Condon Elliott Gould also a passenger aboard the train is somehow whirlwinded into a search for the elusive Miss Froy and before you know it he is sleuthing the mystery with Ms. Kelly. Where is she what has happened to Miss Froy and why? Unfortunately while this is a fun adventure it's more funny than fun. It lacks in wit and your humor is more at the expense of Gould's and Sheppard's performances than the dialog. It lacks the intelligence and careful direction of the original. Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express is a much better endeavor and I highly suggest it in place of this poor remake. Hitchcock must have puked upon seeing this.What should have been an epic homage ended up being a sad parody of a great masterpiece of suspense. While it is still enjoyable it could have been ohsomuchmore and was in other versions.It rates a 4.310 from...the Fiend .";

You may argue you shouldn't compare it to the Hitchcock original and by the way Hitchock is my favourite director but the thing is people do. The remake doesn't quite have the charm of its original and I do think it is to do with the fact that the screenplay at times is weak the director is no Hitchcock and the film does meander in the last twenty minutes. On the other hand it is stylishly done with stunning cinematography and lavish costumes. The story is an interesting concept and I did find the film interesting and a pleasant watch overall. The music by the way is outstanding very richly scored and the main theme sticks in your head for a very long time. The performances are mostly not at all bad. Angela Lansbury is marvellous as Miss Froy despite her limited screen time. Herbert Lom also impresses as usual and while Cybill Sheppard has given better performances she did look absolutely beautiful. In fact the only actor who disappointed was Elliot Gould he had the handsome screen presence but he didn't quite convince and just for the record his dialogue for me was the weakest of the film. All in all slick underrated and well done remake but if I were to compare the two I would say the original was better. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "On a wet dreary Sunday I watched both versions of this film more or less back to back fully expecting to prefer the earlier Hitchcock version I'm a Hitch fan yet I was pretty surprised to find it wasn't that straightforward.Yes the earlier version is in many ways more economical in its story telling rapidly showing the mittelEuropean setting plus avalanche and thus getting straight to the business of the problems at the hotel within 3 minutes including opening titles rather than the picturesque but drawnout opening of the 1979 version. And the editing is often more stylish in its intercutting of images of train tracks wheels and whistles into subtle plot points.But such things aside for me the modern version has an improvement on the original because it uses real history. It's set one year after the original film 1938 and so uses WWII reasons for the plot. The original film was made and set in 1938 and uses preWWI reasons and a fictitious country highlighting just how separated from real events that movie was. Obviously the writers weren't to know everything in Europe was about to go up in flames but hindsight inevitably dates the quaint portrayal of incendiary events.I found Cybill Shepherd's character gratingly brattish and nowhere near as charming as Carole Lombard that she was allegedly trying to emulate but that was as nothing to how annoyingly entitled and arrogant most of the characters were in the 1938 version. Hitchcock may well have been satirising how awful the English are abroad but he also filled his movie with patronising stereotypes of funny foreigners who were treated with varying degrees of disdain by all even Miss Froy. Charters  Caldicott's treatment of the maid who had to give up her room to them was plain obnoxious.There was a good deal of believable warmth and chemistry between Lansbury and Shepherd that was lacking imo between Whitty  Lockwood. And for me Arthur Lowe can get more dry comedy out of one line or even one look than several scenes with Basil Radford.Mrs Todhunter's motivation for saying she saw Miss Froy is more slickly conveyed in the earlier version but Herbert Lom's doctor is a more fully realised character in the later one so it came as a better twist for me when we find out what he's really up to.For me Iris  Gilbert gradually bonding over lunch and in the luggage carriage was more endearing than Robert's leering appreciation of Amanda's braless figure in a slinky dress regardless of how alluring she looked in it.And the reason for the nun to switch sides is better hinted at in the 1938 version because she's English whereas the 1979 version unnecessarily complicates things by making her married to the doctor who in turn is the aristocratic lady's nephew all for no storytelling gain.Hitchcock also wrings far more tension out of the drugged drinks than happens in the remake as well as more daft comedy out of the inept fight in the luggage car. However I did enjoy Amanda  Robert's madcap reactions when they thought they'd been poisoned. Gould is naturally funny Shepherd occasionally so.The shootout is much better acted out in the 1979 version but changing the male lead's profession from musician to photographer meant that Miss Froy pulling him away from the lifeordeath shooting match in order to teach him a vitally important piece of music instead of teaching just Amanda didn't make sense better to have left him being a music specialist and thus having a good reason for pulling him away from a vital shootout. Nor does the modern version even attempt to explain why this tune is important anyway daft though it is.Both films are the same length to within a minute but the more efficient storytelling in the older version left enough time to include the story line of the officer who boards the train at the shootout and he adds even greater tension in the final act. What also adds to the final 3 minutes of the original is delaying the clinch between the two leads until then rather than Shepherd  Gould making it clear that they're a couple far earlier.I loved the musical score of the remake it really added to the lush feel along with the gorgeous location shots and ironically it reminded me in places of the score to one of Hitchcock's other movies Marnie.So in summary1979 photographyscenery 19381979 music 1938Angela Lansbury May WhittyArthur Lowe Basil Radford1979 characters far less obnoxious with foreigners than 19381979 political backdrop 1938But1938 editing  tight storytelling 1979Margaret Lockwood Cybill Shepherd1938 Plotting  motivation 19791938 mystery  suspense 1979All in all I think I just prefer the original mostly because Margaret Lockwood is so winningly gorgeous in it but there is plenty to recommend the newer version and it was by no means a pointless remake.".

I'm really not sure what anyone was on when this was made. I don't know if people didn't like each other whether they were doing it for a bet or what.

But somehow everyone ends up as though they know they're not in an danger of repeating a classic and so just walk through the roles. If you watch as Cybill and Elliot deliver their lines whether or not it was ad libbing lots of it just looks sounds and is played like a rehearsal  and not a good one at that.The Story It's a good mystery story but it comes off as fake. There is nobody to care about nobody to go along with. Cybill's character comes across as just a plain spoiled brat. What's with the million pounds bit? I know the rest of the casehave to believe she's a bit mad and that her story isn't true but I really wanted HER to vanish not Miss Froy! Updating it correctly so it has the Nazi references is good but the Nazis are played as comicbook baddies so it's just odd. And the English are comic book goodies too.

I'm putting all the rest of what's wrong with this in the same place. Other reviews have called this a much maligned film but it really does deserve maligning. There's almost nothing good about it unless you count its comic relief potential. It's too bizarre for words  some of the scenes should not have made it into a finished project.This is just a bad film everything's wrong with it from the stereotypes to the casting to the direction to the look of the whole thing. It would be nice to look at it now and forgive it its flaws but there are just too many of them! Any film you can't watch without cringing doesn't deserve a good review.It gets 2 out of 10 from me because of its classic heritage and because of Angela Lansbury.

	schema:headline " Imaginative animated fantasy based on Hong Kong comic";
	schema:reviewBody "STORM RIDER CLASH OF EVILS 2008 is an epic animated feature coproduced by Hong Kong and China and is I believe the first animated adventure I've seen that was based on a Hong Kong comic book. It's quite a spectacular swordplay fantasy with intricately choreographed fight action and expertly detailed backgrounds that evoke an ancient and mythic China. It has a strong storyline and a host of interesting characters and never flags during its 99minute running time. It was directed by Hong Kong director Dante Lam who's known for such liveaction thrillers as BEAST COPS JIANG HU THE TRIAD ZONE and THE TWINS EFFECT. Why this film isn't betterknown is a mystery to me. IMDb lists release dates in Hong Kong Taiwan and China but I have found no information on how it was received critically or how well it did at the box office. As far as I know it never got any release outside of those regions. I found my import DVD copy in a Chinatown video store in New York.The film is based on Storm Riders a comic book by Wing Shing Ma that has been published in English by a company called Comics One. The comic was previously adapted as a liveaction film called THE STORM RIDERS 1998 which starred Ekin Cheng Aaron Kwok and Sonny Chiba. The animated film is something of a sequel in that it follows the two main characters Wind and Cloud after the events of the earlier film.The animated story is a little on the convoluted side but once you get all the characters straight by the halfhour mark it's simply a matter of following what happens to Wind and Cloud. In the earlier film they had been seen as martial arts students under the tutelage of Lord Conquer a villain who had killed their parents and taken them as pupils to fulfill a prophecy laid out by a character called Mud Buddha. In that film they nurtured their plans for revenge and carried them out at the end of the film in a sequence that's recreated in an entirely new fashion at the beginning of this film. In the newer film the two heroes acquire the power of the sacred Flame Kylin Sword but it comes with a price. Wind gets the lion's share of the power but runs the risk of being possessed by it to the point where he might lose control and become a murderous allpowerful monster. Cloud has been ordered to kill Wind if this were to happen. After the events of the opening sequence the two heroes are separated for a long stretch during which Cloud is afflicted with amnesia and aligns himself with a band of street urchins acting as their mentor and protector and earning the affection of Ying the oldest girl in the group. Wind joins a group in another village and begins a relationship with a woman named Mong. Both protagonists wind up in the same town and on the same side in a battle with a marauding gang before they are eventually reunited.There are three major action setpieces. After the opening flurry of fight scenes involving the confrontation between Lord Conquer and his two vengeful students there is a welcome lull in the action in order to deal with Cloud's sudden amnesia introduce new characters and build up to the two sprawling battle sequences later in the film. At around the 50minute mark the Bat Gang a group of vicious bandits attacks the main town and their leaders are confronted on separate fronts by Wind and Cloud who are both still unaware of each other's presence nearby. Later after Wind and Cloud reunite the two must confront Ao Jue and DuanLang two young martial arts masters who covet the Flame Kylin Sword and its power. It all leads to a knockdown dragout fight in a massive clifftop castle which results in Wind losing control thanks to the power of the Kylin Sword compelling Cloud to recognize his duty to stop him.The characters drive the story here and incidents occur based on what a particular character would or wouldn't do. As a result the viewer becomes more engaged and emotionally connected to the action. It helps that the characters spend significant downtime with their friends and allies and get a chance to relate normally to other people. This is most evident in scenes where Cloud interacts with his young charges the street urchins after he's rescued them from the bumbling town constables. After the two protagonists are reunited Wind watches as Cloud plays happily with the children. He turns to Mong and makes the memorable observation I never would have imagined his happiest times would come when his past is forgotten. When you leave the anger and stubbornness behind life changes entirely. This leads to a romantic interlude between Wind and Mong that's remarkably touching and something quite rare in this genre.There's a beautiful music score by Henry Lai Wan Man that perfectly matches the breathtaking artwork particularly in scenes of sprawling landscapes of farms villages fields mountains and waterfalls. The fights are staged by an actual action choreographer Wong Wai Fai whose credits include Dante Lam's JIANG HU THE TRIAD ZONE. The swordplay is mildly bloody at times but the gorier parts are all kept offscreen. The DVD comes with both Cantonese and Mandarin language soundtracks with English subtitles. I prefer the Cantonese track because the sound quality is better and the caliber of the voice acting much higher.STORM WARRIORS II 2009 is a liveaction sequel to the 1998 film bringing back Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok in the roles of Wind and Cloud but it has points in common with the animated film including the threat of Wind going out of control. It's much darker and more claustrophobic than the earlier films and relies much too heavily on computer effects and CGIcreated backgrounds. I prefer the animated film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite David O. Selznick's omnipresence whenever his wife was involved in a film even if it wasn't his own director Henry King managed to make a fine film adaption of F. Scott Fitzgerald's celebrated autobiographical novel Tender Is The Night. Jennifer Jones and Jason Robards Jr. are nothing short of wonderful in the leads.A lot of the personal lives of both the leads went into roles of Nicole and Dick Diver. Jennifer Jones saw enough tragedy in her life for about five people and saw the inside of mental institutions a few times while on the mortal coil. And Jason Robards love of the grape was also well known.Robards purportedly is Fitzgerald himself who fell in love with a high flying millionairess Zelda Sayre and the easy living he became accustomed to sapped his creative energy. In this work Robards is a psychiatrist who forgot professional ethics and fell in love with his patient. Zelda Fitzgerald also saw the inside of an asylum but no one ever affected a lasting cure for her.The two live in real luxury as American expatriates in Europe and 20th Century Fox spent no small expense turning the locations in Europe like the Riviera Paris and Zurich into what they looked like in the Twenties. Bernard Herrmann wrote a musical score that interwove more melodies from that era than I could count.Robards falls in love with the beautiful Jones as he helps bring her out of her mental illness. The Code was as omnipresent as David O. Selznick and the barest hint of the cause of her illness was made because talk of incest was still a big taboo. It would take Chinatown more than ten years later to bring that sin into the open on screen. One thing that wasn't included from the novel was a theme of miscegenation as well in deference to our Southern audiences still not the beneficiaries of the Civil Rights revolution. Fascinating as to what was considered worse by Hollywood box office standards in 1962.Joan Fontaine plays Jennifer's older sister and custodian of the family legacy. The father was one of those robber baron tycoons who committed suicide and of course it was that and the incest that drove Jones to her illness. Fontaine totally misreads Robards as a fortune hunter but since he's pried the family's dirty secret from Jennifer's mind better to have him in the family. Because of Jennifer's illness Fontaine controls the family purse strings.Loving Jones and at the same time resentful of being tied financially to her Robards loses professional detachment. This was something he should have learned from his mentor Paul Lukas who has a small part. Tender Is The Night is an object lesson about not getting involved with a patient personally.Tom Ewell as a Broadway composer who has lost his muse in alcohol has a good role as a kind of hanger on to the RobardsJones party world. He's a good ornament to have at a party. I believe his role might be based on Vincent Youmans who gave up his career to both tuberculosis and to a drinking problem. The theme song by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster also serves as a symbol of a lot of unfinished lives. Ewell keeps playing the melody and he can't complete it. When someone else does he takes it all wrong and tragedy ensues.The title song Tender Is The Night is one of my favorite movie melodies. I have a recording of it by Tony Martin and it received the only Academy Award nomination the film had. The song lost to the title song of another fine film The Days Of Wine And Roses. Personally I like Tender Is The Night much better.Tender Is The Night was the farewell directing assignment for Henry King who in his long career directed some of the best films 20th Century Fox ever made. For some reason he's not considered at the very top of his profession and I think it's because he was contracted to one studio and stayed there. I think the reasoning is that if you're the very best you can go from studio to studio and you must be the best if everyone wants you. A contract director like King just gets assignments. But King always did his films with a certain amount elegance to them and so what if he toiled only at one dream factory. Guys like King and Woody Van Dyke and Clarence Brown at MGM always get a short shrift when discussing directors.Fitzgerald purists will not be crazy about Tender Is The Night but I think it holds up very well almost fifty years after its first release. Really top flight entertainment.".

Personally I like Tender Is The Night much better.Tender Is The Night was the farewell directing assignment for Henry King who in his long career directed some of the best films 20th Century Fox ever made. For some reason he's not considered at the very top of his profession and I think it's because he was contracted to one studio and stayed there. I think the reasoning is that if you're the very best you can go from studio to studio and you must be the best if everyone wants you. A contract director like King just gets assignments. But King always did his films with a certain amount elegance to them and so what if he toiled only at one dream factory. Guys like King and Woody Van Dyke and Clarence Brown at MGM always get a short shrift when discussing directors.Fitzgerald purists will not be crazy about Tender Is The Night but I think it holds up very well almost fifty years after its first release. Really top flight entertainment.";

	schema:reviewBody "David Selznick loved his wife Jennifer Jones. John Huston wrote in his An Open Book that David laid everything on the line for his adored Jennifer. This movie was years in the making and while this was a 20th Century Fox production not a Selznick International production Mr. Selznick was always behind the scenes suggesting ideas for the Movie. Selznick himself tried for many years to personally produce this property but could not get the financing.Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel Ivan Moffat wrote a fine screenplay and David Selznick approved Henry King as Director for as DOS put it  Henry King gets the best results with Jennifer as King directed Jennifer Jones in two of her greatest hits her Oscar winning performance in Song of Bernadatte and Oscar Nominated Love Is A Many Splendored Thing both hits at 20th Century Fox. Oscar Winner Joan Fontaine in her auto biography No Bed Of Roses noted that Henry King downplayed the erotic nature of Nicole and Dick Diver relationship and also that Joan Fontaine was treated like an extra by the crew but not by Jennifer Jones who was a Friend.Jennifer Jones was a major star in the l940's and early to mid 1950's with 5 nominations and one Oscar win but semi retired for 5 years from 1956 thru 1961 and that is a long possibly too long an absence for a major star to be off the screen. Jennifer Jones was as good an actress as Meryl Streep is regarded today and was very analytical in her performances. In this film Jennifer Jones An Academy Award Winner and Major star for nearly 20 years had Paula Stasberg most famous as coach to Marilyn Monroeas her on set acting coach which irked Henry King no end. Ms. Fontaine again in her book No Bed of Roses scoffed at the coaching and in her bio wrote Charming and Talented Jennifer was the most insecure Actress I ever worked with Fontaine noted that Jennifer would hold up production as she talked long distance with Selznick in Hollywood things such as set dressing! Fontaine observed that Director Henry King had not the slightest care or understanding of European cafe society.The movie is lushly produced and David Selznick insisted they shoot some of the scenes in Europe in Zurich on the Riviera and in Paris. In fact Selznick wanted the entire film to be shot in Paris rather than 20th's stages in Beverly Hills. The movie is very well cast with stars who can act Jennifer Jones Jason Robards and Joan Fontaine as Jennifer's brittle older sister. Some criticism was made of the fact Jennifer Jones was too old to play Nicole I disagree. Jennifer Jones eschewing 20th's makeup man Ben Nye and costumers Charles Le Maire and William Travilla looks beautiful and younger due to George Masters great hairstyles and famed designer Balmain's great outfits than Jennier Jones did in Selznick's  A Farewell To Arms five years earlier.Many top Male stars and previous Jennifer Jones leading Men such as William Holden and Gregory Peck were offered the role of Nick Diver and declined but I gather they felt in any DOS obsessed production Jennifer Jones would be the spotlighted star not them. Correct! The role of Nick went to Jason Robards and while in the early 60's he had not attained the stature as he would later in his career I feel Robards is superb and the chemistry between Jason Robards and Jennifer Jones is real on screen. It is also great to see Oscar winner Paul Lukas in a small pivotal role.Some of David Selzinck's complaints about the movie are accurate some of the sets are not at all 'Roaring 20's like' and the music could be more reflective of the period. When the movie was released it was not well received and David Selznick requested 20th pull back the movie and add scenes but alas 20th Century Fox released it worldwide as it was and after the fanfare of a big New York premiere it was quickly released and forgotten. All except the beautiful theme which Selznick hated which was Oscar nominated and played today the song is haunting and beautiful.Tender Is The Night was Jennifer Jones last movie as a true Superstar. The Selznick's hoped this film would garner Jennifer a 6th Best Actress Nomination and return her to the upper strata of leading ladies. At the time of his death David Selznick was in talks for Jennifer to appear in one of Ross Hunter's great soap operas at Universal in the hope that a Ross Hunter film would do for Jennifer what Hunter's great films did for Lana Turner mid career.The Idol in 1966 with Michael Parks and the disastrous 1969 Angel Angel Down We Go would follow and a cameo in the Towering Inferno and Ms. Jones would retire.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great 20th century American novelists all created books that were difficult to transfer to the big screen successfully. Hollywood had better luck adapting the short stories of Faulkner and Hemingway to the motion picture medium than with their master works. Fitzgerald was no exception. None of his masterpieces was a total success when rewritten as screenplays even when directed by such skilled artisans as Henry King. Only John Steinbeck's works were readymade for media exchanges. But who would place him on the same creative sphere as Faulkner Hemingway and Fitzgerald? Tender is the Night has its moments of greatness in particular toward the end and who can fault the acting of such a stellar cast. One distraction for this viewer was the failure of the director and cinematographer to capture on film the essence of The Jazz Age the way Fitzgerald did in his novel. This version of Tender is the Night has the 1960's written all over it from the clothes worn to a jetset aura rather than the Lost Generation expatriate ambiance of the Fitzgerald masterpiece. Even the music is more 1930's swing than 1920's jazz. The only saving grace in the music department is the original score provided by virtuoso composer Bernard Herrmann.All that remains of Fitzgerald is the bare bones story of the cosmopolitan Divers focusing on Dr. Dick Diver played with lan by Jason Robards Jr a psychiatrist married to Nicole Jennifer Jones who has suffered a mental breakdown. The good doctor becomes both a husband and an analyst to his mentally unbalanced spouse. On the French Riviera just before the stock market crash of 1929 Dr. Diver near middle age meets and falls for a rising starlet Rosemary Hoyt Jill St. John. As the plot thickens Dr. Diver slides into a maelstrom of drunken escapades until he hits rock bottom. The story somewhat parallels Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda's own experiences though Fitzgerald claimed it was based on friends Gerald and Sara Murphy's struggles.By all means read the novel before watching this screen adaptation. I recommend the film only as a supplement to the book perhaps Fitzgerald's best work.".

WhenI finally saw the whole thing all the way through I enjoyed it very much and questioned why it does not have more admirers.It explores many themes thoughtfully and without exploitation. Should a doctor romance his patient? When does the patient stop being a patient exactly and start being a person? Nicole meets Dick in a sanitarium. She's there for a variety of reasons none of which sister Joan Fontaine really care to discuss. It has something to do with their father. Nicole eventually is released and runs into Dick years later and they get married. They have a wonderful life and two children but it starts to fall apart. Not because of Nicole's mental state  actually as it turns out she becomes the stable one. But a friend of theirs Tom Ewell making a fool of himself as a chronic drunk dies their daughter almost dies from alcohol poisoning and Dick is see with an actress Jill St. John at a brawl in a caf and their picture makes all the front pages.Jennifer Jones is prone to be very mannered. In spite of them she's still a favorite but here she's really very good she's not too old to play the part and her chemistry with Robards is believable. Fontaine doesn't do much but enjoy her own wardrobe. As I mentioned Ewell is a drunk but his death scene or rather the circumstances surrounding it are the worse thing in the movie. Jill St. John is first seen as a youngster but she matures as the movie progresses..unfortunately her acting does not improve. At over 2 12 hours its an investment but worth your time. Now I want to watch it again. 810.".

There is perhaps not quite enough emotion throughout most of the film but by the time the end comes the film has become pretty moving. Jason Robards was definately miscast as Dick Dyver a good name for a  porn star!but Jennifer Jones shows what a good actress she sometimes could be especially when she is displaying her character's 'madness' if that's not too strong a word. None of the supporting characters are as interesting as they should be except Jill St John's aspiring actress and there is somehow little feel for the period but the strength of the story just about carries one through. Mention should be made of Bernard Herrmann's often touching if a bit self derivative!music but having the film's theme song which he did not write played endlessly on the piano by one character gets a bit annoying.Despite it's flaws this is a fairly solid romantic drama that probably seemed old fashioned even in 1962 but deserves some reappraisal.".

Mention should be made of Bernard Herrmann's often touching if a bit self derivative!music but having the film's theme song which he did not write played endlessly on the piano by one character gets a bit annoying.Despite it's flaws this is a fairly solid romantic drama that probably seemed old fashioned even in 1962 but deserves some reappraisal.";

I wanted to like this film but it is sorely dated and due for a remake. If nothing else it aptly demonstrates society stigma and misconceptions when portraying mental illness.

Oscar winners Paul Lukas and Joan Fontaine give fine support to the Star and I found Jason Robards fine as Dick Diver. There was much discussion about former Jennifer Jones co stars and friends Gregory Peck or William Holden playing Dick Diver but eventually the role went to Jason Robards who had played F Scott Fitzgerald in the play The Disenchanted on Broadway.Kudos to a great theme song Tender Is The Night which was nominated for Best Song it should have won. A beautiful haunting song! This lushly produced movie really gets to you and when you see it over and over it is like a beautiful spell.I wish I could see this movie uncut and at a major revival house in wide screen.

Over the course of their marriage Robards loses his intellectual drive and becomes increasingly dependent on Jones who although she had begun desperately needing his guidance and love gradually transforms.

She was a woman who had emotional problems that seemed uncomfortably close to the problems her character in the film experienced.The film is based on what is considered F. Scott Fitzgerald's most autobiographical novel. According to some sources Jennifer Jones' character Nicole Diver was based on Fitzgerald's marriage to a highlystrung woman who suffered from severe psychological disorders.Like Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises the film is set among expatriate Americans in Europe in the 1920's. Nicole Jennifer Jones is married to psychiatrist Dick Diver Jason Robards. They are financially well off and their life revolves around serious partying. They even have a resident alcoholic piano playing composer Abe North played by Tom Ewell who is frustrated at having a great melody stuck in his system.We learn through flashback that Nicole had been Dick's patient and there is concern that she may not really be cured and that Dick himself may have issues. Infidelity lurks in every corner especially when a young starlet takes a fancy to Dick. Eventually Nicole and Dick drift apart as Dick heads deeper into alcoholism as did Fitzgerald.Jennifer Jones still exuded that amazing aura and fits the part well too well if one is aware of her story.Cary Grant was considered for the part of Dick Diver but it finally went to Jason Robards. Although he was a brilliant stage and character actor Robards didn't project the charisma of a Cary Grant and maybe that's what was needed.Although the final scenes do pack a punch for the most part the film seems dry and talky.There is location work in Switzerland and France with brilliant scenes at the end shot on the French Riviera but much of the interior studio work is flat and uninspired. Also Bernard Herrmann's score doesn't marry with the fabric of the film the way his scores did for Vertigo North By Northwest and many others.The actors are photographed mainly at the middle distance with few closeups. Possibly Selznick forbade closing in on Jennifer Jones who was about 43 at the time. She looked fabulous though with a tightly bobbed hairstyle.Big and glossy the film is interesting more for the behindthescenes story but for Jennifer Jones fans she is still a good reason to seek it out.".

It's not really worth giving spoilers but I'll just say that the movie is worth seeing if you just want to satisfy your curiosity as I did. A much more faithful and betterquality adaptation is the 1985 Showtime miniseries but I'm not sure if it's available anywhere. Regarding that version I thought Mary Steenburgen an actress I generally love was miscast as Nicole but Peter Strauss as Dick and the rest of the cast were very good. BTW since I'm a Fitzgerald junkie I'll share some background Fitzgerald created Dick and Nicole as an amalgam of two couples his friends Gerald and Sara Murphy wealthy American expatriates in France and himself and Zelda. The Divers' glamour wealth and charisma derive from Gerald and Sara their neuroses from Scott and Zelda. BTW Zelda was not a millionairess as one reviewer saidher family in Alabama was comfortably middleclass not in the millionaire category.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well c'est la vie.A wonderful cast and beautiful scenery are the highlights of Tender is the Night a 1962 film starring Jason Robards Jennifer Jones Tom Ewell Joan Fonaine Jill St. John and Paul Lukas. The film is based on a book by F. Scott Fitzgerald.Fitzgerald wrote beautiful prose but much of his work has been difficult to adapt to the screen. He himself worked as a writer in Hollywood but wound up uncredited on most of the scripts and told someone that he did recognize one of his lines in a film that evidently had not been cut from a script.In this film Robards plays Dick Driver a psychiatrist who falls for one of his patients Nicole Jones. Nicole is being treated for mental instability the result of incest though this is only hinted at. When Dick realizes his feelings and hers he quickly distances himself but she runs into him after she leaves the sanitarium and the two wind up getting married.Nicole is filthy rich and the money is controlled by her sister Joan Fontaine. Dick gets lulled into the good life the parties the travel the luxury and while he intends to return to his work at the sanitarium and finish a book he doesn't go. This is mainly because the insecure and sometimes paranoid Nicole is resistant. When he finally returns to the sanitarium his mentor Lukas is dying and the sanitarium has been taken over by a colleague who only wants Driver's investment. Driver refuses since he would have to get the money from Nicole but she insists. But for Driver it feels like it's all too late.The acting is superb and Jones one of my favorites looks gorgeous throughout. She is somewhat nervous and mannered as Nicole but that's the character and she captures her. Robards is strong emotional and excellent as the deeply convicted Driver. And how wonderful to see Paul Lukas. I actually recognized his voice and then looked at his face  I'm so used to seeing him in movies made 20 years earlier that I didn't recognize him at first.The problem with the film for me is that so much that goes on is beneath the surface  this can be a fascinating feature but it is directed at too leisurely a pace by Henry King. The St. John character is never really fleshed out she darts in and out of the picture ditto the drunken composer played by Tom Ewell. We just don't know enough about him to care. Joan Fontaine wears some great clothes and acts well and we do get to know her somewhat.The other problem is the time in which it is set which seems a bit generic. It's supposed to be the '20s  I can tell by the music  but not by anything else. The ambiance is '60s.Nevertheless Tender is the Night was an ambitious project that probably could have used some judicious editing but if you're a Jones fan you won't want to miss it.".

I loved Jason Robard's performance very much and enjoyed that his character was from Glens Falls where I lived from 1983 to 1985.This film is no perfect adaptation of the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald and that is reflected in how David O. Selznick reacted to its release back in 1962. But it is a respectable film made more likable by the performances by Mr. Robards Jennifer Jones Tom Ewell and Jill St. John.Beyond the usual this is a film of transitions. Jennifer Jones' career though restarting here was really winding down as she only made three more films before retiring in 1974. Tom Ewell is beginning to look more haggard here compared to when he was acting opposite Marilyn Monroe some years earlier.On the other hand Jason Robards would see his career progress further continuing until his death in 2000. Jill St. John not only progresses from childhood to adulthood in this film but did so in real life she would turn 21 during the general time of the film shoot. This is also the film where she would change her hairstyle to the bob that she would wear during the 1960s.And speaking of which  Even looking at the titles of this film one gets the feeling that despite the 1961 filming and 1962 release this is very much a Fifties film and with some sense of restraint. That may be where the downfall of the film may be but I cannot say for certain. Remember this is the early 1960s.And if there were limits might Cleopatra with its studio overruns have made an impact? Possibly. Anyway give this movie a chance. It is rewarding to watch! 810.".

Then there are the wonderful images and the haunting music. The excellent supporting cast. Mervyn Johns is an excellent Cratchett multidimensional and fun loving. Michael Horden as Jacob Marley definitely the best performance as the ghost. Scrooge is shown to be calculating at every juncture but seems to know that in many ways he is wrong. His avarice becomes his mistress and he can't forsake her. There are wonderful little scenes that I remember. When he stops to have dinner at the restaurant and is told more bread will cost extra he decides to deny himself a little bit of warmth. There is the scene where Fezziwig loses his business to Scrooge not a part of the original book but it works fine in the film. Scrooge hesitates for a moment and then barges on and shows his insensitivity by retaining a worker at a reduction in salary. The scene where Marley is dying and Scrooge waits till the end of business. He then comes to the house and asks Is he dead yet? We all know the ending but there is a joy a blissful excitement not found in any of the other films. This is all attributable to Alastair Sim. He carries every moment. He shows us what real acting is all about. I treat myself to this movie a couple times a year and it never tires me. See it if you never have.".

	schema:headline " The definitive Christmas story";
	schema:reviewBody "Scrooge is the definitive Christmas story. Ebenezer Scrooge is a wealthy businessman in Victorian London and a miser. One Christmas Eve he is visited by the ghost of his expartner Jacob Marley as well as three Christmas spirits who gradually convince him of the error of his ways. As a result he awakens on Christmas morning transformed into a veritable champion of the season and all that it stands for.This 1951 version of A Christmas Carol Scrooge remains the best for an important reason of all the versions made before or since this is the only one that got it absolutely right.The story  as so many have misread it  is not about an evil tightwad who hates everything and is suddenly scared into being a saint by the spirits of Christmas. It is instead about a good man whose life has turned him in on himself  made him bitter and miserable  primarily through the death of his beloved sister Fan. He is not therefore changed in the end but rather restored to himself his innate good nature emerging renewed from its cocoon of selfimposed misery.Of course the Spirits of Christmas must do the job for him since Scrooge can't rely on his own sense of reason and fair play to save him from himself  his position is technically valid. The opening scenes demonstrate how everyone is expecting something from him in the name of Christmas  but not in the name of what's fair A debtor wants more time to pay  in the name of Christmas. A charity wishes him to donate money  in the name of Christmas and Cratchit wants the day off  with pay  in the name of Christmas. As Scrooge points out if he were to dock Cratchit's pay half a crown for a day without work Cratchit would feel illused but it's perfectly alright to ask for a day off  with pay  from Scrooge. That it is all done in the name of Christmas hardly counts as an argument either since Scrooge has lost sight of what Christmas is all about.That is Scrooge's illness and A Christmas Carol recounts this classic Dickens tale of the cure.Thanks to Alastair Sim's wonderful performance we can almost feel sorry for Scrooge. He suffers more from his miserly nature than anyone else. We are introduced to a reasonable man who simply wants to be left alone and we can empathize with him  in part at least. We see him a man of great wealth deny himself a piece of bread simply because it would cost an extra halfpenny. Lit by a single candle and warmed by a meager fire he sits alone and lonely on Christmas Eve in his large and empty house. Sim also adds a wonderfully droll sense of humor to his portrayal thus making Scrooge more of a character than a villain and that much more sympathetic from the outset.Come Christmas morning we celebrate with Scrooge because we know him. In spite of ourselves we liked him even before his rebirth and now are delighted that he is finally happy. His acts of humility and generosity come from a familiar soul and we are touched by them.I first watched this film in 1955 on television Christmas day. I have not missed a Christmas in the fiftyplus years since then and always find it wonderfully entertaining and inspirational. Aided by a wonderful cast and careful adherence to Dickens' original dialogue and concept it has deservedly become a Christmas classic. I can't imagine that there is someone who hasn't seen it but if you haven't I certainly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Dickens' finest hour? Transformation and redemption have never been better described";
	schema:reviewBody "I do love Charles Dickens critics of his might say that he went for the emotional jugular and that he even might be sentimental or even worse manipulative but really he had a consistent message to get out that the plight of the poor and unfortunate is everyone's concern and this story tells it best  against the backdrop of the Christmas season the time to celebrate give gifts and welcome friends and family into warm homes to share festivity and generosity. I think that a Christmas Carol is not so much a tale for the family as it is Dickens trying again to pierce hardened hearts of the  during that time  men in society. The men who had trained their eyes not to look down at the gutter or the darkened doorways where society's less than fortunates were cowering for mercy help a hand up or a hand out. I think this story speaks directly to those men in Dickens' day who could do the most to rectify the wrongs described in this tale. Those less fortunates were there in Dickens' day just as they are with us now and just as there are influential prosperous and greedy men and women Scrooges among us today who coolly and easily stare straight ahead past those less fortunates instead of choosing to extend a helping hand. I never could appreciate what this story was really about until I became an adult and witnessed the great divide in our society between the Have's and Havenot's and the amazingly steeled resolve of those among the Have's to enjoy the Christmas season while not really being concerned at all with those poor souls in the ranks of the Havenot's. At this time of year Mr. Scrooge when want is most keenly felt....Dickens largely devoted himself to the plight of the less fortunate  and we should all be so generous to show even a trifle of such concern for our fellows in need. Many Britons would probably agree that after Churchill Dickens is one of England's great men greatest men perhaps one of England's greatest people ever. A real humanitarian dedicated to social change.And so to the role of Scrooge in this edition of this great story   the role every mature actor hopes he'll get a chance to play  comes Alistair Sims and he certainly does the role of Scrooge no disservice. I'll agree with one of my fellow reviewers in saying that I'm not sure if he owns the role outright but surely no one yet has emerged to lay a better claim to it. Certainly not onenote and pompous little Patrick Stewart. George C. Scott acquits himself admirably but certainly cannot claim to own this role.So many of the other reviews here have stated well the praise that Mr. Sims deserves for his portrayal of Scrooge and many have made mention of their own favorite and classic lines from the movie. I'll not try to restate what has already been written so well before me but instead I'll point out for others some of my favorite little details of this great story and specifically of this particular version.I think some of the greatest lines of all are reserved for the ghost of old Jacob Marley dead for seven years who comes to call late on Christmas Eve and warn Scrooge to change his ways. His indignation at Scrooge for referring to him as a good man of business by screaming that mankind was my business! was a perfect retort to the old miser. Marley disparages how he had lived  and how Scrooge was presently living  and further reduces their life's work to no more than bald faced greed with the disdainful line my concern never roved beyond the confines of our money changing hole!. His description of the chain he forged in life link by link that was now choking and weighing him down in the afterlife and the warning to Scrooge of how your own coil was as full and long as mine these seven years ago and you have been laboring on it since. It is a ponderous chain! In a way I think that the Marley character might be the juiciest role rarely have I seen it given the appropriate weight to show the full measure of remorse for a life misspent and the ominous warning for a friend heading down the same path of damnation for all eternity. The degree to which this role is played gives Scrooge that much more of a contemptible and hardened crust to be cracked by the spirits to come because of Scrooge's selfrighteous and indignant dismissal of Marley's ghost. Marley being the closest thing to what Scrooge could describe as a friend is a tortured soul condemned to torment in perpetuity. Marley only seeks to warn his old friend to turn back before it is too late but his friend is already too far gone to heed his warning.After the chilling visit of Marley and the bitter revisiting of Scrooge's past the appearance of the Ghost of Christmas Present is a welcome and wonderful respite. He embodies the goodness of how we all wish Christmas to be merry abundant good through and through for all no matter their station in life. His exit when he is abruptly changed from ruddy faced and jolly to serious old and grey has always struck me. Particularly I never understood until I was much older the two miserable holloweyed and gaunt children that clung to his robe  the boy and the girl Ignorance and Want and the ghost's warning to watch out for the boy in particular. I still find that moment chilling and still relevant today.Most moving of all to me is the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Be's stop at the Cratchit family's house in the future. The heavy air everyone trying to buck up and keep a stiff upper lip while under a heavy pall and poor Bob Cratchit's brave but feeble attempt at putting a positive spin on things for his family by talking cheerily of the lovely gravesite they picked out until he loses his composure sobbing my poor little child in debilitating grief. The Bob Cratchit part is a good one not a big part but a very important one that reveals what harm Scrooge has wrought through his miserly and cheap existence. Without Bob Cratchit and his poor family's real suffering under Scrooge we don't get to fully appreciate how bad Scrooge's dastardly handiwork is and just how dramatic his ultimate salvation really is.The other character that reflects directly on Scrooge and in this case as a perfect mirror of what Scrooge has not become is dear old Fezziwig. Oh would that every business owner and capitalist today were as decent and altruistic as he!Watch this film taste every morsel and savor every bite! It is a feast for the heart. Where It's a Wonderful Life transforms a truly good man who already thinks only of others by showing him what he could not see about himself and thus saves him from bitterness despair and suicide A Christmas Carol  in contrast gives us as hateful and diabolical a man as we could ever hope not to meet. A man who smugly has no regrets no remorse and feels no guilt for his absolutely selfish ways and it is only when he is finally forced to see what he has caused does he realize that in order to ultimately save himself  and all those his life touches  from himself he must embrace goodness. His transformation into a man that is good and that is concerned for others is at the end truly a cause for joy and celebration. Both films  while now canonized as family classics  I believe are targeted specifically at adults.Either to warn and prod the selfishly immobile into benevolent action as in A Christmas Carol or to show what surely every adult with heaping responsibilities must feel at some time feelings of uselessness disappointment and discouragement that have wrongly overshadowed the good acts in one's life as in It's a Wonderful Life. In either film you get a joyous transformation of the soul by the end. There is no shortage of reminders these days to watch It's a Wonderful Life but please! don't ever let a Christmas go by without watching Alistair Sims in his masterful portrayal of Scrooge  along with all the other fine performances  in A Christmas Carol.".

	onyx:emotionText "I do love Charles Dickens critics of his might say that he went for the emotional jugular and that he even might be sentimental or even worse manipulative but really he had a consistent message to get out that the plight of the poor and unfortunate is everyone's concern and this story tells it best  against the backdrop of the Christmas season the time to celebrate give gifts and welcome friends and family into warm homes to share festivity and generosity. I think that a Christmas Carol is not so much a tale for the family as it is Dickens trying again to pierce hardened hearts of the  during that time  men in society. The men who had trained their eyes not to look down at the gutter or the darkened doorways where society's less than fortunates were cowering for mercy help a hand up or a hand out. I think this story speaks directly to those men in Dickens' day who could do the most to rectify the wrongs described in this tale.

Iendorse the review already placed here by jackboot and I havealso been particularly touched by that small scene betweenScrooge and the maid with not a word spoken that Seashell 1mentions. Two points I would like to underline here which I havenot seen mentioned by others First this is about the onlyChristmas Carol movie that remembers to be a GHOST story aswell as a Christmas story. The superb camera work by PenningtonRichards and the powerful score by Richard Addinsellhelp to make this movie rather scary in places as it should be.Nowhere else have I seen the grim bleakness of the grimier sideof Victorian London so immediately conveyed. The scene whereMarley's ghost is caught out in the snowstorm with a multitude ofother wailing spirits is truly horrifying and there are many suchmoments such as the one where the Spirit of Christmas Presentsuddenly reveals to us the personifications of Ignorance andWant they really scared me as a kid and they should scare us allas adults now. Secondly and above all I think that the reason whyAlastair Sim succeeds so brilliantly here in a role which hasdefeated so many is that he was chiefly a COMIC actor. EbenezerScrooge has from the beginning an underlying humor whichmakes him human by allowing it to come out he makes thetransformation plausible by making you understand that thishumor was dormant in him all along just waiting to be awakened.It just isn't Christmas without Sim.".

Death during childbirth was not associated with either the mother or Fan ... implying that the distancing between Scrooge's father and Scrooge as well as between Scrooge and Fred was merely because both had become miserly and unfeeling men of business.

	schema:reviewBody "I positively love the Alastair Sims version of A Christmas Carol... simply titled Scrooge upon its 19512 release. It's the first I recall seeing and it began my devotion to reading just about everything Dickens has put to pen.Now that said I have noticed countless people who comment that this is the truest to the novel and I'm sorry but having read this particular novella at LEAST a couple of hundred times... several times every Christmas I can assure you that it in no WAY is the truest to the actual novel. But this in no way detracts from its own value as a moving experience in watching the transformation of the quintessential Scrooge in the person of Alastair Sims.Where it deviates GREATLY with the book 1. There is no Belle we have the girl of his love changed into an Alice... why this name change defies any logic I can fathom. 2. Unlike the Belle whom we see happily married with children giving Scrooge a glimpse of what he'd lost still with the Ghost of Christmas Past... we later have her shown as a poor spinster working as some nurse or volunteer in an almshouse poorhouse or some such institution and that by the Ghost of Christmas PRESENTcompletely not in the book and I think an unnecessary deviation from a much better scenario presented by the book's original author. 3. The first scene of young Scrooge left back at school has him practically a man not the little boy reveling in the stories of Ali Baba and Robinson Crusoe and the Parrot! Fan is practically a woman not the excited tiny girl who had to reach up just to put her arms around her brother's neck. Again these do not prevent it from being a good movie but are a disappointment to a purist like myself who would truly like the movies to be more faithful to the book. I am stunned by the number of people who often think this to be one of the most faithful when if anything it deviates from the actual text if anything MORE than most.The manner in which Scrooge and his later partner Marley join forces at another business not anywhere in the book... the manner in which they procure Fezziwig's own business and put him OUT of business not anywhere in the book the continuing sequence of scenes of his hard business dealings nowhere in the book... His bedside scene where Fan dies and she makes him promise to look after her son... nope not in the book... the bedside scene of Marley's death... also not in the book. create a mountain of little infidelities which while unfaithful to the actual text DO manage to create a nice Christmas storyjust at least as I see it...NOT the one Dickens created.The scenes created in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Present with the exception of the Alice scene are among the few that do remain somewhat more faithful to the written story although much is left out as well. The episode with the Ghost of Christmas future is practically inverted with the first scene at the Cratchits which is practically the last in the book... but this minor item can be overlooked as much of the dialogue at the 'Change is faithful to the text and the BEST scene in my humble opinion is that of the Undertaker the charwoman and Mrs. Dilber in their dealings with Old Joe which I find delightfully close to the text.Of course we all know how it ends the great transformation. This is handled very well and close enough to the book to satisfy even persnickety folks like me especially since the lad shouts WalkER instead of some of the inane substitutions made by those newer versions which feel this compulsive need to translate things into a more common language for the viewer. And with all that said I give it seven stars... actually it merits an 8 12 as a thoroughly enjoyable and inspirational Christmas story... but I penalize it for its vast variance from the actual text and in my opinion overuse of poetic license and therefore round it back down to seven but here... don't let this Dickens purist and curmudgeon detract you in the least. It IS after all is said and done... a very good motion picture! And that's MY take on it!".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two movies that crop up repeatedly on television at Christmas. One is It's a Wonderful Life less often now that it's no longer in the public domain. The other is this version of Charles Dickens' story. Curiously enough both films deserve the honors.This one is fine in every respect. It was directed by Brian Desmond Hurst who used to call himself The Empress of Ireland. The studio was small with few locations shots and limited stages. Yet it comes as close as any other attempt in catching Dickens at his best. It could be argued that the movie is better than the novel as it is in my opinion.Is it really necessary to outline the plot? Okay. An old and bitter miser is visited by three ghosts on Christmas Eve  the ghosts of Christmas past present and future. They  well they scare the dickens out of him and he reforms forthwith.Ebeneezer Scrooge is played to near perfection by Alastair Sim and all the other performances are fine. The photography and lighting are done by C. M. PenningtonRichards who deserves some kind of medal for making something out of nearly nothing.The squalor we see on the screen was very real in Dickens' time the 1840s. There were no safety nets if you lost your job or grew old except inadequate private charities and government poor houses. And it was the age of horrifying and deadly infectious diseases like typhoid and cholera. Half the funerals of the day were for children. It's an oddity that when Dickens visited the United States he met and chatted with Edgar Allan Poe. One wonders what in God's name they had to talk about.It might be worth pointing out that after his epiphany Ebeneezer Scrooge remained a prosperous businessman and capitalist. There was no more talk of letting the poor die off and reduce the population but neither did Scrooge man the barricades. He didn't become a socialist. He just stopped being a Social Darwinist and became a Mensch. No need to go on about it. It's a fine and very moral movie.".

Film studios have remade Charles Dickens' story of A Christmas Carol so many times people often mistake one version for another.The original story saved both the career of Dickens down on his luck and the holiday of Christmas largely forgotten by the public of the 1830's. However the moment publishers released the novel the public clamored for more. Three years later the play ran continuously all over London and the book went through six printings resurrecting Dickens' reputation as a storyteller and the idea that Christmas should remind the public to help the poor and destitute. At this time one in ten London funerals was a child usually death by malnutrition or starvation in a city blessed with opulence. After the release of A Christmas Carol lawmakers strived to rid the community of workhouses and debtor's prisons.In the Twentieth Century the story struck studios as a waiting gold mine starting in the silent era having made no less than twentyeight versions of the story since 1900. MGM released the first large production in 1938 with Reginald Owen as Ebenezer Scrooge. This version appalled the English as MGM made major changes to the novel's story. Other studios produced similar 'cut' versions around the same time. However it was producer George Minter trying to save a small studio in England named Renown Pictures who persuaded writer Noel Langley to adapt the Dickens' novel into a screenplay. He had been friends with George Cole who lived next door to Alastair Sim known for his comic roles. The pair just finished starring in a comedy film together when they came to audition for acting producer and director Brian Hurst Hurst demanded to see if Sims could do a 'serious' role. However Minter ran the show at Renown Pictures and hired Sims on the spot along with Cole as the younger Scrooge. Minter also hired Set Designer Ralph Brinton later Oscar nominated for Tom Jones and cinema photographer C. PenningtonRichards who had a rather short tragic career. Richards went with a rather dark look on the film that added to the austere sets of Brinton. Sim took to the role of Scrooge with relish painting a truly evil man whose dour expressions and stone reflection on his partner's death left audiences cold and surprised the comic actor pulled the part off so well.Unfortunately Minter's plans to debut the film at New York's Radio City Music Hall that Christmas turned disastrous when the hall's committee rejected the film as 'too dark' for America audiences. It played at a theater around the corner for three weeks panned by critics and the American public. Minter quickly pulled the film back to England. However the film ran to pack houses and rave reviews in England where it enjoyed a long run. During production many famous people visited the set including Bette Davis and Douglas Fairbanks Jr along with Dickens' grandniece. She declared the film the only genuine representation of my greatuncle's work. The film then fell into obscurity and America audiences were largely surprised when it began to turn up on television around Christmas time. They had mostly seen the Reginald Owen or George C. Scott versions Scott's being the least Scroogelike with his 'I'll phone it in' performance. As if discovering a long lost art treasure critics changed their tune and America embraced the Alastair Sim version as the official Scrooge. In 2007 VCI Home Video purchased the rights and went back to the original film negative to make a 'restored' version released last year selling in stores this year for less than 15.The restored Scrooge is wonderful to see with prolonged scenes and the opening fully restored the hand pulling the book down from the shelf and so on. The blacks are blacker the lines sharp the artifact removed and the original soundtrack restored without hiss. Alastair Sims and his miraculous transformation into the endearing beloved comic at the end is warmly embraced by English audiences annually as a true Christmas tradition. While we have our American films such as It's a wonderful life and White Christmas Dickens' classic English tale gives us the story that saved Christmas and reminds us that this season is not simply a Christian holiday but a human one as well. This is a time of year when we reach out to those less fortunate and offer some warmth and happiness so that we may all enjoy life's blessings. If you bother to watch any film this holiday season take the time to see the Alastair Sims' version 1951 of Charles Dickens' Scrooge in the restored edition and may God bless us all everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has been a part of my life since the first time I saw it about 60 years back. No Christmas season has gone by without my watching it again sometimes more than once and with the coming of VHS and DVD I now view it even more often. Why? Well I am and have always been a fairly voracious reader and a highly voracious film viewer and while I certainly cannot claim to have read even onetwentieth of the novels upon which subsequent films were based of those I have read there are precious few in which the film version has equaled or perhaps even slightly surpassed the original. I could probably count them on the fingers of one hand. This is one of them. Another is the much underrated  but mainly by critics who have never read the novel  DEATH ON THE NILE the most perfect realization of an Agatha Christie novel ever filmed and because so wellmade perhaps a bit more exciting. But back to A Christmas CAROL. Dickens is arguably the greatest novelist in the English language and the characters he creates the dialog he provides for them and his general commentary on the most dire or comic situations are indelible and unforgettable to anyone who has indulged in reading him. Possibly because of that most of his greatest novels have had at least one great film version and most often a good deal of their greatness has been determined by how closely they stick to the original text. Think of the 1930s version of THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP with an unforgettable performance by Hay Petrie as Quilp the 1940s versions of OLIVER TWIST GREAT EXPECTATIONS and NICHOLAS NICKELBY and the 1950s version of THE PICKWICK PAPERS. Of course these all came from England. The one Hollywood excursion into true film greatness by way of Charles Dickens is the incredibly moving 1935 version of A TALE OF TWO CITIES although they produced a first rate David COPPERFIELD shortly before it. But for me none of these comes as close to a full realization of Dickens as the 1951 Christmas CAROL. Every time I see it I feel like I have truly been transported back to mid19th century England. The visual filming is absolutely perfect of course but it is the performances of the entire cast that make the film the greatest film realization of any of Dickens' works but most especially that of Alastair Sim as Scrooge. This has to be one of the very greatest acting performances in the entire history of cinema. I have seen any number of other actors in this role  Seymour Hicks Fredric March on TV Albert Finney George C. Scott Patrick Stewart  and great actors that they all are not one comes even close to Sim. As is commented on elsewhere here he quite literally 'owns' the role and his is my mind's eye image whenever I think of old Ebenezer Scrooge. Interestingly that great British character actor Francis L. Sullivan is my similar mind's eye image of Nero Wolfe whenever I read one of Rex Stout's hilarious mysteries yet I'm pretty certain Sullivan never played that particular role. Sim was a great and highly prized comedian yet his greatest film performance is certainly in this very dramatic and thrilling version of the Dickens classic. And Michael Hordern is just as definitive as the ghost of Jacob Marley  has ever this condemned spirit been so hapless shrill and selfcondemnatory as Hordern makes him or so concerned with saving his friend Scrooge from the torment now visited upon himself? You can only pray that his condemnation is not for all eternity but like Hamlet's ghost only a temporary state until his sins have been expiated. And amazingly enough George Cole playing Scrooge as a betterhearted young man looks amazingly like a young Alastair Sim or at least a young Scrooge who will grow into the old Scrooge we now see before us. For me this is not just a perfect film realization of a great short novel but quite simply one of the most perfect movies ever made another one would be the 1940 THIEF OF BAGDAD but it was not based on anything so concretely unchangeable as a Dickens novel one so grandly flawless that the imagination cannot conceive of it ever being done as well again.".

He adds little touches to the character that sets his performance apart from the countless other Scrooges. As for the story well unless you have been living under a rock or weren't raised in an Englishspeaking country then you should know the plot to this classic. Miserly Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by three ghosts on Christmas Eve to show him the error of his ways. Obviously I recommend the book because it's a seminal classic. But as far as film versions go this is the one everyone should see first.".

No matter how many enactments of Dickens' classic I experienced it seemed none had begun to do justice to the images formed in my mind by the book's grim depictions of Victorianera England. The first thing one realizes in this particular version is director Brian DesmondHurst's timemarcheson approach not to mention his total lack of pretentiousnessa factor which has ultimately felled all other treatments as well as the screenplay frittering away no time whatsoever in getting to Scrooge's visits with the ghosts. The penetration into the miser's past is the focal point of the film and Sim's performance has a throughandthrough naturalness that makes his exuberance on Christmas morning that much more palpable. There's a mechanical nature to the character's nearrecitation of his familiar lines at the start but his sheer vulnerability something distinctly lacking in say George C. Scott's portrayal from then onward gives it perfect sense. Sim is every inch the visual equal to his radioScrooge counterpart Basil Rathbone.Other factors contribute towards making the film the complete triumph it is things like the visit from the ghost of Christmas Present and the scene in the future depicting Tiny Tim's funeral preparations which for once are truly heartwrenching.It looks like the real thing it sounds like the real thing Lord knows it feels like it.

The story is set in the Aegean on the eve of World War I when so many nations lusted to flash their sabers and sound their canons. Ben Kingsley brilliantly plays Pascali a bottomranking spy for the Ottoman Empire that after reigning for 900 years is about to be annihilated by the war. The name Pascali is a reference to JudeoChristian symbols of the paschal lamb passover and so forth and the story incorporates the encounter between Muslim Turkey and the Greek Orthodox Church. Pascali longs for the attention of expatriate Lydia Helen Mirren who being an Austrian represents the impending war's crushing of the AustroHungarian Empire as well. Into the lazy sun drenched intrigue of Pacali's Greek island steps one Antony Bowles a most poished Charles Dance. A failed archeologist turned worldtraveling swindlersophisticate Bowles in classic Anglic fashion plays the Turks and Germans against one another. The only thing missing in terms of dynasties the Great War destroyed is a reference to the Romanovs! But then actress Helen Mirren is of Russian descent...hmmm. Even the Americans are involved as distantly glimpsed for they would not enter the war until 1917 arms merchants. Lest this all seem like a pretentious amount of historical intricacy Pacali's Island is a modest set piece about a handful of people whose gods have deserted them or never heard their plaintive worshipping in the first place. The blinding glare of the Greek Islands is artistically wrapped like bleached gauze around a mood of sweatandouzosoaked melancholy. Mature intelligent and sensitive this one requires the viewer to be wide awake. View it perhaps on a Sunday morning while the coffee is fresh. Take from it the line that means nothing out of the movie's contextThe error of their ways. Quality film making!".

	schema:headline " Underrated romantic intrigue";
	schema:reviewBody "'Pascali's Island' could have been made specifically by and for the Greek tourism bureau. The cinematography is so utterly gorgeous as to make this film selfrecommending. If you are an addict of the Greek Isles then this film is a musthave for those long winter evenings in the upper Midwest or whereever your winters are spent when you need to see shimmering Dodecanese seas and opalescent sunrises and dazzling golden sunsets. The views of the azure sea set between the whitewashed houses on Symi and Rhodes where this film was shot are enough to make one give up the unequal battle and retire immediately to some beachshack on one of those stunning islands.Added to the glorious photography is an especially beautiful score by Loek Dikker a very fine composer who first came to attention with Verhoeven's early film 'The 4th Man'. Moving beyond the travelogue attractions of this film there is the understated and touching romance of the character of Basil Pascali wonderfully embodied by Ben Kingsley in what could be his finest work since 'Gandhi'.

The Greeks are about to reclaim their land and Basil is facing a dark future until Charles Dance happens on the scene. Any further comment on their activities would spoil your firsttime viewing so I'll stop. Dance is very good as is Helen Mirren as the beautiful and decadent Viennese artist who is Basil's old pal and Dance's new love.'Pascali's Island' is a subtle film not for boys night out or the kids on a Saturday night. It's a thinking film set in a glittering location that creates a very pleasant marriage between eye and mind. Not so common a thing in the flicks these days when you come to think about it. That alone makes this repeatable viewing.Highly recommended especially to Ben Kingsley Helen Mirren Charles Dance and Greek Island fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Pascali's Island' could have been made specifically by and for the Greek tourism bureau. The cinematography is so utterly gorgeous as to make this film selfrecommending. If you are an addict of the Greek Isles then this film is a musthave for those long winter evenings in the upper Midwest or whereever your winters are spent when you need to see shimmering Dodecanese seas and opalescent sunrises and dazzling golden sunsets. The views of the azure sea set between the whitewashed houses on Symi and Rhodes where this film was shot are enough to make one give up the unequal battle and retire immediately to some beachshack on one of those stunning islands.Added to the glorious photography is an especially beautiful score by Loek Dikker a very fine composer who first came to attention with Verhoeven's early film 'The 4th Man'. Moving beyond the travelogue attractions of this film there is the understated and touching romance of the character of Basil Pascali wonderfully embodied by Ben Kingsley in what could be his finest work since 'Gandhi'.

The story had great potential the three leads are all fine actors and all do decent jobs here and the cinematography and period features are faultless.

	schema:headline " Refreshingly Original Zombie Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The zombie horror genre is an oversaturated one and it takes something truly original to remind you why you loved them in the first place. Pontypool is such a movie. If you think this is going to be a straightforward zombie flick it's time to think again.The first half of the movie moves slowly but efficiently as a radio host and the two women in his team begin to realise that something is most definitely wrong in their normally quiet little town. With the aid of some wonderful cinematography and an intelligent script the audience is holed up inside the radio station as reports begin to filter through of mysterious events which are growing ever more threatening in nature.The second half of the story when the cause of the danger becomes known and our protagonists are forced to protect themselves will either impress you as it did me or completely lose you. If you're lucky enough to experience the former you'll realise that this movie has far more going for it than your standard 'mindless zombies run around eating brains' movie. It's a cerebral horror movie designed to make you think as you watch.The acting is solid throughout. Stephen McHattie who had small parts in Watchmen and A History Of Violence amongst others and whose voice and appearance reminds me of Lance Henriksen is perfectly cast in the central role and is backed by great performances by Lisa Houle and Georgina Reilly. As most of the early scenes of rising dread come from their characters listening to others calling the radio show their reactions are essential to maintaining suspense and they do a fantastic job.If you're a fan of more intelligent horror fare such as the earlier work of David Cronenberg you'd be advised to take a look here. It's a movie that defies expectations and provides a refreshing injection into a genre of movie that has become increasingly tired as of late.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pontypool is one of the few horror movie that used a little creativity and proves you don't need a high budget to a make horror film. The story circles around a local radio station and its crew of three people. As the day moves on they slowly start to here reports of violence happening all over the region. This includes riots people killing each other and intervention from the Canadian Government. Soon they find themselves hiding in the station from the horror out side they are reporting. If that was not bad enough they can't figure what's going on. Pontypool takes a very different and more effective way at trying to scare its audience. Most western horror these days seem to mainly focus on jump scares or brutal kill scenes alone. Pontypool on the other hand gives a few vague descriptions on what's actually going on out there. For most of the movie you really are just listening to a broadcast and testimonies of eye witness. This leaves the viewer having his own imagination working against him for a big chunk of the film. For me this was the most strongest for the first half of the film when we don't know what's causing the hysteria. I actually only have one real complaint which I felt the ending could have been better. I didn't hate the ending it just feels kind of weak compared to what we see earlier. I would go into more detail but that would results in some spoilers.Overall it's a fun creepy horror movie that could be enjoyable for Halloween. I give it a few extra points for what they were able to pull off on a low budget and for an interesting experiment in horror.Thats why I give this radio broadcast from hell an 8 out of 10.".

And what if you were only one of thousands who shared the same compulsion? This novel depicts just such an epidemic. It's the compelling terrifying story of a devastating virus.I will not tell you how you catch it so as not to include spoilers but once it has you it leads you on a strange journeyinto another world where the undead chase you down the streets of the smallest towns and largest cities.If you are expecting a night of the living dead style film... this is not it. This movie does a fantastic job of drawing you into the world of the characters their relationships and everything falling apart around them you are not an outside observer. You are for all intensive purposes just another Pontypool citizen wondering WiskeyTangoFoxtrot.This movie is a great treat for four reasons 1 The focus on the actors as the actors were perfectly cast. You may recognize an actress from the recent release of Dark Room 2 The choice to follow the Aliens model of never placing the source of fear and unease front stage. By not letting you in on the whole thing and only providing glimpses your imagination will take the scenes further than any expensive CGI ever could. 3 The writing and angle of the movie.

	schema:headline " Gruesome chillingly memorable and darkly funny semiotic zombie film";
	schema:reviewBody "As with many film genres the psychological horror film becomes increasingly in danger of being driven into the proverbial ground under a staggering mountain of clich and repetition with frustratingly few alternatives to the same old spin on the same old story. However with Pontypool Canadian independent director Bruce McDonald manages to not only breathe fresh life into an increasingly withering genre but concoct a sliver of something altogether unexpected and new in the process. Adapted from screenwriter Tony Burgess' own novel about a small Ontario town overrun by zombies infected by a virus spread through the English language McDonald's impressively lofi sheen proves the perfect fit for a zombie horror film brave enough to engage in notions of semiotics dismantling the English language and forms of verbal communication and philosophical reflections on interpersonal communication and survival situation ethics while somehow managing to remain darkly comedic in the process. Yet inherent complexities and offbeat humour aside Pontypool remains a gruesomely effective and taut piece of psychological horror beautifully paced and peppered with chillingly detached bursts of visceral violence and gore making it almost essential viewing for any horror film fans. Taking notes from abiding genre classics such as Alien McDonald keeps the viewer daringly in the dark throughout the film offering only tantalizing snippets of information from outside news broadcasts to contextualize the viral outbreak and horror unfolding outside the secluded setting. This focalization alongside the protagonists serves not only to draw the viewer in further in terms of alignment with the characters but perpetuates a noxious continual sense of claustrophobia amplifying the creeping terror to almost unbearable levels. Far from balking at the challenge of keeping a single enclosed setting interesting McDonald practically drinks in every last inch managing to make the radio studio appear alternatingly oppressively tight and eerily vast  a masterful exploration of subjective relations to space. Similarly Claude Foisy's eerie dirge of a spectral musical score perfectly compliments the film's crushingly atmospheric veneer.And yet McDonald refuses to let genre conventions stifle an impish sense of fun as the film's grisly realism is counterbalanced by unexpected moments of irrelevant silliness a man dressed up as Osama Bin Laden appears on Mazzy's radio show with no explanation given tastefully melding the zombie horror and black comedy genres to create a remarkably unprecedented result.

	onyx:emotionText "As with many film genres the psychological horror film becomes increasingly in danger of being driven into the proverbial ground under a staggering mountain of clich and repetition with frustratingly few alternatives to the same old spin on the same old story. However with Pontypool Canadian independent director Bruce McDonald manages to not only breathe fresh life into an increasingly withering genre but concoct a sliver of something altogether unexpected and new in the process. Adapted from screenwriter Tony Burgess' own novel about a small Ontario town overrun by zombies infected by a virus spread through the English language McDonald's impressively lofi sheen proves the perfect fit for a zombie horror film brave enough to engage in notions of semiotics dismantling the English language and forms of verbal communication and philosophical reflections on interpersonal communication and survival situation ethics while somehow managing to remain darkly comedic in the process. Yet inherent complexities and offbeat humour aside Pontypool remains a gruesomely effective and taut piece of psychological horror beautifully paced and peppered with chillingly detached bursts of visceral violence and gore making it almost essential viewing for any horror film fans. Taking notes from abiding genre classics such as Alien McDonald keeps the viewer daringly in the dark throughout the film offering only tantalizing snippets of information from outside news broadcasts to contextualize the viral outbreak and horror unfolding outside the secluded setting. This focalization alongside the protagonists serves not only to draw the viewer in further in terms of alignment with the characters but perpetuates a noxious continual sense of claustrophobia amplifying the creeping terror to almost unbearable levels. Far from balking at the challenge of keeping a single enclosed setting interesting McDonald practically drinks in every last inch managing to make the radio studio appear alternatingly oppressively tight and eerily vast  a masterful exploration of subjective relations to space. Similarly Claude Foisy's eerie dirge of a spectral musical score perfectly compliments the film's crushingly atmospheric veneer.And yet McDonald refuses to let genre conventions stifle an impish sense of fun as the film's grisly realism is counterbalanced by unexpected moments of irrelevant silliness a man dressed up as Osama Bin Laden appears on Mazzy's radio show with no explanation given tastefully melding the zombie horror and black comedy genres to create a remarkably unprecedented result. And while the film may not be a flawless entry into the genre Burgess's script offers the occasionally wooden patches of dialogue and the daringly ambiguous ending may not be for all tastes such a unique spin on age old narrative tropes deserves recognition and plaudits from all capable of stomach the material both in terms of jarring violence and troublesomely complex thematic and philosophical overtones.

Afterall for every great movie we often have to sit through a dozen bad films. Pontypool did not disappoint and greatly exceeded my expectations. To begin if you watch horror films solely for the blood and guts then this isn't a movie for you. This movie doesn't follow the typical format of a band of survivors battling their way through hoards of zombies. In fact you might not even call the infected in this film zombies. Most of the movie takes place in the same location but the concept is innovative and the suspense is brilliant. Basically the disease in this film isn't some random virus or parasite. The disease is language. The way this is done is really creepy and if you watch it you'll see what I mean.As I said if you want violence and blood and guts then you might not appreciate this movie. But if you're looking for a psychologically terrifying experience then check out Pontypool. And if you work for Comcast please put this movie on OnDemand!".

Pontypool is a zombie flick but one that is unique original thoughtful macabre and utterly scary. And my fellow Canucks it is Canadian.Pontypool belongs to the lessismore school of horror filmmaking meaning that you're more likely to scare an audience by suggestion and careful skilled filmmaking than by showing all the strings of saliva and bloody entrails. In Pontypool the horror is communicated verbally inside a radiostation from outside then recommunicated back outside with a little something added or a little something taken away in the translation. Spreading the word reworking the word. By the time the socalled zombies reach the church building where the station is located in the second half of the film you're almost shaking with dread.Stephen McHattie's Grant Mazzy is a garrulous aging rebel the new talkshow host on this particular morning and Lisa Houle is the bythebook producer trying to rein him in. Then there is the assistant Georgina Reilly an Afghan vet. As the day progresses they try to decipher what's going on outside. Their man in the field is in the news helicopter which is fiscally ridiculous until you discover that the helicopter is a car on a hill  with sound effects. Even the BBC enters the picture what? not CNN?. The movie is walltowall dialogue and you know  I didn't even notice! Some things I particularly liked. At one point Grant Mazzie has a mental breakdown. He succumbs to outandout paranoia  the kind of paranoia where the floor seems to drop out from underneath you and you have nothing to hold onto. He fears that somebody's pulling his leg. This is all an elaborate hoax at his expense. C'mon  zombies? And this hurting proud man becomes very angry. This scene feels so right and McHattie nails it. The spatial layout of the studio becomes an important element in the story with the sound booth an island of safety in a vast unknown. And when that safety is breached just the simple act of crossing that big empty space seems fraught with peril.The revelation of what the virus infecting people was made me grin from ear to ear. The film had me up to that point but now it REALLY had me. The revelation made sense given all the previous events and the actors tore into the idea so to speak with enthusiasm. The market is saturated with zombie movies most of them disposable but Pontypool takes a great idea and runs with it. You willingly want to give yourself to it. It's also a reminder of what a low budget dedication and talent can achieve.".

Tony Burgess' script is intelligent and interesting offering a different take on just how people can get infected and become violent. It ultimately loses a little of its effectiveness in its third act when it starts being more conventional. Use of gore is discreet and the atmosphere is undeniable. With the number of main players in the story kept to a bare minimum a high degree of intimacy is achieved.The underrated veteran character actor Stephen McHattie gets a chance to sink his teeth into a rare meaty lead role as Grant Mazzy a sardonic shock jock now working as a morning radio man in the small Ontario town of Pontypool. Together with his fellow employees Sydney Lisa Houle who in real life is Mrs. McHattie and LaurelAnn Georgina Reilly he discovers that things outside are going from bad to worse.

Eventually with the help of a doctor Hrant Alianak who provides plenty of exposition they get to the bottom of things but it remains to be seen if their newfound knowledge can aid in the restoring of order.Mostly played straight but not without a sense of humour this is one of those individualistic little gems that jaded horror fans would do well to check out. It creates some genuine tension and doesn't treat it as a given that all will end well. The actors work very well together especially McHattie and Houle who get a great many scenes with each other towards the end of the film. Slick widescreen photography is an asset as well as McDonald's nononsense direction.It just goes to show that good ideas and simple no frills filmmaking can make for good entertainment and that sometimes less is indeed more.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:headline " An intelligent zombie film. Who knew?";
	schema:reviewBody "Zombies  as I have written in many a review  are maybe the most boring of horror film villains. Although 28 Days Later and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead did their best to revamp the genre zombies for all intents and purposes are boooooring.Yet there doesn't seem to be a week that goes by that a new zombie film doesn't hit the DVD shelf or have a limited run at the local holeinthewall theatre just outside of town.At age 39 yeah that's right I had come to believe that the best of all the zombie films were behind me and that there would be nothing new for the genre to show me that hasn't been done in everything from Death Becomes Her to Pet Cemetery.I am gleefully happy to report that well that I was wrong. And it took a small Canadian film to show me that you can still take a stale boring near dead genre and breathe fresh crisp air back into an unsuspecting audience.Pontypool stars Stephen McHattie as Grant Mazzy a talk radio DJ that just so happens to be on the air when reports start to come in about strange mob behavior in the Northern Ontario town of Pontypool.He along with Sydney and Laurel Lisa Houle and Georgina Reilly respectively spend most of the movie sitting in the station trying to put the pieces together through various callins from town locals. It is a fascinating trip where the audience uses their own imagination from the descriptions to accompany any horror or violence that is ensuing within the town borders.Information comes slow at first. They are told that a mob of hundreds are attacking the office of Dr. John Mendez. From there reports of murder and horror come in spurts.

	onyx:emotionText "Zombies  as I have written in many a review  are maybe the most boring of horror film villains. Although 28 Days Later and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead did their best to revamp the genre zombies for all intents and purposes are boooooring.Yet there doesn't seem to be a week that goes by that a new zombie film doesn't hit the DVD shelf or have a limited run at the local holeinthewall theatre just outside of town.At age 39 yeah that's right I had come to believe that the best of all the zombie films were behind me and that there would be nothing new for the genre to show me that hasn't been done in everything from Death Becomes Her to Pet Cemetery.I am gleefully happy to report that well that I was wrong. And it took a small Canadian film to show me that you can still take a stale boring near dead genre and breathe fresh crisp air back into an unsuspecting audience.Pontypool stars Stephen McHattie as Grant Mazzy a talk radio DJ that just so happens to be on the air when reports start to come in about strange mob behavior in the Northern Ontario town of Pontypool.He along with Sydney and Laurel Lisa Houle and Georgina Reilly respectively spend most of the movie sitting in the station trying to put the pieces together through various callins from town locals. It is a fascinating trip where the audience uses their own imagination from the descriptions to accompany any horror or violence that is ensuing within the town borders.Information comes slow at first. They are told that a mob of hundreds are attacking the office of Dr. John Mendez. From there reports of murder and horror come in spurts. All unconfirmed but all truly believable thanks to the convictions and the terror in the voices of each caller.Later in fear for his life Dr Mendez stumbles across the radio station and he helps connect the dots that might sound ridiculous but are shear genius. Seems these zombies are not created the old fashioned way wherein one bits a living person and thus transforms them thanks to the transfer of fluid.Nope director Bruce MacDonald based on a script by Tony Burgess instead has people becoming violent and insane for the taste of death due to a virus spread by words in the English language.

	schema:reviewBody "I admit I stopped watching after 30 minutes. I accidentally thought it was a horror film but the first 30 minutes consisted of a radio show host trading barbs with his fussy producer while his fawning assistant looks on him reading yes reading a live report from a police scanner in the basement of a church while hearing reports of people killing each other outside. Right after the report the producer insists the host let some local yokels sing for the radio. What?? It made no sense. There was nothing scary or even interesting. In fact the entire producer vs shock jock thing was clearly CONTRIVED since we are supposed to see this talk show host as edgy being restrained by his uptight produceras a plot element. But they were in a tiny town broadcasting out of a basement. What is a highstrung quibbling producer doing biting the heels at every sentence of a shock jock that doesn't say anything... that shocking? Also where are the callers and the take no prisoners attitude? Eric Bogosian's Talk Radio this isn't. We just hear a lot of talking talking talking. How boring!McHattie's voice is nice and gravelly but without a decent script it's not enough to sustain a viewer's interest more than 10 minutes much less 30. The entire when would you call 911 thing went nowhere. And where's the horror? So I fastforwarded the movie to the point where we would see something happen OUTSIDE of the basement. But all I saw were blackwhite family photos of some of the victims and then we're back in the basement for the entire movie. IT NEVER LEAVES THE BASEMENT! It's at best a oneact play in one claustrophobic scene. At worst it's a RADIO PLAY put to film for no reason whatsoever! The entire budget of the movie must have been spent on McHattie and the radio studio. Many people liked this movie claiming it made them think and was an interesting idea a zombielike virus which spreads by language but I think a movie should be more VISUAL otherwise it's really just a radio play and the film is superfluous. And in art anything superfluous detracts from the message. A complete waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pontypool is set in the small town of Pontypool in Ontario in Canada  starts as local radio station DJ Grany Mazzy Stephen McHattie drives into work during a snowstorm it's winter  it's dark  cold  Mazzy hates the winter. Mazzy starts his show his producer Sydney Briar Lisa Houle listens  looks on while his technician LaurelAnn Georgina Reilly pushes the buttons that need pushing. Disturbing reports of strange incidents start coming into the station reports  eyewitness accounts of riots where people chant random words  phrases while attacking other people  property. Neither Mazzy or Sydney know what to make of the reports or whether to even believe them but they soon find out the truth for themselves that an infection is spreading that turns people into mindless zombies...This Canadian production was directed by Bruce McDonald  is a film that many seem to be raving about lavishing all sorts of praise on it however I see things very differently to those people  thought Pontypool was boring tripe. For a start at over an hour  a half it's far too long the first forty minutes is slow going with nothing more than the performances to maintain ones interest. Sure Mazzy tries to inject a little life into his boring radio show from missing cats to what the weather is doing but ultimately I was bored  not captivated. An offbeat comic horror Pontypool presents an infection that is spread by certain words now I don't know about anyone else I just found that concept extremely hard to relate to  like. I suppose if your looking for a deeper message then you could say Pontypool is a look at how the media can use words  phrases to infect us to poison us to manipulate us  change us but I actually think that's giving the film a bit too much credit. I seem to get the impression that a lot of people like Pontypool because it's different which it is because it's original which again I suppose it is  that it's intelligent which I certainly don't think it is. Just because something is different doesn't mean it's great Pontypool is a good example of this. The somewhat muddled plot has it's problems too how do people get infected? Is it when they say a word or when they hear a word? What happens to them? Do they need to feed on other words or what? It's all rather vague  Pontypool finally descends into complete gibberish as Mzzy tries to well confuse everyone as he tries hard to make people not understand him including us but talking nonsense. Apart from it's quirkiness  a few nice lines here  there I can't say I liked Pontypool at all  found it a very frustrating boring  unrewarding experience.Set almost entirely in one single location Pontypool might have made a decent stage play but as a film I found it repetitive. The idea of experiencing an outbreak of a new infection through the ears of a confused  scared radio station employees over phoneins police reports  eye witness accounts is sound as an idea but talk about stretching it out. To be honest the likes of Night of the Living Dead 1968  Return of the Living Dead 1985 are more credible a zombie virus spread through certain words? A bizarre concept for sure that some seem to like  they are entitled to their opinion just as I am to mine. Forget about any proper horror I didn't think it was scary although there is one jump moment near the start  there's no blood or gore either to speak of. I suppose some will find Pontypool tense as we hear the action unfold for the first forty five minutes rather than see it just like the radio station crew but again my argument is I just found it dull  boring.With a supposed budget of about 1500000 this looks decent enough  has good production values but I still didn't like it. The acting is solid Stephen McHattie in particular carries large chunks of the film on his own.Pontypool is a film that seems to getting rave reviews but so what? If I didn't like it I didn't like it  no amount of people who write reviews online saying how good  scary Pontypool is are going to change my mind. I guess I am just offering an alternate view to the popular one personally I didn't find it scary refreshing or original at all but that's just me. A sequel Pontypool Changes 2012 is listed as being in development.".

AuthorScreenwriter Tony Burgess throws out a very scary 'What if' kind of idea which sustains the movie for a good hour. Unfortunately when the hour is up chaos follows for the remaining twenty five minutes. It feels like the movie as a whole is trying to make a metaphor or send out a message about humanity. However you choose to interpret it you won't find greatness here but you'll find something.It starts off in the dead of Winter in the town of Pontypool Ontario. Grant Mimzy is the local radio man operating with his team in a basement. One day he hears from his man in the field who apparently watches the town from his chopper that a strange riot is taking place in town. The news is so bizarre that at first Mimzy thinks it is a hoax. Eventually the scary truth emerges a virus has broken out in Pontypool. This virus is not transmitted through food not through the air or physical contact. It is spreading through word of mouth. While hiding from the rest of the infected town Mimzy and his crew must find a way to stop the virus before they themselves along with the rest of Canada becomes infected.If I may digress for a moment I'd like to point out how something can be hilarious in one context and very disturbing in another. The first symptom of the virus in Pontypool is sputtering gibberish which will probably unsettle the audience. The same kind of gibberish is sputtered by John Cleese in the Monty Python 'Inspector Tiger' skit and it's funny.When watching Pontypool you kind of enjoy the disturbing feeling. This is how you can tell when a horror film is good and up until the climax Pontypool is pretty good. For some reason the filmmakers cannot keep it together. They are clearly intent on having a nonclich unconventional climax. What they come up with is as inexplicable as trigonometry to a first grader. Then it gets even worse the film has no ending. Maybe the idea makes more sense in Burgess' novel format. Books can get away with stretching things out in ways that film cannot. As a movie the Pontypool story is overrushed in its conclusionMovies like Pontypool are tricky to recommend because there are an equal number of ups and downs. It is up for the viewer to decide with rules the other out the ups or downs. May as well try it.".

That out of the way I was looking forward to watching it after reading loads of positive reviews but I just wasted 90 minutes or so of my life sitting through this movie. I've never read the book but that's irrelevant  I'm talking about the film. It was dire. The whole premise that language can cause problems on the scale the film presents is just too far off centre. Maybe literacy rates have suffered these past few decades and I sometimes shake my head in disbelief at some of the emails and letters I receive but the worse they cause is mild indignation. They don't prompt me to go on a murder spree. And yes I know the premise is more the understanding of words but why just the English language? The word 'love' is surely understood no matter what the language for example. The differences between what Ken in the Sunshine Chopper was describing when talking about the mob pulling people from a car quite visceral stuff and the apathetic mob that invades the radio station is stunning. They can't be the same group of people. There was no tension  the church basement was too open plan to make the scene claustrophobic and there were far too many ways in  I mean come on using windows twice. There a far too many unanswered questions Why did neither Grant nor Sydney see the child sitting in the chair as they walked past? Why if the 'zombies' were attracted by speech could unaffected people just not walk right by as long as they didn't speak? What happened after the countdown at the end of the film  was it a nuclear device an ordinary explosive soldiers storming the station?

While I was disappointed in it I feel like I will have to explain my issues with it as constructively as I can because one has to understand that the movie was trying to be something different. The actors were good and there was definitely some clever dialogue that made me laugh but the spread of infection is quite absurd. I was very open minded to the idea of the spread of infection but it is really quite hard to take seriously. With out trying to give too much away when they do discover what infects people it becomes very hard to believe and some of that comes from the dialogue to describe how it infects. It is also where most of the character believability goes. This movie probably shouldn't be referred to as a zombie flick because it's so much different from a typical zombie movie. Not that it being different is bad it's just very likely it isn't what a zombie fan would be looking for if you find yourself enjoying open endings with plenty of questions then you may enjoy it. Understandable it is a movie trying to break from the stereotypes and the general concept is interesting but the movie is a little allover the place. Some of the frustration comes from the entire movie minus the introduction being in the same radio station. It becomes quite tedious visually and with the limited cast not that there's anything wrong with that its variation just isn't there. Although when the movie is first unfolding I found it quite suspenseful with the lack of knowledge and the creepy muttering of the infected but I found in the later half of the movie it really loses that edge. The movie does have several frustrations that don't seem to be resolved and if you stay till after the credits you will be rewarded with. Something? Honestly the movie is confusing but you'll get the general concept. Hardcore zombie fans will probably want to veer away from this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most unintentionally funny movies I have ever seen. The script defies logic and the acting is the worst I have seen in quite some time. I am still scratching my head and trying to figure out what they really wanted to do with this movie besides just be a really bad gore movie. Somehow a dead crow falls and hits a rock which rolls and down a hill and hits a doctors windshield which makes him crash into a bus transporting prisoners. The prisoners take him hostage and set out through the woods. Every at this point has heavy European accents and the background is obviously set around Germany yet we are told that we are in Seattle! Okay I guess? Well from there they walk into a fog and come out and there is an old cottage filled with people straight out of the 1700s. They speak like an olden time Yoda. We soon find out that these people are like vampires but look more like a a hairless werewolfvampire hybrid if that makes sense. We have the standard slaughter scene of everyone but the doctor and this one female member of the tribe who has her inner vampire under control and helps him escape.The cops catch up to the doctor and take him into custody. He has all the blood of the victims on his shoes but they can't find the house so of course they are going to send him to jail. All the while we keep getting these black and white flashbacks of the doctor as a kid trading a toy clown to the female from the cottage for a cross that she gives him with a dog laying in between them.Now we are in yet another bus transporting criminals. One of the men setting in the back of the bus says one of the funniest unintentional gut busters of the year. We tries to pull off a thick southern accent and says ahhh you don't wanna talk to Georgy Porgy. I laughed so hard that I had to pause the movie for at least 20 minutes.The bus makes it to the same stretch of road when you guessed it another dead crow falls hits another rock which rolls that spooks a deer into running out in front of a car and she hits the bus. Rinse and repeat. Now we have the doctor yet again in the woods with more convicts heading straight for the cottage again. In one of the oddest scenes in a movie when they reach the cottage one of the convicts says I can see it all now and we see his thoughts in which he is drinking raping women throwing money around and smoking cigars. After this scene the doctor says no it will go more like this and we see his thought process of them all getting slaughtered. So did he read the guys mind or what? Anyways the group enters the cabin we have a very weird scene of the doctor removing a bullet from one of the convicts scrotum. What makes this scene weird is there is twangy country music playing the whole time that really does not fit the moment.Once the monsters make it there we have the typical slaughter scene with one exception that really left me perplexed. Everything in this house is from the 1700s yet one of the convicts just casually bends down and picks up and chainsaw which starts with one pull of the string and starts sawing people. So this family lives like the 1700's does everything that way all their tools is that way yet they have a gas powered chainsaw? Now were at the ending in which the doctor and the girl escapes. They make it to the road in which the doctor for some reason stands in the middle of the road with his eyes closed until you guessed it he is hit by a car which causes another bus crash. Only this time the girl is hit also and when she opens her eyes she is one of the monsters now. sigh I guess this means a sequel is unfortunately in the works. We cut to another black and white scene of the doctor full grown talking to the girl with the dog still between them and he thanks her.Wonder if the state ever decided to check into this one stretch of road and see why so many bus crashes happen there and lose so many criminals there?".

	schema:reviewBody "When the movie started I was pleasantly surprised about some rather nice camera work. This pleasure lasted exactly until one of the actors started to speak.This movie proves that basic technical skills do not make good directing Apart from moving the camera in the right way a director also has to make decisions concerning things that do or don't work. Ittenbach's movie fails miserably in the attempt to get some acting out of the amateur cast.I sometimes enjoy amateur actors but here we have a disastrous collision between the lack of acting skills and the inane things the poor people are supposed to say. The plot revolves around some convicts stranded in a forest hut with a family that obviously lived secluded from civilization for some centuries. When these people speak they use what writers Ittenbach and Thomas Reitmair assume to be an ancient English dialect. This idea may have looked nice on paper but the result is absolutely hilarious. Because the writers believe that old English simply consists of attaching a th to every verb everybody is phonetically challenged and has to speak very slowly. When the doctor asks the protagonist girl horrifically played by Ittenbach's wife Martina whether she has some hot water her unwieldy reply is Aye haveth I. For the reader What do you think is the translation of no into old English? Right Nay haveth I not. Almost as funny as this is the grandiose overacting by Dan van Husen who tries to play the chief convict. If somebody told him that he is not Anthony Hopkins would he believe it? Inexplicably Jrgen Prochnow also has a small part unfortunately a talking role. He's as terrible as in all of his English speaking roles. I thought his career had hit rock bottom when he appeared in House of the Dead but it's strange how things can always get worse.The only thing that Ittenbach is known to do really well is overthetop splatter and gore effects. The movie is rather tame in this respect even compared to Ittenbach's work in Uwe Boll's BloodRayne where the two formed an unholy alliance. The effects did a lot to make this the first of Boll's movies that was comparatively bearable. As a director however Olaf Ittenbach is a much more terrible than Boll and would deserve an appropriate level of notoriety.".

As a director however Olaf Ittenbach is a much more terrible than Boll and would deserve an appropriate level of notoriety.";

While in a bus with dangerous inmates the bus crashes on a car and the story repeats like in a dj vu for Dr. Douglas and the criminals.House of Blood is an extremely violent and gore with scary and gruesome special effects. Unfortunately the acting is uneven with good but also awful performances. The screenplay and the story are flawed since what could be the possibility of another identical accident in the same lonely road in the same circumstances? But there are good points in the story and with improvements and better actors this movie would have a great potential.

	schema:headline " Some sporadic moments of gore but still a really poor movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Some movies are hard to enjoy no matter how much we try to overlook the flaws. I simply couldn't concentrate on the dialogues which is already a big shame considering that we're in the 21st century and movies in this day and age are not silent anymore. I know most of the cast members were German and they were speaking in a foreign language but frankly I don't think that is the audience's fault. So why should we pay for the consequences and put up with these extremely irritating thick accents? I'll never know. American actor Christopher Kriesa performing Dr. Douglas Madsen was perhaps the only decent or at least mildly tolerable character. The others were simply pitiful especially because of that fictional and laughable form of an antique English dialect spoken by this group of weirdos who live in a cottage in the middle of the woods. Perhaps this socalled ancient form of English was just a way to cover the fact that the actors weren't English speakers but the results turn out to be pretty bad anyway. Concerning the plot I don't know if it is too weak or not maybe it is but that is not nearly as blameworthy as the fact that the same story happens twice. Hard to believe as it is it's real. The exact same story occurs twice in each half of the movie only with different characters except for Dr. Douglas Madsen who appears both times. It seems like the writers were desperately trying to fill one hour and a half and they run out of ideas when they finished the first half of the script. It's somewhat hilarious come to think of it. It's like watching a new horror movie and then the quick remake or something of that sort.I hate being harsh with my reviews because regardless of how much I can like or dislike a film there's always a noble effort coming from a director the cast members and everyone involved in a movie. Perhaps Chain Reaction can be appreciated for its little things like the unpretentious moments of plain gore that avoid the cheap CGI for latex and Korn Flakes. Frankly I didn't enjoy the movie very much but I'm sure gore worshipers are going to find it bearable on the whole.".

Therefore since it had a larger budget I was hoping that Chain Reaction would be a leap forward in terms of overall quality for the German master of gore. But apart from a some flashy CGI credits a few crashes and the presence of a 'real' actor Jurgen Prochnow not a lot has changed. In fact to be honest the acting is actually worse than usual and the script... well it maketh me laugh!A dead crow drops from a tree to the ground and dislodges a rock which hits a car belonging to a doctor that crashes into a busload of violent criminals who escape into the woods taking the doctor hostage and eventually wind up in a house occupied by weird religious folk who speaketh in ye olde dialect who then transform into flesheating demons. Phew!To be fair I like the initial premisethat something as insignificant as a dead bird falling from a tree can set off a series of dreadful eventsbut unfortunately so does Ittenbach. A lot. So much so that he uses the idea three times within his film! After his captors are all killed the good doctor escapes only to run into the arms of the law who suspect him of foul play and decide to keep him under lock and key whilst they investigate.The doctor is put on a DOC bus to be transferred to jail and guess what happens..... that's righta dead crow drops from a tree to the ground and dislodges a rock which hits a car that crashes into the busload of violent criminals... and so on.And when a third dead crow causes even more trouble later on one wonders whether it might be wise just to cut down all of the trees along this stretch of road to bring down the accident rate.As always with an Ittenbach film there is plenty of gruesome gore on display with some very nasty crushed heads being the most sickening of these but with quite a long running time there are also periods in which the film is just too 'dry'. Some of these moments offer some presumably unintentional laughs the aforementioned olde English spoken by the demon people is hilarious but other parts are just plain dull. Jurgen Prochnow is given nothing much to do there is lots of mundane chitchat and the whole 'dejavu' angle quickly starts to irritate.Ittenbach is a director who has shown a lot of promise in the past he certainly knows how to put together a decent gore scene. Perhaps in future if he gets a reasonable amount of dosh to spend he should invest in a decent scriptwriter and get a better cast. I'm sure he has a horror 'classic' somewhere up his sleeve however on the strength of this effort it's hard to believe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Phew... after the incredibly bad Dard Divorce I am honestly positively surprised by House of Blood which was releases previous to Dard Divorce. Again the visuals are pretty good there is nice cinematography all over great camera moves... Mr. ittenbach even managed to include elements to the plot that was not just working for the gore elements some at least...Basically you get a straight horror movie about a bus of criminals on their way from one prison to the next that crashes in a car accident. After killing off pretty much everyone the psychos head for the Canadian border and end up in a house full of strange religious people like from 100 years ago. Since one of them is wounded the criminals have a doctor they kidnapped fix their pal up... well until the inhabitants of the house turn out to be some kind of cannibalzombiewerewolfvampires and things get messy. Although my version of the movie is 100 Minutes and clearly says uncut I doubt Mr. ittenbach would cut away from heads being bashed in so I'd say mine was cut and the full version delivers more gore entertainment like every Ittenbach movie does.Yet like every Ittenbach movie also this one suffers from some wooden acting. Yes they got some decent actors like Christopher Kriesa and even Jrgen Prochnow but the fight sequences often seem clumsy and worst of all again Martina Ittenbach plays a major role and we all know she is an abysmal actor. Here she has to deliver lines in an accent that sounds like a mix of pilgrim and Romanian and is laughable most actors don't even deliver the TH of thou hath etc. right. Some of her looks in scenes of emotion like the unbelievable romantic finale are kind of funny... but I don't want to see that in a movie with the production values of House of blood but rather in a school play.There is some mysterious twists that lead to the doctor witnessing the events twice in a kind of timeloop which could have worked along with the straight house full of bloodfreaksplot but just watch the ending and you'll understand why it doesn't. House of Blood is by far superior to the incredibly dumb Dard Divorce but it angers me again that Ittenbach trashes so much potential with a mix of good and abysmal actors and his obvious lack of talent for story writing. Please stick to FX and directing and let talented writers do that job... it hurts to see all that work and potential go down the drain every time I see your movies.".

Yes they got some decent actors like Christopher Kriesa and even Jrgen Prochnow but the fight sequences often seem clumsy and worst of all again Martina Ittenbach plays a major role and we all know she is an abysmal actor. Here she has to deliver lines in an accent that sounds like a mix of pilgrim and Romanian and is laughable most actors don't even deliver the TH of thou hath etc. right. Some of her looks in scenes of emotion like the unbelievable romantic finale are kind of funny... but I don't want to see that in a movie with the production values of House of blood but rather in a school play.There is some mysterious twists that lead to the doctor witnessing the events twice in a kind of timeloop which could have worked along with the straight house full of bloodfreaksplot but just watch the ending and you'll understand why it doesn't. House of Blood is by far superior to the incredibly dumb Dard Divorce but it angers me again that Ittenbach trashes so much potential with a mix of good and abysmal actors and his obvious lack of talent for story writing. Please stick to FX and directing and let talented writers do that job... it hurts to see all that work and potential go down the drain every time I see your movies.";

The biggest one here is the needless circular storytelling that happens as the film goes through two different versions of what happens are repeated again in the course of the running time. This is a part of the film's rather troubling storyline in general as getting the second half of the story to repeat the first half in order to tell everything again really makes no sense as it employs the exact same setup with the exact same outcome both times over and it exemplifies the problem with the rest of the film's storyline and structuring issues. Not only does this one repeat that facet wholesale but it skips around repeating scenes from earlier to show the accident that stranded them there and then later on going back showing the group getting free by shooting their way to freedom which are simply inserted into random sections of the film and altogether simply makes for a jumbled storyline. As well the fact that hardly any of the characters are that likable makes for a tough watch when it's really hard to understand why they're together traipsing through the woods simply bullying each other or going to such extremes simply displaying such utter stupidity in their decisionmaking that really adds to their unlikable nature and really troubles the film but it's not a rather huge issue. The greatest plus for the film though is that none of that matters when it gets going and starts to deliver the goods and this one does a great job at producing copious and overthetop quantities of gore and bloodshed. This here is quite varied about where it comes from ranging from crude surgeries of amputated limbs to hearts being ripped out decapitations gunshot wounds and much much more here that make this a real gorehound's dream. That also means a lot of action scenes here with plenty of confrontations between the two sides starting with the first group appearing there and the family turning into the creatures fighting off the group in extended brawls throughout the cabin which is quite fun while the second visit there brings out the more adventurous brawling that shows the group being completely overwhelmed from the start and it's quite a bit of fun especially with the peculiar group of demons present they must battle. Throw in an atmospheric house for the location as well as the great monster makeup and it's got enough to make it interesting over those few flaws.Rated R Extreme Graphic Language and Extreme Graphic Violence.".

	schema:headline " Poor effort from Ittenbach.";
	schema:reviewBody "Olaf Ittenbach's career as a director is an interesting but usually not good one. He started out directing lowbudget splatter films like Burning Moon Black Past and Premutos Lord of the Dead which got him a cult following. He then graduated to doing makeup and gore effects for things like Uwe Boll movies and directing larger budgeted movies like Legion of the Damned Garden of Love and Dard Divorce which were attempts at doing more mainstream friendly horror. Another one of these attempts is 2006's House of Blood originally called Chain Reaction which suffice to say is pretty bad.Dr. Douglas Madsen Christopher Kriesa has been taken hostage by a group of escaped convicts who decide to take refuge in a cottage. Inside said cottage is a strange family that speaks in Olde English and also seems to double as a religious cult. The family then turns into bloodthirsty demons is there any other kind? and kills the criminals but Dr. Madsen is saved by local girl Alice Olaf's wife Martina and ends up being interrogated by police one of the officers is played by Jrgen Prochnow and of course they don't believe his story so he ends up taking a bus ride to a prison with some inmates. The bus crashes and you can guess what happens next.I'll say this much about House of Blood The gore and splatter FX are pretty impressive the cinematography is good and Kriesa delivers a good performance. Unfortunately he delivers the only good performance as everyone else is terrible mostly just shouting profanities and pointing guns at each other. They are all supposed to be from America and this is supposed to take place here but most of the cast speaks with Germanic accents and it was clearly shot in Germany. Also while the gore is effective there isn't enough as the viewer has to wait for what feels like a very long time for the splatter to hituntil then it's a lot talking and yelling at one another.Then there's the fact that the direction editing and script which Ittenbach cowrote with Thmosat Reitmar are all pretty poor. If this was from a rookie director it would be more acceptable but Ittenbach has been making movies since 1989 and that this is his tenth movie. None of it feels like something that was directed by a man whose been making movies for seventeen years. It just feels like something directed by a hack looking to make a quick buck.All around this is a terrible movie with very little to recommend. If you want to watch a movie from Ittenbach watch one of his earlier splatter movies. Those aren't great but at least they're directed by someone who gave a damn about what he was making.".

I honestly thought that people had their heads blown off IT'S THAT BELIEVABLE!!!The emotional depth of the film told through a subplot of a vampire and her gentle lover almost made me cry. Tears of laughter fear and joy...tears of anguish compassion and dexterity...tears of pure emotion.The subject of male genital disfigurement was dealt with sensitively and tastefully and i feel the director was justified in his decision to show the practice of scraping out a left testicle. Had this been the both testicles I would have felt offended and would have felt morally corrupted and violated.The ending twist was a complete surprise but entirely expected and predicted by two of us. However this did not detract from the overall impact of the film and we would strongly urge the producer and director to sit down and consider the sequel 'Chain Reaction 2 The Widow's Revenge.I believe this film will inspire not only amateur filmmakers but such 'stars' as Tom Cruise Brad Pitt and Opera Winfrey. This film is now my 1 alltime favourite replacing such classics as 'The Godfather' 'Ben Hur' and 'Mr Bean goes to Hollywood'.YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!".

The script by Thomas Reitmair  Ittenbach isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination there are lapses in logic what horror film doesn't?  the whole chain reaction plot that the original title is obviously referring to is a bit muddled somewhat confused  to be honest I'd have preferred for the filmmakers to have played the entire plot straight rather than go back  forward in time  rely on flashbacks. There is also the tiny fact that the second half of Chain Reaction is exactly the same as the first half with a few minor details changed like the prisoners are different  the nature of the injury sustained by one is as well but for all intents  purposes the last 50 minutes is exactly the same as the first 50. I have to say I quite liked this idea at least we didn't have put put up with these unlikable character's for the entire duration of the film at least the film tries to cram in lots of blood gore  violence at least there isn't long tedious passages of dialogue to pad things out  I must admit I didn't know where the film was going with it.

The character's are poor though  unlikable the dialogue isn't great  the film lacks tension although there is some atmosphere.

Set in America but actually shot in Munich in Germany. The acting is not good that's one point where I agree with the other comments here.Chain Reaction House of Blood sounds so much better doesn't it surprisingly impressed me. I think it might be just that I've seen so many crap horror films lately the atrocious The Dead of Night 2004 to name but one that this seems like an absolute masterpiece by comparison  all that cool frenzied gore helps too.

A house in the middle of the woods where people speak in King James English and drink goat's blood... A doctor who had an encounter with a angeldemonhotina'it's closing time'sensechick as a boy  but instead of being eaten is given a gaudy amulet that he wears for sixty some odd years... A jail sentence that makes less sense than giving Mr. Rogers the chair... These my friend are the elements that make up what is supposed to be a story.Sure  it's gross. Plenty of gore. The problem is even for hardcore gore lovers out there who I am not numbered amongst this is the same sfx that folks were using for B movies in the 70s. Nothing particularly clever or interesting or disturbing here...Basically these people become regenerating demons that can't be killed and can't be stopped and will not let you get away... Unless you are an old man with a bum leg  in which case you can escape twice. Why does he escape twice? Because he is the part of three different bus wrecks that involve prisoners being transferred  which isn't the least bit unbelievable right? In the margins are maniacal prisoners who get what they deserve in the form of being eaten alive.Hmmm... That last line makes the movie almost sound good... But don't be fooled. This is a DVD you should avoid.".

	schema:headline " House of Blood";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a cabin in the middle of the woods far from modern civilization inhabited by a group of unusual people who speak Old English and become demonically possessed savages with a craving for anything with blood in it. Poor Dr. Douglas MadsenChristopher Kriesa traveling to pick up medical equipment happens to come across a bus wreck carrying evil inmates who have eliminated the security assigned to keep them detained. Forced against his will Doug will have to follow the four inmates into the woods as they head for the Canadian border only to find the cabin which occupies the strange folk who warn them repeatedly to flee before the turning occurs. What commences is a slaughter but thanks to one of the group a young lady named AliceMartina Ittenbach Doug escapes. When he tries to explain to a detectiveJrgen Prochnowwhat happened to him he isn't believed and must face the idea of prison. He's the only one who came out alive with four missing inmates and dead security guards..Doug seems to be in a bit of trouble. Well prison might be better than what awaits him. Traveling in a bus with other inmates they drive through a female traveler out of her car to see about a deer she hit causing an eerily similar wreck to the one that occurred at the start of the film. A feeling of deja vu for Doug and as before another group of inmates will force the doc to accompany them into the woods with a goal of heading north..just guess what happens.Forget the storyline director Olaf Ittenbach's horror tale is mostly a German splatterfest..pure unadulterated gore movie loaded with outrageous violence. I mean the religious freaks in this house turn back flips using the wall as a springboard for petesake! I didn't know if they were supposed to be a relic from another time or luchadores needing a wrestling ring. You get an arm amputation eyeballs pried away from a victim's face as it's being ripped apart heads exploding..including one nifty scene where a demonically possessed savage's face forms back together from it's shredded remainsfrom shotgun explosions a face being stabbed with a spate lots of blood splatter from bullet riddled bodies..it appears that A LOT of squibs were used in this movie guts being pulled from bellies etc. The Doc even gets to remove shrapenal from an inmate's nutsack for crying out loud. There's a nice attempt straightly executed at how fate or a divine force can guide certain people to a specific fate. The undesirables from prison who often find themselves supposedly heading north only to meet an ominous fog within the woods which leads them to this cabin housing God's chosen to feed on their flesh. I guess that was what this crazy movie was attempting to accomplish. I just laughed this aspect off and rather enjoyed the battles between inmates and demonbaddies. Simon Newby really lays it on thick as the first heavy Arthur spending his time on screen barking orders and threatening dire consequences towards anyone crossing him. Doug gets treated like dirt the entire running time of the film. First he's the constant source of bullying given little chance to survive only remaining so because of the assistance Arthur's brother SpenceLuca Maricneeds with a torn arm with a bullet wedged causing an artery to bleed badly. Then later Doug must deal with a quiet psychopath Paul AndersonDan van Husen who likes to wax poetic often quoting from books and writings from popular writers. I found van Husen amusing as Anderson the kind of bloke who loves to hear himself talk and has a superiority complex..he informs Doug that he'll remain alive as long as he pleases Anderson's intellect. You really can't give much thought to things that often matter in movies..a decent storyline and acting. These departments in House of Blood are missing. I will say this..Olaf Ittenbach has some style but his attempts at messing with the chronology in the storyline..going back and forth in time often in the case of Doug such as his interrogation scenes tied in with the second act and how events unfold in Doug's life and how the whole escape of the inmates came to be I felt were unnecessary. The Old English will probably have many viewers trying to hold back giggles. Thee and thus it becomes quite tiresome. And the opening actors who play the inmates Doug must deal with overact often blurting profane lines with each other often shouting and always quite annoying...they're like rejects from an episode of HBO's OZ. They're a source of amusment as well as they really try hard to elicit evil by heightening their voices towards each other. Perhaps with halfdecent material Olaf might have potential.".

	schema:headline " Underrated flick from the master of brutal gore.";
	schema:reviewBody "Initially going into Chain Reaction I was only aware of all the bad things people had to say about it. Pretty much the same stuff you here with any Olaf flick Great gore but crappy story. And in this case it was even worse. So heading into it I had some pretty low expectations. Not sure if that's the frame of mind you should be in when going into it but I came out completely satisfied and actually impressed with this Ittenbach flick.I don't know what some other people were complaining about especially the ones that I know have seen loads of horror. The story was not tough to follow the acting felt inspired meaning they were having fun though it was overthetop and most were probably German pals of Olaf the writing was cheesy but delivered exactly what was needed and of course the gore was awesome. Especially if you saw the Uncut version. The region 1 USA version is cut and you do not get that true brutal violence you get in normal Olaf gore outings.A group of prisoners on a bus crash in the middle of bumfck nowhere and seek freedom by trudging through the woods so they can reach Canada. With a doctor as a hostage who becomes the main focus they end up running into a large rundown looking cabin with a family of whackos living there. Like other Ittenbach movies the villains here are always very evil so expect blood and expect a lot. And when a supernatural theme erupts into play more gory entertainment follows. Supernatural fate is the main theme here and I enjoyed it.More than anything that stood out for me was the way this film looked. If you're like me and have seen other Olaf films you've come to realize his films have drastically improved over the years. A couple of his films seem to have been shot in the same house. But with this one it was really clear nice creative shots of lush forests and just more style you're used to. His latest flick Dard Divorce is also a nice looking film.Once again he casts his wife in a lead role and once again I have to say she stinks. I guess she has the acting bug but she doesn't have much talent at all. But her wooden portrayal and the lines she's given in this one combine to a result that I liked. It came off as cheesy good instead of cheesy bad. And that is basically the bottom line with this film. All the actors aren't great but with how they go about their lines and the type of writing that's given to them it's not rare where you'll laugh it up. Especially the leader of the first group of inmates. He laid down some great lines. I can't remember someone throwing down Shut the fck up! with so much gusto. And he does it twice and both with great effect. The second group of inmates are still cheesy and OTT but not as memorable as the first group.Chain Reaction aka House of Blood is a widely disliked film. But I think it's mostly disliked by people who aren't the biggest horror buffs. Which usually means they can't decipher between bad acting and cheesy acting. When it comes down to Ittenbach horror there's usually an underlying aspect that is there to make you laugh. And this flick delivers some pretty nice dark humor. With a cool atmosphere great production values awesome ultra gore and a fun cast this is one flick that truly deserves more love. People who say it's the worst you've ever seen can go fck themselves. That's just bunch of bullsh!t. If I may say on behalf of Olaf Shut the fck up!.".

We see a character give a promise It gets us to wonder given the personality of this character if his offbeat honor will disallow him from breaking it or if his more.. evil.. side gets the best of him. Whichever way the answer is I can guarantee that it showcases not only the brutality of the real world but the ultimate emptiness and meaninglessness of human action. At the same time the movie shows how human personalities and human ideals indeed have more sides to them than what is made apparent by modern easytoswallow  and very shallow  storytelling.We see stereotypes that go all the way into caricatures but at the same time there are surprises and depth molded into their stories. The stereotype is there merely to create the contrast. There are touches of true human life that we can all relate to. This movie is not selfexplanatory. It does not make comprehension easy on you. But at the same time it and its characters feel natural and true. Not artificial and plastic. For that  and its experimentation and braveness  I give it 910.Still not recommended if you diss goresplatterhorror andor love Hollywoodlack a sense of humor.".

Chain Reaction aka House of Blood is a professional good looking 35 mm film with car crashing great makeup and gore FX but it lacks in entertainment value. I mean its very boring and confusing. The plot is very hard to follow and the action scenes comes only in bits when they come are cool with gore and blood but its a very talkie movie and the dialogs sucks. Premutos was a great low budget movie. Then Ittembach entered more mainstream. The fromdusktilldawnesque Legion of the Dead was pretty cool and entertaining but stuff like this or Riverplay make me think if i will watch a new Ittembach movie. 410 for the good productions values only.".

Sure Ittenbach is directing but that doesn't mean it was a piece of youknowwhat like everyone seems to think about Uwe Boll's films. Both directors make the same style of movies and if their movies are taken on their own for what they are which is action movies they should not be subject to so much negativity It starts off a bit out of sequence but after the first 1015 minutes you get the idea of what's going on. I won't spoil it but this movie is FULL of blood guns action scenes more blood a possessed old English speaking devillike cult in a church in the middle of the woods and more blood. Oh and there's more blood much more than Evil Dead 1  2 Combined or Haunted Forest. This is the type of movie where you're filled with giddy joy that the criminals are such badasses so they MIGHT have a chance to kill off all the possessed cult members kind of like that awesome Russian film Trackman. You're also filled with that feeling while watching something like the Matrix especially if you're a guy. That adrenaline filled killeverythingneveraskquestions feeling if you know what I mean. Go see this film I think they had it at Blockbuster a few years ago they definitely have it on Netflix's discbased plan maybe on streaming. The reason I mentioned Blockbuster is because I bought it for 5 at a used bookstore and it was in a Blockbuster case. In short just go see this film if you are a guy and love lots of guns blood action with a great story and mix of horror. Review updated December 28th 2013".

The film mostly circles a barber Steve Zahn whose wife Lara Flynn Boyle has just left him when a nervouslooking gangster Jeff Goldblum enters the shop asking for a haircut.Saying more than this would be spoiling the film a bit as the plot is not presented chronologically and it has to do with everyone trying to get hold of three very valuable Mingdynasty coins.Many archetypes are displayed e.g. the gangster the hysterical ex wife and the stiff upperlipped englishman Tom Wilkinson although some quite interesting characters are in place e.g. a 17yearold hitman Elijah Wood a Police Inspector who has graced herself in Playboy Salma Hayek and a very nasty Timber Scout Leader David Cross.The film loses tempo from time to time but recaptures it with the help of the characters and the backandforth switching in time and place which makes up for the general lack of story. The film does appeal with its simplicity and Zahn does a great job with playing the loser as do others of the cast. The soundtrack is varied and tense not giving away commercial spots for known artists but alternative rock and some actionesque dance tracks.Making up for the dark humor of the film there is a lot of slapstick and also wordplay probably a stab at Quentin Tarantino's dialogue but here it's more earthbound and close to heart. You won't hear any Royale with cheesedrops here.All in all this is a decent actionromancefilm although there is not much romance. There is more action in this film than in your general Hollywood ones though giving way to a lot of different screening locations a very varied spectrum of characters dialogue that feels real an OK story and a good soundtrack.

It went so fast for the last two thirds of the movie that you really had to pay attention to get everything. The twists are great and incredibly funny. The plot is pretty good not brilliant but allows for some very funny twists and some unbelievably funny but fairly unlikely very complicated situations that will make you laugh for several minutes without stopping for a breath provided that you like black humor. The actors all do pretty good jobs even Elijah Wood who I normally hate with a passion pulled off an entertaining performance. There weren't really any of the actors I was heavily disappointed by. All of the characters were funny in their own twisted sort of way most of them are either caricatures or stereotypes but they work really well together. The humor was great most of the time though some of the jokes fell flat but most of it was a treat for fans of black comedylike me. The sparse number of action scenes there was were really great. The movie has a very good fast pace throughout most of the movie there was hardly any moment where I was bored. The movie has some scenes that take place on a nonlinear timeline especially in the beginning but the moment these are over the film finds a better pace. This is not to say that these scenes were bad in fact I find them to be a great start to the film. Overall the movie was quite good but some of the humor seemed to be more there to shock than to amuse some of it did seem over the top. It could have been better had the humor been more balanced and had more of the characters been believable and likable. In the end the movie has some great laughs but that's about it. It's easily forgettable. I recommend this to pretty much any fan of black comedy. It's not the best but it's a pretty good one. If you're not easily offended and you like black humor it's worth checking out. 710".

What makes this unusual and imaginative is that what happens in a subplot we are not currently following has an impact how the story goes at the next intersection. At the same time we get the full coverage in time with a frequent use of flashbacks and jumps in the timeline. Still it was never any problem to follow.The movie has a really big cast and a lot of the names on the list are known. Goldblum delivers a solid performance as usual Zahn is a great choice for Kresk. The best impression however I think I got from Elijah Wood who portrays a teen hitman with finesse. I think it is the best performance from him I have ever seen. The director team Traktor has done a great work in their movie debut and I hope I will see more work from them like this one.710".

Still it was never any problem to follow.The movie has a really big cast and a lot of the names on the list are known. Goldblum delivers a solid performance as usual Zahn is a great choice for Kresk. The best impression however I think I got from Elijah Wood who portrays a teen hitman with finesse. I think it is the best performance from him I have ever seen. The director team Traktor has done a great work in their movie debut and I hope I will see more work from them like this one.710";

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie 4 years ago on Italian payTV it was very less advertised and I've seen it only because that night there wasn't nothing apart it and it was with famous actors like Steve Zahn and Salma Hayek. And when it started I read the others actors of the cast! One name better than the previous Jeff Goldblum Elijah Wood Orlando Jones Tom Wilkinson David Cross. This is a good point to start watching a unknown movie discover a beautiful cast. Then the movie obviously. I love black comedy and generally all the movie with a lot of different characters which want the same things like Snatch Big Trouble And this one is absolutely the best. It's very funny which is a very hard thing to find nowadays few times banal and it has a tremendous pace in 1 hour and 35 minutes happens everything you can imagine. Moreover the plot begin almost at the end of the history and then it's a flashback followed by another flashback and so for all the actors but that is the best thing about this movie it's never really hard to figure out and although it is complex it's easy to rebuild the history which is globally believable. It's quite clean not like the majority of black comedies unfortunately it has a large number of dirty words in the Italian version I've counted more of 70 of them but they are proportionate at the characters. So isn't a deep movie to think about something it's the better way to relax yourself sometimes. Discover it because isn't famous at all!".

And surprisingly I enjoyed the movie and all its characters instead of just Elijah Wood's.The entire movie is actually based on a somewhat simple plot but there are so many people involved in it and with all the flashbacks you can actually see how they're related to one another which cracked me up.The movie is funny in its own simple ways. I wouldn't label it as 'slapstick' immediately because obviously there's a plot clinging on to it and the movie follows that plot.There were loads of funny moments. When Andy the Timberscout David Cross began insulting Miss Cocoa Orlando Jones and when Boilingsworth Tom Wilkinson tripped while walking from his car to meet Avnet Jeff Goldblum.For reasons not related to my liking for Elijah Wood hey dudes they simply ARE funny I most liked the parts when hitman Mikey Elijah Wood repeated to Kresk Steve Zahn I didn't mean to brag but do you know about Senator Dove... when in fact... uh you'll have to watch the movie to find out. the part when he cried was kind of out of the blue and the snotty man looked so strange then.The show is entertaining but the video is probably not attractive enough to be picked up by nonfans of the cast. 7 stars".

He said hello in a very special way with a short recording just for the gala audience where he was doing jokes singing drinking songs and wishing he had some Swedish Herring.Chain of Fools is Traktor's first movie. They have done tons of commercials but never a movie. Chain of Fools is their first stab at the silver screen  and man what a good way to become immortal.Steve Zahn is down on his luck well a loser. He is doing nothing just being a loser... but by accident he get into both this and that. The movie is smart and moves from one thing to another and back again. The way the story is described and played in the movie is similar to Pulp Fiction O'Brother Numbers and True Romance. It's a blend but you will feel right at home if you enjoyed those flicks. A dark whacky and sarcastic humor poors out of the film.Bottom line I highly recommend this movie if you are into the earlier mentioned  even though the concept doesn't feel as fresh any more.".

The bloke from Road Kill is the main guy  a suicidal hairdresser  and he plays the part so well. Elijah Wood plays a 'hardboy' hitman but really he's just a big softie. The hairdresser comes across these coins after 'killing' the man who stole them somewhat accidentally. His nephew Scottie swallows them and he wants to take Scottie to France to 'fence' the coins which will be pooed out in 24 hours or so. It reminded me of a cross between All I Want or Try 17 in the US and... er... a crime movie. Very well worth watching!".

Steve Zahn plays the lead and was terrific as the barber whose always in the wrong place at the wrong time. He wasn't my favorite of this unique cast of characters however that award goes to Elijah Wood who was hilarious as the emotionally scarred teenage hit man. Seeing this little guy who Scotty could have beaten up as the big bad hit man was just hilarious. Wood even attempts to grow a mustache for the role and fails miserably. On the surface this is a strange film and as you watch it it gets stranger but at the same time it gets better and better.

And it also moves fairly tightly and briskly with none of the pretentiousness of most Bgrade arthouse fare.The cast ensemble was an absolute dream in fact. Stalwarts like Jeff Goldblum Steve Zahn David Cross David Hyde Pierce  and that lady who now plays the wife in Scrubs. They were excellent.And Elijah Wood is totally awesome in this. I once said that he had totally lost his comic touch or interest after the NORTH fiasco. Well I now have to completely eat my words. He showed a lot of the brilliant personality that he displayed as an alltime great child actor  especially as Huck Finn. This is the role that I would class as his definitive transition role from child protg to credible adult actor. It contains most of his charm and personality that were the highlights of his early career with the professional maturity of his later work.And once again I am totally blown away by Tom Wilkinson. His was a great role for a jobbing British actor in Hollywood and he handles it wonderfully. This would be the perfect foil to his dramatic antagonist in Mel Gibson's THE PATRIOT see my review and a great foretaste of his comic flair as Doctor Chasubile in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST.This movie really worked a lot better than I thought it would. I was expecting some dour slowpaced cynical modern seriocomedy with garish visuals and poor pacing  like RUSHMORE or ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND or ADAPTATION i.e. way selfconsciously smug with far more drama than comedy. But instead I got a snappy witty intelligent little character comedy with enough imagination and pacing to really keep it rolling along. It lacks the real punch of a classic movie like THE STING Jim Carrey's THE MASK or even ZERO EFFECT but on its own terms it is very watchable and totally deserves a lot more success. I thoroughly recommend it to everyone. A movie that's definitely worth renting.".

Still seeing Elijah Wood as a 17 year old hitman who smashes chair on people's heads was at least something different and Salam Hayek in her underwear is always nice so despite the fact that I can't really claim this is a good movie per se I would still recommend it for anyone looking for a very undemanding time killer.".

Or am I missing something?I'm a huge fan of Elijah Wood's and very partial to anything he does but can't in good conscience give this movie more than a 4 out of 10 unless I'm really missing a point here???  it was great to see him do some action stuff  do the gun thing  and the funniest bit in the movie was probably Mikey saying through his sobs Don't worry I'll do the hit  but he as well as some of the others particularly Selma Hayek seemed hampered by having to deliver far too many words in some situations and not necessarily stuff that anyone would actually say either. Andy could have been a riot as well he probably comes closest to being funny next to Mikey and his craving to see Cats  but most of the rest of the characters were fairly clicheed and do we really need TWO almost identicallooking bitchy women in Kresk's life? Exwife and sister. The premise of everyone trying to be incredibly badass and not succeeding at all could have been really funny but it all fell down in the delivery. ".

Living handtomouth stuck in a cycle of drink abuse visits to prostitutes and deadend jobs a glimmer of hope appears when he is befriended by Shoji who offers up catalyst opportunities with the cute girl in the local bookstore. However the demons Kanta carries inside him are not so easily exorcised.Screenwriter Shinji Imaoka offers up a fascinating character study superbly executed by Mirai Moriyama in an outstanding performance. From beginning to end we are forced to shift our understanding of Kanta. You cannot help but pity a man  at 19 still in many ways a child  who has had to carry the burden of having a convicted sex offender for a father during his formative years. But then he does something disgusting like lick a girl's hand and you begin to suspect nature may win out over nurture. Aimless amoral conniving and at times misanthropic Kanta is nonetheless human and frail. You see few paths for redemption in a modern Japan where Kanta's coworker is summarily dispensed with when a workplace accident renders him disabled and for Kanta the only avenue of negotiation for rent disputes are threats and insincere apologies.Director Yamashita keeps it all plausible and authentic. At times Kanta's excesses evoke visceral disgust as his various methods of ejecting bodily fluids  and one attempt at solids  are framed in closeup. At other times there is a light jaunty tone to proceedings often dictated by the music which may just be deployed ironically given the hopeless drudgery of Kanta's daytoday existence. The comedy is threaded in nicely and never done for its own sake. Kanta's reunion with his exgirlfriend and her new beau is funny and terrifying in equal measure. Kanta seems to have the worst life imaginable till we meet his ex and glimpse the hellhole existence she endures.Kengo Kra plays Shoji as a guy trying to do his best for a friend while never losing his wariness. His patience is admirable and the loss of it forgivable. Atsuko Maeda as love object Yasuko injects a difficult role with an element of mystery. Quite why such a wellbalanced intelligent young woman would indulge a shifty creepy NEET is an active question that Imaoka's writing and Maeda's acting skill make come alive. In the hands of lesser talent this would appear a flaw in the narrative. In modernday Japan isolation loneliness and withdrawal from society is practically an epidemic and all three characters in some way embody elements of this.In the end Kanta may have found an escape. Or we may be seeing the dream that is the regret of a dying man in a rubbish heap. The film fittingly concludes with questions rather than answers. The social commentary is apt and incisive but it is the character of Kanta as unfathomable and memorable as Travis Bickle that stays with you long after the final credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the very start of THE DRUDGERY TRAIN the narrator tells us a couple of pertinent facts about Kanta Kitamachi at that prove to be significant to the direction his life is going. Kanta is 19 yearold his father committed a sex crime that broke up his family while he was in 5th Grade and since dropping out of school after graduating junior high Kanta has only had work as a day labourer. The freezeframe image of him leaving a seedy peepshow joint during this opening narration speaks for itself.A day labourer with no contract and no rights Kanta has little opportunity for advancement out of this life of backbreaking manual labour. What little money he earns he spends on alcohol on peep shows and massage parlours and owing four months' rent he's about to be thrown out of his cheap rented accommodation. Kanta however is not entirely beyond hope. He loves reading and has a crush on the girl who works at the bookstore but he confuses sex with his need for the warmth of human contact and friendship. His means of expression is so awkward crude and inappropriate that he ends up alienating everyone close to him and getting his head kicked in by those less sympathetic towards him.Based on a novel by Kenta Nishimura one suspects that there's some autobiographical content in Kenta's story so it might be a stretch to extrapolate an individual anecdotal story to see it as a reflection of a generational problem. Undoubtedly however it would seem like Kanta's education his development as a young man his relationships and his prospects for the future in postbubble economy Japan have indeed been influenced or affected to some extent by the actions of his elders as is suggested by the unspecified sex crime of his father. Nothing good will happen to you for the rest of your life a work colleague tells him and indeed it's hard to see how Kanta can turn his life around. Is it a kicking Kenta needs or a kick up the pants?".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I would like to say that I have given this film a 7 out of 10 due to its try hard effort.The film itself is quite stunning the effects that they use to integrate Santiago Munez and Gavin Harris into the Real Madrid team would almost have you thinking that they were receiving passes from Raul and Zidane. Some of the sequences where the players have the ball at their feet though are totally unrealistic. I mean for example at certain times Santiago pulls off runs and tricks that just wouldn't happen in football. After around 3 step overs and a Cruyff turn followed by dribbling around two more defenders would just result in you being hacked to the ground. They seem to have made Santiago invincible with the ball at his feet if they were to ask Cristiano Ronaldo what happens when he runs at defenders he would tell you that 99 of the time it would result in him being kicked! The film has an interesting storyline though which is cleverly left with a lot of questions to be answered in the third film. A surprising twist at the end before the Champions League final certainly caught me out. However the story lines seemed to get tangled up and at times seemed a bit silly. Santiago seems to have too much going on too quickly and you only have to look at the likes of Paul Gascoigne Sol Campbell and even David Beckham to realise that with all of the things going on off the field does not mean you are going to be scoring goals from 30 yards every match. Gavin Harris for me in this film has a far better storyline than that of Santiago. The football side of things in terms of the film got too predictable very quickly. I mean I don't want to spoil the film but at times I was left sat watching thinking OK that was so blatantly obvious that it was going to happen it was unrealistic. The Champions League final will be a prime example of this.I think that the acting in this film though was all around better in the sequel than the original. I think that Kuno Becker does a good job again as Santiago making sure that the audience feel what is going on in his head is portrayed on the screen. Alessandro Nivola is superb as the ever arrogantsoft Gavin Harris I think that Nivola does well to express what Gavino is going through in his time at Madrid he almost makes the film feel as if it is about the pair of them not just about Santiago. Anna Friel is stunning as ever as Roz and I think she did well in the role of Girlfriend to the superstar.The cameo's in the film were a bit limited and to tell the truth I am quite glad. The film so easily could have ended up as Real Madrid the movie. I think that only Guti and Illker Casillas have speaking parts and even then it is whilst winding up Gavino. The Casillas part actually had me laughing.All in all I thoroughly liked the film as a football fanatic it seems only logical to love the film. However with some silly story lines and un realistic action they nearly spoiled the film.".

Massive paychecks and beautiful women begin to get to Santi's head and we see a darker perhaps weaker side of our hero in this chapter. All the main characters from the first Goal have roles in the sequel as well as cameos by superstars like Zidane Ronaldo Raul and Beckham.

But to my mistake the storyline steers of course of the footballing world bringing in a twist of family life which was almost suddenly killed of by the stress of which football brings. Every little boy's dream is to play football at a professional level but this film gives us an inside view as to what goes on off the pitch and in my opinion doesn't have enough twists in the story. As i'm a football fanatic i loved the matches they played and the 32 comeback in the Champions League final was amazing but so predictable. Overall i feel the film was a failure but is still worth watching so that there is some hope that GOAL III can impress and revive the disappointment of GOAL II. Daniel Bryson".

II improves upon the great football action portrayed in the movie all elements of storytelling are lost.In this installation Santiago Munez gets his big break when Real Madrid are interested in signing him from Newcastle. His imminent decision to move to Spain causes problems which reflects the real life of a professional footballer for example Santiago plays in the same position as his friend Gavin Harris who has already settled in Real Madridand therefore his competitor is his own best buddy the allures of coming with living in a posh celebrity lifestyle there's probably about a hundred chicks included in the film 90 of them quite hot plus a few other points the movie brings out such as his family ties. In fact the movie tries to focus more on the emotional and personal impacts so much they never really give any importance to winning football matches at all.Moreover despite the attempts at focusing on the changes to his personal life and the emotional impact he must endure the movie never follows throughly with these subplots and we're left out in the cold. You never get to see the tension build between Gavin and Santiago and even feels like a nonissue sometimes yet it's conveniently resolved at the end. In fact everything gets so conveniently solved or left to forget it's often irritating. The only real issue the movie tries to explore is between Santi and his fiance and that is left to be resolved in Goal 3 when he goes to the World Cup with Mexico.But despite these minuses Goal II can probably be ranked amongst the best football films not just because of a dire lack of them but also because of its great football action and intelligent improvisation of real life situations. The swaptransfer of Santi is humorous and the onfield action sequences are great. Yet the movie's strength can also lead to its downfall. While it contains a vast number of football stars it gets irritating how none of them ever really talk and how Beckham is somehow suddenly forced into the film as a major character without him ever needing to act or open his mouth. In fact I got irritated at being forced to look at Beckham doing nothing so much I grew to dislike him more from this film alone than from anything else personally I admire his footballing skills and especially his professionalism.Overall it's one big highend productplacing film with subpar acting bad character development horrible screenplay but great football action and beautiful camera work at times.It could be a pretty good watch during the offseason but if you're not a football fan I highly recommend you to avoid it.".

	schema:headline " Focuses more on Santiago's life. Soccer can wait...";
	schema:reviewBody "I have mixed feelings for this movie. I truly liked the original Goal mainly because I'm a huge soccer fan. Not that the sequel is a bad movie but in my opinion it lacked of reality moments. Let me explain myself...Sure the movie is very well done because it has good acting an interesting romantic plot and tries to display the ups and downs of being a famous soccer player. The transfer negotiations and trainings were also a nice addition to help understand how it works. Also it was great to see Real Madrid's starts in small cameos. So Goal 2 succeeds because it's a blockbuster movie and probably a favorite among young audiences. The events of the movie are truly over the top but it works. I really hope that Santiago's half brother plot will be important in the next Goal! On the other side I expected more interaction with Real player's. Also I expected more seriousness on the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE subplot. I mean it's the most important soccer event in the world after the FIFA WORLD CUP. The director and producer made it look like just another tournament. But on the bright side I liked that some real matches were displayed with the occasional CGI help. Also it isn't that easy to score in these kind of games! But oh well I understand it's only a movie and a good one.Watching Zidane the last soccer genius and Ronald wearing the Real Madrid outfit was great and powerful. The direction and visuals are spectacular. The soccer matches looked great with the aid of CGI and brilliant cinematography. I expected more soccer related scenes though. Kuno Becker delivers a good performance again. I'm glad for him. Alessandro Nivola steals the show as Gavin Harris overrated soccer superstar. Anna Friel looked mature but sexy as hell and delivered a good performance love her accent. Stephen Dillane also delivers a fine performance as Santiago's former assistant. Rutger Hauer also delivers a good performance he's always the man.So give it a chance for Goal 2 if you are a huge soccer fan. Otherwise you might enjoy it for it's dramatic plot and romantic situations.Hopefully in Goal 3 we will get to see Santiago leading Mxico to win the FIFA WORLD CUP. That could only happen in a movie ".

In a dressing room scene inside the Bernabeu for instance Becker's time on the ball in a jolly juggling scene was thankfully limited to one touch.I guess it's too much to ask for an actor who had real football skills and I guess that realization kept the cameras more focused on the 'real' football players in game situations. This added more to a sense of realism as compared to the first movie when Becker was scene doing all sorts of fantastic things  corny to a trained eye.This movie's real merit comes from the way it handled the human element Santi's head getting a tad too big from all the media attention and from being in the company of Real Madrid's galacticos the lover's tiff with Roz doubtless echoed in many a professional football player's life and the surprise of finding he has a halfbrother living in Spain along with the painful reunion with a longlost Mother.Dramatic without going overboard and without losing touch with the primary plot that this is a professional footballer's story.".

Basically it just follows the pleasures the trials and the tribulations involved in the life of a professional footballer who has just hit the big time after signing for the greatest football team in the world.The story was very predictable but the football action scenes were excellent with appearances from the likes of greats such as Beckham Zidane Raul and Ronaldinho. Reuteur Haur took a good part as the team coach.As usual the incredibly sexy and gorgeous Anna Friel provided the eye candy  especially in the bedroom scene wearing the frilly knickers calm down lads with parts of the film focusing on the emotional conflicts involved with her job as a nurse at Newcastle hospital.Nothing too major happens but the film is enjoyable if looked upon as an accurate insight into the life of a professional footballer. All in all I would say this film was slightly better than the first simply for the glut of football stars on view and the amount of onfield action.This film should appeal to the football fan and nonfan alike  a good movie to snuggle down on the sofa with your beloved whilst cracking a few beers and the popcorn.Goal 3 perhaps?

Sure Zizou might pull it off but to do it consistently? I think that if a movie is to be made about football realism is quite important. I do like how they integrate the many stars that real has. It seems that at times santi and gavin are really playing alongside henry David zizou robbie etc. But I do have to say... what the hell is Nick Cannon doing here? What? It's fine that they put him in a breakdance or basketball or detective movie. But football? I could not stop laughing when i saw him in the finals. Maybe he's got an important part in the third movie... I hope he does... because he seems extremely out of place in goal II. I don't' know if there is a rule about the finals of the champions being played at home but even if it's allowed what a coincidence that the finals for that year was played in the Bernabeu. then there is the whole is  she  my  mother  and  why  did  you  not  tell  me  i am  so  sad  and  confused issue paired with the i  kissed  another  girl  and  my  gf  is  mad  now  i  need  to  make  it  up  to  her issue... and he still manages to score game winning an game defining goals.Now the plot was too foreseeable. as soon as that jordana girl shows up it was pretty much spelled out that he was gonna have to apologize to his gf. and then the whole mother thing was also very predictable. it was expected that santi was going to get into trouble because of his mom. and last but not least we all expected santi to be the best player in madrid. He makes all these improbable goals and who could actually be shocked with madrid coming back from 20 and beating the gunners all in a span of 6 minutes?Oh... and why is santi and his mom speaking in Englsih?

	schema:reviewBody "Living the Dream? More like Living the Nightmare!The first Goal movie brought plenty of cheers to football fans who celebrated the coming of a decent movie about the beloved Beautiful Game. And it didn't disappoint with a likable hero in Santiago Munez Kuno Becker in a rags to riches story nifty footwork and camerawork locales familiar to English Premier League fans the seamless combination of real world match footage with fictional shots taken on match days and access to seldom seen areas in and around the stadiums.The story of Santiago continues in this UKSpainGermany production with the stage moving from England to Spain and to Germany of course for the World Cup. With the first movie centered on the domestic football league following Newcastle's season the sequel brings us to the Spanish La Liga and firmly the spotlight of matches put on Europe's Champions League games. It's a nobrainer that German involvement will be of course the World Cup which just ended last year and given that this sequel is delayed you'd still get to see Real Madrid's exgalacticos like Roberto Carlos Zinedine Zidane David Beckham and Ronaldo besides mainstayers like Iker Caillas and Raul Gonzalez amongst others see if you can spot McManaman!In a player swap deal with Michael Owen we see Munez head to Real Madrid in probably almost every footballer's dream to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world. And of course with hard nosed coach Rudi Van Der Merwe Rutger Hauer at the helm our new recruit has to prove his worth before being handed some first team duties. But good friend and exNewcastle player Gavin Harris Alessandro Nivola is on hand at the club reference the first movie shall we to provide Munez some action especially when Harris is running afoul with Rudi for his lost form.The football sequences here are rather straightforward and more of the same we saw in the first movie save for some spectacular probably CGed movies like the volleys overhead kicks and diving headers. The number of matches being featured too is much less as the story wanted to focus on our player's life outside of football.You know by putting all the press reports that you read day in day out of boozing incessant partying easy models who don't bat an eyelid looking to get between the sheets with the players flashy sports cars designer togs mansions with numerous rooms and the likes. Munez lives the dream in material wealth although this starts to get into his head and takes a toil with his relationships especially with girlfriend Roz Anna Friel. There are numerous subplots put into Goal 2 but most times they are superficially touched upon for the sole purpose of covering the ground and then forgotten conveniently like the paparazzi photo journalist and various incidents on and off the pitch.What I thought slowed the movie down further was the injection of Munez's typical stepbrother brat from hell and mother who were conspicuously absent in the first movie then reintroduced here just to amplify the moments that try to touch the heart like in the first movie with the dad and grandmother but one without which I feel would not make much of a difference. Couple this family reunionreconciliation of sorts together with his struggles with injury and attempts to shake off the supersub tag Munez has his hands full.While the other real life players do not have much speaking lines or none at all you can't help but to feel both Kuno Becker and Alessandro Nivola being fish out of water in the Real Madrid dressing room where either the charismatic players will undoubtedly get the audience attention with their antics or camaraderie which shines through or clever editing and cinematography tells you that shots have been made with the clear exclusion of those players in some movie magic moments. The movie too seemed to like David Beckham given plenty of scenes befitting probably of his real last hurrah at the club before leaving them this summer.And for Arsenal fans like myself while it's a blast to see the team featured in this movie and the likes of Jose Antonio Reyes who incidentally played for Real Madrid few weeks ago and created then scored 2 crucial goals in their final league game to hand them the La Liga title Robert Pires and a fictional TJ featured alongside our Captain Thierry Henry don't leave! the result is blasphemous as the last time we went headon with Real it was in the first knockout round 2 seasons ago where we triumphed 10.So the scoreline at the end well it's actually living in the dream. Given that the ending is one of the technical worst that can happen leading straight to the third installment let's hope that the concluding chapter really does see the light of day. Not as polished as the first one with the novelty factor wearing off but let's judge the series as a whole once the sequel screens. Excellent soundtrack once again coupled with the usual product placement shots for Adidas.".

It really is an inspiring story about believing in yourself and triumphing over adversity. The characters are developed nicely and the love story is even handled in a very good way and does not feel tacked on like it does in so many other sports movies. Santiago comes from Los Angeles to Newcastle and then plays at the world famous Real Madrid. My favorite player David Beckham is in this movie too. We were not lucky enough for Zidane a 21st Century portrait to come out in the US so this is your only chance to see Zidane in film.

Badly directed filmed acted written and made it is a disappointing follow on to what had been a remarkably enjoyable original.Santiago Munez Kuno Becker has been transfered to Real Madrid but when you are a rich spoilt footballer with more money than sense life doesn't always run smoothly.From the opening minutes the flaws with Goal II become apparent. Whilst the original specialised in it's simplicity and rags to riches story this is more about the fall from grace and corruption of the individual.This story this path to destruction is told in such a weak badly written style that not only do we loose any sort of connection with our characters but eventually we actually end up loathing the entire concept of the film. In our first outing we cared about Munez we cared about those around him we cared about Newcastle. Yet here we are one film on and nobody really cares about that over hyped over arrogant bunch in Madrid. The humble nature of football is removed at times intentionally at times accidentally from the entire story and the audience is made to suffer.Away from the plot we also have to face up to the awful truth that the whole cinematography has been ruined too. To give the first film it's due it really managed to capture the footballing atmosphere perfectly and when it slotted fictional characters into the live action there was a degree of realism about it. So why do we now have some shoddy artificial attempt where everything looks more like a version of Pro Evolution Soccer than real life? The brightness of the light as Rutger Hauer's Dutch coach of Madrid would look at Munez on the bench the whole feel it looks ridiculously artificial.Also the film feels like it has been sped up too. When on the pitch our first film was filmed at a relatively human speed yet here we have fast action shots which look absolutely insane. It just looks nasty pure and simple.There is a lot else wrong with this film. The acting the soundtrack the first featured a rather stunning selection of Oasis tracks for some reason the concept. Yet I'm going to avoid going into any more detail. This is a film which promised so much and has delivered so little. It'll be interesting to see the third film at the World Cup but my expectations are not that high. Stick to the first film.".

	schema:headline " Really Poor Sequel To What Could Have Been A Good Franchise";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie sees Santiago getting transferred to Real Madrid at the start of the new season. The celebrity life goes to his head and he is 'caught' with a beautiful lady hints of the BeckhamLoos scandal?. He also has to come to terms with injury and with his mother and her new life.This movie had some good material with which to give Santiago's story some depth. But it is appallingly executed.Firstly Santiago gets transferred to Real Madrid and given a key role in their team coming on as a sub then earning a starting place immediately. This is after just three first team appearances for Newcastle United. Villa took until he was 28 to get signed to Real. Beckham was of a similar age and struggled to make the first team on a regular basis. But Santi is fasttracked. In a team that counts the likes of Zidane and Raul among their regular players? !? After three games for a soso Premiership team?!? It's ridiculous and totally unbelievable.Also Gavin Harris is already at Real. Ignoring the simple and pertinent question why would Real buy a player who was rubbish even when he was at Newcastle? it seems implausible that they would follow up their purchase of Harris who spends most of his Real time underperforming by buying a similarly untested player in Santiago from the same team.We can overlook the coincidence that Snti's mother now lives in Spain the country he's just moved to. But the kid brother of Santi acts like a total brat and the only proof he has that Santi is his brother is one photograph. There's no reason for Santi to pursue a relationship with him and no struggle involved in Santi deciding to do so. When they eventually are united there is no character development involved. They're just suddenly a happy family together. Once again Santi falls prey to the celebrity culture surrounding football. While you could forgive the character for this in the first movie as he seemed innocent and overwhelmed by the second movie he starts to just look like an idiot. He makes the same mistakes all over again and doesn't seem to have learned from his past experiences at all. The character arc suggests that if there is a third instalment he'll be a total Ronaldostyle prima dona. The plot is very weak overall. This might be forgivable were it an excuse to put football on the big screen  if the football was the focus. But it clearly isn't. The goals are clearly CGI'd and fake looking and the games aren't shown to have any flow. Teams get lucky with final minute goals but not every game with the same player being responsible every time. Yet this movie thinks that is acceptable.The new manager was very stiff and barely made any impact upon the flow of the movie. This was an opportunity missed in my opinion. An interesting movie could have been forged from the torn loyalties players might have when moving clubs and working under a new manager  return games at their old club being forced to play in a different position or style of play etc. But this was completely overlooked.In summary this movie seemed to want to retread the ground covered in the first movie while incorporating too many subplots. Overall it felt like nothing was dealt with thoroughly and the plot felt forced and confused  it felt like those involved couldn't decide what they wanted the movie to be about. Too formulaic it came off as a let's do a sequel because football's popular kind of movie instead of being a strong development of the areas hinted at in the first movie.I'd recommend watching a full Accrington Stanley game over watching this movie. That's how bad it was.".

	schema:headline " The Best of Hepburn and Tracy";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the nine films which paired Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn Adam's Rib is often considered the best. Writers Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin were friends of the famous couple and wrote the film specifically for them. Kate insisted the film be directed by her favorite screen director George Cukor who services the brilliant writing and onscreen chemistry with his trademark elegant staging and unobtrusive style. The result is a comedy that remains the best battle of the sexes films ever made.When Doris Attinger Judy Holliday discovers her husband in the arms of another woman she opens fire and is charged with attempted murder. Enter Adam and Amanda Bonner Tracy and Hepburn married lawyers whose lives are turned upside down when Adam is assigned to the prosecution. An ardent proponent of women's rights Amanda decides to represent Doris claiming that if the sex of the parties on trial were switched the jury would feel differently. This conflict of interests creates friction in the courtroom as well as the Bonners' home.Spencer Tracy with his confident and relaxed screen presence paints Adam as a man quite comfortable with his wife's force and ambition. But Adam grows upset with Amanda as the media spotlight finds the case and magnifies it into a cause for women's rights. He accuses Amanda with disregard for the law reminding her that no one man or woman has the right to take the law into their own hands and that Amanda is using the case for her own selfish purposes. The script is careful not to polarize Adam's interests. He reveres the law and has no special affection for Doris' husband. In opposing him Katherine Hepburn manages to retain her signature strength while also portraying Amanda as a loving wife who fears the damage her marriage may sustain because of the case and its publicity. Amanda alleges that Doris is doomed to an unfair trial because the general public irrationally feels male infidelity is much more permissible than female infidelity. The courtroom becomes a spectacle when Amanda puts a circus strongwoman on the stand and asks her to lift Adam. Tracy rises to the occasion with an angry outburst that is empowered by his otherwise calm and restrained performance. Despite their marital bliss before the case Adam admits that he likes two sexes and doesn't care for having a wife who is a new woman and a competitor. This rare outpouring causes Amanda to realize just how personally Adam is taking the trial and that it could result in their divorce. Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin deserve special recognition for creating a balanced onscreen battle in what has always been a controversial debate  gender equality. Amanda's plight is shaded by her experiences as a woman and Adam is presented as a man who admits to always trying to hear her side of the story. That their marriage was a happy one before the trial is an indication of the equality they had achieved together. Amanda is in fact equal to Adam in both the career and financial worlds. To create a sparring partner for Amanda Gordon and Kanin could easily have presented a misogynist or even a lovable but cantankerous traditionalist. They were wiser to portray Adam as a man who simply refused to see the case as one for gender equality but for vigilantism. As directed by George Cukor Adam's Rib features a great many long takes that play uninterrupted. Even during moments of action like the scene in which both Bonners are getting dressed for dinner Cukor utilizes minimal staging and camera movement. The camera points directly across the Bonners' bedroom with her dressing room off frame left and his off frame right. They shout at each other poking their heads into the frame occasionally walking through the frame and back again. And later when Adam discovers Kip and Amanda together the ensuing fight is framed similarly with the camera looking down the apartment hallway characters popping into frame from the left or right and back again. This isn't to say Cukor doesn't move his camera much. There are several decisive camera movements but Cukor's sparing use of them and his tendency to rely more on wellcomposed master angles gives the film an elegant traditional Hollywood style. The film also benefits from a lively score by Mikos Rozsa and a catchy Cole Porter tune Farewell Amanda. Jean Hagen unforgettable for her comic turn in Singin' in the Rain again demonstrates her talent for comedy as the other woman. Cukor must have realized that with Tracy and Hepburn on screen all the camera really had to do was follow them frame them and let the sparks fly.The screenplay and the actors' offscreen romance are gifts to the film. We feel for both of them and believe in what both are trying to achieve. It is rare that a film about difference and equality plays so fairly to all parties involved and also rare that such a sensitive subject can retain its comic appeal. But for all the film says about equality Adam's Rib ultimately serves to remind us that when it comes to Hepburn and Tracy there is no equal.  Scott Schirmer".

The case gets quite a bit of notoriety and of course it puts a strain on the marriage. But the plot is sure the right vehicle for a lot of great lines and situations. This is Spence and Kate at their very best. Of the comedies they did this is my favorite just like State of the Union is my favorite among the more serious films.Probably Adam's Rib's best known scene is when defense witness Hope Emerson picks up Spencer Tracy in a visual attempt to show feminine prowess and power. Even after seeing it several times you still will laugh yourself silly.For Adam's Rib George Cukor denuded Broadway of stars to play in support of Tracy and Hepburn. Making film debuts were David Wayne Tom Ewell Judy Holliday and Jean Hagen. Wayne is particularly funny and if Adam's Rib was made today he'd certainly be more explicitly gay. He's the next door neighbor of Spence and Kate and some of the cracks Tracy aims in his direction would be considered downright homophobic. But let's face it Wayne is an obnoxious scamp and that bit of vengeance that Tracy wreaks upon him and Hepburn in the climax involving licorice is a great cinematic moment. Adam's Rib is Tracy and Hepburn at the very top of their game and I think folks who are not necessarily fans of their's would be amused.".

Adam's masculinity is seemingly challenged and his sense of justice offended by his wife's insistence on showing how smart she is while furthering her feminist agenda at the expense of the law. Will their public confrontation destroy their marriage or will it ultimately make the bond stronger? This still plays mainly because of the charisma of Hepburn and Tracy and the fine chemistry they create together. The script by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon is shallow and profound by turns yet ultimately witty and pleasing. Judy Holliday as the lower middleclass Doris Attinger on her way to her signature role in Born Yesterday 1950 and David Wayne as the songwriting neighbor who adores Amanda shine in supporting roles. George Cukor's direction is clear crisp and always focused. In the end we can see that Adam can be as feminine as Amanda can be masculine. The bit where Tracy cries real tears to win her back and then tells her We all have our tricks is classic. It's his clever answer to her outrageous courtroom theatrics. Memorable as it illuminates their contrasting personalities is the early scene where the unsophisticated Doris is interviewed by Yale law school grad Amanda. As a political movie was Adam's Rib ahead of its time as a vehicle for feminist expression or was it just another apology for male chauvinism or was it balanced and fair? I'll give you a hint the title is ironic. One of the things that made the TracyHepburn romance work so well for so long was the creative balance they maintained in the battle of the sexes. The script by Kanin and Gordon carefully continues that profoundly true equilibrium.".

Her feminism  when put to the test  amounts to little more than anthem singing and however sympathetic her client may be we can see at once that the case for the defence is almost entirely frivolous.  Yet George Cukor is standing in the gallery apparently cheering her on.  It's infuriating.  It's like watching an Edwardian comedy about suffragettes.Well no.  The film is a good deal smarter than we had given it credit for being ... oh very well smarter than I had given it credit for being. Gordon Kanin and Cukor understand our infuriation the supposedly shrill dispute in the first half is merely a starting point.  Maybe audiences these days AREN'T too sophisticated for this kind of film.  Maybe we're too stupid.  Oh very well maybe I'M too stupid.  In any event this is really a story about Adam and Amanda.  Their story becomes deeper as the trial becomes shallower.Even while it's infuriating us our infuriation will be used to good effect later of course Adam's Rib is never less than pleasant to watch.  One reason is that Hepburn and Tracy are just so brilliant.  The script serves them both well neither player is denied good lines and any impression that Hepburn is meant to be just some hothead or that Tracy is meant to be just some schmuck is transitory.  This is a wonderful script!  My only previous exposure to Hepburn and Tracy had been in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner where their partnership was the only thing holding the film together I wasn't at all prepared for the sheer energy they generate when they set to work on stronger material.  Moreover they seem perfectly natural as a married couple.The music is good too.  There's a catchy original song not a gratuitous addition ... although it wouldn't matter if it was by Cole Porter the rest of the score was written by Mikls Rzsa in one of his rare lighter moments.".

Mr. Tracy is delightful to watch in their scenes together. He has such a mischievous presence that endeared him to us in anything he played.The revelation in this film was Judy Holliday. As Doris the accused woman she shows talent beyond imagination. In a way it is sad to realize this amazing actress didn't live to make it even bigger in the movies. She was a natural and she is a joy to watch in the film. Lucky are we to be able to see her best work preserved for posterity.In minor roles David Wayne plays Kip Lurie a Broadway composer.

When I got it home I realized that while some other Cukor movies and All about Eve were there Adam's Rib was not.  Of course I did watch it and think maybe it should've been.  I truly enjoyed it!It was funny warm interesting turbulent.  The dialogue between Adam and Amanda was up there with Tarantino's stuff.  And some of those fights are just downright explosive!  The unique relationship between the two is believable and fun to be a part of.  There is chemistry and above all else mutual respect.  It's such a relief that they reconcile at the end of the movie.  Vive la difference!  Adam Bonner is appropriately goofy but it's clear that there is depth and intelligence beneath his bumbling stuttering dispeptic exterior.  Amanda Bonner's strength may not be bombastic with a few exceptions but her resolve is adamantine.  Sure she may not make much of a fuss about it but she's going to do what she needs to do whatever the cost.  Of course this deeply exasperates her husband almost ending their marriage but this must also be what he loves so much about her.  There is a sweetness and warmth to their marriage that perseveres through all the obstacles thrown in its path. Some of my favorite scenes though a little frivolous are the underthetable courtroom scenes when they drop their pencils and flirt with each other.  Kisses are blown funny faces are exchanged and Kate even flips her dress up at one point. OUCH!Though not without imperfections Adam's Rib is a a good solid movie and I'm glad I made the mistake of watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "ADAM'S RIB is probably the most wellknown of the nine TracyHepburn films with perhaps the exception of Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. It stars Spencer Tracy as Adam Bonner and Katharine Hepburn as his alliterativelynamed wife Amanda. When they wind up as opposing counsel on the same Attinger v Attinger case Adam prosecuting Amanda defending sparks of all sortsromantic angry sexualfly through the courtroom and their home. Given the extremely flawed feminism of WOMAN OF THE YEAR Tracy and Hepburn's first film together I was worried that ADAM'S RIB would be more of the sameunderstandable given that it is written by Garson Kanin the mastermind behind the first film. The message of the film is certainly muted by the shenanigans Amanda gets up to in the courtroomdeliberately flustering Adam by giving her client a hat he had given her for example or flirting with him under the table a naughty electric scene or even worse having Adam literally shown up by a circus woman. It does occasionally make you wonder why Amanda has to resort to such silly tactics to make such a serious point about equal rights for women. But this really is just a minor offenseI present the entire series of 'Ally McBeal' as proof that if ADAM'S RIB did present female lawyers as silly and flighty it is hardly the only offender and the fact that it was made in 1949 might excuse it. 'Ally McBeal' doesn't have that same excuse.In fact I don't think that ADAM'S RIB is as schizophrenic about affirming the female and equal rights as WOMAN OF THE YEAR is. Yes Amanda does some silly things in courtthis is a flaw in the film albeit I feel a minor one. But discounting that Amanda is by all accounts a character the audience can and do sympathise with. Moreover she is affirmed at the end in a way the Tess Harding character never is. I find it very interesting that at the end it is Adam who schemes to win Amanda back. Contrast this with WOMAN OF THE YEAR Tess has to win Sam back and to do so must be 'domesticated'. The film actually makes the point that both Adam and Amanda are partly righther cause is just as pertinent as his and they both eventually come to respect what the other is fighting for. That's what gives them a true marriage a true union based on sharing and trust give and take. Again by contrast this came under serious fire in WOMAN OF THE YEAR.In the end ADAM'S RIB really is a wonderful film it's not without its flaws of course but what it comes down to is a truly delightful little romantic comedy with sparkling performances from its leads. It's a true delight to see Tracy and Hepburn playing a happily married couple who evidently love each other deeply. They really do play together perfectlyalways in sync and so believable as people who are going to spend the rest of their lives with each other. For them it's the little moments that make all the difference one of my favourites is when Adam and Amanda are screening a home movie for their party guests. Worried that Adam is mad at her as he has every reason to be! Amanda moves quickly across the dark room to him and gently rests her head on his lap before returning to her seat. Such a sweet romantic little gesture and yet it says volumes about their relationship.Moreover the film has plenty of little surprises I was actually really pleased and surprised at the verdict given by the jury a lovely supporting cast including Jean Hagen and Judy Holliday the latter's role beingeffectivelya screen test for her later Hollywood career and incredible dialogue fired off at an incredible pace. Plus a sweet song by Cole Porter albeit a very irritating and crassly forwardopportunistic singer in the character of Kip and some of the naughtiest scenes in film history that never took place onscreen.Well well worth the watch. 910.".

In the rest of that scene Kate cries until Spence is sorry for hurting her feelingsand her derriere. He's willing to make amends but the only thing that makes her happy is when she immediately quits her crying and kicks him in the shin. If you laugh at that scene you'll love the rest of the movie.Besides Guess Who's Coming to Dinner because that film's totally different than the usual films they made together Adam's Rib is my favorite of the TracyHepburn movies. It's a hilarious battle of the sexes with the offscreen duo playing an on screen married couple who are both lawyers and in constant competition with each other. When they take opposing sides in a trial the courtroom erupts with tension!While Katharine Hepburn was famous for being an early feminist icon in real life she took everything Spencer Tracy dished out even when it wasn't pretty. So if you like seeing her give as good as she gets from Spence you'll love the ninetyminute sparring match. The screenplay is funny and smart as true to life today as it was in 1949. Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin's script will make you think about the roles in a marriage and what society will accept from a man versus a woman. When Spence claims men can use tears to get what they want just as effectively as women or when Kate continually fights for gender equality at home and at work you'll find yourself torn between the arguing pairwhich shows it's wellwritten since the script never blatantly takes sides! Watch the hilarious preview to see if you'll like it and then rent the perfectly titled Adam's Rib for a fun afternoon with your sweetiepie. It'll make for some very interesting conversations!".

	schema:reviewBody "An obvious HepburnTracy vehicle riding on the couple's reallife romance Adam's Rib suffers from a blatant absence of plot and come to think of it pretty much anything that makes a good film. Adam and Amanda Bonner respectively attorney general and lawyer take sides in a courtroom battle over a woman's case who cooled her husband's adulterous ardour by clumsily trying to shoot him down. Sure enough the legal joust spills over into the counsels' private life with Hepburn making a case for women's rights and Tracy trying to compete on traditional i.e. manly legal grounds. What could have been a pacey screwball classic quickly turns into a humdrum romancecumesprit playlet deludingly relying on desperately witty colloquy and the chemistry between the two stars foggily directed by an uninspired George Cukor who must have been crying secretly in between takes. Though Tracey and Hepburn are on cruise control mode there's only this much anyone could have siphoned out of a virtually nonexisting intrigue and after a somewhat upbeat beginning it all drifts off into precocious women's lib rhetoric most of it obstructing any further development of the story. Worst of all the side plot  the couple's friend a viscerally annoying wannabe songwriter and singer openly courting Miss Hepburn  is about the patchiest piece of script you've come across shredding this hapless comedy into bits of fluffy dinner talk and cackhandled situation comedy. The truth of the matter is that right from the start Cukor follows the wrong cue when he decides to stage a gender fight by settling on the obvious option which is Hepburn siding with the betrayed female and Tracy defending the shotat husband. This is of course a wild and foolish guess but Billy Wilder in his heyday would have likely tackled the same story by going head first for a reversal of roles perfidiously casting Tracy as a reluctant champion of the weaker sex instead which in itself could have sparked off a firework of quiproquos and story twists and incidentally prevented anyone involved in this weakling from trying to get away with a routine job. For all those tender souls who keep fooling themselves about the grand cinema of olden days and how everything was so much better in those days this is shattering proof that futility is timeless.".

	schema:headline " Not as dramatic engaging or funny as has been suggested but the lead pair make it well worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "Adam and Amanda Bonner are happily married despite the sparky nature of their relationship. Lawyers each both are interested in a newspaper report of a woman who shot but not killed her husband when she discovered him in the arms of another woman. The Bonner's take differing views of the case and it is no surprise that Adam ends up prosecuting while Amanda is Doris Attinger's defence counsel. With the gloves off in the courtroom with a legal battle of sexual equality it is no surprise that the conflict and disagreements don't end at the front door and soon it is all kicking off.The issue of sexual equality may have moved on from where it was in the middle of the last century but this film occasionally hits an interesting point even if the majority of it is fairly shallow and a bit unconvincing in terms of legal argument. Without really engaging me the film still held my interest as the story developed and it was fairly enjoyable even if it couldn't settle on whether or not it is a comedy or a courtroom issue drama as it was I didn't think it did either brilliantly but did both well enough to make it work. I did expect more laughs because I thought it was going to be one of the screwball genre but once I realised that it was more amusing than funny then I was able to settle into it.One of the main reasons that the film has continued to last down the years is the chemistry between Tracy and Hepburn. Both are convincing as a couple in terms of romance attrition chemistry and other aspects of their relationship on screen. Tracy is tetchy and enjoyable but Hepburn is more than a match for him and she does it with style and real humour. Support is good from Holliday as well as Wayne's annoying neighbour. Mainly though it is Tracy and Hepburn's movie and they more than carry it between them.Overall though this is not quite the classic that I had hoped it would be but it still did enough to make it work today. The courtroom stuff is not as dramatic or as relevant as it may have once been and the comedy is more of the sharp variety than the laughoutloud sort however the chemistry between the lead two keeps it going and makes it worth seeing still.".

Without really engaging me the film still held my interest as the story developed and it was fairly enjoyable even if it couldn't settle on whether or not it is a comedy or a courtroom issue drama as it was I didn't think it did either brilliantly but did both well enough to make it work. I did expect more laughs because I thought it was going to be one of the screwball genre but once I realised that it was more amusing than funny then I was able to settle into it.One of the main reasons that the film has continued to last down the years is the chemistry between Tracy and Hepburn. Both are convincing as a couple in terms of romance attrition chemistry and other aspects of their relationship on screen. Tracy is tetchy and enjoyable but Hepburn is more than a match for him and she does it with style and real humour. Support is good from Holliday as well as Wayne's annoying neighbour. Mainly though it is Tracy and Hepburn's movie and they more than carry it between them.Overall though this is not quite the classic that I had hoped it would be but it still did enough to make it work today. The courtroom stuff is not as dramatic or as relevant as it may have once been and the comedy is more of the sharp variety than the laughoutloud sort however the chemistry between the lead two keeps it going and makes it worth seeing still.";

I read the rest of the story on wikipedia and it doesn't seem to get much better.

	schema:reviewBody "Seven years into their screen partnership Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made what is arguably their best effort together the sixth of nine movies they made together. The zingy repartee and oldshoe comfort in their relationship are in full bloom in this 1949 comedy classic directed by George Cukor. Written by the legendary husband and wife writing team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon the plot focuses on a headlinegrabbing court case involving Doris Attinger a dimwitted wife who shoots her philandering husband Warren just as he is caught with his blowsy mistress Beryl Caighn. Representing the wounded husband is Assistant DA Adam Bonner who is looking for a quick conviction of the wife. However his protofeminist attorney wife Amanda sees the alleged crime as an act of justifiable defiance and decides to defend the wife.This potentially tense setup leads to a trial where Amanda sets out to prove that a double standard exists for women and that Doris was merely defending her family and home. Adam however believes that the law is the law no matter the gender of those involved and that a murder was indeed attempted. Consequently the story is not so much about Adam's inherent sexism as it is about Amanda's singleminded determination to prove her point even as the case degrades into a media sideshow. Over half a century later Amanda's arguments sound rather dated onenote and frankly illconceived with many of her lines simply polemics. At the same time Hepburn plays such a convincing litigator that her case actually sounds persuasive at times. Tracy is also in top form as he brings his unique combination of sympathy and combustible bluster to a man who respects his wife deeply but becomes increasingly disillusioned with her unlawful stance.Together they banter terrifically throughout but it's in the domestic scenes for instance the home movie of their Connecticut farm and the late night meal preparation where you feel their natural chemistry the most. As Doris Judy Holliday delivers in her first significant screen role bringing a deeper pathos to the scorned wife than you would expect. Several years away from The Seven Year Itch Tom Ewell plays Warren for the smarmy sexist cheater that he is while Jean Hagen expertly plays Beryl as a mediahungry floozy. As the Bonners' next door neighbor Kip David Wayne acts rather fey for someone who supposedly wants to run away with Amanda but I suppose the approach was intentional to ensure nothing would really threaten the Bonner marriage except the case. However dated some of the sexual politics feel the film is still one of the most smartly played of romantic comedies. Unfortunately the 2000 DVD has no extras.".

Except her mother Elisabeth Shue is a whorelike drug addicted loser who's abandoning her daughter. And her father Alessandro Nivola is a fading rockandroll star who has no idea he has a daughter let alone any intention of being a father to one. Janie Jones the film and each of the characters pick all the right notes.It's a fairly subtle drama about a young girl who doesn't want to be left on her own but knows how to take care of herself and a father who doesn't seem to have the first clue about how to take care of himself but with the arrival of Janie he might try for her sake. Similar movies have been done before but this one is a bit more subtle in their actions even if the plot points are the same. I wholeheartedly enjoyed each of the choices they made to the move the film along.Ethan the father is a rock singer desperate to cling on to the notoriety that comes with being a band leader. As you can guess his career isn't going so well. One of the excellent elements of the film was choosing softer folk songs when he's actually playing music for us or for his daughter. And even better it really is Nivola playing the guitar. A talented musician he was in bands throughout high school and university.More excellent choices were made in the casting and characterizations. Brittany Snow has managed to stay just in the shadows of the Hollywood spotlight her whole career despite her cute blonde looks. I'm assuming that has something do with the fact that even though she is a cute blonde either her characters have had a dark side or the films have had a dark side. I've always admired that about her. This marks the first time she's not playing a teenager. And her character named Iris who appears to be a whorelike drugaddicted loser on the arm of Ethan isn't exactly as she appears to be. Frank Whaley playing Ethan's bandmate steals the few scenes he's in by adding some touching comedy to the drama.Nivola and Breslin are the stars and despite their age and background differences they never went overthetop around each other. They both played their characters with the subtlety required. The scenes of just the two of them were cute but never showy they held our hearts the whole way. I've always loved Nivola and have appreciated everything he has done. Breslin has made the right choice by returning to her indie roots showing how she has matured and keeping the comedy in check.Janie Jones has flown under the radar I'm assuming because it has chosen quieter tones but they are the right ones.".

Written and directed by David Rosenthal this somewhat overly long film works well and that is in no small art due to the sensitive casting.Tattooed alcoholic almost has been rock and roll performer Ethan Alessandro Nivola tours with a mediocre band headed by manager Sloan Peter Stormare who somehow manages to keep things together for the band  Dave Joel David Moore singer and Ethan's girl friend Iris Britanny Snow Chuck Frank Whaley and Ulysses Michael Panes. The band has been together for years and now is forced to play the sleazy nightclubs who will book second rate acts. Into this worn down group comes a surprise  Ethan's old squeeze Mary Ann Jones Elisabeth Shue whom Ethan hasn't seen for 13 years arrives on the scene with Ethan's 13 yearold daughter Janie Jones Abigail Breslin. Ethan doesn't even remember Mary And nor does he buy the fact that he fathered a child but Mary Ann has the birth certificate to prove it Mary Ann is drug addict and can no longer care for Janie while she attempts to dry out so she literally dumps Janie with the reluctant Ethan and disappears. The remainder of the film is a struggle Ethan has at being unable to cope with life in general the disbanding of the band because of Ethan's sociopathic behavior Ethan's arrest and Janie's method of bailing him out when no one else will falling downhill as a musician and coping with the fact that Janie is around. The gradual interaction between Ethan and Janie demonstrates the difficulties of fatherdaughter bonding but it also awakens in each of them the concept of being noticed needed and loved.Both Alessandro Nivola one of our finest actors today and Abigail Breslin bring a depth of acting skills to these rolls. They are wholly credible and have our hearts all the way through. The smaller roles including Frances Farmer as Ethan's wealthy mother form whom he is able to get funding because of Janie's presence as her granddaughter are well written and beautifully acted. The film relies a lot on music and Nivola and Breslin sing and pay their own musical contributions. Yes the story may be tattered from over use but the strength of the film is well worth the viewer's interest and time. Grady Harp November 11".

Fortunately that's where the similarity ends as this is a much better film with respect to both writing and acting.

I also heard that she was a joy to be around so that probably helped too! This films progression was done really well. The character development was awesome!

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so the movie is far from reality and never likely to have incidents such as depicted in this movie transform in real life. Now that I got that out of the way I will tell you what my wife and I thought were the highlights of this melodrama.The relationship that evolves gradually between the two main characters missing father and roadie rocker Ethan Brand Alessandro Nivola and lost 13 year old daughter Janie Jones Abigail Breslin takes place as Janie's drug induced mother Mary Ann Jones Elisabeth Shue literally dumps her daughter on unsuspecting rocker bastard father Ethan as he is travelling through the U.S. on his tour bus with his band. Ethan initially rejects the notion that Janie is his daughter and his emotions get the better of him as does the booze as one by one he fights with members of his own band until all that is left on the road is Ethan and his daughter Janie. One of the first relationships to disintegrate and he loses is that of his band member and girlfriend Iris played by Brittany Snow. Even his long time road manager Sloan played by Peter Stormare realizes the gig is past its heyday and he decides to move on to greener pastures.So with only guitar and daughter in tow Ethan is forced to play the bar scene to a much smaller audience who does not show the appreciation for his musical talents that Ethan is used to receiving. Spiraling continually downward Ethan boozes it up until fighting with the local rowdies eventually lands him in the slammer. Now what to do Janie? She's 13 years old stuck in a motel with her dad in the slammer. So Janie uses her intuition and driving skills to somehow get her dad out of jail. Not wanting to spoil the plot any further I will say that the next few scenes are a bit unrealistic but heartwarming for any father and daughter relationship to grow Janie appears to have some musical talent of her own and with her dad sobering up real quickly they visit dear old mom for a small loan to get them the start up money needed to get back on the road as a duo. Frances Fisher plays Lily grandmother to Janie who gets to meet her grand daughter for the first time. Relationships are starting to form the musical talents between Ethan and Janie are melding and then dear old drug addicted mom Mary Ann Elisabeth Shue comes back in to the picture.Okay so dysfunctional families are part of our culture and always will be but when heroes come to the rescue and music that warms our heart mellows us we transform in to a loving family unit that enjoys a good picture even if the story line is not the strongest. I think this is a movie for families to watch and enjoy assuming that your children are well in to their teens. Spoiler alert moms and dads At the end of the movie you will be obligated to hug your daughters and tell them you love them even if they have caused you some grief lately. Or maybe you have caused them some grief? Either way it is a good watch for the music and warmth that evolves between daughter and father.".

I plan to take family members to the film. Goos family picture. Sound track should be popular especially with teen girls.";

I did really enjoy this movie though and highly recommend it but for those that have seen August Rush be prepared. The acting and story are very good but also extremely predictable in most movies that hurts it but this one still keeps you watching.

The lead guy looks so much like Chris Martin of Coldplay by the way. We are to assume that years ago with a full band he sounded good and had a knack for writing poignant lyrics.Nivola the lead played his role with soul as he always does. The little girl did well by not pushing any stereotypes of the jaded kid or the precocious one.I just didn't know where this was goingor maybe I knew all too well and that's why I abandoned it.I don't recommend it to anyone.

Cameraman Harmeet Singh seems to have been literally in a holidaying mood so he has beautifully captured the new scenic locales of Cine Tirol region and Salisberg  Austria where nothing else but only the songs have been canned. Editor A.Muthu has been hampered by the hackneyed story screenplay dialogues of Rumi Jaffery Ikram Akhtar Yunus Sajawal and even their constant takeoff on senior actors like Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan was not in very good taste. Musically the AnandMilind  Sameer combo leaves much to be desired with only the title song sung by the principal actors'Chori chori sapno mein aata hai koi' and 'Meri neend jaane lagi hai' that are worth humming.Performancewise Sanjay Dutt excellent as usual and exudes a tremendous screen presence. Salman Khan too matches his senior costar especially in the comic sequences. Karisma Kapoor successfully displays her comic forte apart from portraying all the nuances of her well defined role. On the other hand Naghma Sonali Bendre and Twinkle Khanna's gutsy guest appearances are just about okay.

Ganesh Acharya's choreography is good. AnandMilind's music sounds nice in the theatre but there are too many songs. Two songs 'Meri neend jaane lagi hai' and 'Chori chori sapnon mein' are hummable.The first half is a breezy comedy. Tempo slows down in the second half and the story runs on predictable line. A major drawback of the film is that the basic story has been repeated in many films and recently in Dillagi and Pyar Koi Khel Nahin.Performancewise Sanjay Dutt impresses. Salman Khan is natural. Karisma Kapoor is lively. Shakti Kapoor Sushma Seth Dalip Tahil Himani Shivpuri and Asrani provide able support.As the director David Dhawan again shows competence as a maker of light comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed watching David Dhavan's Chal Mere Bhai a crazy comedy which is a complete laugh riot for the entire family. The movie has drama action romance and comedy all blended together to create a picture that keeps you entertained from start to finish. The film tells the story of two loving brothers Vicky and Prem both of whom fall for the same girl. That sounds rather dramatic but everything is flavoured with great humour and is great fun to watch. Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan play the leading roles they do a great job and have a great chemistry with Karisma Kapoor but more than anything they just look like real brothers simply because of their own friendship behind the cameras. Everything in their interaction is incredibly convincing and nice to watch. Sanju is restrained and subdued and Salman is naturally funny with his happygolucky attitude. Karisma Kapoor is awesome as the innocent and unassuming yet smart Sapna. These three leads act according to the film's mood and provide the film's most hilarious moments. What I particularly liked about the movie is its lighthearted nature. The movie has practically no villains and the supporting cast pretty much resembles the big good family of Hum Aapke Hain Koun. AnandMilind compose a lovely soundtrack for the film. Among the songs Aajkal Ki Ladkiyan is very catchy Chori Chori Sapnon is also very nice but my favourite number is Meri Neend Jaane Lagi Hai which is very melodious and is beautifully pictured on screen. Chal Mere Bhai is not some extraordinary film but it's very entertaining and deserves many repeat viewings at least according to me.".

Besides Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt looked good together on screen. Salman and Karisma's pairing was also quite fresh. The film had nothing new to offer but it entertains while it plays. The camerawork especially of the songs was very eye candy. The locales were plush the cinematography was eye pleasing and the film had its comic moments as well.A big plus was AnandMilind's music. Unlike their other hit collaborations with director David Dhawan which mostly comprised of mass appealing peppy songs this film had some beautiful romantic duets. The pick of the lot is undoubtedly Meri Neend Jaane Lagi Hain followed closely by Chori Chori Sapno Mein. The peppier tracks like the title song Aaj Kal Ki Ladkiya and Lal Dupatta Malmal Ka were also infectious.I don't really know as to why the film despite its merits couldn't survive at the BO.

One can halfway see Vicky's attraction to Sapna because of her slightly heroic actions but it's a bit more challenging to believe that of Prem's.

	schema:reviewBody "With Outrage Takeshi Kitano returned to his filmmaking roots and he did not disappoint bringing to the audience one of his signature yakuza movies. Its followup Outrage Beyond offers more of the same as it focuses on a larger scale conflict this time a conflict that is the direct result of the events in the first film. The action here revolves around Takeshi Kitano's Otomo and the way his actions lead to a war between two rival yakuza gangs. We find out that Otomo is alive and well but still in prison after surviving the aftermath of the bloodbath in the first film. His premature release from prison leads to tensions between the two organizations and the apparent peace between them is disrupted. Thus the fight for power begins and the conflict is spiced up by the involvement of a police detective who has interests of his own all leading to an explosive finale.The film does not fail to deliver although it is not in the same class as some of Takeshi's other yakuza efforts. It represents an improvement on Outrage in terms of storytelling there is less focus on old school action and more emphasis is put on the conflict between the characters which is a good thing since it adds more dimension to the story. The characters themselves are well developed and the acting is what you would expect. On the other hand the film lacks some creativity and some artistic touch in order to be truly great. All the elements of a Kitano film are here but they do not stand out as much as they should even his trademark deadpan humor is served in smaller doses. All things aside the film is good in its own right and the only reason for it not being on par with Takeshi's best efforts is because those films have set such a high standard. While it does not break any new ground Outrage Beyond is an entertaining film to watch whether you are a fan of the genre or not and it represents a good addition to Takeshi Kitano's filmography.".

The 2nd instalment is more composed and deals with the politics and characters on a much deeper level. After watching it I am curious as to if this was one screen play cut into 2 films or if Tekeshi and co decided to write another script after the original. Outrage Beyond is a solid piece of crime cinema. The themes of corruption loyalty redemption and honour are explored on multiple levels. I loved the cinematography and was really impressed with the solid performances throughout the film. My pick of a great bunch was Tomokazu Miura's portrayal of the aged and weary Kato.The ending solidified this Kitano outing as a classic. Great film.".

Detective Shigeta a somewhat more straight arrow policeman accompanies Kataoka on some of his tasks. Kato is still the Chairman of the Sanno family. Ishihara formerly in Otomo's clan is now Kato's underboss. Sanno has grown considerably in wealth and power partly because they absorbed Murase's drug business from the first film. Other shifts in the Sanno family are placement of older executives by younger ones and valuing acquiring money over muscling other families. As the story begins there is plenty of fuel in the powder keg the old guard resent the younger upstarts when one family expands others just might feel threatened the cops have decided to squeeze Sanno growth.In the film's opening sequence the police lift a car out of the water. Kataoka and Shigeta arrive so one knows there is a yakuza connection. One of the bodies is that of a high government official and evidence points to the Sanno family issuing the hit order. The police see that Sanno thinks its money is sufficient to buy enough protection for them to openly order the killing of a government official. This seems to be too much to bear.Kataoka sets about riling up the yakuza against each other. He encourages one of the old guard in the Sanno family and two of his followers to attempt to unseat and replace Underboss Ishihara.

	schema:reviewBody "In Takeshi Kitano's Outrage we sat through some heavy plotting and counterschemes where every one a collective of Yakuzas and gangsters is a bad guy fighting over power and control when being unwittingly manipulated together with shifting alliances. The story was pretty brilliant then since you're really unsure how the concocted plans would turn out suffice to say it boiled down to very violent affairs with plenty of firearm action all round.But Kitano kept his direction well balanced then as he does so again now with dramatic scenes happening in the first half of the film followed by a build up to various violent crescendos in the latter half. We continue where we last left off where the victors of the first film's schemes Kato Tomokazu Miura and the Otomo Clan turncoat Ishihara Ryo Kase return to the top of the food chain grabbing control over the Sannokai crime organization although not without their detractors from within who will jump at every seductive suggested opportunity to usurp the throne. It didn't help that their leadership style parallel to some real world techniques of cost cutting stinginess doesn't cut it through the rank and file.And you just can't put a good man down or a bad man in this case with Beat Takeshi's Otomo returning to the mayhem as orchestrated by Detective Kataoka Fumiyo Kohinata. Wait a minute didn't we witness his key scene in the finale of Outrage? I suppose if one is at the creative helm of the film  directing writing and editing  then anything's possible. Otomo as it turns out is still sitting pretty in prison but has his enemies quaking in their shoes when rumours got squashed and Kataoka accelerates Otomo's parole to get him released and back in the fray. With preference for a lowly life amongst the hood it is genre mantra that one never walks away but gets pulled back into the hustle and bustle of vengeance and violence.Between the two films perhaps I will have to throw my hat of preference over to the first one if only for a plot that involved a lot more stakeholders and on screen violence that was more balletic than this follow up's rather tame and usually offscreen mayhem. Sometimes we get to see flashes from muzzles compensated by the awesomely rendered loud sounds of multiple rounds leaving the chamber of the gun. And stylistically which is a fair counter point to the explicitness of what Hollywood does today we find ourselves staring down barrels of guns on screen before cutting to the aftermath.When put together while the films touches on titfortat revenge and perhaps contain a shade of real world organizational politics given the structure of the Yakuza not only do we get to compare leadership styles and skills of those at the top but rather how one should be aware of the little man running around stirring trouble only for personal benefit. Fumiyo Kohinata steals the show each time he comes on screen as the corrupt Detective Kataoka on the payroll of the force and striving to go up in his career ladder while on the take from the clans yet at the same time scheming against all to advance his personal agenda at both sides of the law.I had nothing but chuckles especially during an interrogation scene which Kataoka engineers which probably cuts a little close to home given the series of gaffes in high profile court cases that didn't quite put the Home Team in good light. And characters like Kataoka are not hard to imagine nor stranger than fiction. His opposite would be the ramrod straight Shigeta who for all his righteousness couldn't influence the corruption going on in his face as executed in arrogant style by his counterpart. It's really Kataoka's show from the get go being the key character and catalyst in almost all twists and turns with Fumiyo Kohinata being the quintessential villain amongst all villains here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Takeshi Kitano's OUTRAGE was one of the best films I saw this year a toptier Japanese yakuza flick with all of the hardhitting violence and dense plotting that you could wish for in a film. This followup carries on the same story thus was a welcome addition for me even though it's not up there with the quality of the first.The main issue I have with BEYOND OUTRAGE is that the pacing is a lot slower than in the first film so that you're sitting around waiting for the proper plot to kick in especially during the first half. Plus a lot of the plot twists and turns are rather unsatisfying whereas the satisfying material is rushed over quite quickly. Kitano goes out of his way to avoid copying the sort of scenes we had in the first film but as those were my favourite bits I can't help but be a little disappointed.Still this is nevertheless compelling filmmaking with top direction and acting. Kitano is a more than welcome return as actor although his acting is more subdued here and he's keen to give the other returning stars more screen time and meat to get their teeth into. There are some fine setpieces again the most memorable involving baseball and as a whole the movie has an air of quality and authenticity that makes it work. BEYOND OUTRAGE feels very much like a classic samurai movie albeit one in a modern setting.".

The central relationship in this film is between gay men but the film manages to touch on failingtoxic relationships in general and offers up some noteworthy and humorous ensemble performances. As difficult as it is to believe these relationships exist in gay and straight life. It seems to me that the filmmaker decided it was important to hold up a mirror and show us reality and a real relationship gone awry instead of showing us that gays can have just as little sex andor just as loving relationships as straight folk. We have enough sanitized and safe portrayals of gays on network TV. I found the performances to be interesting and the characters were dynamic. Each had a journey unlike the static characters in the aforementioned lauded art film. Since this film was most certainly shot quickly and with a limited budget I take my hat off to cast and crew. The selfishness desperation preoccupation codependency and obsessive behavior depicted seemed right on point. I felt that the filmmakers unflinchingly and without apology depicted the good the bad and the ugly of this relationship while tell a story about two individuals in love.".

Each had a journey unlike the static characters in the aforementioned lauded art film. Since this film was most certainly shot quickly and with a limited budget I take my hat off to cast and crew. The selfishness desperation preoccupation codependency and obsessive behavior depicted seemed right on point. I felt that the filmmakers unflinchingly and without apology depicted the good the bad and the ugly of this relationship while tell a story about two individuals in love.";

	schema:reviewBody "Okay really? This movie is homophobic and makes it look like all gay men smoke crack? That it didn't seem believable? Huh. Maybe because I watched it not only knowing it was largely a true story but also having read the reallife memoir of the man represented in the film by Paul Bill Clegg but I thought it did a very good job of depicting the tragedy of being in a relationship with someone fundamentally fcked up and not being able to let them go until far too late. The acting was spoton particularly from Thure Lindhardt and the portrayals were entirely believable. In no context whatsoever was it intentionally designed to depict gay men as insatiable crackheads.As for complaints that basically go back to verisimilitude people it's an indie flick and a super lowbudget one at that. You can't realistically depict Manhattan circa 1998 that way nor can you have characters whose attire and hairstyles change all that much during the film. That said I've seen photos of Bill Clegg and his superpreppy look  which is how Paul is consistently depicted in the film  hasn't really changed much over the years. My only issue in this regard was in terms of easily avoidable problems in the second scene for instance set in 1998 Erik walks by what is clearly recognizable to a New Yorker at least as one of the bus shelters constructed within the past five years or so. They really had to shoot on that street?My problems with the film weren't with the acting but more with its failure to fully flesh out Paul as a character. I'm unclear whether this was intentional  in the context of you can never really know someone  but Paul started out as an enigma and largely stayed that way. I understand that this comes with the territory with a largely autobiographical film written by the protagonist Erik though I have no clue whatsoever why he's Danish to the extent of having conversations in Danish with his sister  Ira Sachs is American and Jewish though obviously a reallife filmmaker but hewing so closely to a reallife timeline left Sachs with too little time to delve into what compelled him to stay with Paul for such an extended period. I also thought there were a few too many largely extraneous side plots particularly involving Erik's BFF's biologicalclock issues and the weird muscley guy Erik inexplicably hooked up with two times five years apart. And why did a solitary unexplained pair of scenes have him going to Virginia for an extended period of time? neither of which had anything whatsoever to do with the main plotStill even given its flaws it's one of the best gaythemed indie films I've seen in quite some time though Weekend is still better all around. It avoids the most typical gayfilm clichs the comingout stories the happy endings the life revolving around discos and fabulous hags to deliver something raw and real.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a terrific low budget independent limited release film about a relationship mortally wounded by addictions. Erik and Paul Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth meet while trolling for sex on a phone sex line back in 1998 when people were still doing that. The opening scene is of Erik spread out on his bed in his dingy apartment on the phone clicking back and forth between callers sifting through details of size appearance top bottom etc. These calls are not about would you like to hook up. They are about I'm ready you're ready do we suit each others needs. One after another he either hangs up on them or they hang up on him and then score. Next we then see Erik walking through the streets of NY which are as dark and dingy as his apartment to meet up with Mr. Right Now Paul. And then  the big reveal. Erik knocks on Paul's door and as it opens you have the moment that is the giant metaphor for this whole movie are you who I'm hoping you are and will this work out? Did he lie or tell the truth about his height looks hair color penis size? Will this be a fairytale or a nightmare? On most occasions this is probably where if you are the one knocking you turn and walk away fast. And if you're the one with the door you slam it and lock it. They do neither. And for just a second before the sleaze begins their eyes lock in a gaze that tells you that they will know each other long after this encounter is over.Writerdirector Ira Sachs has some problems with this script. It bogs down near the end. In the scope of the entire film however it's minor but worth a mention. He has written and brought to life a very gritty sentimental and real story about two men falling in love as one of them crashes to the ground in flames. Paul has a drug problem. A bad one. Erik tries to tolerate it bargain with it talk Paul out of it literally hold his hand through it until he finally says enough. The road from here to there is painful to watch. It unfolds nakedly through the actors the script a brilliant music score and menacing cinematography. This is a familiar story with a new treatment and it is raw to the bone. The cast here is breathtakingly effective. Julianne Nicholson Flannel Pajamas plays Erik's colleague and best friend with disarming gentleness. Zachary Booth plays Paul a man only slightly aware of the harm he does to himself and others. Erik's sister is played sparingly but effectively by Paprika Steen. With very few lines she establishes the normal facets to Erik's character. There's brothersister tension. But mostly there's love and family. The very thing Erik and Paul want for themselves. One of the more interesting castings is Russ played by Sebastian La Cause. Russ is one of Erik's distractions from the chaos of Paul and he is bizarre. They meet over the phone and their first encounter goes a little differently. Sebastian Le Cause has very little screen time but he makes an impression. He is the flashing caution light for those contemplating anonymous encounters. And the way he does this character is jarring. He is as menacing as he is alluring. Ultimately this film belongs to Thure Lindhardt as Erik. Lindhardt makes you feel this movie and his journey as he is dragged through the madness of drug addiction and loving someone who is out of control. He has the same quality that I attribute to great actors like Heath Ledger. He pulls away from the camera away from the movie and draws you in closer until you're living the story with him. Before you know it Erik's problems are your problems. Which made me care deeply about both of them. It is an astonishing technique and Lindhardt gives a mesmerizing performance. It is natural and unstudied. He finds the perfect pitch in every scene and the expert camera work is there to capture all of it. Thimio Bakatakis's cinematography is art. It's not possible to discern who the genius is here Bakatakis or Sachs but someone has angled a camera here boxed in a shot there and sometimes filmed scenes where a character is completely back lit by a bright sky leaving them in shadow empty lifeless or unreachable. Twice you see Erik caged in the shot. The first time at the museum when he is made to hide from Paul's unexpected exgirlfriend. The second time at the bathroom door listening to the running water quietly calling for Paul. If you turned off the sound the camera work alone would tell this story.It's easy to get into the weeds too much about how and in how many different ways this film is brilliant. But ultimately it is just compelling. You want these two guys to win. You want their love for one another to trump the mountain of odds stacked against it. You want them to live happily ever after. If ever a film cried out for a sequel and they almost never do this one does. Five years after the credits roll on this film I can see Erik and Paul together again tenuously carefully and forever. At the beginning of this film when they see each other for the first time unglamorous as it was you know that it's the start of something better. When they see each other for the last time here I just got the feeling that it wasn't over. This is not an easy film to watch. But much like driving past an accident on the freeway you can't not look.".

	schema:headline " An excellent main actor saves this one";
	schema:reviewBody "Thure Lindhardt is at the center of this film and he's really its only saving grace. His Erik is the kind of character many of us know or have been in life. He's in his late 30s but hasn't really done much with his life and he's somewhat addicted to casual sex. When a phone hookup leads to emotional involvement Erik's life suddenly has a focus and it gives him more impetus to complete his documentary film project. Handsome charismatic Lindhardt is wellcast as a nonnative trying to make it in New York. He knows how to express the conflicts within Erik wanting love but pursuing an impossible object. He's decisive tender petulant and confusing all at once. Lindhardt is the kind of actor who can do much with small nuances of voice and facial expression. Unfortunately Lindhardt is playing opposite a much less compelling character and actor in Paul Zachary Booth. This actor gives a professional performance but Paul is so nearly a nonentity it's doubtful anyone else could do more with him. He's narcissistic drugaddled and selfdestructive from the start and he never changes. Erik is narcissistic too but his character and storyline have more substance. For some viewers it may be hard to understand why Erik puts up with Paul and returns to him again and again. Lindhardt makes us believe in Erik's obsession at least most of the time we don't always want the most appropriate person. One one level this is a story about the power of sexual attraction but it's also about the attraction of a 'wounded deer'. Erik thinks that Paul needs him and that notion is as strong as any to make him continue the relationship.Also good in the cast is Julianne Nicholson as Erik's close friend and collaborator. She brings a natural livedin quality to their scenes together.The film opens well and builds the narrative nicely until the final third when it feels slightly disjointed and suffers a bit from a loss of energy. It's nicely shot and has a mostly pleasing music score highlighted by the song under the opening credits.".

	schema:headline " Tale of Gay lover's efforts to save drugaddicted partner trumps his onenote obsession with him";
	schema:reviewBody "While attending a recent screening of 'Keep the Lights On' director Ira Sachs indicated that the title of his new film about a gay romance spanning approximately ten years refers to transparency or lack thereof. An additional theme he revealed is that the characters are trapped in a masochistic relationship.The film begins as we're introduced to Erik a documentary filmmaker from Denmark. He's basically supported by his father much to the chagrin of his sister who criticizes him for not having a regular job. Erik has just broken up with his lover and compulsively seeks out physical encounters with other gay men using phone hotlines the film begins in 1998 at the time when phone hotlines were beginning to be phased out due to the rising popularity of the internet.Mr. Sachs holds little back in depicting the sexual encounters Erik has with strangers as well as his new found lover Paul a literary agent. They're not completely explicit but there's a raw immediacy which gives the film an authentic verisimilitudea peek at gay life that outsiders rarely are privy to.Sachs wisely chronicles the dichotomy of Erik's personality. On one hand he's almost irrational in his obsession with Paul ignoring the obvious reality that Paul is a drug addict and is rapidly going downhill. Erik also keeps a lot of things to himself and there is a lack of communication between the two lovers that lack of transparency that Sachs alluded to during the recent screening I attended. On the plus side Erik is deeply concerned about Paul's welfare and is instrumental in getting him into an inpatient program.While Paul has to struggle with his demons Erik gradually makes good on his promise to become a successful documentary filmmaker. He wins a 'Teddy' Award in Berlin after garnering acclaim for his documentary about a gay artist from the 40s and 50s who Erik in effect rescues from obscurity.The tension in the plot is bound up in guessing whether Paul is going to make it or not. After Paul returns from rehab there's a great scene where he disappears for a number of days and Erik and his friends have no idea where he is. When Erik finally finds him at a hotel it's obvious that he's had a bad relapse. Erik hardly seems surprised when a young man comes over to have sex with Paul. Instead of getting angry and feeling betrayed he accepts the fact that Paul has relapsed and holds his hand while Paul has casual sex with the stranger.'Keep the Lights On' slows down considerably in the third act as Paul seemingly is much better after a few years and is now able to work. Erik's attitude has changed toward Paul who has kept away from him for about a year. When Paul gives him an ultimatumeither break up or find a new home and live togetherErik perhaps now realizing that their relationship has run its course chooses the option of dissolution.Erik's obsessive love for Paul does eventually become tiresome and of course the point is that Erik must go through a process of selfactualization before he realizes he's been in a masochistic relationship. Nonetheless Paul's breakdown and Erik's efforts to help him is the best part of the picture. And yes we also want to know what the ultimate disposition is of their relationship.Director Sachs' portrait of Erik is of a gay man who is not isolated from the rest of society. He has female friends and well as straight male friends and despite flights of sexual compulsivity Erik comes off as someone who is pretty much part of the mainstream. In that respect Mr. Sachs ably argues that gay people should not be considered 'outsiders' but ordinary people who are no different than the average middle class straight person.A good part of 'Keep the Lights On' is strangely compelling. Will Paul overcome his addiction? Can Erik remain in the relationship despite Paul's chequered history? Erik's 'love at any cost' obsession with Paul is necessary to show his selfdestructiveness but by the same token remains unexplained and goes on for a little too long. Some judicious editing to make the film slightly shorter would have helped. Nonetheless this is a film that is definitely worth a look not only for a few nice twists and turns in the plot but the particularly strong performances from Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth as the gay lovers whose relationship reaches its nadir and then unceremoniously fizzles out!".

I guess there are two things you can learn after watching this movie first the gay hookup culture and how it hasn't changed 20 years later... cough... Grindr... cough... second the overused drugs ruin relationships clich. Come to think of it I don't really see the point of the use of drugs in this movie. What's most frustrating is that not much is known about Paul other than his drug addiction! Let's draw an easy comparison Weekend 2011. I don't get how Weekend was dragged for filth for featuring drug use when it actually carries weight and adds an excellent level of depth to the characters! Yes Paul is a druggie so what then? Go see this movie if you want to see a rocky relationship that may or may not work out in the end no spoiler duh. But don't get you hopes up cause you'll be just as disappointed as I am.".

This movie gripped me from the very first moment to the last the acting is beyond superb and not only Thure Lindhardt but also Zachary Booth. I understood both of these characters while admittedly am more like Eric than Paul albeit I've never done any drugs at all. My only discomfort with this movie was the drug use I need gaythemed movies than don't have drug use in them but this particular movie is about a relationship with someone who is addicted to drugs so it was necessary in that sense but I wish Eric hadn't done drugs. I could relate to scene after scene  telling someone you like what they are doing when you don't. Staying in a dysfunctional relationship because you love them and learning that it's best to say goodbye and the mistake of putting too much importance on sex. I've been in a very similar situation than these two characters with a drug addict back in the 1990's and could completely relate to it. This is why I find it odd that some of the reviewers said this didn't reflect gay culture  perhaps not for them but certainly it rang true for me.Ira Sachs direction is superb  and artistic. So many gaythemed films are entertaining but not very artistically satisfying which makes his achievement here all the more special. The script is spot on. All of the acting performances are wonderful the bit with the guy being interviewed in the documentary Eric is making was particularly great. The chemistry between the two leads is astonishing. The sex scenes are vivid and real and hot too. I'm surprised this film is so lowrated  it was 7 on my top ten films list of 2012! ".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at the LIGLFF Out at the Movies event last night. As it happened I liked it better than most. I thought it was a nice mood piece with good acting and an involving story for the most part. I definitely would recommend it.There were some flaws though. The biggest one was the time changes. For very little apparent reason we flash though about 9 years of the main character's lives and yet they look exactly the same from beginning to end. They have the same hairstyles and have not seemed to age at all. It just seemed nonsensical to make a big deal about the passing of years and not have it impact at all on the appearance of the actors.Also other issues pop up that seem to have no relevance to the movie at all in the end like the results of an HIV test.While I did like it I thought it was definitely way too long. It was not as if each yearly segment had some significant action attached to it. Sometimes they didn't. The movie sometimes lurched jarringly ahead a few years seemingly without valid reason. Since the movie's outcome was obvious in the first half hour it played out way too long. Still I did find the characters involving.As for the person who commented that they had never seen a gay crack addict this film begins in the 90's. There were gay men who did crack. And not every gay man in this movie did drugs. In fact the movie made that point quite clear. One of the 2 main characters tried it but did not like it. There was a definite validity to some of the drug culture the movie was referring to. I think more surprising to me was that the person in the movie who was very addicted still managed to hold his highlevel job without repercussions.One more thing I did love the soundtrack in this film. It totally matched the movie.This film was not especially deep however it was a bit of a melancholic art film that was an interesting look at the decade in the lives of 2 gay men.It is what it is and not all that much more.".

For very little apparent reason we flash though about 9 years of the main character's lives and yet they look exactly the same from beginning to end. They have the same hairstyles and have not seemed to age at all. It just seemed nonsensical to make a big deal about the passing of years and not have it impact at all on the appearance of the actors.Also other issues pop up that seem to have no relevance to the movie at all in the end like the results of an HIV test.While I did like it I thought it was definitely way too long. It was not as if each yearly segment had some significant action attached to it. Sometimes they didn't. The movie sometimes lurched jarringly ahead a few years seemingly without valid reason. Since the movie's outcome was obvious in the first half hour it played out way too long. Still I did find the characters involving.As for the person who commented that they had never seen a gay crack addict this film begins in the 90's. There were gay men who did crack. And not every gay man in this movie did drugs. In fact the movie made that point quite clear. One of the 2 main characters tried it but did not like it. There was a definite validity to some of the drug culture the movie was referring to. I think more surprising to me was that the person in the movie who was very addicted still managed to hold his highlevel job without repercussions.One more thing I did love the soundtrack in this film. It totally matched the movie.This film was not especially deep however it was a bit of a melancholic art film that was an interesting look at the decade in the lives of 2 gay men.It is what it is and not all that much more.";

I personally stayed the whole time and I couldn't believe the abyssal emptiness of it.2 main problems 1 The movie is supposed to cover 8 years from 1998 to 2006 but everyone is wearing 2012 clothes and 2012 haircuts. Not just the people on the street  all the actors too. And in 8 years they don't change clothes or haircuts or anything not even once. The guy starts and ends with the exact same shaggy beard. I know they probably shot the movie under 2 weeks but it would be nice if they made an effort to at least pretend they didn't. I'm not saying that just to be anal about it  but because it's one of the main things that kill the movie because even with the title cards warning you we've changed years their whole story seems to last 1 month certainly not 8 years. Difficult to get emotionally involved.2 The drug. I didn't know it was a drug movie but it is. It's closer to Trainspotting than to a gay romance. And I hated the casual way it's shown as if all gay men smoked crack and it was normal. I've been around and I've never seen ANYBODY smoke crack ever. Not saying it doesn't exist but to play it like it's a normal occurrence is just stupid.Then there are many other things A guy who's in the closet with a girlfriend... and 1 month later he's kissing his boyfriend in the street? And of course we saw nothing that showed his evolution. The problem just disappeared. There were definite pacing problems as well the first 25 minutes everything is happyinwonderland and you're just shifting on your seat waiting for the movie to start.The only saving point is that the actor playing the drug addict is incredibly good looking. Apart from that you'd tell me the movie was sponsored by the American Family Association and the FRC I wouldn't be surprised. it just plays into every single negative stereotype about gay people save for the child molesting I guess they didn't have the time.".

Gay themed background or not sounded worth a detour. This Indie movie low budget so I will not grade with an eye out for an outstanding choreography and impeccable script. It has some anachronistic oddities character not changing style over many years New York City scenes out of era interior not changing a bit over the course of many years but also a few artistic shot that may catch your attention playing with lights framing or softness. There is a reasonable balance of both your sensitivity or attention to detail may find either enjoyable or disappointing. Again an Indie movie  don't be too harsh.With that in mind the final product does fairly at treating the topic especially with the character of Erik well developed and believable. But it also has gaps and short comings. The second main character of Paul as the closeted gay lawyer with a secret side fails to develop beyond that. By the end we know nothing of him and it is not all clear if this was intentional or not. Without this development it is hard to judge of the depth of the struggle  when the intervention scene comes to the forefront we realize there is a real indepth problem but have not been driven into it but we cannot relate to the depicting of Paul as a loving and carrying character. We have to feel this as real through Erik.The movie has also holes and the side scenes and stories do not add much to the thread but raise more questions. From underdeveloped characters to shallow in passing add ons we often miss the point and the value added to the threaded theme. OK we get the idea that Erik has an unstable love life and fall for phone based dating and hook ups. But take the character of Igor for example. Who is he? Do they have a relation? Does he present a better alternative for Erik? This is so brief that the intent is unclear. And what about Erik's BFF? They often travel together but at no point in time are we sure of the nature of their relation  why the friendship and dependence? The confidence? How instrumental is she to his life's story? We are left in our unanswered thoughts.The performance of the main actor Dane Thure Lindhardt Erik is one to remember for a movie which is not very deep and at times treated with flaws omissions and unexplained or unclear characters. The whole atmosphere succeeds to give you a sense of sadness and disconnect but comes short to an in depth drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm convinced that this is a very sincere production but it left me rather depressed and unsatisfied. It's the story of two lovers who are followed through a period of like 10 years. Erik is a bit of a sullen and insecure filmmaker who works with financial support of his father forever on one project Paul a more world wise and intelligent lawyer who gets hooked on all kinds of drugs. While Paul slowly but deliberately glides away from his lover into his own drugsfilled universe Erik desperately tries to hold on to what he sees as the love of his life. We see them love and bicker parting and coming together again and endlessly talking to save the remains of their relationship until finally and understandably Erik givesup. The end. Both actors Thure Lindhardt as Erik and Zachary Booth as Paul do a fine job and are convincing enough. And the script may not give us an optimistic point of view but it's authentic and painfully realistic. My biggest problem though was that I couldn't feel sympathy for either of both men. Paul is aloof egotistical and doesn't seem to have any empathy of course you know that his personality is marred by the abuse but still you want to smack him for treating Erik so bad. On the other hand Erik is extremely passive and lets Paul walk all over him again and again. One important scene illustrates this poignantly Paul who had disappeared for yet another long period suddenly calls Erik up and invites him to a hotel room where he heavily influenced by drugs receives him but at the same time has an escort come over and has sex with this guy with Erik sitting miserably next to the bed. It didn't help at least not me that both men aren't really good looking which all the more made me wonder what they saw in each other to begin with anyway. To sum it up definitely good performances but a depressing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "This superlative film from Finland shows better than most how to tell a story with few words. The director Klaus Haro definitely shows the same skill with visual storytelling as that consummate master Nuri Bilge Ceylan famous most recently for Once Upon a Time in Anatolia 2011.The plot is simple a youngish woman Leila Kaarina Hazard is released from a life sentence in prison to take up a job as a personal assistant to a blind priest Pastor Jacob Heikki Nousiainen out in the boondocks. Leila settles in reading the pastor's letters from supplicants and writing necessary replies. Leila is not happy though she resists Jacob's attempts at friendship she avoids helping in other matters she remains aloof uncaring unsatisfied. Until one day she notices that the postman fails to bring more letters for Jacob and Leila discovers that things are never quite what they seem to be.The underlying story is complex lyrical philosophical and ultimately heartwarming without being sentimental. The acting is simply perfect for the context Kaarina Hazard with a large bone structure deep frowning face and brusque manner is every bit the excon and depressive personality  but why was she serving a life sentence? Why was she released? And why was she sent to the pastor of all places?As the pastor Heikki Nousiainen is equally adept at portraying a gentle sage near life's end supremely faithful to his god forever upbeat and friendly always with a gentle word for all even for those who despise him as Leila seems to do at first. Dialog is sparse. Often all that is needed is a quick look a glance a sigh a slight groan of disquiet as the two get to know each other and while the days meld into a seamless almost timeless stasis with the gorgeous Finnish forests. Some comic relief is provided by the wary attitude of the postman towards Leila as he brings the letters for Pastor Jacob.The sound track  mostly piano  is muted and fits the overall mood. We see the wind in the forest and hear the river water. But more than that we hear the silence particularly when the two sit contemplating each other and their inner selves. The rain falls the water drips through the ceiling into pots or buckets and life must go on. Even for the Leila's of the world...It's a credit to the script writer and director that I was never squirming in my seat eager for something to happen. In fact that never impinged upon my involvement with the unfolding story so that's perfect pacing for me. My only criticism though is that story lacks true believability it's possible yes but highly improbable in real life.No story is ever perfect however. This one though comes close by promising nothing up front and then with a denouement that arrives like a meteor it rips away any comfortable sangfroid to show us that if you're prepared to dig deep within you will indeed find promises to keep.Highly recommended for all adults young and old. Eight out of ten for this effort no question.February 28 2013".

	schema:headline " Not as good as it could have been";
	schema:reviewBody "As far as Finnish drama goes this is pretty typical though it has a visual style that's far more cultivated and deliberate than is normal. The film is full of details and carefully thought out use of lighting and sound. Atmospherically this is a very nice film and I managed to fully immerse myself into the world of it.So what went wrong? In short the story which should have been a bit longer. The basic idea is nothing special. A prisoner has served her time and is thus released on the condition that she goes to serve an elderly priest that needs her help answering his mail. Okay so this is spiritual guest about finding the lost soul of this poor woman I thought. And unfortunately that's pretty much all it is. And don't get me wrong that alone could have made for a great film if handled correctly. But it seemed almost as if the film makers were in a hurry to finish the story before it had had the proper time to unfold. You get the proper three act structure but nothing more. I didn't feel like I had enough time to get to know these characters. We got the introductory scenes where their basic characteristics were established and almost immediately after that the film just ends. We get the emotionally cathartic ending alright but it means nothing if we haven't managed to identify with these characters and we cannot do that if we are not given the time to do so.So yeah the movie could have used a few extra scenes. Not too many mind you but at least a few. Now the mood feels like a whiplash going from one end of the spectrum to another with almost no scenes in between. There is one or two but I could have used a third or fourth.Aside from that major gripe the film is rock solid. Both of the main actors are really talented and Father Jaakob Heikki Nousiainen especially just oozes the elderly charisma of someone who has seen it all and come out on the other side as a better man. Furthermore the scenery is good the dialogues are interesting and the whole premise has promise. It's just that I'm far more used to movies that take their time to tell the story so for me this felt more than little jarring. Perhaps it's just perfect for someone who has had a bit more experience with Finnish films which are generally shorter than most Hollywood productions.".

	onyx:emotionText "As far as Finnish drama goes this is pretty typical though it has a visual style that's far more cultivated and deliberate than is normal. The film is full of details and carefully thought out use of lighting and sound. Atmospherically this is a very nice film and I managed to fully immerse myself into the world of it.So what went wrong? In short the story which should have been a bit longer. The basic idea is nothing special. A prisoner has served her time and is thus released on the condition that she goes to serve an elderly priest that needs her help answering his mail. Okay so this is spiritual guest about finding the lost soul of this poor woman I thought. And unfortunately that's pretty much all it is. And don't get me wrong that alone could have made for a great film if handled correctly. But it seemed almost as if the film makers were in a hurry to finish the story before it had had the proper time to unfold. You get the proper three act structure but nothing more. I didn't feel like I had enough time to get to know these characters. We got the introductory scenes where their basic characteristics were established and almost immediately after that the film just ends. We get the emotionally cathartic ending alright but it means nothing if we haven't managed to identify with these characters and we cannot do that if we are not given the time to do so.So yeah the movie could have used a few extra scenes. Not too many mind you but at least a few. Now the mood feels like a whiplash going from one end of the spectrum to another with almost no scenes in between. There is one or two but I could have used a third or fourth.Aside from that major gripe the film is rock solid. Both of the main actors are really talented and Father Jaakob Heikki Nousiainen especially just oozes the elderly charisma of someone who has seen it all and come out on the other side as a better man.

But the greatest of these is love. The ending is surprising and moving. Brightness and darkness of light rain and cloud are effectively used in the impressive cinematography typical in North European movies. The high rate in IMDb is no question.However when I saw the movie I couldn't simply be moved to tears. There are many questions in this movie and I couldn't help thinking about them. In fact it makes you think too much. Let me take an example from the 'storyline' on IMDb Father Jacob spends his days answering the letters of the needy. Indeed letters come every day. But Father Jacob does not look like a famous pastor known over the country. His church is almost forgotten by the villagers. How come many letters come to the pastor from over the country asking his advice and prayer? There are many other points that made me think about. But I can't write here to avoid spoilers.

Like My Afternoons with Margueritte Letters to Father Jacob is one of these sweet pictures. But because it sneaks up on you be sure to pay attention and fight that urge to turn it offit's a terrific little film.The film begins in prison. Leila has been pardoned for her crime but she refuses to leave! It seems she has no where to go and is content to stay in prison. However an old blind priest named Father Jacob has requested that she be paroled to himas a housekeeper. She is not thrilled but has no other options and moves in with the guy. Her job is to do light housekeeping as well as read letters to him. Apparently he's received thousands of letters from people requesting his advice and prayers and that is his ministry. Leila seems pretty bored by this and even begins tossing many of the letters away and contemplates running. However she stays and then it happensthe film really goes right for the heart. I won't say moreit would spoil it. However suffice to say it was NOT predictable many questions are answered and you should have some Kleenex nearby. The bottom line is that this film is exceptionalgreat writing wonderful natural acting by folks who do not appear to be professional actors though they areespecially Heikki Nousiainen who has had many film appearances and the direction was just wonderful. If you don't mind a film without explosions superstars or glitz but just want a great film about people give this one a tryyou'll be glad you did!".

I am hardpressed to recall another Basil Rathbone performance other than his work as Sherlock Holmes to equal this one. Sure he chews the scenery unashamedly but that is a big part of what makes this movie fun. Add in the first rate supporting cast of Lon Chaney Jr. Akim Tamiroff Bela Lugosi and especially John Carradine and you have a veritable Who's Who of horror and film noir icons of the period. One must not forget the contributions of Tor Johnson and the lesser known actors filling out the cast. The best scare occurs when we first meet Lon Chaney as Mungo. The imaginative pointofview camera work focusing on Chaney's hands is very original and creative  especially for a lowbudget production such as this one. My favorite scene though occurs quite late in the movie when the surgical recoverees led by the always riveting although overthetop John Carradine make their escape.Sadly Bela Lugosi's character is mute and we are thus deprived of the exquisite pleasure of hearing his unique voice and diction. His character induces sympathy  even pity rather than horror. In my opinion this represents his best work from the declining days of his career. I must also single out Akim Tamiroff for the unctuous humor he provides as Rathbone's procurer of surgical subjects.I give high marks for creative use of obviously cheap sets and evocative camera work. This is a movie which should not be missed by serious fans of films of the 50's. This is an excellent reminder of how they used to make effective horror films without soaking the screen with blood.10 points out of 10.".

To promote the film makeup artist George Bau was commissioned to create lifesized wax replicas of many of the cast members which were later displayed in New York City to coincide with the picture's June 1956 release. For good measure Boris Karloff who was in town at the time is said to have posed with these wax sculptures in publicity photos to help give the film an extra push in the following year Boris would work with The Black Sleep's director Reginald LeBorg its production company BelAir and many of the same technical crew to make Voodoo Island an eerie zombie tale set on a tropical isle. Herbert Rudley who would later appear in The MothersInLaw TV series Patricia Blake aka Patricia Blair Phyllis Stanley Sally Yarnell George Sawaya Peter Gordon Claire Carleton John Sheffield Clive Morgan Louanna Gardner and the unbilled players who always add so much to the creating of a world in which a film is setone of whom is Howard W. Koch who helped produce the film! all join together with the aforementioned players in bringing a magical level of conviction to this tale of a scientist and the strange drug he tampers with which produces a deathlike trance to all who come under its influence. Dr. Max Andler is the Beverly Hills neuro surgeon who served as technical advisor during the brain surgery sequences. A wellproduced tale of terror directed by Reginald LeBorg who helmed such other favorite shockers as The Mummy's Ghost Diary of a Madman and the abovementioned Voodoo Island.

The film has it all rich performances both mimed and spoken evocative sets lighting and cinematography an involving story and detailed script mad science swirling mists dark London streets gaslight an old abbey complete with an oaken door with a medieval viewingwindow rumblings of thunder burning candles horsedrawn carriages elegant costumes and period 1872 England detail gigantic fireplaces with sliding panels shadowy corridors replete with ghostly knight's armory lurking in dark corners sinister music hidden torchlit chambers suggestive soundeffects subtly chilling props and special effects including clanking chains coffins syringes a musty skull and a pulsating brain! a moody mattepainting of a castle atop a hill overlooking a valley of gnarled windblown branches gruesome monster makeup and a stunning ensemble cast of  mystery and terror specialists that features Basil Rathbone Akim Tamiroff Lon Chaney Jr. John Carradine Bela Lugosi and Tor Johnson! To promote the film makeup artist George Bau was commissioned to create lifesized wax replicas of many of the cast members which were later displayed in New York City to coincide with the picture's June 1956 release. For good measure Boris Karloff who was in town at the time is said to have posed with these wax sculptures in publicity photos to help give the film an extra push in the following year Boris would work with The Black Sleep's director Reginald LeBorg its production company BelAir and many of the same technical crew to make Voodoo Island an eerie zombie tale set on a tropical isle. Herbert Rudley who would later appear in The MothersInLaw TV series Patricia Blake aka Patricia Blair Phyllis Stanley Sally Yarnell George Sawaya Peter Gordon Claire Carleton John Sheffield Clive Morgan Louanna Gardner and the unbilled players who always add so much to the creating of a world in which a film is setone of whom is Howard W. Koch who helped produce the film! all join together with the aforementioned players in bringing a magical level of conviction to this tale of a scientist and the strange drug he tampers with which produces a deathlike trance to all who come under its influence. Dr. Max Andler is the Beverly Hills neuro surgeon who served as technical advisor during the brain surgery sequences. A wellproduced tale of terror directed by Reginald LeBorg who helmed such other favorite shockers as The Mummy's Ghost Diary of a Madman and the abovementioned Voodoo Island. Curl up on a rainy night and enjoy The Black Sleep!";

	schema:reviewBody "While Plan 9 from Outer Space is often considered to be Bela Lugosi's last film considering that movie consisted of test scenes meant for a different movie the actual final picture of which Lugosi actively participated in should actually be this one. He plays a mute butler who doesn't really do much but still has somewhat of a presence and is nothing to be ashamed about. He is joined here by fellow horror stalwarts John Carradine gloriously hammy here Lon Chaney Jr. and fellow Ed Wooddirected series castmate Tor Johnson. The star is Basil Rathbone as a mad doctor who performs brain surgeries because of a secret I don't want to reveal here. Herbert Rudley is his reluctant assistant and Patricia Blair or Blake as she's credited here is the daughter of Chaney who plays another mute who was once a functioning human being. There's also an amusing performance by Akim Tamiroff as another associate of Rathbone's. Other cast members worth noting Phyllis Stanley as Rathbone's nurse Sally Yarnell as another of the underground patients Claire Carleton as a customer of Tamiroff's and John Sheffield as a Scotland Yard detective investigating the whole thing. I thought this was a very effective chiller that was underrated considering the cast. So on that note I'm recommending The Black Sleep.".

But then old Basil was always way over the top. Herbert Rudley is the nominal hero  the good scientist who is rescued from the gallows by Rathbone.In the supporting cast are many seasoned veterans. Akim Tamiroff is good as the procurer of Rathbone's subjects. Playing various mutants are Lon Chaney Jr. John Carradine in yet another over the top performance and poor old Bela Lugosi.Lugosi nearing the end of his life looks sick tired and underweight. Chaney is totally wasted. Had the producers beefed up his part The Black Sleep could have been a much better picture. They could have combined his role with that of the Rudley character for example.Given all of its limitations The Black Sleep is good way to pass an hour and twenty minutes if you don't expect too much going in.".

	schema:reviewBody "From what I've heard about this one I expected an Ed Wood style farce. What I got was a surprisingly literate and wellacted classic horror. The flaws are definitely present but this flick has some genuinely chilling moments and boasts 3 outstanding performances.Dr. Cadman the mad scientist behind this whole house of horrors is superbly played by Basil Rathbone. This was probably the last good horror role Basil had. He portrays Cadman as a supremely selfconfident and utterly controlled man who has willingly tossed aside all ethics and morality in pursuit of his goal. Rathbone's command of dialog and smooth diction brings this human monster to life. And yet in the scenes with his paralyzed wife we feel some of the love and devotion that underlies his horrific crimes.Cadman's partner in crime is the sly Udo the Gypsy wonderfully brought to life by Akim Tamiroff. What a great character actor this guy was! His every facial expression and physical movement conveys what a greasy unprincipled character Udo is. And yet his quick wit makes him roguish and likable in a way. It would be a mistake to consider Udo just a humorous characterthough. The scene where he easily disposes of a prospective subject for Dr. Cadman to save his own hide is chilling. Great bit of character acting from Tamiroff!The hero of the piece is Dr. Ramsay whom Cadman has saved from the gallows to aid in his illicit research. Ramsay is played by Herbert Rudley who I have not seen in any other roles. Rudley fits the part perfectly and more than holds his own in his scenes with Rathbone. I like the way he carefully tries to weigh all sides of the argument against Dr. Cadman before finally takes action against him. Rudley's revulsion against the crimes of Cadman seems heartfelt and authentic.Those three strong performances anchor the movie but not all cast members are so fortunate. A sickly looking Bela Lugosi is wasted completely as the mute butler Casimir. This was Bela's last official movie role not counting the stock footage that appeared in Ed Wood's Plan Nine From Outer Space which is a shame. His acting ability and speaking voice is wasted on a part that could have been done by any bit player. Lon Chaney Jr. comes across somewhat better as the moronic Mongo because of his physical size and truly crazed look but he still deserved better. Mongo was originally a cultured professor and associate of Dr. Cadman until Cadman botched an operation on him. It might have been better to have Mongo as a JekyllHyde character that veered between the man of science and the maniacal killer...more pathos that way and a better test of Chaney's acting.A couple of scenes here are still capable of making the viewer queasy. The open brain surgery scene on the hapless sailor had to be shocking at the time...complete with fluid leaking from the brain. And the tour of Cadman's dungeon is right out of a carnival haunted house. John Carradine is crazed and over the top are the crusader Bohemund but he's in good shape compared to his cellmates the shrieking laughing female with tufts of hair sprouting all over her body the luckless sailor whose face has melted into slag and hulking Tor Johnson made blind and voiceless by Cadman's experiments. This is a nutty crew of mutants indeed and when they finally appear The Black Sleep turns from a literate thriller of medical horrors into a sleazy spookhouse romp. Kill kill kill! yells Carradine crazily and kill he does bringing a visceral end to the movie.If you don't require Dr. Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia in every film The Black Sleep should keep you awake for a while!".

Cadman revives Ramsay and has him help with his operations mapping the centers of the brain. Of course Cadman is mad his desire to help his wife who is in a coma has reduced him to using means that are less than savory. Tension mounts as Ramsay's good nature clashes with Cadman and the weird things that are going on in the house.Somehow this little gem slipped under my radar and it wasn't until recently that I even knew this movie existed. With a cast that would be the delight of any classic horror movie fan Basil Rathbone Bela LugosiLon Chaney John Carradine Tor Johnson Akim Tamiroff this is a one of those movies that they don't make any more. This is an odd mix of what you think of as classic horror and modern graphic visuals with a moody castle passageways and graphic brain operations and disfigured monsters. It walks that fine line of being link between the Universal style horror films of the 30's and 40's and the drive in monster fare of the 50's and 60's it feels like a black and white version of the Hammer Frankenstein films or something like Blood of the Vampire . Its a great deal of fun and more than a tad creepy and tense since you really can't be sure whats going to happen next. In its way its a classic of its kind.My only real complaint is that the casting of Lugosi Johnson and Carradine is a bit misleading since Lugosi only has a few scenes as a mute butler and Carradine and Johnson only show up in the final 15 minutes. They are really no more than cameos and don't deserve the high placement in the credits they receive.Definitely high on my recommend list to anyone who likes classic style horror. This is a movie to search out and enjoy late on a rainy Saturday night.".

Along for the ride are Akim Tamiroff in a very creepy roleand the most complex of the guest stars. As for Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi both have thankless nonspeaking roles and are rather wasted. And out of the blue John Carradine appears near the end of the film...and then overacts wildly. And along for the ride with him is Tor Johnsonof Ed Wood fame. I liked seeing all these guysI just wish the script had given them more to say and do. It's like a great opportunity somewhat squandered.The film is entertainingmostly because the plot is quite good and has a few nice twists. Unfortunately however there are also some moments with LOTS of cheesemost notably Carradine's bizarre performance. But the good well outweighs the bad and is fun.".

Along for the ride are Akim Tamiroff in a very creepy roleand the most complex of the guest stars. As for Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi both have thankless nonspeaking roles and are rather wasted. And out of the blue John Carradine appears near the end of the film...and then overacts wildly. And along for the ride with him is Tor Johnsonof Ed Wood fame. I liked seeing all these guysI just wish the script had given them more to say and do. It's like a great opportunity somewhat squandered.The film is entertainingmostly because the plot is quite good and has a few nice twists. Unfortunately however there are also some moments with LOTS of cheesemost notably Carradine's bizarre performance. But the good well outweighs the bad and is fun.";

That alone could probably make a pretty decent horror film  who is opposed to seeing brain dead lobotomy patients lumbering through a dungeon?But really this film could not have failed if it tried. Besides Rathbone it features Bela Lugosi Lon Chaney and John Carradine. They could have stood around and played hackey sack and I would still watch it.Paul Corupe makes an interesting observation about this film's role in history. He notes that on the surface Cadman is your typical 1930s mad scientist saying things like In the interests of science anything is justified. But underneath that he is a 1950s scientist a transitional figure who does experiments not just because he can but because he is trying to save a life  he is one of the very first mad scientists we can feel sorry for possibly. The only earlier example Corupe offers is from The Ape 1940.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Black Sleep 1956This is one of those campy horror movies two decades after the great originators that fans will really love and newbies or outsiders will have trouble getting.I'm mostly a fan but even as the titles rolled and I couldn't believe the great cast I was aware that this was 1956 that Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. were well past their prime. And the lead Basil Rathbone was playing an evil doctor a shade like Dr. Frankenstein pushing moral boundaries with his surgery was more known as Sherlock Holmes. Still along with John Carradine what a cast!And this is really Lugosi's last uncompromised appearance in any movie even though he plays a mute and we don't get to hear him. Plan 9 comes after this but Lugosi's role there is famously limited. He's terrific! And Chaney's appearance is also mute a brief each time and not such a big deal. Once there is nice corny subjective p.o.v. camera as he attacks his prey.The plot? The title? Well it's all a bit obvious what's happening though the opening twenty minutes is more a straight drama that actually suggests a really good movie is ahead. A man is on death row and Rathbone visits him and gives him the Black Sleep potion which puts him into a fake death and he is carted away and revived. That doesn't give too much away. For the rest of the movie the potion is really just used as anesthesia at the crazy doctor's castle and is no big deal.There is the pretty girl in a coma a misunderstood nursing assistant who is daughter of the Chaney character another nurse who is oddly cold and efficient and not a Nazithis is all 1872 and then there is the main character the man from death row who happens to be a crack surgeon that the evil doctor needs for his research.For the middle half of the movie you see minor tensions and some brain surgery that is meant to seem cutting edge and unscrupulous. Then in a huge surprise almost as if the director woke up a bunch of old patients appear out of nowhere maybe they escaped their cells. And it's a bit of absolute mayhem with Carradine playing an angry Moses type and it's pretty crazy.Look I said too much perhaps but you should know this isn't a great movie. But it's great camp. It's silly it's filled with icons from the old days and it's not so badly made at all edited well and filmed better than you would think for this nadir of Hollywood productions. This is around the time of the new Castle low budget films and early Corman stuff but this one is clearly from the old school of 1930s Hollywood. See it on those terms and like it!".

It doesn't help that Laurie turns out to be Munroe's daughter!!!. The clincher comes when Ramsay witnesses Cadman's callous experiment on a sailor's exposed brainAn amazingly graphic scene for this film's era then there's the implication that there have been past victims of the experiments and more to come as Cadman is ruthlessly devoted to his secret goal....Rathbone gives what is probably his best horror performance. His character is ABSOLUTELY a prototype for Peter Cushing  Whit Bisssel's portrayals of Baron Frankenstein but with a considerable depth of character as Cadman has a rather sympathetic goalhis wife is dying of a brain tumor.

As such I have known about this movie for decades from the occasional reference to it in those dear old monster magazines of the 1960's and 1970's. Now that I've finally seen it wow.The ensemble of noir horror film stars assembled for this feature is unparalleled. I got pretty excited just to see the lineup during the opening credits. And I'm happy to report that none of them are wasted each has a pretty cool character role to play and puts in a good sometimes great performance.After the tantalizing title credits the story gets underway quickly. The plot is taut and wellconceived but what really got to me was the vivid characterizations. In fact this film has given me a whole new clue about where those clever scriptwriter blokes at Britain's Hammer studios might have gotten their radical new concept of Dr. Frankenstein with his riveting mix of elegance obsession with his vision of what he's trying to do and ruthlessness of determination to not let anyone or anything stop him. The Black Sleep features Basil Rathbone in a role that clearly foreshadows Peter Cushing's Frankenstein. It strikes me as ironic because in 1939 Rathbone played Dr. Frankenstein in Son of Frankenstein but his characterization in that film was more consistent with the Universal Studios concept of the character as originated by Colin Clive. The unscrupulous manner in which a medical assistant is recruited by deception blackmail or whatever to the mad scientist's cause the sheer strength of will and personality dominance of the mad scientist the refined sense of style and taste that contrast so dramatically with the psychopathic lack of conscienceall this and more appears in Rathbone's character as it did for the first time the following year in Hammer's Frankenstein films. But The Black Sleep adds one extra motive and personality element we never saw in the Hammer Frankenstein films the mad doctor's anguish over his comatose love hidden away from prying eyes.Lon Chaney Jr. probably drew upon his previous portrayal of Lenny Of Mice and Men for the role he plays here. But after Basil Rathbone steals every scene it's John Carradine who steps up to challenge him for scene chewing. This is an actor who has been in so many horror films quite a few of them as undistinguished as can be too often wasting his talents. If you're a Carradine fan and have ever lamented this I'm pleased to prescribe The Black Sleep as the curehis part and acting in this film are mustsee. For my price of admission this film has the bestacted bestrealized roles ever played by Carradine and Rathbone both. Their greatest moments on screen may well be right here in this little underseen low budget masterpiece.This is a surprising unsung classic highly recommended for lovers of the old black and white horror films.".

To help him he brings back to life a criminal who has just been hanged for murder.  He uses a drug known as The Black Sleep to do these experiments with. Unfortunately the subjects he had experimented on earlier are now mutants and are released from their underground cellar and they kill Cadmund at the end.This movie is worth having in a collection just for the horror stars in it Basil Rathbone as Cadmund Bela Lugosi in one of his last films as a mute butler Lon Chaney Jr. also as a mute John Carradine as a mutant Akim Tamiroff and Tor Johnson Plan 9 From Outer Space.I found this movie great fun to watch.Rating 3 stars out of 5.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have just watched The Black Sleep for the first time and I found it rather enjoyable despite the low budget and reading several bad reviews about itA mad doctor Cadmund experiments on the brains of his subjects to help to remove a brain tumor which his wife is suffering from.  To help him he brings back to life a criminal who has just been hanged for murder.  He uses a drug known as The Black Sleep to do these experiments with. Unfortunately the subjects he had experimented on earlier are now mutants and are released from their underground cellar and they kill Cadmund at the end.This movie is worth having in a collection just for the horror stars in it Basil Rathbone as Cadmund Bela Lugosi in one of his last films as a mute butler Lon Chaney Jr. also as a mute John Carradine as a mutant Akim Tamiroff and Tor Johnson Plan 9 From Outer Space.I found this movie great fun to watch.Rating 3 stars out of 5.";

It's in BW there's a scary castle with dungeons and secret passages a mad scientist with a limping assistant a tortured hero desperately trying to save a beautiful girl Scotland Yard police body snatchers etc. Unfortunately it's just not made very well and lacks the punch of the earlier films.In his final role Bela Lugosi as a mute turns in a virtual repeat of his character in BODY SNATCHER 1945. In fact the whole movie is a slightly more gruesome version of that same plot doctor who thinks he is above the law uses people for experiments because his work is more important than human life.What makes this movie fun is the parade of great horror stars including Lugosi Rathbone Lon Chaney Jr. and an ACTUAL parade consisting of John Carradine Tor Johnson and others. And of course we have a villain named Mungo were you watching this Mel Brooks? and a woman suspiciously like Frau Blucher. Les Baxter turns in another decent horror score replete with bass clarinets vibraphone and even a gong for emphasis. I give BLACK SLEEP four stars for lack of cinematic quality but if you're in a goofy mood you're certain to enjoy it.PS  Can any Sanskrit scholar verify that the opening title is actually a translation of the words Black Sleep?".

	schema:reviewBody "From the opening shot of the Tower of London labeled Newgate Prison to the Scotland Yard inspector who feels obligated to reintroduce himself every time he walks into a scene it is very hard to watch The Black Sleep with a straight face. Its main claims to fame are its large cast of horror veteransBasil Rathbone Bela Lugosi Lon Chaney Jr. John Carradine Tor Johnson and some say Akim Tamiroff who was really replacing Peter Lorreand the fact that this was Lugosi's last real film shot after his release from selfimposed drug rehab. Lugosi dodders quite a bit and looks unwell but he does what he can with his nonrole as a mute majordomo. Chaney meanwhile reprises his inarticulate murderous brute routine that he had perfected through such other films as The Black Castle and The Indestructible Man while Carradine goes completely into the stratosphere as an insane religious fanatic who looks like he just escaped from the Bastille. Johnson is well Johnson complete with the blind contact lenses he later wore in Ed Wood's epics. Rathbone as the mad doctor who turns humans into monsters for love is adequate only really snapping into life in his scenes opposite Tamiroff but the real lead of the film in just about every scene is the miscast Herbert Rudley as Rathbone's assistant and the film's hero. In addition to being too old for the role of a medical student Rudley was a very unsubtle actor who telegraphed every thought to the balcony...all right for comedy but not so good here. He Rathbone and Carradine would all fare much better that same year in The Court Jester. An even bigger villain than Rathbone's character though is the script by John C. Higgins which must have been 300 pages long to include all the talk talk talk talk. Every second on screen is talkedtodeath and every plot point overexplained which serves to make the film seem much longer than it is. Reginald LeBorg's direction accomplishes nothing but to record the endless dialogue though he does manage to get in one trademark dreammontage sequence reminiscent of some of his 1940s work at Universal. Despite the low budget the castle sets are quite impressive but all that means is that seeing this cast against those sets makes watching a set of still photos of The Black Sleep as satisfying if not more so as sitting through the movie.".

We have BASIL RATHBONE BELA LUGOSI TOR JOHNSON LON CHANEY JR and JOHN CARRADINE noirish camera work a bizarre and delicious script what has to be an influence also on the REANIMATOR series. Tor and Chaney also go mano y mano! We even have one of Dr. Cadman's monsters in a youthful skinheaded sailor with the stitched up Frankensteinian flat head and protruding forebrow long before David PROWSE wore the skinwig in HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN.

Looks like THE BLACK SLEEP has all the ingredients for a creepy eerie fright house chiller with firelit Gothic stone interiors and darkened hallways winding staircases and ghosts. Try not to get too involved with all the crazy plot holes and dialog.

For its time the graphic nature of the brain surgery scene especially the one on the sailor played by George Sawaya left nothing to the imagination. You can actually see Rathbone performing surgery on Sawaya's dummy head like they do on NipTuck and other medical shows and what's supposed to be CSF fluid drains from the area. No blood just a watery substance that literally oozes from the tissue as it's handled. It's nasty folks and you feel every single cut twist squeeze and probe that the scene offers. You will definitely squirm in your seat! It's been said that Rathbone was directed by a reallife Hollywood neurosurgeon as to what to do in this scene. In Rathbone's website you can see the dummy head in one of the behindthescenes photographs. But enough of the grossout stuff.The horror comes at you from all sides and from all the characters  Tor Johnson with no eyeballs Deranged John Carradine with his very deranged plan of escape the female subject she just appears out of nowhere and her make up is very effective with what appeared to me to be half of a head Akim Tamiroff as the Igor to Dr. Cadman's Frankenstein and good old Lon Chaney Jr. at his usually twisted best as the one character for whom you really feel sorry for he played a lot of these didn't he? although he tries to beat the crap out of Tor Johnson and vice versa then you don't know who to feel sorry for because Tor's character was an innocent too.

No one in this has a good part except for Rathbone and Rudley. Still it's a good B movie of the kind that was so prominent in the '30s and '40s but had died out by this point. Too bad they couldn't get Boris Karloff though.";

Among them is a hirsute John Carradine. Don't be fooled despite his prominent billing his is little more than a cameo role. The same goes for the hulking Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson who doesn't show up for a long time. The reasonably likable Rudley does a decent job of carrying the story. He's a good man who claims to be innocent of a murder charge and there's no reason to doubt him. He's also the moral centre scoffing at the insanity perpetrated by Sir Joel. Mr. Rathbone is marvelous his performance does ultimately transcend the material. But performers like Carradine Lugosi and Chaney end up rather under utilized.Directed without much style by Reginald Le Borg Weird Woman Diary of a Madman but the score by the talented Les Baxter is definitely worth a listen.Six out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I often wonder Instead of receiving a salary were horror icons paid per word that they said in the old days or something? The amount of old 1930s '40s and '50s horror movies in which great actors appear and even receive top billing but hardly have any lines or dialogs is enormous. Particularly Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. were specialists in this although this probably had something to do with the fact that they were both very unreliable due to their alcoholismdrug addiction issues in the fall of their careers The very first screen is perhaps the best thing about The Black Sleep because that's the opening image that lists the names of Basil Rathbone Bela Lugosi Lon Chaney and John Carradine underneath each other. What an awesome lineup for a horror movie you'd think and we even get a little cherry on top of the cake when also the name of Tor Johnson appears on the second credits' screen! Yes the lineup is definitely incredible at first sight but I've rarely witnessed a bigger waste of talents. Basil Rathbone  history's greatest Sherlock Holmes  is the only one with a prominent role whereas the others merely just serve as set decoration. Lugosi is a mute butler again Chaney Jr is a madraving brute again and Carradine appears as a kind of wizard but I honestly don't understand who his character was and what his role added to the plot. Purely talking in terms of plotting The Black Sleep does form an interesting footnote in horror movie history as it somewhat builds a bridge between the oldfashioned mad scientists from the Universal era Victor Frankenstein and such and the more emotionally tormented mad scientists from the 1960s and onwards. The former group contains merely just megalomaniac geniuses whereas the latter group is driven by severe personal problems usually to cure their terminally ill wives or to save their daughters that got horribly deformed in accidents. The classic French masterpiece Les Yeux Sans Visage 1959 was officially the first and most famous of the 'tormented scientist' flicks but perhaps The Black Sleep was really the first one. Physician Joel Cadman Rathbone is looking for a cure for his wife's brain tumor and therefore conducts unorthodox experiments in a remote old castle primarily experiments that teach him how the human brain is mapped and structured. He uses an oriental drug nicknamed black sleep that puts the patient in a deathlike coma and subsequently cuts open their skull to explore the brain functions. Unfortunately things usually go awry during this process and therefore the castle is full of failed experimental subjects. The Black Sleep benefices from the professional direction by Reginald LeBorg and strong performance of Basil Rathbone but the screenplay is often boring and there disappointingly aren't any real Grand Guignol highlights. As stated already the phenomenal cast is underused and it's a bit sad that Lugosi's very last role is such a pitiable one.".

As she gets closer to her bed she is Drag under the bed!At this point you may be thinking wait have we not see this before?Next scene we see students in Collage having their lunch and Sarah is worried that her friend not answering her phone! Later when Sarah goes to the dorm and then Aurdery who was sucked under the bed is still alive she tells Sarah that the Boogeyman who killed her dad and now it's after her! Of course no one believes her! Not even her best friend who is a part of Radio show! Later that night when Sarah is on a Radio show Aurdery call up and saying someone going kill me I can't hide he is everywhere Meanwhile Sarah rushing to help her friend While she is talking to other man on radio show and he tells her that her dad was killed by man who pretend to be the boogeyman!At that moment in the dorm the lights go out and boogeyman is next to Aurdery it grabs her and you still hear her choking on the radio show and then Sarah walk into the room to see Aurdery being killed by the Boogeyman and the Boogeyman also see her and Sarah could see the evil in its eyes she quickly goes back to hall and tells her other friend it killed her has he looked into the room now it looks like she hung herself but Sarah know what really happened.At this point of course she knows no one will believe her if she tells anyone! So she keeps it too herself until she start having visionDreams of thing that going to happen to her friends or have already happened to her friends and th4 whole Dorm will be killed by the Boogeyman ! When her friends start going missing she knows everything see saw in her visionDream is coming true! She has to warn everyone before it 's too late! There is small twist near end of movie but some migh say it not even twist at all! And This movie will also tell you why all 3 movie are different! Which I think was really good ideaI really enjoyed watching this movie there was some very good creepy scenes in this movie like JuonThe Grudge scene For me anyway! Death scenes in this movie were really good but not as gory as boogeyman 2 however there some decent mount of gore in this movie! As the Boogeyman his self great make up affect was great loved the way it looked! The acting was really good for a Straight to DVD and an third movie in the series I put my hands up and confess that this movie did creepy me out just a little bit! The one thing I didn't like about this was the last ten seconds of movie Don't you just hate when you get those silly last scare scenes at the end of horror movies these days! Give this movie 78 out 10 still not sure what to give it!".

She has a nervous breakdown and goes to the Hammond Halls in the Wolfbridge University in Northern California to sleep in the dorm of her friend Sarah Morris Erin Cahill. Sarah is a student of psychology that feels guilty for the death of her mother and presents a show in the WZXB radio in the campus to give support to the audience with her professor Dr. Kane Matt Rippy. However Audrey is hanged by the boogeyman while Sarah glances at her and dies. Sarah reads the diary of Audrey's dad and discovers his theory that the boogeyman would be a physical manifestation of the innermost darkest fear of a person. Sarah believes on the illogical theory and tells to her boyfriend David Chuck Hittinger and their common friends Lukas WB Alexander Jeremy George Maguire Lindsay Mimi Michaels and Ben Elyes Gabel. As far as they also believe in the boogeyman the legend becomes stronger and reborns killing his victim. Boogeyman 3 has an interesting premise that the imaginary monster that is used to frighten children gets stronger when people believe that the entity does exist. There is one creepy sequence when Sarah sees the corridor of Hammond Halls covered of corpses and gore. However for a clever woman like Sarah it would be obvious that she was doing exactly what the boogeyman wanted generating panic and making the students believe on the evil force. Despite of the flaws this movie is not so bad and it is a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is six.Title Brazil O Pesadelo 3 The Nightmare 3".

From the ten Friday the 13th sequels which range from great to insultingly bad to the thirteen with more coming Witchcraft films all of which are awful no matter how unnecessary a sequel seems you can always fit one in. These days it seems even worse. Even seemingly unknown films are getting countless sequels. Now I can understand the annual Saw installment. They're perfect Hollywood moneymakers Lots of earnings with minimal risks. But Boogeyman? Does this really need two sequels? The first one was bad enough yet still somehow managed to earn more than double its budget at the box office and the second was pretty bad as well. . . so why a third? Well they've got that 28 million they earned at the box office burning a hole in their pocket and instead of using it on something worthwhile why not throw a couple million at what they assume is a builtin audience. Is there a builtin audience? Would I count as a part of that simply because I've seen both? I sure hope not. Regardless before watching I had actually heard some notsobad things about this installment so I thought I'd return to the subpar franchise once more. This is the last time though I swear! Anyway. . . the film itself is pretty bad. Most notably the amateurish acting and script make for a dull and unlikable movie. The direction seems very TV movie and the editing is awful exchanging MTVstyle jump cuts for real scares. As a whole the film stands as a typically underwhelming unscary and poorly made lowbudget horror that should be avoided by anyone other than the truest of fans of the first two Boogeymans then again if you like both of those I don't know what you WON'T like.Obligatory Horror ElementsSubgenre Demonic I guess? Or ghost or something.ViolenceGore There's a good bit of blood but none of the violence is really explicit enough to make it worth it.SexNudity A teensy bit of the homely girl at the beginning but nothing too sexy.ScaresSuspense A for effort but flashcuts aren't really all that scary.

So when I heard there was yet another sequel my doubts of course were raised and I almost condoned the movie right away as being even worse.However after reading about it and seeing some pics on the net and watching the trailer I decided to give it a go.First off for anyone disappointed by the second movie for the fact that it wasn't actually the boogeyman you will be very happy for it is indeed him in this one not someone just dressing up like him. He vanishes appears out of thin air has a 'hidden' world where he keeps his victims which is quite bloody and has a wonderful creepy score to it when it shows up in the film and knowing before going into the movie that it is indeed the boogeyman makes it all that much better and ruins nothing of the movie trust me.There is a bit of a twist before the ending something I haven't seen a movie do in a long time the twist not the fact they do a twist The deaths in this are not as intense as the second one yes they're bloody as all hell especially the laundry room one but they're not revolting a la maggots crawling under the skin or vomit being pumped into a victim. And I think that makes the movie work better actually.There are side dialects in this such as the main character having been some kind of nut job in the previous year and they never fully explain any of these side dialects so character development is definitely not a strong point in this movie. In fact the only real character that's developed overly well is the first one to die who is also used as a the poor connection between the second and third movie here.Overall there are some jumpy parts the boogeyman looks pretty damn creepy in his own regard there's a lot of blood some pointless nudity and some neat effects. And the movie is indeed entertaining I actually watched the whole movie in one sitting without wanting to get up and do something else.".

Part 1 was a total mess of a film that had no real focus. Part 2 was a very gory but somewhat boring slasher that had no real story to it. Part 3 is the strongest of the bunch and i don't mean that as a backhanded compliment. This film actually gets a lot right but also a few things wrong.Lets get the bad out of the way. The characters in this film are not very well written. They are not given time to develop and because of that they fall into the cookie cutter college students. Now with a movie called Boogeyman 3 one isn't really expecting great characters but to be honest if they had been given a little more depth it probably would have pushed this movie from being a fun haunted house flick into a hidden straight to video gem.Also the characters are not very smart. Actually they are very dumb. They hear a noise and instead of running the other way they investigate it. Do you know how many characters willingly walk into closets or dark rooms? Yeah... not the brightest kids.The third negative is a few of the effects. This one is actually pretty minor. Most of the gore and blood is practical but when the digital effects pop up they stick out like a sore thumb. Luckily they are few and far between. Most of the effects are done on camera.So with the bad out of the way lets get to the good.This film is entertaining it keeps a nice balance between blood and gore and being a haunted house or in this case dorm film. It has entertaining kills and a few decent jump scares. The Boogeyman costume is a little weak but it is kept in the shadows enough where it doesn't stand out.The film is also very well made. This director knew what he was doing and created a very nice look with the film. The pace moves quickly and the story is very clear with a strong ending. Actually character stupidity aside this movie probably has the best script out of all three. The story is fully developed and has a clear reason for why things are happening.This film wisely drops the practical explanation from the second film and returns to the supernatural roots of the first film but avoids all the child psychology that the first film seemed to hold on to. Instead we have a clear cut reason for the Boogeyman's actions and it makes the world of difference.Over all I went into this film with the lowest of expectations. The first film was watchable the second film was a total bore but this film surprised me. It kept me interested and entertained through out and at no point did I feel cheated by the pay off. Don't expect the next great horror film but just be ready for a decent movie that hearkens back to the 80's slasher and monster films.".

The first was moderately successful so they make two DTV sequels. Out of good conscience I cannot give this a recommendation.3 10";

And it seemed that you didn't really need to have watched the first two movies to be in the loop.Boogeyman 3 is not rich on shocks creepy moments or scares though I have a decent enough amount of gore in it. I found this to be a rather dull movie for a horror movie. I wasn't thoroughly entertained and I sure wasn't feeling any sense of dread.The story told in this movie well it was a bit weak and there were some gaps in the overall flow of the story. But it did manage to pull through and close up nicely enough.Not being familiar with the boogeyman from the previous two movies I found the make up to actually be quite nice. He looked sinister enough especially the face. However and I must point this out the noises he made what was up with that? They were more of a hilarious thing than a scary thing. That really didn't work well for the movie. And why would he be chasing people when he can apparently just appear from any shadow or dark place? What was the point of chasing the tail of people? For shocking and scaring the people sure. But if you think about it it really made no sense.The effects and CGIs in Boogeyman 3 were good enough and I liked what I saw. The blood however was a tad too red. But other than that good enough job.As for the acting and the people starring in this movie. I found most people to actually do a good enough job with their roles. Nothing awardwinning here but still good for a horror movie of this caliber.If the Boogeyman series is an attempt at a slasher like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger then it is not much of a memorable character they have as the killer. There is nothing iconic about this boogeyman sorry to say.For a horror movie Boogeyman 3 came off quite weak and there are lots of other horror movies out there far better. Now that I have seen it I can honestly say that I will not pick it up and watch it again. I will however watch part 1 and 2 just for the sake of having seen them.".

Audrey's father was apparently killed by the Boogeyman  now Audrey is frightened that the Boogeyman will kill her too as a rational sort of person Sarah tries to calm her down  assure Audrey that the Boogeyman does not exist. However Sarah sees the Boogeyman strangle Audrey as her predictions came true  soon believes her late friend as she tries to warn other's about the Boogeyman it feeds off people's fear of it  once you believe in the Boogeyman he can pop up at any time  kill you. The more people Sarah tells the more people die...Directed by Gary Jones this is the third entry in the Boogeyman franchise  while I definitely know I have seen the previous two I can't really remember that much about them other than Boogeyman 2 2007 was surprisingly good here Boogeyman 3 isn't anything that special but at the same time I suppose it's alright. First thing to say is that Boogeyman 3 is a teen slasher set on a University campus so in that regard it's not going to win any awards for originality  any self respecting horror fan will probably have seen dozens of similarly themed films as some killer bumps off the students as one final girl is left to run around a bit at the end. To be fair to it Boogeyman 3 isn't too bad of it's type the central character of Sarah is given more depth than one might expect with decent amounts of background although her mates  potential victims are strictly walking clichs. The killer here is a sort of Freddy Krueger type who has supernatural powers although some of the killings don't make sense as why were the first two victims bodies never found yet that girl shoved in the washing machine was? Where did the bodies go? Were they in some sort of alternate reality that Sarah visited in her dreams? Or was Sarah just dreaming  nothing else? The idea of seeing into the future the corridor full of bodies is mentioned but nothing much becomes of it  again it's only used in one part rather than as a consistent theme. The notion that legends fuel themselves  the ideas behind are briefly explored but again not much comes of it. I also want to know why Sarah left that jug in the sink  left the tap running I guess she doesn't have to pay the bill.Although not directly following on the event's of Boogeyman 2 are mentioned  it was Audrey's father that was killed in the previous film. There's a fair amount of blood splatter but not much graphical gore a dead body with it's front cut open is about as gory as it gets. The film constantly uses that same old horror film tricks of false scares lights going off suddenly  doors opening by themselves you know the sort of thing. Although a bit annoying at times at least the makers try. Even though there's a scene set inside a girls changing rooms only one pair of breasts are seen disappointing.Although set in Northern California this was filmed in Sofia in Bulgaria like so many straight to video offerings are these days. The film is well made for sure with decent production values  special effects. The acting is alright  leading lady Erin Cahill is very attractive here.Boogeyman 3 is an alright time waster an attractive leading lady who has decent material to work with helps but a few unexplored  underdeveloped ideas means this had the potential to be better than it is. Not bad but not exactly great either worth a watch.".

The film starts with a hysterical girl who stays at a friend's room. Like the beginning of SUSPIRIA the hysterical girl is terrified of everything around her feels she's being pursued and eventually is confronted by a malefic being. The entire scene was so reminiscent of SUSPIRIA minus the style of course that I was having a severe case of deja vu. But as it went along the tormented girl is attacked by the boogeyman while talking on a live radio show with her cell phone which is identical to the plot point in Tobe Hooper's underrated Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2. And this was just the setup at the beginning so it was downhill after that as it followed the very familiar horror template set up by A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. The entire film was terrible. Clichd to the nth degree the few male actors are dispatched quickly and then the rest of the film is spent on tormenting the bad actresses huh the female characters for our viewing pleasure. The girls are often in state of undress and such juvenile moments that will get 12 year olds excited. The film even ends with two anonymous girls stripping down to their underwear in their dorm room before the silly looking boogeyman makes a predictable appearance.No style no shocks no suspense no originality no logic. There's even a horror scene which takes place in the laundromat room which we've have seen a million times in films like PULSE. With films like this the horror genre is all but dead.".

I just don't know what it is trying to do and be exactly and the series as a whole is one you can easily do without even if you really are into horror stuff.Thing with the whole series is that it's trying to be horror but at the same time also serious movies with drama in it. The results are a whole bunch of slow moving and not that very interesting movies that besides also hardly do anything new or original. They fail at being good movies and they just don't work out the way they were supposed to. They were persistent though since this is actually the third movie out of the series. Seems that it also is the last one out of the series though fortunately.Seems that this movie was a tiny bit trying to be more like a common modern horrorslasher. It just isn't being a very good one though. As earlier mentioned the movie is just moving too slow and is not being very interesting with its story or any of its characters. It also does a poor and lazy job with its story really. It doesn't ever explain anything though I admit that this movie still did a better job at it than any of the previous movies out of the series. But still it's mostly relying on all of the events that happened in the previous movies and does very little to try and delve deeper into things and search for a clear explanation for all of it. It's actually funny how all of the movies are heading into a totally different direction with their stories and as a series the 3 movies just aren't being connected very well or convincingly to each other.At times the gore and some of its other horror elements were still OK but overall it's being nothing too exciting or surprising.And I was about to rate this movie just as 'highly' as its two predecessors but then came its moronic ending which was something totally unconvincing and just did not worked out very well.Just really not worth watching.410 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Sometimes it will suddenly appear and then disappear sometimes it will creep up behind someone and then disappear occasionally it will grab them pulling them into the shadows only to let them go and sometimes it will kill them. What tactic the creature uses depends entirely on whether director Gary Jones intends to make the viewer jump creep them out or shock them although nine time out of ten he achieves none of these his cheap scare tactics and excess of CG effects rarely having the desired effect.Furthermore the film fails to stick to its mythos supposedly if you fear the boogeyman it has more power over you and yet several of its victims are those who do not believe that the creature exists. None of this makes any sense and proves extremely irritating.210 just for the eye candy especially Nikki Sanderson as Audrey who provides the film's only nudity early on and the two cuties at the end who lounge around together in their underwear as most men like to think all college girls do.".

	schema:reviewBody "You want Armageddon? An Apocalyptic threat? This gives you the unscientificallypegged Satan Bug a virus so lethal it can kill everyone in California in a few hours the U.S. in a week and the world...oh a couple of months. Towards the end of this movie the one who makes this pronouncement takes a step back and admits it's unclear if this virus can actually be so effective life tends to survive as we all know but let's not test it shall we? I wonder if this film influenced Stephen King's The Stand the novel and the miniseries. The chilling scenario first described manages to up the ante from the generallyregarded worst threat of nuclear annihilation. An atomic bomb destructive as it is is still limited to a certain area this bug  you open the flask it's all over baby for the entire planet. The allusions to the 'Pandora's Box' fable are quite obvious similar to those in Kiss Me Deadly from 10 years earlier.The threat surfaces at one of those government installations for biochemical warfare in the middle of the desert  a barren vast empty landscape. There's no such thing as perfect security but here they really bumbled it by letting two unpacked crates inside to make a long story short with the help of an insider certain flasks are removed from the property. The government here also seems to have lapsed badly as far as background checks. There's an air of mystery to the story since we don't know who the master villain is and tension is ratcheted up on a regular basis when the bug may be released at certain points. I also like the use of the desert locations where much of this takes place the very sparse layout of an occasional building lends an almost alienlike atmosphere to the terrain.There are some contrivances to the story which make you shrug afterward. For example the hero Maharis and two government agents including Star Trek's Jimmy Doohan in a small nonspeaking role are captured at a key point it's obvious they are to be killed by the villains. Instead of simply shooting them as would be proper in the isolated location the villains go through this elaborate method of using a flask of a deadly bug. But it's an exciting sequence and sets it up for the most intense moment of the film when any or all of the 3 may die in the next few seconds from exposure. The main villain's motivations are also hard to buy into. He seems to be doing this as a protest against biochemical weapons but is willing to wipe out cities to make his point. He's dismissed as a paranoid delusional a maniac at one point but never comes across that way as if he has an alternate plan. This storyline is similar to a James Bond adventure and most viewers will strain to keep track of all the character names. Later films with similar threats were The Andromeda Strain Warning Sign and Outbreak.".

Instead of simply shooting them as would be proper in the isolated location the villains go through this elaborate method of using a flask of a deadly bug. But it's an exciting sequence and sets it up for the most intense moment of the film when any or all of the 3 may die in the next few seconds from exposure. The main villain's motivations are also hard to buy into. He seems to be doing this as a protest against biochemical weapons but is willing to wipe out cities to make his point. He's dismissed as a paranoid delusional a maniac at one point but never comes across that way as if he has an alternate plan. This storyline is similar to a James Bond adventure and most viewers will strain to keep track of all the character names. Later films with similar threats were The Andromeda Strain Warning Sign and Outbreak.";

I have fond memories of Anne Francis as a kid and she still looks good to me. Maharis is cool and clever and Basehart actually does a solid job. The sad thing is that Dana Andrews who was a really firstclass talent in his younger days just walks through this picture fortunately he's not onscreen very much.

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched this film several times and never find it boring. That this film was not a hit at the time of release and was not able to make a movie star out of George Maharis shows that either the studio did not know how to market it at the time or that a movie even with all the right ingredients will not become a hit movie if people don't go and see it.I do see some problems with the screenplay however in that things see to happen in the film that just pop up from nowhere. A mans car getting stuck that we the audience are not entirely clued in on two agents just coming on the screen at a particular time what where the motivations for this to happen is not explained and a dead body that without the use of a DVD player or DVR that we can view the movie on Turner Classic Movies and look back on might make us wonder who this dead body is.The Maharis character is the most interesting of the lot he is a man who is at odds with his government throughout his life and he is a character in films ahead of his time. We didn't get to see people like this in movies before. He is a man who it is emphasized at the beginning of the film to be a rebel but knows the difference between wrong and right. When his country needs him as he shows in this film he will be there for the correct cause. His last line in this film is a telling one I'm paraphrasing it here but it goes something like this Will start over again. This film makes one ask the question how could any country sanction a sight that could create something so deadly and which might as we learn towards the end might destroy life on earth? At the same time while the film I think questions this it does at least give us some comfort that our government agencies fighting terror might be able to stop it as shown by agents beside Maharis as being capable of stopping mad men through their hard work.A great supporting cast helps the film as well Richard Basehart is outstanding and I just realized that Frank Sutton Sargent Carter of GOMER PYLE fame is one of the villains and what a different role it is.John Sturges in his direction shows a man who knew how to direct an action film and an entertaining one to boot. The film was also ahead of its time in warning us that we had more to fear than just a hydrogen bomb as that fear of the bomb I believe was coming to an end at the time. A flawed but entertaining film that still holds up some forty years latter.".

In this era of 100000000 budgets and overproduced actioncgi epics this film seems pretty tame. But I would argue that's what makes it more disturbing more realistic and more entertaining. Spoiler ?  The best moment in the film comes when Richard Basehart casually flips the glass vial containing the deadly virus that could kill all human life on earth into the air and just as casually catches it like it's nothing more than a baseball. Your heart is in your throat! This is more effective than some overelaborate spectacle because it is more real and more surprising when it comes.

I had expected it to be another simplistic view in the litany of 60s antiwar statement films but it is not that yet it makes the case for nondevelopment of biological weapons more clearly than any of those overthetop and jingoistic propaganda films do. And to make it all better it comes with a thrilling plot excellent cast and direction suspenseful music score. I would have rated it a 10 but for the unlikeliness of some major plot directions still they are handled in a manner that makes them possibilities if yet improbable.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite all its obvious flaws I've always really liked this film and having seen it again recently and having still enjoyed it I wondered why it still held its appeal.Yes the plot groans a bit for instance the Anne Francis character though wellplayed seems to serve no purpose  except as a poorly explained romantic interest the characters are one dimensional well it is a suspense film and you can always use your imagination and some of the motivation is a bit suspect but this film still generates a real tension and sense of terror. It's a wellimagined claustrophobic world of neurotic scientists a secret state disillusioned spooks and isolated topsecret labs. There are good performances especially Jon Anderson Ed Asner Frank Sutton Richard Basehart  despite dodgy Austrian accent  and George Maharis and a superb tense score by Jerry Goldsmith that keeps the fear and suspense palpable. The action too remains tight but downplayed it does move forward at a reasonable pace but the emphasis generally remains on the realistic and the prosaic. This lack of the spectacular may be more due to the small scale of the production but for me it fits perfectly to the claustrophobic style of the film and doesn't detract from the plausability of doomsdayvirusgoesmissing plot line this is key to why the films' appeal has remained strong  the story seems all too possible and hence frightening and it certainly is as possible today as it was 40 years ago.There are two other stars of this film that deserve special mention. One is the desert  I think much of the the filming was done around Palm Springs in the Colorado Desert. It looks truly beautiful and otherworldly well if you're from London it does but also desolate and lonely. Its emptiness intensifies the sense of paranoia and isolation and serves as a subconscious reminder to the watcher of the apocalypse that the Satan Bug could unleash upon mankind... the other star is a small flask with a red seal that requires just 4 lbs of pressure to break it... if I had to compile a list of the scariest things in cinema I think I'd place that little flask pretty near the top.".

The entire cast of the film is minimal. Anne Francis is the ONLY woman you even see on screen for the whole picture.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a kind of doomsday thriller about a bug that will kill all life on earth developed by a group of scientists at a secret government station in the midst of the Mojave Desert. One of the scientists turns out to be a maniac who escapes with a supply of the stuff and threatens to destroy the world. Can he be stopped? It seems to have a lot going for it. Written by Alistair MacLean and James Clavell directed by John Sturgis a plot of considerable topical interest performances by a lot of respectable folks like Richard Basehart Dana Andrews Ann Francis Simon Oakland score by the perceptive Jerry Goldsmith beautiful locations.So why doesn't it work? Probably a combination of bad luck and budget. The bad luck was that practically everyone involved seemed to be taking the day off. This is known as sampling error in statistics. The low budget casts this effort indelibly in the configuration of a madeforTV movie. There's a lot of talk and little action or suspense. I don't mind talk per se. The Andromeda Strain was filled with it but it was necessary. Here it's unfocused and sometimes confusing. Actually I lost track of some of the vials at times. There are stray vials of the Satan bug of botulis and of botulis antitoxin. Or are there? I didn't mind the absence of lots of action either. Nothing was more dreary than the frenetic pace and elaborate effects of Doomsday. But Jeez it would be nice to be able to follow the plot. And to have more to the story than just a lot of guys standing around pointing guns at one another.It's also the writers' responsibility to see to it that characters are differentiated and they stumbled here. James Hong is distinctive because he's Chinese. But how about the rest? Look at their names Hoffman Barrett Williams Michaelson Cavanaugh Donald Tasserly Reagan Raskin Johnson Baxter Mason. What is this a fraternity reunion at some diploma factory for the WASP elite? Not a Greek or Ginzo among them. Two suspenseful and thrilling incidents. A flask of one of the toxins is discovered in the soft drink ice box at a baseball stadium and the detective who discovers it must hold still while another disarms the explosive device attached to it. Well this is already a clich. The reason we run into this situation so often in films is that it's a sure fire tension generator. It works every time. And yet here Sturgis gives it no more than perfunctory treatment. The formula calls for a close up of the fulminate of mercury the dreadful question of which wire to cut  the red or the white  and a close up of the sweating face of the poor slob who must stand motionless and hold the thing. But no. It's all done in medium shot with only a few cuts. The endangered actor looks concerned but not terrified as if worried about a loose tooth. And no one releases the tension at the end with a wisecrack. The writers either didn't have time to deal with this situation properly or weren't being paid enough and the director's mind must have been elsewhere.Second suspenseful incident. George Maharis a wooden actor from television is holding a gun on Richard Basehart who is holding one of the demonic flasks in his hand. Put the flask on the ground and step away from it Maharis orders him and Basehart simply smiles and flips the flask in the air catching it again. It's all over in a second and it's the best scene in the movie.The movie holds the interest but just barely.".

There are stray vials of the Satan bug of botulis and of botulis antitoxin. Or are there? I didn't mind the absence of lots of action either. Nothing was more dreary than the frenetic pace and elaborate effects of Doomsday. But Jeez it would be nice to be able to follow the plot. And to have more to the story than just a lot of guys standing around pointing guns at one another.It's also the writers' responsibility to see to it that characters are differentiated and they stumbled here. James Hong is distinctive because he's Chinese. But how about the rest? Look at their names Hoffman Barrett Williams Michaelson Cavanaugh Donald Tasserly Reagan Raskin Johnson Baxter Mason. What is this a fraternity reunion at some diploma factory for the WASP elite? Not a Greek or Ginzo among them. Two suspenseful and thrilling incidents. A flask of one of the toxins is discovered in the soft drink ice box at a baseball stadium and the detective who discovers it must hold still while another disarms the explosive device attached to it. Well this is already a clich. The reason we run into this situation so often in films is that it's a sure fire tension generator. It works every time. And yet here Sturgis gives it no more than perfunctory treatment. The formula calls for a close up of the fulminate of mercury the dreadful question of which wire to cut  the red or the white  and a close up of the sweating face of the poor slob who must stand motionless and hold the thing. But no. It's all done in medium shot with only a few cuts. The endangered actor looks concerned but not terrified as if worried about a loose tooth. And no one releases the tension at the end with a wisecrack. The writers either didn't have time to deal with this situation properly or weren't being paid enough and the director's mind must have been elsewhere.Second suspenseful incident. George Maharis a wooden actor from television is holding a gun on Richard Basehart who is holding one of the demonic flasks in his hand. Put the flask on the ground and step away from it Maharis orders him and Basehart simply smiles and flips the flask in the air catching it again. It's all over in a second and it's the best scene in the movie.The movie holds the interest but just barely.";

	schema:headline " Best 60s movie ever! Maclean you've done it again...";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to spy movies it's all just about the 007series. I've seen a lot of spy movies not only movies from the 60s but none so perfect and cool as the Satan Bug. It actually kicks all the Bondmovies' asses!I bought the DVD a couple of years ago cause I'm an Alistar Maclean fan and I just thought it would be something very typical Maclean and nothing else... I was very VERY wrong. After watching it I realized this is one of the best movies ever! The plot In the desert of Los Angeles lies a top secret laboratory called bas station 3. In this laboratory scientists are working on chemical weapons or more like massdestruction weapons. The projects are all led by professor Baxter and his assistant Dr Hoffman Richard Basehart. THey have just finished producing the most terrifying chemical weapon since the atomic bomb. It's a liquid which in a small quantity could wipe out all life on earth. They call the weapon simply The Satan Bug. The FBI keeps regularly an eye on this project through agent Reagan. But then one day what shouldn't happen actually happens while visiting the laboratory Reagan gets murdered and Baxter disappears mysteriously. FBI fears the worst and they call for their best agent on the field  Lee Barrett George Maharris. It starts with an ordinary murder investigation but it gets worse. They soon find out that the Satan Bug has disappeared from the lab and is held by terrorists  led by a mysterious person called Charles Reinhold Ainsley. Soon the first threat comes and then as a follow up the terrorists wipe out a Los Angeles suburb. They're demand is cease development of massdestructionweapons. Barett most together with his colleague and wife played by Ann Francis find the Satan Bug and the terrorists before another city wipes out. The movie is so very 1960s as well as it's not dated. The movie was ahead of its time when it comes to the plot a deadly virus stolen by some terrorists or as they say in the movie a Messiah to threat human life on earth. It reminds about much later movies like Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman and The Rock. The movie is based on the book with the same name written by the master of thriller and spyadventures no it's not Ian Flemming  Alistar Maclean! In the book it all takes place in England and the laboratory is in fact in Morton. But in the movie it's all set in Los Angeles instead. Unlike other movies this move works perfect!The film is directed by John Sturges and this I think is his best movie. He made a very good job here. Too bad it's almost forgotten today.The musical score is written by the legend Jerry Goldsmith and the theme is believe it or not quite scary actually. The beginning of the movie is very special and quite unusual for it's time I guess an animated video how the virus spreads in your body and kills every cell in you within a few seconds.The manuscript is good and te actors and actresses are fantastic! THey really make the movie scary and you don't feel like the movie is that old.The environment and the picture is just super. Every picture in this movie is a masterpiece!What is also very interesting about this movie is that the cast contains actorsactresses not so well known today. In mid 60s George Maharris was a so called teenidol and was a so called rebel from movies like Route 66. But he still needed his mayor breakthrough. Satan Bug was a try but I guess it unfortunately didn't bring him the fame he actually deserved. Ann Francis one of the beautiful young 60s women in Hollywood is also almost forgotten. Richard Basehart was an old time Hollywood star but almost forgotten today as well. I'm an Alistar Maclean fan and when you know Maclean's got something to do with anything you know it's gonna be good. The Satan Bug has got all the twists and mystery that you can find in Macleans books but here it's even more spicy than Guns on Navarone or Where Eagles Dare etc. Like other movies from this period mid 60s the plots could be quite slow for todays viewers the Bond movies included yes. But Satan Bug is very VERY different. You will never be bored and the ending you could never guess. Satan Bug is not like a Bond or Harry Palmer movie it's so different and it's somehow more mature. Bond and Palmer are more like typical comic cartoon spy heroes while Barrett is more like the way an agent probably is in real life. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who especially likes spy movies. It's my absolute favorite 1960s movie and Spymovie. A warning would be that you might worry more about world war three after watching The Satan Bug... Don't miss this great masterpiece!I wish I could give Satan Bug 20 out of 10!!".

	schema:headline " The script is the real natural disaster in Volcano";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Mick Jackson's disaster flick in which the eponymous natural disaster wreaks havoc throughout Los Angeles is like watching a 3 a.m. infomercial. It's such silly mindless fluff yet there's just something about it that keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Volcano is admittedly wellcast and acted despite a dreadful script and a plot whose summary could fit on a matchbook. Tommy Lee Jones who would give 110 making a McDonald's commercial stars as Mike Roark the hardboiled head of the Office of Emergency Management where he is assisted by his sidekick Emmit Don Cheadle. After initially poohpoohing the thought of a volcano in L.A. from geologist Amy Barnes Anne Heche who constantly ends her lines with a fourletter word like a period after a sentence it's only a matter of time before he is proved wrong before his very eyes. Other solid performances come from Jacqueline Kim Dr. Calder John Carroll Lynch Stan the oftmaligned subway boss and Keith David a great actor who is otherwise wasted here in a role as a police lieutenant who has no impact on any events in the film which is halfway over before he even appears on screen for the first time.However there's the small problem of having something resembling a good story to go with the awesome visuals which are indeed spectacular.

	onyx:emotionText "Watching Mick Jackson's disaster flick in which the eponymous natural disaster wreaks havoc throughout Los Angeles is like watching a 3 a.m. infomercial. It's such silly mindless fluff yet there's just something about it that keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Volcano is admittedly wellcast and acted despite a dreadful script and a plot whose summary could fit on a matchbook. Tommy Lee Jones who would give 110 making a McDonald's commercial stars as Mike Roark the hardboiled head of the Office of Emergency Management where he is assisted by his sidekick Emmit Don Cheadle. After initially poohpoohing the thought of a volcano in L.A. from geologist Amy Barnes Anne Heche who constantly ends her lines with a fourletter word like a period after a sentence it's only a matter of time before he is proved wrong before his very eyes. Other solid performances come from Jacqueline Kim Dr. Calder John Carroll Lynch Stan the oftmaligned subway boss and Keith David a great actor who is otherwise wasted here in a role as a police lieutenant who has no impact on any events in the film which is halfway over before he even appears on screen for the first time.However there's the small problem of having something resembling a good story to go with the awesome visuals which are indeed spectacular.

	schema:headline " A pretty simplistic disaster movie with all the usual clichs but just enough stuff happening to make it passable entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite a history of major geological events in the area nobody really suspects anything when a handful of pipe engineers die from intense burns while underground. Investigating the accident OEM chief Mike Roark almost gets killed himself when an underground fissure throws up intense heat and flame. Expert Dr Amy Barnes believes that magma may be coming up to the surface of the earth and causing the events but would you believe it nobody buys it. Nobody that is until the tar pits overflow and start to pour lava onto the streets destroying everything in its path. With Roark convinced and Barnes wishing she had been wrong the race is on to protect the city. Better known as 'that other volcano movie of 1997' this film gets out the disaster movie handbook and follows it step by step. So we have a manly and practical hero an expert children and pets in peril human conflict sacrifice special effects 'bad' politicians etc etc. So far so formula and so it all continues. The basic set up does the usual things by setting up the most basic of characters for us to use as a focus before then just letting the lava go and relying on special effects to do the rest. The need to turn the drama into a specific story around Roark means that it occasionally forces him and his into unlikely dangerous positions that require them to be inches away from the action this is not convincing and at times just feels like overkill sucking any real tension out of the film.Without much real excitement the film just piles on the special effects and unfortunately these look dated with some poor back projection failing to really cut the mustard.The film soldiers on unsure of how it can keep raising the stakes while remaining plausible it doesn't! and it will satisfy those just looking for a noisy disaster movie but no more than the clichs that those produce. The script has a few digs at LA the news reporting the pet obsession etc but these don't amount to much but it works much better than the rather sickening attempts at racial commenting in the final few scenes 'everyone looks the same'  ugh!. The cast try hard to convince us that they are real people in real danger but even the talent involved cannot do much more than put on grim faces and soldier on. Jones is a good lead because he has a solid presence but even he cannot make it exciting when he is placed within inches of anything fallingburningexploding. Heche simply fits into the 'I hate it when I'm right' expert without really bringing more than competence to the role while Hoffmann simply tries to find trouble to get into anytime the film dips. Cheadle is good support but minor subplots featuring the likes of David Corbett and Rispoli only serve to highlight that the film cannot even manage to do the disaster movie stable of having each character have a background to make us care.Overall this is an average disaster movie at best and as such will only really play well to those that like that sort of thing. The script is weak and cannot wait until the lava flows but even then struggles to make it exciting throwing specific near misses at us again and again to keep us interesting. The cast have nothing to work with and make little impression but viewers may find this has just enough going for it to make it watchable if totally forgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Volcano' is a Bmovie at best and at worst is more of a disaster that what it's supposed to be depicting.  To be fair you have to be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for one major concept.  'Volcano' asks you to suspend disbelief in science human interaction and common sense.Tommy Lee Jones gets to be the studlyyet1990ssensitive head honcho of the Office of Emergency Management and he's fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue the script provides.  However Anne Heche gives a howlingly bad performance as a smartass geologist who becomes Roark's love interest while the city is burning down natch.  Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and American President to a turn as a whimpering needy and victimforlife daughter of Jones.  Don Cheadle gets to sit in a really coooool office and take Jones's phone calls doing the job that in reality Roark would and should be doing.Anyway the movie really starts going downhill when Heche's geology partner gets sucked into a lava vent while they're breaking into the subway lines. It picks up speed when Jones starts suggesting that they use buses to dam the flow of the lava flowing down the street Heche's geologist who loves to lecture everyone about The Science Of Geology being apparently oblivious to the fact that lava is hot and it melts metal and rock and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect.  It really starts to suck when the film introduces Rodney Kinglike racial tension between two bad actors dressed as cops and an angry black man who can't understand why the fire department is busy with this large river of flowing lava.  But hey in the end the three of them will be working together to build a Krail dam to stop the lava from eating up his neighborhood even though the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used wouldn't stop lava anyway.  Besides Krails are hardly watertight but I guess lava wouldn't think to poke its head through the gaps not when Tommy Lee Jones is glaring at it.  Don't even get me started on the strandedsubwaycar subplot where a tunnelful of hot lava is coming down but oddly enough it's not too hot to attempt a rescue it's not too smoky to see and there aren't any poisonous gases so everyone can breathe.  This must be LA Lava or Lava Lite.  You know it eats cars but is ecofriendly.There are moments of sheer camp here that almost make you wonder if this was meant to be a comedy.  For instance the two security guards packing up Hieronymus Bosch paintings have a completely meaningless and farcical conversation about weight and at the end no sooner does the little boy RoarkJones rescued note that everyone looks the same while covered in ash than a rainstorm breaks out and cleans everyone up  and then the sun comes out and Heche says something along the lines of aw shucks Roark.'Volcano' almost achieves Battlefield Earth status but except for Heche no one approaches Travoltalike badness and the technical aspects are handled pretty well.  If you are from the LA area as I am it's kind of funny to think of a lava flow wiping out Wilshire Boulevard.  I gave it a three for the effects and the little amount of tension you get from this.".

My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive. I blithely watched anyway certain that if Jones was in the movie it must at least be worth two hours of my time. After all he has been one of our goto actors for years. Although Heche isn't one of my favorite actresses I was additionally reassured by seeing another wellknown face. The list of accomplished actorsactresses continued to grow so I endured more and more of this film certain that if I pushed through enough clichs and trite social statements I would arrive victorious on the other side of the plot. Alas there was no plot. It appeared to be burned by the everoozing lava of doom.The characters were paperthin. The plot was so chock full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie. Was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this film's budget? No acid rain...no toxic gasses like sulfur or hydrochloride...no deadly ash...no skinsearing heat just a few feet from the lava. Wow...it's the world's friendliest lava ever! The events were no better than the characters. Each incident was so contrived and farfetched...it's like the writers said Okay we need to get rid of the little girl NOW...and poof she's splashed by a lava bomb which burns her enough that she has to be carried to safety not from the lava but from her own helpless stupor...but just moments later in the car she is in no apparent pain and soon after is running effortlessly through the groan! building that oh no! is about to be blown up. After enduring all of this your reward is the line from the little boy at the end about all the people looking the same...which has got to be one of the worst movie lines I have ever heard. Even if it wasn't so painfully scripted it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. Kid and cop aside as if the mother would still be in the area and just needs to be pointed out because she just isn't speaking up...what...she's hoping to slink off into the shadows and get away from the little brat once and for all? I don't think so. Obviously the child's mother would be missing or dead  or yelling her head off to find her toddler.The token black gangsta tough hoodlum with a secret soft spot versus the chip on his shoulder narrow minded cracker cop with a secret soft spot scene made my eyes bleed. Even if such pat characters existed they wouldn't behave as the movie portrays them given the circumstances. Something about imminent fiery death and massive destruction tends to catch people offguard ya know? There are too many canned movie moments like these to mention...really it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. Those poor writers...where are they now?".

	schema:headline " Volcano made ash of itself here.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was pretty lame. I didn't lava it. In 1997's the United States was welcome that year with two big budget volcano films. One was Dante's Peak the other is this mess of a movie. Directed by Mick Jackson the movie had a lot of things going against it. One thing is the horrible acting. Tommy Lee Jones seem to forget what movie he is in because he's channeling his inner Samuel Gerard from 1993's Fugitive with this role. Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark head of the Los Angeles Emergency Management Center whom with Dr. Amy Barnes a volcanologist Anne Heche discover an actual volcano ready to emerges from the La Brea Tar Pits and destroy Los Angeles. It's up to Mike and his management team including his secondincommand Emit Reese Don Cheadle to save as much people as possible. Too bad for Los Angeles they put a guy in change for Emergency needs that has no clue how Volcanos and earthquakes work. That's really smart. Serious how does this guy not know what lava and manga is!? The ignorance of geography is just annoying. Are we supposed to believe no one in LA has a clue what a volcanic eruption or lava looks like? Sure the first time people might do doubletake. However it soon gets to the point where the film seems to be set in an alternate reality where the very existence of volcanoes is an obscure geological fact completely unfamiliar to the general public. It's an insult. For a city as large as Los Angeles the fictional and totally ridiculous volcano erupting unnoticing erupting is just out of the world unrealistic. How does this volcano get unnoticing for years from every scientist in the world over the years? Yes California is a geologically complex place with many centers of volcanic activity but most of them aren't anywhere near the Los Angeles Basin. So maybe scientist weren't looking for it but still Los Angeles area has no volcanoes active or even recently extinct. The LA basin is also full of oil wells and tar pits. Petroleum deposits cannot form geologically in the presence of volcanic activity anywhere in the vicinity you can't have oil tar and volcanoes in the same place period. It's nearly impossible to have volcanos such as a Parcutin type there. It's like me saying that the volcano on the moons are all activate when there clearly dead. Another thing that bugs me about the movie is Anne Heche. I really don't buy her as a scientist. She has to be one of the worst actress that came out from the 1990s. The movie even has the nerves to set up a love plot between the 28 year old Anne Heche and the 51 year Tommy Lee Jones. Really? Do you think that's needed for this ridiculous movie!? They have little to no chemistry. If that doesn't get you turn off the movie adds more subplots like a doctor Jaye Calder Jacqueline Kim choosing her job over her jerk husband who wants to flee the city. Why on earth did the man marry her if he's against her helping people? I would thought the word 'Doctor' who give him some clues what she does for a living. The movie even wants to deal with racism. If there wasn't enough subplots in the movie alright. There is a few scenes where a black guy and racist cop are fighting while the eruption and lava flow are going on. Only to connect with each other when the disaster threaten their neighborhoods. In a better movie and director this would be great social commentary but in this film it's deliver in such a cheesy and offending way. Even the boy last line in the end of the movie sounds tacky. Another bad character is Roark's daughter Kelly Gaby Hoffmann who tend to freeze up constantly forcing people to save her. Her clueless way to save herself cost the chance of her hero trying to save someone else's life. Does she felt any empathy about that? No! The worst instance being losing a kid she was put in charge of and when she finds him on an exploding street decides to stay there and wait to be saved. Her behavior is justified mention by an easily missed conversation between her mother and father early in the movie but gees... she so tiresomely getting saved all the time to the point that I wanted her to die in the film. There is also a lot patting scenes with characters that have little to do with the main plot. While I do like the character of Stan Olber John Carroll Lynch and his last scene was pretty damn epic. There is little reason why the movie needed him around. The visual effects were alright in the most part. Still there couldn't get the science between the lava right. I like how the heroes place concrete barriers in a culdesac so when the lava reaches them it'll dam itself but they face it in the wrong direction for the dam to work. In real life dams and bridges need to have the arc against the point with the most pressure. There are too many instances to count where individuals are standing directly on the other side of concrete barriers redirecting and holding back lava. Most of them with the ash they breathed in would have turned the insides of their lungs into pavement and killed them well before the final act. The movie was composed by Alan Silvestri. Too bad it's not that good. Overall The ads say The Coast Is Toast but to be truth the movie is toast. It's painful to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "As someone who's watched both the simultaneous Volcano disaster movies of 1997 I can say without a doubt that this movie fails to hold a candle to Dante's Peak simply because whilst the situation in that movie was realistic though predictable and the action you could be gripped by with some enjoyable characters to back it up this film has pretty much the opposite but still laboured with the predictability aspect.So what's the red lettuce? Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark the head of the Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management and after an earthquake rocks the city he's sent to investigate an apparent gas explosion at the MacArthur Park which has killed several workers. This is followed by strange activity at the La Brea Tar Pits where some of the sculptures in the pits start to melt. Early the next morning another violent earthquake rocks the city again and very soon a large lava spewing volcano emerges from the Tar Pits spreading out into the city. With the assistance of a geologist played by Anne Heche Roark must try to bring down the destructive force of nature before it wipes out the entire city on its way to the Pacific!Now aside from the many glaring plot points and the fact that as a Geography student I could write a paper on how inaccurate this movie is what specifically is wrong with this movie? Although I will say if you drop 1000 gallons of water on top of a Volcano like they do towards the end that won't stop it erupting!Well whilst it maintains the predictable 'the volcano's gonna erupt at some point' streak that Dante's Peak did it's just generally a bore. The build up to the eruption isn't half as subtle or suspenseful as that in Dante's Peak and even when the eruption happens it's not particularly exciting. The fact that the lava is moving slowly down the street really takes you out of the excitement sort of like Oh my goodness it'll hit us eventually! Better stick the kettle on then... Dante's Peak had the advantage of faster moving lava an acid lake a wall of debris laden water and a Pyroclastic Flow to keep both us and our heroes on the move.Next are the characters who are all unbelievably stupid. Whilst Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche I'll excuse for the fact that they actually get stuff done to try and stop this thing the other character's roles extend to just standing there with their mouths wide open in shock as this big red mass of heat approaches them. The daughter is especially stupid spending the first half of the movie being a rebellious angst teen and the second half just standing gawking at the obvious danger rather than running away or ducking for cover like any other human being would. This is just one of many scenes that you find yourself scratching your head in confusion at because you really can't let them slide they're just too stupid for words.So to sum up this movie is exactly the same as Dante's Peak only much less enjoyable. The most jarring problem is the characters who are all very stupid and act less like human beings and more like lost sheep! The story's recycled the CGI is recycled the pace is slower and less exciting there's enough plot holes to sink the Isle of Wight it's just a big boring mess!Word of advice avoid like these characters should have been doing with the lava!".

	schema:headline " Fun Albeit By The Numbers Disaster BMovie";
	schema:reviewBody "Head of Los Angeles Emergency Operations Mike Roark Tommy Lee Jones and plucky seismologist Dr. Amy Barnes Anne Heche find themselves dealing with a crisis of monumental proportions when Los Angeles is suddenly threatened by an erupting volcano! While I have serious doubts with regards to the legitimacy of a lot of what's presented on screen that's also true of most disaster films and make no mistake that is what this is... a 1990s attempt at updating the classic 1970s style disaster Bmovie. It has the usual disaster movie focus of looking at the crisis from the point of view of several key barely fleshed out aside from our leads characters. It is a little slow getting started but once the lava flows I have to admit I just sat back grabbed some popcorn and had fun watching this one. Where this movie best succeeds is in its portrayal of human courage in the face of impending doom and disaster my favorite scenes being the hurried rescue aboard the stranded subway train Roark running in front of a falling building in an effort to save his only daughter and Dr. Calder trying valiantly to save lives in the middle of a busy street. Where it falters is in its attempt to say something about race relations those scenes proving absolutely groan inducing. Plus it offers very little truly new and surprising very little we haven't seen in movies of this type before but at the end of the night I have to admit it held my interest as a fun popcorn movie.".

While I have serious doubts with regards to the legitimacy of a lot of what's presented on screen that's also true of most disaster films and make no mistake that is what this is... a 1990s attempt at updating the classic 1970s style disaster Bmovie. It has the usual disaster movie focus of looking at the crisis from the point of view of several key barely fleshed out aside from our leads characters. It is a little slow getting started but once the lava flows I have to admit I just sat back grabbed some popcorn and had fun watching this one.

This big budget trash went up against that other big budget trash Dante's Peak back in 1997 and even though this one obviously had more to work with it still managed to come off even shorter than Pierce Brosnan's dreary vehicle. Featuring all manner of great special effects and autopilot performances from all concerned Volcano subscribes to the classic 'disaster movie' profile and shows this further by ensuring that the plot makes about as much sense as blowing up your house to keep it from being robbed. Tommy Lee Jones struts his stuff as some bloke who works for the government and Anne Heche gets down and dirty as someone who knows about volcanoes. When a volcano erupts in Los Angeles where'd that come from? it's up to these two and a load of firemen etc to stop the lava in its tracks before Tommy Lee Jones' daughter is killed! Oh...and the rest of LA. The story is set up in the usual way someone notices something blah blah he's ignored blah blah disaster happens blah blah the day is saved. Blah. Blah.This film is completely pointless and is obviously only there for entertainment value. Still even as entertainment this falls flat on it's face. Obviously in a film like this you've got to expect some over the top sequences and silly goings on such as a sequence that sees a train worker save one of his friends... but the film continually throws stupid ideas into the plot and before long it just gets so silly that it's impossible to care about it. Quite how Tommy Lee Jones has managed to maintain a semirespectable reputation after all these years is astounding. To me his name has become synonymous with 'stupid load of rubbish'. He might have the ability to portray a rugged action character but he's unbelievably corny and doesn't make a good lead. Anne Heche stars opposite him and just does what you'd expect the 'female with brains' to do. Don Cheadle who met with high acclaim after his performance in the massively overrated Hotel Rwanda gives a very mundane performance but I'd still rather watch him than either of the two leads. On the whole if you're going into this expecting some brainless fun you'll be pleased to know that it is brainless but unfortunately it's about as much fun as an actual volcanic eruption. Definitely NOT recommended.".

Mike isn't sure what to think so he brings geologist Dr. Amy Barnes Anne Heche in to try  explain things unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava has been released after the quake  erupts at the La Brea Tar Pits sending the lava pouring out into the city streets engulfing anything  everything it touches in flames. Mike his men  the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava  save as many lives as possible...Directed by Mick Jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting Volcano during 1997 with Dante's Peak 1997 being released a mere two months or so before Volcano was  while Dante's peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least it's slightly better  more plausible than Volcano is. The script here is total nonsense  is not based in reality at all underground rivers of lava that seem to appear  then disappear just as quick various character's standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine as far as I am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal is it?  it constantly happens helicopters flying is clouds of ash in reality it would be impossible one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava what about down the other streets  other directions? being able to blow a perfect trench in a street  then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam  when Kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there  watches two firemen get burned to death  waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guy's do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through  loads more besides like that massive building falling on Tommy Lee  his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards. The character's are awful too although they were not as clichd as usual with no romance blossoming between Tommy Lee  Anne Heche  minimal city official's who try to shut Tommy Lee  Anne Heche up before the event labelling them scaremongers. There's a few badly written  at times embarrassing moral moments as Los Angeles pulls together the black guy  that semi racist cop who warm to each other  by the end are wishing each other well  that little kid at the end when he says 'everyone looks the same' is cringe worthy  is surely a hamfisted attempt  trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings  we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together. Having said that I think Volcano is one of those so bad it's good films it entertains  it moves along at a decent pace but just don't expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama either.I suppose a film like Volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70's disaster film such as The Poseidon Adventure 1972 or Earthquake 1974 but on a huge budget with modern effects work. Speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much  the setpieces are also surprisingly forgettable sure there are a few impressive explosions  a few OK river of lava flowing through Los Angeles effects but little else. Generally Volcano just isn't very exciting  while occasionally unintentionally funny  completely ridiculous it doesn't really work in the way the makers intended.With a supposed budget of about 90000000 it opened to a little under 15000000 at the boxoffice it looks alright  there's lots of fire but nothing stands out  Volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall. Filmed in Los Angeles I think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations. The cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue  ridiculous setpieces to contend with Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than this.Volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself. Worth it for a few unintentional laughs  the ridiculousness of it all but it's nothing great  I doubt I would ever want to see it again.".

The script here is total nonsense  is not based in reality at all underground rivers of lava that seem to appear  then disappear just as quick various character's standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine as far as I am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal is it?  it constantly happens helicopters flying is clouds of ash in reality it would be impossible one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava what about down the other streets  other directions? being able to blow a perfect trench in a street  then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam  when Kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there  watches two firemen get burned to death  waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guy's do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through  loads more besides like that massive building falling on Tommy Lee  his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards. The character's are awful too although they were not as clichd as usual with no romance blossoming between Tommy Lee  Anne Heche  minimal city official's who try to shut Tommy Lee  Anne Heche up before the event labelling them scaremongers. There's a few badly written  at times embarrassing moral moments as Los Angeles pulls together the black guy  that semi racist cop who warm to each other  by the end are wishing each other well  that little kid at the end when he says 'everyone looks the same' is cringe worthy  is surely a hamfisted attempt  trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings  we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together. Having said that I think Volcano is one of those so bad it's good films it entertains  it moves along at a decent pace but just don't expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama either.I suppose a film like Volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70's disaster film such as The Poseidon Adventure 1972 or Earthquake 1974 but on a huge budget with modern effects work. Speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much  the setpieces are also surprisingly forgettable sure there are a few impressive explosions  a few OK river of lava flowing through Los Angeles effects but little else. Generally Volcano just isn't very exciting  while occasionally unintentionally funny  completely ridiculous it doesn't really work in the way the makers intended.With a supposed budget of about 90000000 it opened to a little under 15000000 at the boxoffice it looks alright  there's lots of fire but nothing stands out  Volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall. Filmed in Los Angeles I think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations. The cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue  ridiculous setpieces to contend with Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than this.Volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself. Worth it for a few unintentional laughs  the ridiculousness of it all but it's nothing great  I doubt I would ever want to see it again.";

	schema:reviewBody "I find it's impossible to write a review of a Mick Jackson movie without pointing out that in 1984 he shocked the nation of Britain with his nuclear holocaust docudrama THREADS . Anyone who saw that on its BBC broadcast will never forget the grim  bleak  depressing and powerful depiction of the end of humanity . Seeing as THREADS was set in the Yorkshire town of Sheffield and filmed on a budget of what appeared to be three dollars fifty cents you'd think he'd use some of his unquestionable talent and VOLCANO's 90 million budget to make a convincing scenario of a city devastated by events beyond its control But Jackson has been there  done that  bought the TShirt and written his name in broadcasting history with THREADS and the last thing he wants is to make another grim shocker where millions of city dwellers die . Picking the dumbest script imaginable Jackson has decided he's going to enjoy himself this time and filmed the complete opposite to his nuclear holocaust horror show . Remember in THREADS a myriad of scientific advisers were used ? It goes without saying that no scientific bodies were consulted in the making of VOLCANO . Mind you this may actually work in the context of the story since the characters are so dumb  there is a logic to having a bunch of underground workers being burned to death and no one saying  Hey these men were killed by lava . If we don't evacuate the city millions of people are going to be burned alive by a volcanic eruption  Remember in THREADS after the bomb drops its everyman for himself ? That was probably the most terrifying thing about the docudrama  of having your throat cut for your meager supplies of food . But not here where the guardians of law and order are not only noble enforcers of justice throughout the movie but also make sure no one is discriminated on the grounds of race and culture . You've also got the feeling that if looters existed in this movie they wouldn't be shot but given a place on a counseling program There's also a similar aspect to the above . In THREADS people are left in the rubble to die since it's not practical to save them . Here the laws of physics have been changed so that if anyone is trapped under a burning truck a passer by can magically lift up the truck with one hand thereby rescuing the injured party . There's even a scene of self sacrifice that has to be seen to be believed  not that the scene was in any way believable to start with The English speaking world are obsessed with their pets and Jackson used this to harrowing effect in THREADS . We saw family pets suffocating in firestorms . If you didn't feel sorry for the human beings killed you'd feel sorry for the poor animals . In VOLCANO we're treated to several scenes of pets in peril being rescued . I'm not sure how many people die on screen but I'm certain not one single type of mammal dies on screen apart from homo sapiens I don't believe for one moment that Mick Jackson's contrast between this and THREADS is coincidental  It's done entirely on purpose with the only connection being a scene of irony . In THREADS this takes the form of characters standing in front of a billboard advertising life insurance while in VOLCANO a character reads a book on writing screenplays . You won't need life insurance when the bomb drops while VOLCANO shows being able to read a book on screenplays doesn't mean you're capable of writing oneUnfortunately VOLCANO flopped at the box office and only made half its production costs in American cinemas which effectively ended Mick Jackson's successful Hollywood career which is shameful . I don't know about you but anyone who can direct two pieces of totally contrasting work is a literal genius in my opinion".

I was a cinemagoer back then and we went through a time where every year there were two rival movies on the same subject coming out at the same time. One year we had ARMAGEDDON and DEEP IMPACT in 1997 we had this and DANTE'S PEAK. While I much preferred the Pierce Brosnan movie and have gone so far as to purchase it on Bluray for continued enjoyment I think VOLCANO is a fun production. It has a good plot that harks back to the old Hollywood disaster hits like EARTHQUAKE and a very fastpaced story that gets straight to the crux of the matter without much hanging around. The worst thing about it is the terrible direction which is cheesy beyond belief. It starts off restrained and ends with slowmotion running bad CGI backdrops and some hugely embarrassing zoomingin on people's faces that has to be seen to believed. You'd think you were watching a spoof.Tommy Lee Jones acquits himself well as the hero of the hour enjoying the peak of his popularity in the years following on from THE FUGITIVE. He's well supported by solid character actors including Keith David and John Carroll Lynch who can be relied upon to do their very best. The one missstep is the casting of the terrible Anne Heche as the female lead she's totally unconvincing as the geologist and another embarrassment at times. The special effects haven't held up as well as those in DANTE'S PEAK but the lava lake still looks good today and there are some fairly exciting setpieces along the way. As cheesy as this is I'd still take it over any of the modernday Bmovie disaster films made by the SyFy Channel and The Asylum.".

	schema:headline " A disturbing psychological horror film with a twist ending";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film as a child but its images haunted me for many years. This terrifying film has rarely been broadcast since but was recently shown on American Movie Classics and I found it as frightening as I remembered. It is notable for the performance of the legendary acting teacher Uta Hagen whose film and TV appearances are limited but whose teachings are highly regarded in the acting world. Her role as Ada the Russian grandmother of mysterious twin boys with a terrible secret is perhaps not one of the great roles in film history but her performance lends the film a tragic depth which makes the events seem all the more horrible. TV's John Ritter also has a small but important role as another member of the family beset by crises and dire events. And the late Portia Nelson one of the nuns from THE SOUND OF MUSIC also makes an appearance. Like many horror films of the 70's this film sets a child's innocence against a malevolent force but unlike The Exorcist or The Omen doesn't involve supernatural elements. The horror is almost entirely psychological and involves the twins' relationship and a griefstricken family. It would be foolish to give away too many details because the plot twists and shocking ending are so effective but this film without explicit violence or gore manages to make an impact and is a mustsee for horror fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this film as a child but its images haunted me for many years. This terrifying film has rarely been broadcast since but was recently shown on American Movie Classics and I found it as frightening as I remembered. It is notable for the performance of the legendary acting teacher Uta Hagen whose film and TV appearances are limited but whose teachings are highly regarded in the acting world. Her role as Ada the Russian grandmother of mysterious twin boys with a terrible secret is perhaps not one of the great roles in film history but her performance lends the film a tragic depth which makes the events seem all the more horrible. TV's John Ritter also has a small but important role as another member of the family beset by crises and dire events. And the late Portia Nelson one of the nuns from THE SOUND OF MUSIC also makes an appearance. Like many horror films of the 70's this film sets a child's innocence against a malevolent force but unlike The Exorcist or The Omen doesn't involve supernatural elements. The horror is almost entirely psychological and involves the twins' relationship and a griefstricken family. It would be foolish to give away too many details because the plot twists and shocking ending are so effective but this film without explicit violence or gore manages to make an impact and is a mustsee for horror fans.";

I think this was the only film I've ever seen her in and she's spectacular. Well before bad kids became a genre clich this one beats all the other likeminded thrillers by a mile even THE OMEN. Well maybe not THE BAD SEED though.And as the cherryontop Jerry Goldsmith turned in one of his best scores on this one. And DP Robert Surtees' work is so beautiful in contrast to the sheer horror it has us bear witness to...Director Mulligan deserved all the praise he got for THE OTHER and more acclaim than he did get because of the fact that it was considered a lowclass horror movie.

Legendary acting coach Uta Hagen turns in the kind of performance that people only dream about. It seems like she also must have helped out the rest of the cast because everyone surronding her turns in their best work to date. The film doesn't pile on the blood but what it lacks in blood it certainly makes up for in suspense and sheer terror. It has a dazzling array of plot developments you just don't see coming from miles away and it is equally sad scary and beautiful. The director just hasn't crafted a great horror film he has crafted a truly great film. It should stand out as one of the best modern day films. I don't want to give away too much details about the film because it could end up ruining your movie watching experience but I will say this it certainly is a film that should be required viewing. It was one of those films that took me by complete surprise. A totally professional production in every respect.Rated PG Violence.".

And there can be little doubt King was greatly influenced by Thomas Tryon's outstanding novels Harvest Home and The Other.The TV movie version of The Other enjoyed goodratings and critical acclaim when it was first broadcast on CBS in 1972. Although Stephen King was actively writing horror at the time I suspect he took subtle cues from The Other. Among other things little Danny Torrance's psychic manifestation of the shining is curiously similar to a phenomena called playing the game in Tryon's story.Thomas Tryon wrote with an elegant style somewhat reminiscent of H.P. Lovecraft's. His plots were engaging his characters interesting and well developed and his New England settings evoked the gloom and obscure anxiety traditionally associated with that region. So why has his work faded into nearobscurity while King's is heralded as the greatest in the history of horror?Regrettably Tryon who was one of the most highly regarded young actors in Hollywood started writing rather late in life and died while his creative powers were waning. He also chose to explore genres other than the Gothic with generally good results. There is also a more staid preWorld War II air about his work that might not appeal King's core audience. Nevertheless Tryon's Gothic efforts translated wonderfully onto the small screen and he deserves a welldeserved place in the pantheon of American Gothic writers. Thankfully American Movie Classics has begun airing The Other again and a new generation of fans now has the opportunity to enjoy this seminal work of cinematic horror.".

I caught the beginning of The Other a few months ago on AMC and of course it was coming on late on a Saturday night...I didn't get to finish it but what I saw intrigued me enough to look for the film. As I began to search the web I found that the movie was based on an outofprint book by Thomas Tryon. I picked up the book first and was mesmerized! I also bought a copy for my mother a bonafide horror guru. I began talking up the book amongst my friends many of whom were surprised that I claimed to be a horror fan and had never seen the film! The movie has a definite look and feel to it and Mulligan is to be commended for it. From the opening credits featuring the incomparable Jerry Goldsmith's score to the opening scenes in the woods you know that no good is going to come of this. I won't spoil the film for those and there's no doubt many that haven't seen it. If you enjoy a good solid psychological horror story you will not be disappointed. If you're looking for blood and gore don't bother.There's solid performances from the twins and of course from Uta Hagen. My one true complaint comes from the ending...it seemed a little rushed and deviated from the book too much in a production that otherwise had followed the book quite faithfully. Tryon did write the screenplay himself based on his own book so how much can one complain about it? I just feel that the film would've benefited from another ten minutes ending exactly like the book including the surprising and wideopen for interpretation last chapter.I adore discovering a film or book that I've never heard of and once discovering it find that the movie has a lot of fans. This is another such movie. It deserves to be on DVD in the worst kind of way. Fans of thrilling psychological suspenseful movies will be well served by The Other.

The Shining and The Exorcist are two blatant examples of megamovies that sold out with inane dialogue cheap scare tactics and overbaked performances.  Sometimes it takes a little guy to show the big guys how to do it right.  Wisely author and former actor Tom Tryon took no chances at having someone else toy with his fragile exquisitely crafted tale of the supernatural and adapted the screenplay himself from his own novel.  And we are all the better for it because The Other is arguably one of the most subtle hauntingly elegant tales to grace the big screen.  Might I be so bold as to say Tryon actually improves on his complex often exasperating book in terms of continuity and clarity.  An exercise in restraint the screenplay is simple yet rich carefully constructed and motivated by strong threedimensional characters.  The film itself is muscular in concept tone and visual image.  Identical twin boys living on a lonely remote country homestead are left to their own imaginary devices for funandgames on the farm...with tragic results.  To say anything more would be unconscionable.  Just don't let the languid pace of the film fool you. It's intentional. The movie slowly builds giving in to one of the most shattering climaxes I've ever experienced with plenty of plot twists to play with your mind.  And like Hitchcock at his best its done with intelligence not with buckets of blood. The performances are stellar.  Newcomers Chris and Martin Udvarnoky as the twins came out of nowhere to star in this modest little feature and disappeared just as quickly.  Which is eerie in itself since these two youngsters are absolute naturals and could have easily been the Haley Joel Osments of the 70s.  Diana Muldaur is quite moving here possessing the right mixture of anguish and dread as the twins' invalid mother.  This role is a far cry from the feisty cutthroat attorney she played years later on L.A. Law.  Other familiar faces include Victor Highway to Heaven French as a menacing hired hand and a preThree's Company John Ritter as the buoyant fathertobe.  Best of all however is the chance to see legendary acting coach Uta Hagen in a rare heartwrenching turn as the boys' altruistic grandmother.  Her last scenes will not soon be forgotten.  This moody little thriller deserved a bigger and better release.  Don't miss it.  And don't forget the game!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Other is an adaptation of the Thomas Tryon novel scripted and executive produced by Tryon himself which tells us a story of evil set against the backdrop of a peaceful farming community in Depression era Connecticut. Director Robert Mulligan To Kill a Mockingbird milks the location for a lot of atmosphere  and the finale is particularly sinister  but the horrors of this film are largely psychological which will appeal to those genre fans looking for something subtle.It stars legendary acting teacher Uta Hagen in one of her rare film roles as Ada the doting grandmother to twin boys Niles and Holland played by actual identical twins Chris and Martin Udvarnoky. Niles is the more grounded one and Holland the more mischievous one. They also live with other relatives including an incapacitated mother Alexandra Diana Muldaur. Niles has been taught a special game by Ada which allows him to see through the eyes of others.But don't let that lead you to believe there's much if any of the supernatural in this story. It's done in a more realistic manner and the effectiveness of the film hinges on ambiance mood and performances. Hagen is quite wonderful and the Udvarnokys  who unfortunately never made another film  offer completely natural unaffected portrayals. The excellent cast also features Victor French Lou Frizzell Portia Nelson John Ritter in one of his earliest big screen appearances Jack Collins and Ed Bakey. Production design by Albert Brenner cinematography by Robert Surtees and music by Jerry Goldsmith are all beautiful. This is one of those films that does take you back to a different time and place. The end is haunting and not likely to be forgotten by the viewer anytime soon.The story's critical revelation actually occurs sooner than you might expect but things only build from there Tryon still has more twists and turns up his sleeve.Highly recommended to horror fans especially those who favour the traditional variety of horror.Eight out of 10.".

I was 13 or 14 when I happened to catch it in its original theatrical run in 1972. For me it's become one of those rare discoveries that truly feels like something of my own an artist or particular piece of work that I feel a strong attachment to. Chiefly because they'reit's really good but also largely due to hishertheirit's seemingly preposterous and sometimes perplexingly enduring relative anonymity in such a vast sea of mediocrity. Bill Hicks THE bastion of truth and best comedian EVER and countless bands you've never heard of come to mind. The Other became so obscure that I didn't see it again for about 25 years. I finally got a copy of the pan and scan PS tape released in 1989 on ebay 5 or 6 years ago but not before begging AMC to run it. They eventually began running it years later. It's still the PS version and all I can currently find on ebay is a homemade DVR of the same FMC has the PS version scheduled for 83105. It's a paradox but we want everyone to know about our secret discoveries. We want due acceptance success and relevance for them. And we want verification for our fragile selves.Deep huh? That's my IMDb review. It's my first one and may well be the only 10 stars I EVER afford any film. I can't think of a more deserving film to bear the burden of a standard.PS to the POWERS THAT BE Please release a widescreen deluxe edition DVD of this title while the principles are still available for commentary.Keith KA0001081905".

The problems with the film stem mostly from Tryon's script with gives far too much away far too early. I knew where the film was going fifteen minutes into it. There goes the suspense factor to a large degree. Another problem is the actors playing the twins. I just didn't buy them as very good actors. I found them really more annoying than anything else. This also lessened the credibility of what was going on in the film for me. There are some bright spots though in the film. Hagen is a real treasure to watch as she shines in every one of her scenes. The rustic settings were wellshot. John Ritter and Victor French have small roles. Tryon does have a good story to tell that has some powerful moments.

	schema:reviewBody "A week has passed since I watched Cesare deve morire and I am still trying to decipher the multiple layers on which this film has worked in my mind. The brothers Taviani have directed a masterpiece of 76' which however is so dense in content that the time is waxing inside one's own memory.The Tavianis are documenting the misenscene of a Shakespeare piece inside a prison. Probably the most impressive element of Cesare deve morire is the performances of the inmate actors. The fact that the film is shot as a documentary in its natural setting spreads the film in two layers which are seamlessly weaved on each other. On the first level we see the prisoners who are passionately rehearsing the lines of their characters and on the second level we stand on front of Cesar Brutus and Antonius discussing in the alleys of Rome. As in the case of Bergman the brothers Taviani are very successfully studying the relationship between theater and cinema. This prison setting is extremely symbolic and renders the actor performances utterly intense. It feels as if the prisoners lacking their physical freedom are getting deep into the skin of those new personas seeking the experiences which prison has deprived them of. The performances are so convincing that one has to contemplate on the nature of human destiny. Could it be that one's social condition or even coincidences could make the same persons capable of the best and of the worst? Moreover the film leads to an unavoidable rumination of the concept of freedom in all its forms.A stark black and white photography pronounces the prison architecture and recreates ancient Rome in its bare corridors. The photography is perfectly selfstanding and it would be of great artistic value even in the absence of a plot. The black and white may emphasize the lack of freedom of the inmates but also allows the spectator to ignore redundant information and to concentrate on the performances of the actors. It is remarkable how architectural beauty arises even in a prison. The common spaces are illustrated exceptionally well and after a while one feels lost in a limbo between the prison and Rome.Finally although the audience reaches catharsis after the end of Shakespeare's narration the narration of brothers Taviani remains unresolved into ones psyche. I personally believe that Cesare deve morire is one of those rare cinematic experiences that are capable to shake away well entrenched beliefs. That alone would make the film worth seeing. Gladly those 76' are so much more.".

Other movies dealt with existentialistic superficially more important topics than with some prisoners rehearsing a Shakespeare play.

	schema:reviewBody "The Shakespearean 'All the world's a stage' gets a new meaning with this very interesting and very different film made by the Taviani brother whose actors and heroes are individuals for which the world is the high security prison where many of them are to spend long years paying for serious crimes. Using theater as a mean of therapy end education happens in some of these prisons now a film not only dares to make this process known and visible outside the perimeter of the prison but also tries to make of it a work of art. The Golden Bear at the Film Festival in Berlin is a proof that the Taviani brothers succeeded to convince at least the critics and members of the jury. I get the feeling that the larger public was less convinced  it's a very interesting piece of cinema but not one of these that attracts audiences in numbers. This is not entertainment.In one of the introductory scenes we see a screen test. The actorstobe are asked to introduce themselves in two situations  a 'soft' family one and a second which demands them to feel constrained and express rage. Each of them acts with a mix of sincerity and intensity that much exceeds and compensates their lack of professionalism. This is the key of the film. We have already seen theater in theater Shakespeare himself is the first and maybe greatest master of the genre and theater about prisons and many of these were already brought to screen. What we have never seen before is the mix of situations which makes the walls of the prison disappear for the ephemeral moments when the words of the ancient drama become the reality of life for the prisoners acting it.The film asks many questions which arise after the screening ends. Julius Caesar is a play about values  honor democracy freedom. How do the prisoners relate to these? The characters of the play are cruel in modern terms the plot is also about treason and murder  how do these men who have committed serious crimes relate to these deeds? Some of the most interesting moments in the play and there are only a few of them are these in which real life which for the actors is life in prison interferes in the scenes of the play. I found the smooth sometimes unobserved sliding of life in a 21st century prison into the political drama that took place in the first century BC to be terrifying.And then we have the ending. The show is over it ends in applause and ovations. Then the actors get back to what is their 'home'  the prison where most of them still have to spend many years. What we do understand is that life cannot go on without such a film changing it. The lives of the special actors in this movie but to some extent the lives of the spectators as well.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Shakespearean 'All the world's a stage' gets a new meaning with this very interesting and very different film made by the Taviani brother whose actors and heroes are individuals for which the world is the high security prison where many of them are to spend long years paying for serious crimes. Using theater as a mean of therapy end education happens in some of these prisons now a film not only dares to make this process known and visible outside the perimeter of the prison but also tries to make of it a work of art. The Golden Bear at the Film Festival in Berlin is a proof that the Taviani brothers succeeded to convince at least the critics and members of the jury. I get the feeling that the larger public was less convinced  it's a very interesting piece of cinema but not one of these that attracts audiences in numbers. This is not entertainment.In one of the introductory scenes we see a screen test. The actorstobe are asked to introduce themselves in two situations  a 'soft' family one and a second which demands them to feel constrained and express rage. Each of them acts with a mix of sincerity and intensity that much exceeds and compensates their lack of professionalism. This is the key of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Cesare deve morire Caesar Must Die is the latest movie from brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani experienced both over 80 years old Italian directors and screenwriters. In February 2012 it won the Golden Bear the main prize of the Berlin International Film Festival and a very strong reception from the audience which seems to continue. So what's it about? Some time ago a friend told the Taviani brothers about the great experience she had watching a play in a small theatre in Rome and so they went to visit it. They went there loved the actors and decided to film them creating another play Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. All of that doesn't sound like something special but there's a catch. The theatre is in fact in Rebibbia a highsecurity prison and all of the actors are convicts sentenced for various crimes and to a various amount of time some even for life. That's the most peculiar but also the most problematic thing about this movie.The movie establishes three levels one on the scene the enacting of play and two in the prison prisoners as what should be their normal selves talking about the play and in their roles rehearsing for the play. The interesting thing is that on all of the levels the movie feels scripted. The moments of rehearsing are with the help of camera work editing and music made to look like they are parts of play itself whilst the situations when the prisoners are out of character see them still acting thus ironically making the actual play on the stage the only nonfictional part of the movie. As you can imagine it all leaves you a little confused. Of course it's questionable if the directors even wanted to create everything in that way. Maybe I'm just reading too much into it. But Cesare deve morire obviously tackles the theme of the theaterreality relationship and the fact that it's a movie undeniably adds to the equation.What the Taviani brothers pointed as their main intention in doing this movie is drawing the viewers' attention to the human side of the prisoners and I'm not sure if they succeeded in that. That they in fact worked with amateur actors didn't help. As I've already said the prisoners seem to act all the time thus denying us any real emotion and depriving us of any empathy. What we can assume is the usefulness of creating the prison theatre group. Both as a useful way for convicts to spend their time and as means to enable their interaction with the outside world. Bearing that in mind the movie becomes useful as a sort of advertisement reaching to a broader audience.Being the advertisement of course isn't enough to be a good movie however good the cause it advertises may be. Fortunately there are a few more good things about it. Most of the movie is shot in black and white and the cinematography done by Simone Zampagni is beautiful. The use of the camera transforms prison cells to Roman houses and makes simple courtyards become the Senate and the grand Forum of the Eternal City. It successfully embodies less is more principle. The music composed by Giuliano Taviani and Carmelo Travia in the beginning feels mismatched but when you recognize the rehearsals as the play and the other levels accordingly it clicks in emphasizing the pathos of the tragedy.Cesare deve morire isn't a movie without its charms. I just feel like the directors didn't successfully accomplish what they were trying to even if in the process they created something interesting deliberately or not. That said it puzzles me why it got the Golden Bear and I can't wait to see some of the other movies from the competition.More reviews at httponlineimpressions.blogspot.com".

The more the prisoners understood the play the more they became immersed in their roles.There have been many attempts to make Shakespeare palatable to the modern audience. This was my favorite iteration because it showed the actors trying to understand it just as an audience might try to find the relevance. As a high school student I found Shakespeare and Roman History boring. It wasn't until I hit my 40s did I realize this history was more violent than the Sopranos.I don't know if this movie has ever been widely released. I highly recommend seeing it if it ever comes to your town.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewed at the Lobero Theatre on January 28 2013 during the Santa Barbara International Festival at 1100 A.M. Reviewed by Larry Gleeson. Caesar Must Diea masterful rendition of a filmed play a narrative and a documentary all seemingly rolled into a one of a kind colossal piece of work in a quick seventysix minutes. The film is directed by the Taviani Brothers who choose to begin the film with what appears to be a filmed play as we see a staged play in color and an uproaring applauding audience paying great respect to what they've just witnessed. And just as quickly as the audience applauded the film cuts to black and white and thus begins the feel of a documentary as we discover what we're seeing are prison inmates going for auditions in a Roman prison.The casting agents request the actors who all seem to e Italians with a natural dramatic flare built into their genetic makeupto recite personal data  name birth date and place of birth preincarceration city or town of residence  first emotionally distraught and then again defiantly angry with surprising results of great intensity and with subtle humor. Here overlays provide their convictions and the lengths of their sentences and we become privy to the fact that these are hardened criminals. For those who are familiar with the original Dirty Dozen a resemblance can be ascertained. Much like the stockade soldiers being sent behind enemy lines to carry out a dangerous mission our inmates are volunteering to take part in a pilot program to introduce art into the Roman prison system.Interestingly enough the theater director allows the men to speak in their native dialect and to find within their respective life experience as common ground with the character they are portraying. The character of Julius Caesar is played by Giovanni Arcuri with swagger and determination. Brutus is played by in my opinion the most interesting cast member Salvatore Striano. Pardoned of his crimes in 2006 Striano took up acting and returned to the prison to participate and work in this production.Furthermore watching the inmates rehearse and run lines within the prison added an unbefore seen experience of Shakespeare for me. What at first appeared as a lifeless existence being incarcerated I watched these inmates become reanimated performing daily routines and mundane chores.The reality of the inmates being returned to their cell in the evening and hearing the closing and latching of their cell doors was a powerful reminder of the seriousness of their existence. A telling affect the experience had on the inmates shouts loudly in a mildmannered tone as the inmate Rega serving a twenty year stretch breaks the fourth wall and comes right into the theater screening stating Since I have known art this cell has become a prison. Indeed the power of dramatic art to form and shape and experience can be so profound. I took a chance on this viewing with a large group of retired Rhodes scholars and I feel I was handsomely rewarded. Highly recommended to theater and film buffs alike.".

The Taviani's had a great concept here but really failed in the execution of that concept and the resulting finished film is just unconvincing in my opinion. I had to stop watching this film about half way through because I just couldn't take any more.This film does fit into the genre of MetaCinema but fails to take effective advantage of the creative freedom and the unique opportunities that this genre affords the filmmaker.The convicts who assume the roles in the Shakespearean play are not at all typical convicts. Reviews of this film reveal that the inmate theater is an established program at Rebibbia Prison and the casting of the convicts for the play clearly shows that. These convict actors seem to be well worn retreads of this inmate theater program at least in their appearance to me.ALL of the footage in this film is staged including not only the actual stage performance of the play and the rehearsals held in various parts of the prison BUT ALSO even the discussions that the cast members have with each other about the play AND EVEN their interaction with the civilian director. So there is no real convict behavior displayed in this film whatsoever because it is ALL acting.There is no interaction between the convict actors and the general prison population which is a shame because such interaction would have been fruitful to illustrate how the concepts inherent in the play and the very role of being an actor might have affected the convict actors' interaction with the other prisoners.Overall I would place this film in my own personal genre of Cinematic Oddity. In fact this film is such an oddity so unconvincing and ultimately so irrelevant that it isn't even worthy of Cult Film status. At least in my opinion.".

An adulterous affair begun with a certain amount of cynicism on both sides grows into a true and passionate love affair which in turn raises issues of guilt trust duty selfdenial and religious belief. As a story it holds our interest and causes us to wonder where it will end. As a parable and philosophical meditation on belief and its role in love and contemporary life it is both stimulating and unexpectedly moving.That a novel as layered and difficult was attempted with major stars at this time is surprising enough. That THE END OF THE AFFAIR succeeds on so many levels seems miraculous especially in the context of most mainstream film product of the mid'50s.Van Johnson is not as expressive or deep an actor as the excellent Deborah Kerr and Peter Cushing and John Mills Michael Goodliffe and Nora Swinburne yet his character's relaxed masculinity reluctant anguish and saturnine rather malicious jealousy are wellconveyed and he manages to be a presence you remain interested in. As Greene's Mary Magdalene character the woman in whom the sacred and profane are mingled Kerr is terrific in a complex role that is an interesting inversion of her promiscuous childless woman in the far more famous and popular FROM HERE TO ETERNITY of just two years before. ETERNITY done for Columbia the same studio that released this was far more shallow and conventional in the way it dealt with Kerr's Karen Holmes and her redemption. Just as shallow and evasive was TEA AND SYMPATHY which Kerr did after this and which received far more fame and attention than was merited. This 1955 version of THE END OF THE AFFAIR deserves to be much better known and remembered and all concerned deserve belated kudos for attempting such a provocative film in the midst of Hollywood's synthetic movies of the period. I saw this after recording it on TCM and would like to see it scheduled in prime time to perhaps begin to get the wider audience it deserves and to hear commentary from moderator Robert Osborn for that matter he ought to do one hour interviews with both Kerr and Johnson while they are still around.Let the rediscovery and rehabilitation of this good film begin . . .".

	schema:headline " This Movie Is About Religion";
	schema:reviewBody "When I saw that this movie was by Graham Greene I expected a suspense story maybe a spy story. So I wanted to warn people that this movie is nothing like that. It is about faith and God.It is couched as a love triangle melodrama. This disguise is so wellwrought that it seems to have fooled a lot of people into thinking the movie is a love story. But all that is merely an excuse for the rather deep philosophical issues that the movie tackles.In typical Greene manner though it is rife with unexpected plot twists. For example just when I thought the movie was about to wrap itself up it launched into the real reason for its existence via a flashback into what really happened in Sarah's life. This is an unusual place in a movie to have a long flashback it seems to me.After this point there is one change of direction after another. Up until the very last scene the movie is quite ambiguous and it is not at all clear whether Greene views belief in God as a bad destructive thing or not. Even the last scene does not completely resolve this question.Johnson has a particularly unusual part his allconsuming passion for Sarah inadvertently causing her misfortune after misfortune. His understated guilt and horror each time he discovers the effects of his actions is an interesting part of the story.The acting by the three mains Kerr Johnson and surprisingly Peter Cushing is top notch. This movie is not entertainment however. It is an intellectual challenge engaging the viewer to wrestle with issues most thinking humans must come to terms with at one time or another in their lives. The dialogues between Johnson and Kerr remind me very much of a nonhumorous presentation of the themes dealt with in The Screwtape Letters with Johnson and Goodliffe presenting all the rational reasonable conclusions favoring atheism but Kerr inevitably being drawn deeper and deeper into faith in God more because of their efforts than in spite of them.As has been demonstrated in other comments this movie will not be enjoyed by those unwilling to examine their stances towards these fundamental issues of human existence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am indebted to Turner Classic Movies for televising this film today. I had not seen it. I am a great admirer of both the novel and the 1999 film version by Neil Jordan. I count it as one of the greatest love stories in literature.Yes Van Johnson is miscast as Maurice Bendrix. Still he is a sincere actor and his work is good considering that Maurice has been Americanized. I wasn't prepared for the devastating performance by Deborah Kerr. Sarah Miles is one of literature's greatest creations. The saint as whore. Or is it the whore as saint? I found myself engrossed and deeply moved watching her. It only confirmed my belief that she was with Vivian Leigh one of the two best English actresses in cinema. I love Julianne Moore in the 1999 version and equally love Deborah Kerr in the 1954 version. Sarah Miles is such a great creation that it would be wonderful to see another filmed version and compare the work of three actresses.Incidentally The End of the Affair is one of those notable works of literature that went from the page to the screen to the opera house Jake Heggie composer  commission by The Houston Grand Opera  2004. I do like the treatment given to the other characters in the 1954 film version. We get to meet Smythe and the priest and Sarah's mother. In the Neil Jordan screenplay Smythe and the priest are combined into one character a Catholic priest named Smythe. Sarah's mother is omitted in that version. If I was disappointed in the 1954 version it has to do with the character of Smythe. His character has a horrible facial birthmark that Sarah kisses when she parts from him. In the novel we are told that the birthmark disappeared upon her death. We have no idea that this happens in the 1954 film version. In the 1999 film version the birthmark is given to Lance Parkis's son. Also in the novel Lance suffers from stomach disorders. We learn that he is cured of that upon Sarah's death. No mention is made of this disorder in the 1954 film version.Henry Miles the cuckold is more tragically portrayed in the 1999 film version. I tip the scales in favor to Stephen Rea whose performance is so true to the gravity of Graham Greene's creation.A great story of human and Divine love with Maurice and Henry fighting for possession of Sarah's soul and only God receives it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a great film but it is better than many critics said it was when the 1999 remake came out. THE END OF THE AFFAIR was one of the key novels of Graham Greene in the 1950s that delved into his intense Catholicism. With a background of World War II neighbors Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles Van Johnson and Deborah Kerr have a deep passionate romance. But they are separated for a year or so and when they try to resume the relationship or when Johnson tries to resume the relationship  Kerr seems relatively hesitant. It turns out that due to personal experiences Kerr has had a religious revelation. She is listening to a Catholic priest. She is also trying to help a man with a deformity a birthmark on his face who hates God. She is also concerned about the spiritual health of Johnson and of her actual husband Henry Peter Cushing in a very moving  and nonhorrific role. The film shows how Kerr affects all the lives around her even beyond her death after a short illness as the novel does. Yes it is too talky  novels about ideas and here it is the age old question of what is real love the spiritual or the profaneusually are. Greene good Catholic exponent that he was would have said that Kerr's devotion to her God was an outpouring of divine true love to her fellow creatures. Her death is not a tragedy. But Greene the novelist and parttime realist cannot leave it there. Johnson's character is bitter at the end of this remarkable novel and at the end of the film. And his bitterness is directed at the source of that love that triumphed over his profane one.".

Previously he just had a kind of whiny snide voice Best example of this is in the 1948? 49? film Battleground I will always love Deborah Kerr from my POV she can never do any wrong. It is all the better when she was handed a good script and a good director.I would classify this as one of the better scripts. This film is almost like a comedy of errors instead it is a tragedy of errors. Actually it is quite a sad movie I would have to read the original book that this was based upon.What attracted me to this film are the spiritual aspects. If this film were to be remade today and I see it was remade in 1999 I wonder how much of the spirituality would remain? I have yet to see the newer version. This film is a quest into the reason behind Faith. I can't explain it but this film makes a lot of sense. Mrs Miles questions to the priest to the atheist and to God are all valid.Most people will see this film and will only consider the affair between Johnson's character and Kerr's... But that is not what this film is about at all The affair is just a device author Graham Greene used to tell a story about Faith What it means to have and what is expected of us who have it.Of course this film has its melodramatic aspects. Also it has Peter Cushing who is not chasing vampire Christopher Lee for once.The only weak things in this film are the confrontations between Van Johnson and Cushing If I were Cushing and I had a wife that looked like Kerr I would have punched Johnson in the nose. But maybe the weakness of the encounters were to display that Cushing really did not care about his wife being more interested in becoming a Lord or some important personage.".

Deborah or Sarah does her best and succeeds in showing how it's hard to overcome one's emotions when nature or what turned out to be the man of her dreams Maurice takes hold of them. You have to give both Deborah Kerr and her costar Van Johnson credit in generating enough heat in the theater or at home of those watching the movie without having to turn to up the thermostat and thus saving a mint on the energy bill.".

When Henry confides in him about his wife's possible infidelity Maurice poses as her husband and hires a private detective to follow her and find out what she's doing.I have not seen the remake but was quite interested to see how a 1950's movie would manage to depict the illicit affair between Maurice and Sarah without breaking every moral code of the day.  The answer is  with lots of talking.  The film is significantly shorter than the modern version and had less controversy or at least does now but it still manages to bring things out.  The plot is pretty good but relies very heavily on the extended flashbackjournal sequence to keep things going.  The talk heavy feel is a little tiring but does work well  the characters' emotions are brought out well without profanity or nudity.I don't think Johnson fitted the role that well but he was still good.  His inner bitterness and guilt came out well at points and he brings his complex character out well.  Kerr is also good although her role is less difficult. She does have to carry the whole journal sequence near the end and she doesn't let the film dip.  Cushing only has a few scenes but he is very good.  He gives an English gent performance but eventually you can see the cracks as he tries to hold his feelings together.Overall this is a solid adaptation of the book that manages to bring out the subject matter without the sexual excess of the modern version.  While it is a little heavy on dialogue at times the emotions come out with all the stilted control of the period and it works quite well as a subversive melodrama.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure if I'm writing a spoiler or not. The explanation is vague. I am going to say that the movie is poorly done so if you don't want to be put off don't read this critique. But I am not gong to reveal any secrets of the plot.It struck me immediately that Van Johnson was completely wrong for this role. It should have been someone British like Trevor Howard or James Mason or Dirk Bogarde or John Mills. Some actor who could portray completely different kinds of character. Van Johnson was always good old baby face Van Johnson. He got the role so as to have a Hollywood glamour boy to sell tickets. The whole beginning of the affair between Johnson's and Kerr's characters is too facile to believe for a second. Johnson meets Kerr only briefly at a large cocktail party where she is hostess flitting from guest to guest. I can't imagine him falling for her on the basis of a few sentences of very polite stilted conversation unless she were sensationally alluring which she most certainly was not. In addition before he leaves the party he sees her kiss another man not her husband through a partly open door. This would only make any normal man think she was a shameful tramp and want nothing to do with her. Who needs the hassle of an affair with a woman who already has a husband and a lover? Please take a number! In addition if she were to kiss another man in her own home she's hardly likely to do it in a room with the door open and visible to everyone who enters or leaves the house! But despite this rapid sequence of most improbable events lo! He has fallen for her.Then when they meet in a restaurant he tells her right away that he saw her kissing another man. Any normal woman would take great offence at being so rudely unmasked but no Kerr doesn't bat an eyelid. During this very early part of the film Kerr is pretty much a cold fish. She portrays an icy polite upper middle class Englishwoman and no American is going to be tempted by a woman like that. Further I don't see her having any reason to fall for Johnson. He neither says not does anything either intelligent or charming. Kerr and Johnson then proceed to spend lots of time together which is most unlikely to be achievable. Her husband would have to be a complete idiot not to wonder where on earth she was all the time. In addition Johnson is swanning in and out of Kerr's house sometimes when the husband comes home. Again in real life any sane husband would smell a great big rat. When there's something going on between a spouse and another person and they're in the same room with the other spouse the other spouse can always tell. They know their spouse too well. The husband is a highly intelligent civil servant and yet is portrayed as a moron who hasn't a clue about what is going on.The story itself is interesting enough and improves as the movie progresses. It poses the usual well known conundrums about God. Having never been religious or Catholic in her life Kerr at a moment of crisis walks in to a Catholic church. In real life that is just not going to happen. Unfortunately for me the so called affair is a structure built on sand. There was never any initial foundation of passion between a man and a woman and hence there was never any credible affair. The book is just a convenient vehicle for the stars and that will bring in the fans who want to see Van Johnson in a sob story. My tears are for Graham Greene.".

The detective is John Mills who I'm surprised is taking a small supporting role.

No grand passion was ever to be forthcoming with Kerr or anyone else he would have ever hooked up with.The End Of The Affair is all right. The remake done in 1999 with Ralph Fiennes in the Van Johnson role was more explicit. If you like Graham Greene you'll like both versions.".

He is researching a book he is writing about British civil servants  the people who keep things running on the homefront in England during the war. He is invited to a party being thrown by one of these civil servants Henry Miles Peter Cushing and as he casually mingles with the other guests Maurice sees Henry's wife Sarah  Deborah Kerr kiss another guest as he leaves in a way that people who are not lovers seldom kiss one another. Odd that she'd take such a chance in a house full of people and mirrors  that's how Maurice sees them  in the reflection of a mirror.Sarah captures Maurice's imagination. Here is this gorgeous elegant creature married to a tedious fellow like Henry. So he invites her for a drink at a local pub and kisses her himself  he tells himself he wants to see her reaction. Instead he sees Reddy Kilowatt  instant electricity. Having to duck inside a doorway during Nazi bombing they embrace passionately. Thus is the beginning of the affair. But Maurice never trusts her. He says little things about little things she says that reveals he believes that she has had many lovers and is leading him on now. Then they finally have a chance to be alone for a few days. Sarah comes to Maurice's flat and another Nazi raid occurs. Maurice thinks that Sarah should go home and goes downstairs to check things out. While downstairs a Nazi bomb hits close and the blast causes the heavy front door to land on Maurice.

He figures he's been taken for a sap that Sarah wanted out of the affair that she never loved him and he was just another one of many men that made it easy for her to live with the dull Henry.

He ironically confides in Maurice that he thinks Sarah is having an affair and that he is considering hiring a private detective to follow her. Henry then decides against that course of action but Maurice takes note of the name and address of the private detective and does go through on having her followed with completely surprising results. It turns out there IS a fourth person that there IS a love quadrangle but who this other person is in Sarah's life is a shocker.Now up to this point it sounds like I'm describing a Douglas Sirk like romantic melodrama but trust me this thing not only has a twist in the resolution it has a completely surprising change in genres towards the end. And this genre  which I cannot tell you about without spoiling things  is explored intelligently not the usually heavy handed way it was explored in American films of the 50s. This was probably because it was British made and the British did not have an all encompassing production code at the time like there was in America.I'd highly recommend this one. Deborah Kerr is mysterious and beautiful Peter Cushing acts like the last guy on earth you'd expect to be chasing Count Dracula around Europe with a stake in his hand just a few years later and Van Johnson has never sulked about this way this well since The Last Time I Saw Paris. Also look for John Mills as a most quirky and oddly enthusiastic private detective who lends some needed levity to the proceedings.".

	onyx:emotionText "Maurice Bendrix Van Johnson is in London in the last year of WWII after a wound causes his discharge from the army. He is researching a book he is writing about British civil servants  the people who keep things running on the homefront in England during the war. He is invited to a party being thrown by one of these civil servants Henry Miles Peter Cushing and as he casually mingles with the other guests Maurice sees Henry's wife Sarah  Deborah Kerr kiss another guest as he leaves in a way that people who are not lovers seldom kiss one another. Odd that she'd take such a chance in a house full of people and mirrors  that's how Maurice sees them  in the reflection of a mirror.Sarah captures Maurice's imagination. Here is this gorgeous elegant creature married to a tedious fellow like Henry. So he invites her for a drink at a local pub and kisses her himself  he tells himself he wants to see her reaction. Instead he sees Reddy Kilowatt  instant electricity. Having to duck inside a doorway during Nazi bombing they embrace passionately. Thus is the beginning of the affair. But Maurice never trusts her. He says little things about little things she says that reveals he believes that she has had many lovers and is leading him on now. Then they finally have a chance to be alone for a few days. Sarah comes to Maurice's flat and another Nazi raid occurs. Maurice thinks that Sarah should go home and goes downstairs to check things out. While downstairs a Nazi bomb hits close and the blast causes the heavy front door to land on Maurice. When he comes to and pushes the door off of him he returns upstairs to find Sarah down on her knees surprised that he is alive and she quickly vacates the apartment. Maurice never sees her again. He figures he's been taken for a sap that Sarah wanted out of the affair that she never loved him and he was just another one of many men that made it easy for her to live with the dull Henry.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie based on a Graham Greene novel. Green was known as a Roman Catholic Novelist.Although Greene objected strongly to being described as a Roman Catholic novelist rather than as a novelist who happened to be Catholic Catholic religious themes are at the root of much of his writing especially the four major Catholic novels Brighton Rock The Power and the Glory The Heart of the Matter and The End of the Affair 6 which are regarded as the gold standard of the Catholic novel.7 Several works such as The Confidential Agent The Third Man The Quiet American Our Man in Havana and The Human Factor also show Greene's avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage. From WikipediaAlthough I am not a religious person I remember being impressed by the story of the 1999 movie version with Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore in the starring roles. TCM gave me the opportunity to see the 1955 version with Van Johnson and Deborah Kerr in the starring roles. What impressed me was the strange nature of the two seemly unrelated subjects of religion God and extramarital affairs and how well Green's treatment of this relationship plays out in both the 1999 and 1955 movie versions of the novel.Literature and movies are replete with stories about bargains made with the devil. However I am not sure that most people would think of combining the two subjects of The End of the Affair. They wouldn't that is unless they were thrown into an intense emotional dilemma that made an extramarital affair and a promise to God mutually exclusive. It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes. But during the London bombings of WW II it seems that the 'foxholes' had come to the city.This story plays out like a mystery. How could a married woman Kerr make a bargain or prayer to an unknown God in exchange for saving the life of her lover Johnson after she believed he was dead? And what if she FELT that her prayer had been answered? What should her response be and to whom? A God that she didn't even believe in before her 'prayer' was answered? This becomes a spiritual quest for her. The sudden change in her attitude makes her appear suspicious to both her husband Peter Cushing and her lover Johnson. So without her husband knowing that her lover was his friend the two have her followed by a private detective John Mills to discover who the lover is. However the way the detective's mind works and what is really happening to her only adds to the mystery and puts the movie audience in the position of wondering how this story will all turn out.".

This film was remade in 1999 but I prefer the original version since I find Deborah Kerr more likable than Julianne Moore. Also even though John Mills isn't the lead in the 1955 version he classes up any movie he's in so that's also a bonus to watching the original. I won't spoil the plot and tell you the reason behind The End of the Affair but I will say the film focuses on a range of emotions that coincide with infidelity guilt resentment hope and fear. There's also a strong religious element to the film one that really makes you think after the movie's over. In a way it's more of a thoughtful film than a romance.

Van Johnson partners her convincingly enough although his accent should have been a little more English and a little less American. Peter Cushing's excellent diction compensates it.I never saw a failed screening of any of Graham Greene's novels on the contrary they usually manage to enhance the argument of the book which actually should be the purpose of screening and when it succeeds as in perhaps the most classical example of all David Lean's adaptation of Great Expectations the film succeeds in adding to the cult of the story. This story is more difficult to glorify as it is a most complicated and painful love affair with no happy end. It transcends itself in its complexities involving God and all that as Deborah gets confused about involving him in her case which leads to the tragedy which is awful indeed. They all bleed for it. On the other hand that's what makes this trivial love story of lasting interest. It's not just a wartime noir with bombs and politics making a mess of things but a human drama transcending reality in its metaphysical crisis and trial of human values of loyalty fidelity not the same thing and the problems of responsibility and obligations that are implemented by love once it gets started.When Maurice Bendrix loses Sarah and can't understand why this triggers his investigation of her case which her husband rightly questions and Maurice admits himself that you don't do that. What he finds is more or less by accident and totally unintentional which could excuse him but on the other hand if he hadn't done this forbidden thing he wouldn't have learned the truth and there would have been no story.However it's Deborah Kerr as Sarah that impersonates the drama and the tragedy flanked by a number of male actors at their best even John Mills as a detective and Graham Greene must have felt flattered by this film. He could have had no more ideal director for it than Edward Dmytryk one of the best directors and human instructors in film history perhaps the very best one together with Elia Kazan.".

She likes Johnson too and they are quickly copulating. There is a problem however. Kerr is married to British civil servant Peter Cushing as Henry Miles. During an air raid Kerr and Johnson are having a tryst and Johnson is injured. Kerr finds Johnson dead and asks God to bring him back to life. In return Kerr promises The End of the Affair...God answers Kerr's prayer but doesn't tell Johnson why he's being dumped. He assumes she's found another man. The misunderstandings get more complicated after Johnson decides to hire private investigator John Mills as Albert Parkis to snoop on Kerr for Mr. Cushing...Original novelist Graham Greene's spiritual story receives good direction from Edward Dmytryk and gets some nice blackandwhite scenes from Wilkie Cooper. The supporting cast is very good. At the time Kerr received more praise from Johnson who was thought miscast...In reality they both act well in the roles. However Kerr doesn't have any otherworldly appeal she's lovely but doesn't strike an erotic note. Johnson is likewise fine but he doesn't compensate for Kerr with any animal magnetism. They don't get to know each other very well so it must be all sex which we don't see. It's also interesting that Johnson first sees Kerr kissing another man we assume she's had a string of affairs but are left misinformed.

	schema:reviewBody "One Magic Christmas is one of my favorite Christmas movies of all time. While I don't remember seeing it in the theater apparantly I did but I had just turned 3 years old I watched our videotaped copy recorded off of the Disney Channel circa 1986 so many times as a little girlregardless of the season the first few minutes of the tape literally wore out filling with snow and static. This and the fact that I had every line memorized has become something of Christmas Lore in my family. Tonight Christmas 2005 I watched the film again with my parents and sister for the first time in many years and was stuck by several things first how well the film has held up over the last twentyyears second how special and unique the message is from traditional family holiday movies that were made in the 80s and 90s and third how I still remember many of the lines of dialog  they are indelibly etched into my brain after literally hundreds of viewings.One Magic Christmas is sort of an alternate take on It's a Wonderful Life  centering around a family who has fallen on hard times with a mother who never says Merry Christmas and is generally devoid of any holiday sentiment altogether. Her daughter Abbie together with the Christmas Angel Gideon embark on a plan to help her refind the Christmas spirit.Mary Steenburgen is fantastic as the loving but icy mother. Her performance is very real  she is both funny and dramatic and her character is developed in a way that most family films omit. Harry Dean Stanton is perfect as Gideon the angel  calming and knowing. You believe he is who he says he is. The child actors in the film are equally fantastic. In a family film the kids can either make it or break it. These children act like real kids  they aren't trying to be cute for the camera although they really are adorable  and this is coming from someone who dislikes most children on TVmovies and they hold their own with their adult counterparts with ease. The little girl that plays Abbie is effortless in her portrayal of a girl with an nonwavering belief in Santa Clause.Honestly one of the things I think that I like best about this film is how real it seems. Considering magic and faith are primary elements of the story  this really says something. The acting is so good the dialog believable that the more mystical situations do not seem out of bounds. The film also delves into darker more realistic themes than you get in most family fare. This is really exceptional especially considering this was a Disney picture. The ultimate message of the film is heartening and poignant  even for those of us who are grown and longsince stopped believing in Santa and magic.This is one of those movies that just feels good to watch. I can honestly say even if this film didn't have the sentimental value it does for me I would still recommend it as an excellent Christmas movie.".

So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas angel who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee Nazis on the lam. The movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this film wanted to be something Capralike but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be.".

In this familiar story of a woman who has lost the Christmas spirit and rediscovers it through being shown how fortunate she is there are several excellent performancesand a strong feeling of magic throughout.Mary Steenburgen who plays Ginnie Grainger the woman who has lost theChristmas spirit undergoes an amazing transformation and some of the mostheartwrenching moments I've seen on film. Harry Dean Stanton as the angelGideon plays his part with sensitivity and Gary Basaraba is excellent as Jack Ginnie's husband. Abbie the sixyear old daughter of the main character steals the show however. She never seems to be acting and carries the innocence of childhood and the magic of Christmas with her. Keep an eye out for a veryyoung Sarah Polley as Molly Monaghan and veteran Canadian actor JanRubes as the best Santa Claus on film to date if only for his amazing costume.Keep a box of tissues on hand when you watch this movie! It demonstrates that a movie can be magical without overwhelming special effects and that aChristmas movie can be sentimental without being schmaltzy.".

Abbie the sixyear old daughter of the main character steals the show however. She never seems to be acting and carries the innocence of childhood and the magic of Christmas with her. Keep an eye out for a veryyoung Sarah Polley as Molly Monaghan and veteran Canadian actor JanRubes as the best Santa Claus on film to date if only for his amazing costume.Keep a box of tissues on hand when you watch this movie! It demonstrates that a movie can be magical without overwhelming special effects and that aChristmas movie can be sentimental without being schmaltzy.";

	schema:headline " Bittersweet holiday fantasy. Not for tots.";
	schema:reviewBody "Exquisitely made holiday fable with a decidedly dark edge not unlike It's a Wonderful Life in tone. Mary Steenburgen is very convincing as a woman whose heart has been hardened by life's harsh realities. Christmas has become an empty ritual to her and it takes a highly unusual angel named Gideon played by a softspoken Harry Dean Stanton in a long cattleman's duster to make her see the light. Her conversion requires some grim but realistic machinations by Gideon as well as the simple and unquestioning faith of her optimistic husband and children. But the result is an emotionally powerful finale that is honestly earned not the easy tearjerking of lesser films. Special mention should be made of the two terrific child actors who play Steenburgen's kids especially Elizabeth Harnois as the youngest Abbie whose unsticky line readings are a treat. Character actor Jan Rubes makes a wonderful matteroffact Santa Claus. The production is further enhanced by Frank Tidy's meticulous cinematography some imaginative art direction particularly in Santa's toy shop and a lovely score by Michael Conway Baker. Thomas Meehan's scenario delves into some dark territory for a genre that is all too often treacly instead of real but its clear antecedents are treasures such as A Christmas Carol and the aforementioned Capra classic. A word of caution however this is not recommended for very young children. But for 8 and above and adults it's a Christmas tale that may well become a perennial in your house as it is in mine.".

The children's responses as tragedy unfolds are remarkable simple direct and real.

It's nice to see a holiday film that cuts through the schmaltz. People often label It's a Wonderful Life as being too sentimental and sappy but seem to overlook the themes of suicide child abuse poverty and death that run throughout the film. Things have to hit rock bottom for George Bailey to see the value of his life as is the case in this film. The sheer darkness of what could be as shown by the angel Gideon make Ginny's embracing the Christmas spirit all the more resonant.".

Most young children between the ages 4 through 10 are not going to understand the plot or point to this film because it is kind of a dark and depressing film. Even though at the end Ginny turned out to like Christmas throughout the movie was very tense especially the scene where Harry kills Jack at the bank. Even though it was all part of Ginny's dream by Gideon to like Christmas most young children are not going to understand that along with many other scenes in her dream. So the bottom line is if you have young children between the ages of 4 to 10 sit with them when they watch this movie because it may frighten them like it did me when I was 5 years old.".

Her husband lost his job and the house months ago but he's a kind poetic soul who can't really be bothered with mundane issues like being poor and homeless. Ginny is not a Grinch or a Scrooge literally the only reason why she values money so much is because her husband won't and right now it's up to her to make sure her kids don't starve. How fair is it to be mad at someone who works her awful retail job until late at night on Christmas Eve when the alternative is getting fired as well? Or for not letting her husband touch their very last meager savings to open the bike shop he vaguely dreams about? And still she tries to be there for her family and not spoil the holidays for the little ones too much no matter how hopeless and empty inside she is herself.A woman like that would need a lot more appreciation from her loved ones and some me time stat. But no according to old St. Nick what she needs is a serious lesson in Christmas Spirit! She won't even say Merry Christmas! How dares she be so bitter and disenchanted? Not on his watch! So he sends her Gideon a Christmas Angel who wears a creepy black coat never cracks a smile looks all the time like he's really uncomfortable with his job likes to stalk people approaches children in secret at night STRANGER DANGER! and only ever does the bare minimum his job requires.During what is no doubt her worst Christmas Eve in the history of ever Ginny finds out her husband is taking their savings behind her back gets fired faces her husband only to see him randomly getting shot and dying in her arms has her kids kidnapped by the guy who already killed her husband only to see them fall off a bridge into the river. After believing for several agonizing hours that the children are dead too Gideon FINALLY decides to do something with his magic powers and returns them to her. At this point after everything that already happened poor Ginny has to find the strength to sit down and explain to her two small children that their dad was killed and he's never gonna come back.Gideon then straight up kidnaps the little girl and flies her to meet Santa at the North Pole spoiler alert Santa's workers are not elves they're zombies! thus making Ginny spend her Christmas night in a panic frantically looking for her ONCE AGAIN missing six year old. But then the kid comes back bringing a letter from Santa and suddenly all is fixed as Ginny realizes that magic is real and all she ever needed to do was to believe and smile and suck it up even more to her already unbearable family situation! She is magically taken back in time where her husband is still alive and she gets to relive Christmas Eve and make all the right choices nominally saying to hell with my job and burning all their last savings too while she's at it. I guess if they end up homeless at least they had one hell of a Christmas. Eventually a brand new happy Ginny meets Santa under the tree and finally gets to thank the man who just made an already depressed woman live through the most cruel traumatic series of event ever just to teach her a lesson about magic. Or as I choose to believe Ginny is so traumatized after seeing her whole family die that she hallucinates Gideon and Santa to give herself a happy ending and a little peace of mind before the years and years of therapy she will no doubt need.".

What twisted soul at Disney thought of this additional part is beyond me.I guess that in today's world no one blinks an eye when a real parent kills off his or her own children.

	schema:reviewBody "For many Like Someone In Love may be a boring film to watch but others are about to be engrossed by characters their stories interactions and even a drive through Tokyo. Or just be fascinated by the director's style. Or love the outside of main character Akiko played by Rin Takanashi and her appearance and hate her dilemma and inconsiderate duplicity. Or be engulfed in utter dismal sorrow at the treatment of Akiko's grandmother played by Kaneko Kubota which in terms of sheer emotional sadness is second only to Tomi Hirayama's life and death in Tokyo Story. Here is a film that in turn will induce absurdity embarrassment squirming love lust hate loathing discomfort and pity. Akiko is a typical Tokyo girl. She is from Fukuroi in Shizuoka. She is pretty has a fianc and is in the city attending university. She however leads a surreptitious existence. We know this soon enough because we quickly put two and two together based on her conversation with her fianc Noriaski played by Ryo Kase and the persons she shares a table with a manipulative and filthy Hiroshi played by Denden and Nagisa played by Reiko Mori. Foreign directors in Japan could go one of two ways. It could be a Lost in Translation Sofia CoppolaGrade A or a Map Of The Sounds Of Tokyo Isabel CoixetGrade C. Look for sequences in Tokyo and Yokohoma including the entrance to Daisan Keihin Road and Aoyama Book Centre. This is not Adrift In Tokyo yet the drive at night is so commonplace and yet simultaneously so pivotal. How could one not grade this film more like the former film than the latter? As the film opens Akiko is heard but not seen. This is the first of many intrigues in a story where most things are implied and perceived and not spelt out for us. Then we see manipulation and deceit in multiple backandforths. The story unfolds in realtime as a peculiar drama in which patience is a necessity. Should one persevere the film literally makes an art form of making the viewer guess what is going on now and what will come next. Images are seen as reflections one overhears conversations being conducted offcamera and one listens for the consequences without actually seeing the incidents' instigators. There are a few sequences of levity as with Akiko's interaction with Watanabe's neighbour and the latter person's with her brother. The earlier almostmonologue itself is delivered with breathless conviction. Speaking of which each of the admittedly few cast members exudes an amazing ability to make the acting look easy when it is anything but. After all it is anything but given that the characterdriven focus and a lack of special effects and graphics will have to hold our attention. Yet they do and at length. Ryo Kase in particular delivers such a convincing performance that I for one could not have foreseen after seeing him in Hachimitsu To Clover. He might as well not have been an actor in a film but a boyfriend being lied to by a woman in his real life I am not lying to you she assures him as she lies to him and deceived as usual making Akiko a shameless wench in more than one way playing it straight as the uncaring female type while Noriaski is as bewildered as any man who has lost a woman to dishonesty. Make no mistake about it. Like Someone In Love's honesty and cruelty lies in showing Akiko as a casual and professional deceiver as she only outwardly frets to not be one or be unhappy about herself and her actions. Her acting is natural and matteroffact perhaps practiced from the life of a modern woman.The film however disappoints many with its ending. Like the rest of this piece of art leaves much to the imagination of the audience. Using the word 'piece' however might be apropos given what the director likely wanted to convey at the end. Include in the disappointed group this writer. Likely a decade ago the joke would have been that the director and studio ran out of money. A more likely culprit is the Zen of Like Someone In Love. Zen is a Chinese Buddhist school that emphasized the now above all else. Earlier in the film Watanabe sings 'whatever will be will be' and alternately counsels Noriaski to let it go and advises Akiko to stop fretting and let things happen. As it turns out he is ignored and is wrong in that sequence but the director and writer's script direction is based upon emphasizing the present moment at every turn. Amazing as it is Like Someone In Love falls short because it assumes too much and does not give us a definite ending.Like Someone In Love is quite impressive in another regard. The grandmother is never properly seen but even with the Japanese capacity to sadden her part is dismal. She is an old woman in a strange town longing for love and family having left her infirm husband behind for a day only to connect and bond and what happens instead is as sad as anything one could see. The buildup is masterful. Akiko's cruelty to among others the older generation and the latter's patience is indeed alternately reminiscent of Tokyo Story and The Only Son and even more cruel because it is so easily rectifiable and generational. Kudos goes to the direction and cinematography which depict such loneliness all around in a metropolis of thirteen million. It should be noted  because of the earlier emphasis on the Japanese sensibility  now that the story and direction come courtesy of an Iranian in this FrancoJapanese coproduction which in the latter case makes it by happenstance related to one of Japan's most controversial films In The Realm Of Senses. Akiko a beautiful woman with such an ugly life behaviour and personality except that is how it is usually isn't it?".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of what happens in this film is implicit and off screen. The director chooses to focus on a few brief encounters and a newly forged fragile relationship between a call girl and an esteemed older Sociology professor who lives 1 hour outside of the city. Though seemingly simple plotwise the brilliance and intricacies come to life in our minds long after the film ends.The audience isn't provided with a substantial backstory this is a sliver of time we're exposed to and we reckon that Akiko is a student who moved to Tokyo and struggled with finances so she began moonlighting as a call girl after her classes and exams after finding success due to her exceptional though generic beauty. She mentions that she often reminds people of others perhaps her universal familiarity is her allure allowing her clients to project whatever they want her to be leaving the real Akiko unfamiliar to everyone including herself clearly a stranger even to her suspicious for good reason and controlling fianc who we can assume gives the emotionally damaged Akiko some sense of stability in a twisted form of consuming love that she can accept. It's unclear if the relationship was ever good or if Akiko's compartmentalization and doublelife has created the toxic dynamic that exists in the time we're privy to.Akiko's pimp sends her to a client old enough to be her grandfather. Formerly a student of this aging Sociology professor her pimp holds him in high esteem. It's apparent that Akiko seems comfortable immediately with the professor and undresses soon after she arrives and passes out in his bed. He's patient with her despite her refusal to eat dinner with him which he prepared for her and silently watches over her as she sleeps. The next morning he takes her to school while she continues to sleep. In our sleep we are the most vulnerable so these scenes show us the immediate comfort the two feel in each others' presence.While he waits for her he meets Akiko's fianc who is also waiting for her. Through masterful and cryptic dialogue the fianc assumes the professor is Akiko's grandfather. We see what we want to see seems to be the message the director is insisting on despite very obvious clues that not all is what it seems ex. Akiko's fianc has an advertisement with Akiko's photo on it advertising her services Akiko never mentioned her grandfather visiting only her grandmother and her grandfather is a fisherman not a professor. The ambiguity of their relationship echoes that of Abbas' film 'Certified Copy' where we're not sure what's real what's pretend what's a dream and who's who.The abrupt ending literally shatters a lot of what we've come to understand in this poetic soft film. Perhaps making up for the slow beginning and shocking us to our senses the ending calls into question a much more that happens non diegetically how did the fianc find out within the few hours he was denying the truth and now? Is the Professor alright? With so little actually explained in the film our minds run wild with answers filling in the complex backstories that we personalize.All we really understand is that the Professor sees Akiko as familiar because she resembles his wife and granddaughter and though nothing sexual happens at least on screen the nature of their relationship from the outset is of sexual expectations. Perhaps this film is really discussing the innocence of what has darker pretenses on the exterior while also evaluating the darkness that exists within an innocent exterior Akiko.".

	schema:headline " An Iranian director in Japan";
	schema:reviewBody "Like Someone in Love 2012 is a Japanese movie written and directed by the great Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami. Kiarostami brings his quiet thoughtful style to a culture that is surely very alien to him. Japanese viewers may note cultural errors in the movie. My thought is that Kiarostami can look beyond cultural differences to universal themes.The movie set in Tokyo stars Rin Takanashi as Akiko a young provincial woman who is a call girl. She doesn't walk the streets. She works out of a bar whose owner arranges the sessions at people's homes. As the movie opens Akiko is facing two immediate problems. Her jealous boyfriend is on the phone demanding to know where she is. Akiko is a college student and her boyfriend is aware of that. He doesn't know that she's a prostitute but he can sense that something isn't right and he suspects her of cheating.Akiko's grandmother is visiting Tokyo that day and desperately wants to see Akiko. Akiko would love to meet with her but the bar owner is adamantshe must go out on a call to an important client. The client is Professor Takashi Watanabe played by Tadasi Okuno. Akiko has no choice but to ignore her grandmother and visit the professor's apartment.Prof. Watanabe is a gentle lonely widower. He has prepared a special dinner for Akiko and he's playing Western music. It's Ella Fitzgerald singing Like Someone in Love. It's more like a seduction scene than a paid sexual encounter.Akiko spends the night at the professor's home and he drives her to the university the next morning. It's at that point that the film takes a different turn because Akiko's violent boyfriend confronts her on the university steps. All of this action takes place in the first third of the movie. In the remainder of the film Kiarostami continues to explore this unusual and somewhat threatening love triangle. This interaction among three very different individuals provides a fascinating look into human relationships. Where these relationships will lead isn't always obvious or predictable. I enjoyed this intelligent thoughtprovoking movie. It will work well on DVD. It's worth seeking out and watching.".

He started writing poems that resembled Haiku when he was just 20! The serene nonchalant and often profoundly philosophical language of haiku allows the poet to swiftly touch on the core of the universal human condition love despair humor death as his movies do and now Kiarostami made his last movie and one of the best ones where Haiku was blossomed Japan. All these said I can't ignore the innovative cinematographic techniques he used in Like Someone in Love that adds to the beauty of this movie.

Ultimately the story is about subtleties and there are many blink and you miss it moments. A good example of this would be Akiko's taxi ride through Tokyo at the beginning of this movie this scene is absolutely heart breaking and is in many ways the pivotal moment of this movie yet there is virtually no dialogue spoken by the actors on screen only a series of phone messages playing over the background noise. The simplicity of this scene twinned with Akiko's reaction is enough to have the stoniest of hearts melting by the time the taxi ride has reached it's destination.So if you are willing to stay the duration you may be rewarded with a touching if some what incomplete love story for those who expect a sense of closure you may find Pretty Woman is more up your street.".

The simplicity of this scene twinned with Akiko's reaction is enough to have the stoniest of hearts melting by the time the taxi ride has reached it's destination.So if you are willing to stay the duration you may be rewarded with a touching if some what incomplete love story for those who expect a sense of closure you may find Pretty Woman is more up your street.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like Someone in Love is Abbas Kiarostami's followup to the mind bending relationship drama Certified Copy. Dissection of the title alone provides so many interesting clues and directions for the film to take in addition to what was analyzed previously. And while it does in fact address those interesting ideas indirectly it is as minimal as any filmgoing audience could possibly stand. We essentially watch an unexplained relationship unfold in almost realtime just under 24 hours.Akiko Rin Takashi is a collegeaged girl up to something in the big city of Tokyo that is probably not good for her. She's having an argument with her boyfriend on the phone and she's saying no to a job that a middleaged man is offering her. This middleaged man is clearly her pimp and no means yes sir I will do whatever you tell me to. So into the cab Akiko goes and we begin to worry about her safety. We spent an awful long time worrying about her safety with no idea what lies ahead for her. The cab ride was two hours long and we saw a lot of it. Akiko arrives at the apartment of an older gentleman looking for companionship. We don't really know what exactly Takashi Watanabe Tadashi Okuno wanted with Akiko and then in the morning he drives her back to Tokyo. Another long car ride.Visually the car rides were impeccably shot. The scenery was reflected in the windshield and we could still see the characters' faces behind. Unfortunately we don't really know what's happening with these characters during these long car rides. Sometimes a car ride is just a car ride.Eventually we meet Noriaki Ryo Kase Akiko's offensive boyfriend. And he starts putting the relationships into perspective. A different perspective. He allows Akiko and Watanabe to act differently than they actually are which allows us to start seeing them as they actually are. And then it ends. Well not quite that quickly but without giving anything away it ends.We're given so little on screen to examine that it can be frustrating even to the viewers that appreciate the subtle beauty in film. Two weeks after first seeing it my mind has started to form a few opinions on what was being said but it's still a bit too little too late.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never before seen a film by Abbas Kiarostami. But he is an esteemed film maker having won a Palme d'Or in Cannes and Iranian directors have quite a reputation so I thought I could enjoy this movie. How wrong I was. The most appropriate word to describe this film is annoying. It consists of extremely long shots with a static camera confusing dialogue and distracting side stories that don't serve any purpose. I have nothing against slow movies in fact sometimes I like them a lot. But in this movie the director seems to make all possible efforts to make everything as least attractive as possible. The audience has to endure slow conversations about whether the lead character resembles someone on a painting or about the crush a woman has had all her life on an aging neighbour. That would be tolerable if it served any purpose if it added something to the story or the mood of the film. But it doesn't.The camera registers a day in the life of Akiko a student who secretly works as a call girl. She ignores her grandmother who calls her to have lunch during her visit to Tokyo but instead visits a bar and takes a taxi to visit a client although she is supposed to prepare her exams. By pure coincidence the client meets her boyfriend who doesn't know about her work and her secret life is exposed. All this in a few excruciatingly long and slow scenes. Of course there are people who argue that this kind of film deliberately denies the rules of mainstream movie making. It's different and we're not used to that. Why does everything have to serve a purpose? Why can't things just happen because they do? Just like in real life? And why are we annoyed when these things are filmed with a motionless camera instead of with fast edited slick camera movements? True. It can be quite refreshing to see directors moving away from what movies are supposed to look like. But in this case it felt too much like showing off. By trying to do his own thing Kiarostami neglects the needs of the audience. The best thing about this movie is the Ella Fitzgerald song it's named after which is featured on the soundtrack.".

It's clear she doesn't like the work much and grumbles when the proprietor tells her to go to an old and well respected client. She doesn't want to go but finally agrees. It's hinted she has financial problems with her bank. Her granny from the village has come to Tokyo for the day and wants to get together with her. Little does she know.The old and well respected client turns out to be a retired professor of sociology who still conducts research in his field. All he wants to do is chat with Akiko over dinner and feed her the broth with small shrimp he's prepared. It's a delicacy of the village where she comes from. Turns out she hates it. She's exhausted from study and just wants to sleep. The prof doesn't disturb her. It's not clear if he does this kind of thing regularly with young women or if it's just a onetime shot.When Akiko awakens the prof drives her to the university Tokyo University I guess she's attending. As she's going up the steps she meets and argues with a young man who's clearly waiting for her. The prof sees all this from his car. Akiko enters the building. The young man approaches the prob for a light for his cigarette and pretty soon he's invited into the car. Turns out he's Akiko's fianc. He's a mechanic and can't wait to marry her. The prof warns him about getting married too young. Young man doesn't hear a word of it. He thinks the prof is Akiko's grandfather. The prof enigmatically tells the young man that he could just as well be the young man's grandfather as Akiko's.The young man determines the prof's Volvo needs a new drive belt. The car gets fixed in the young man's shop. The young man also hints that he suspects Akiko's hooking. In the shop one of the prof's former student's having his car fixed and tells the prof how much he learned from him.The prof drives back to his flat. He receives a panic call from Akiko abruptly leaving off telling a man on the phone what changes need to be made to his manuscript and jumps into his car. He finds Akiko in tears in an alley. Argument with boy friendfianc. He's found out she's hooking. The prof takes her back to his flat. Boyfriendfianc determines where the prof lives. Although we don't see him he stands on the street outside of the prof's flat shouting at the top of his lungs for Akiko to come out. She doesn't. He lobs a rock at the window shattering it. End.We don't know the characters well enough to feel much for them. There is little drama. Less action. Akiko isn't ready for marriage. Probably met the young man through loneliness and went on a few dates with him. Who knows? The fianc already wants control over her life even before they're married. Where does all of this go? Your guess is as good as mine. I'm probably missing something deep and significant but I don't know what it is. The angst of youth? Making it in the big city is tough on a young girl short on bucks? The film suggests it's either hooking or marrying for her. Rin Takanashi is certainly very nice eyecandy and does a credible job as the confused and confusing Akiko. Good try but doesn't make it.610".

	schema:headline " A Moody Film About The Impossibility of Love";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone expecting the classical forms of plot and characterization in this film will be sadly disappointed. LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE has a minimal plot  a young student Akiko Rin Takanashii who may or may not be a prostitute visits the home of elderly writer Takashi Watnabe Tadashi Okuno an affection develops between them even though no physical contact takes place. Watnabe encounters Akiko's fianc Noriaki Ry Kase and convinces him that the two are related Noriaki finds out that Watnabe is lying and comes to his apartment and smashes a window Abbas Kiarostami's focuses more on shifting moods  the sad resignation of Akiko as she goes about her business neither enjoying nor appreciating it the blank face of the cabdriver who takes her to Watnabe's apartment the wistful looks of Watnabe as he looks at Akiko for him she might be both desirable yet also an object of regret for his own lost youth. Kiarostami refuses to give us the security of explaining his characters' motivations he leaves it up to us to make our own decisions. Comprised of long closeups interspersed with shotreverse shot sequences the film is more focused on what is not said rather than the dialog. What gives LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE its true freshness is the quality of its visual imagery the film is chock full of prison images we see the protagonists sitting in Watnabe's car through the windscreen the world outside reflected in the class the bright lights of Tokyo streets fade into a blur as the yellow cab drives through seemingly endless long and straight boulevards Akiko is seen sleeping in Watnabe's bed through the frosted glass of the bedroom door while Akiko and Watnabe exchange their dialog in the confined spaces of Watnabe's apartment or Watnabe's car. Through such techniques Kiarostani shows us how the characters are prisoners both of themselves  and their inability to disclose their feelings  and the urban environment which confines them both night and day. The denouement is both unexpected and in terms of the film's thematic preoccupations quote shocking by smashing Watnabe's window Noriaki both literally and figuratively tries to break the prisonlike atmosphere. But there is a sad irony here although we see the window breaking we do not see any resolution as far as the characters are concerned. The title and the Ella Bitzgerald song that is heard regularly on the soundtrack are likewise ironic the characters can never fall in love but they merely act like someone in love.".

Watnabe encounters Akiko's fianc Noriaki Ry Kase and convinces him that the two are related Noriaki finds out that Watnabe is lying and comes to his apartment and smashes a window Abbas Kiarostami's focuses more on shifting moods  the sad resignation of Akiko as she goes about her business neither enjoying nor appreciating it the blank face of the cabdriver who takes her to Watnabe's apartment the wistful looks of Watnabe as he looks at Akiko for him she might be both desirable yet also an object of regret for his own lost youth. Kiarostami refuses to give us the security of explaining his characters' motivations he leaves it up to us to make our own decisions. Comprised of long closeups interspersed with shotreverse shot sequences the film is more focused on what is not said rather than the dialog. What gives LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE its true freshness is the quality of its visual imagery the film is chock full of prison images we see the protagonists sitting in Watnabe's car through the windscreen the world outside reflected in the class the bright lights of Tokyo streets fade into a blur as the yellow cab drives through seemingly endless long and straight boulevards Akiko is seen sleeping in Watnabe's bed through the frosted glass of the bedroom door while Akiko and Watnabe exchange their dialog in the confined spaces of Watnabe's apartment or Watnabe's car. Through such techniques Kiarostani shows us how the characters are prisoners both of themselves  and their inability to disclose their feelings  and the urban environment which confines them both night and day. The denouement is both unexpected and in terms of the film's thematic preoccupations quote shocking by smashing Watnabe's window Noriaki both literally and figuratively tries to break the prisonlike atmosphere. But there is a sad irony here although we see the window breaking we do not see any resolution as far as the characters are concerned. The title and the Ella Bitzgerald song that is heard regularly on the soundtrack are likewise ironic the characters can never fall in love but they merely act like someone in love.";

	schema:reviewBody "Crossing cultures and language barriers is something happening more and more in cinema with wellknown directors establishing their name for making films from their homeland looking abroad to try out their skills in a different culture. With 'Like Someone to Love' Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami heads to Japan to work with a Japanese cast and crew to look at the concept of love from various different angles and perspectives. Akiko a young student working as a prostitute ignores both her grandmother and fianc to let herself be talked into working the night before an exam. But her client an aging academic seems more to simply want an evening's company than full sex with a woman. Seeing her off to her exam the next morning both Akiko and her client Takashi are left to deal with the consequences of her deceit. 'Like Someone in Love' is a film that is lacking in many respects but indulgent in others. Various plot holes leave the audience having to make their own deductions as to how things developed rather than making it clear on watching. Time that could have been spent on this is instead spent on lengthy shots with little actual action. The first two scenes consist of one half of an extended phone conversation followed by a close up of Akiko in the back of a taxi listening to all seven of her voicemail messages. With this the case the audience can be forgiven for thinking that the next two hours will be excruciatingly long. The film despite lacking in plot is more an analysis of the different relationships Akiko has with the people in her life her dutiful grandmother whom she ignores her pronetoaggression fianc Noriaki whom she deceives and her client the aging Takashi whom she turns to in crisis. The most likable of the three main characters is Takashi whose bumbling around Akiko provide some humour and his earnest assistance to her show him to simply be a kind man that is lonely. His discussion with Noriaki is perhaps the film's most important indicating that neither Noriaki and Akiko are ready for marriage. But while humour and wisdom come from Takashi in parts other flaws lead 'Like Someone to Love' to miss as much as it hits. While the question is asked as to what Akiko sees in Noriaki the question could also be asked with the roles reversed with the only good relationship Akiko appearing to have one with someone she has known less than 24 hours making her less of an appealing character than required in the lead coming across more as a spoiled brat than abused victim. The sudden development in Noriaki's anger requires assumptions to be made rather than good storytelling. The intentional sudden and abrupt ending shows the problems that misguided love has brought the trio to and in that sense the film works in getting its point across. Though one could argue that Kiarostami takes too long to get there. Having made many shorts in the past perhaps 'Like Someone to Love' would have been better made in a much shorter format with the idea good but the execution like the film's characters somewhat misguided and indulgent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and then I search IMDb's list of movies to find something to watch when I feel like I have seen everything I could have wished to watch. But I stumbled across this movie saw the trailer and gave it a shot. It had a sort of Lost in Translation vibe to it so I gave it a chance.Like Someone In Love focuses on three main characters. The first being Akiko played by Rin Takanashi who is a college student who does escort work Noriaki played by Ryo Kase who is jealous manboy who vies for Akiko's affections and then Takashi Watanabe played by Tadashi Okuno who is an old man who asks for Akiko's company from her boss pimp Hiroshi played by Denden.The story for the film deals with Akiko's life as an escort. At first though you think it is simply about this young girl dealing with a jealous boyfriend but as the movie goes on we realize that Hiroshi a sort of pimp is perhaps forcing Akiko into her current profession. But unlike Akiko's friend Nagisa played by Reiko Mori who seemingly is given to whoever Akiko is special. Because of this she seemingly has some leeway but ultimately she belongs to Hiroshi who sends her to be with his former professor Takashi. Upon meeting him we assume the worst e.g. the pervy old Japanese man who probably buys underwear from vending machines. Luckily though he seems to be more so the type of old man which wishes for some company and conversation rather than sex with a 20something year old. After meeting he takes on the role of pretending to be her grandfather thanks to various characters having said assumption. But then we meet Noriaki the wouldbe jealous boyfriend and with him you realize as well as when you reflect on the film why the title of the film is Like Someone In Love.Now the film itself is very strange. The reason for this is because you aren't ever really sure where it is going. Akiko appears and as you get comfortable with her you think the worst. However until we meet Noriaki the film seems very light and sort of sweet. The reason I say this is because Takashi after you realize he isn't a perv you realize is just a sweet old man who wants some company. His wife is gone daughter is who knows where and all he has is books and no real human company. So it makes his moments with Akiko sweet until she decides to try to flirt with him. Another thing I liked was Noriaki's character to a point. To be honest while I find his patriarchy point of view problematic you had to give it to the actor portraying him. Very much so the bit he is able to do within the movie made me think of Laurence Fishburn as Ike Turner in What's Love Got To Do With It. But instead of charm he gave us genuine vulnerability which is why I called him a man boy in the character introductions. You can see he really does have feelings for Akiko but he has feelings for the idea of her and because he can't advance to really get to know her he is unable to deal with his frustrations so he lashes out. With all that said though if you just watch the movie and don't really analyze it you wonder what was the point of the movie? Before writing this review I didn't get this movie at all. However after going to the IMDb boards and checking some comments only then you understand what this movie is trying to portray. Before that though I was wondering what were we necessarily supposed to get out of Akiko's adventures with this lonely old man? Was he supposed to play fauxgrandpa long enough to save her? Make up for her ditching her grandma because she was forced to work? And what of Noriaki? The boy has issues and we aren't fully sure how in the world those two came together. Was he someone she knew before her profession or during? Much less the ending is so abrupt that it makes the film feel slightly incomplete.Overall Worth Viewing but No Rush As a film I would say off the bat I wouldn't physically go to the movies or really go out of my way to see this. But I must admit that I grew to appreciate it once I fully understood the intentions of the movie and began to appreciate the character portrayals. With that said though I feel if I need to put a disclaimer or search about to get a movie perhaps it isn't worth really recommending. So while it isn't a bad movie even after it being broken down it doesn't really stand out in any way to make it worth recommending.".

For the most part these people simply talk about their problems their relationships and life itself and Kiarostami films sequences in 'real time' and with a fixed camera just as he does in his Iranian films.

There are sequences throughout the film were there is no dialogue spoken for five to ten minutes at a time. Instead the director allows the pictures to tell the story to the viewer without dialogue. Its these quiet scenes that are this film's biggest strength. All the emotions on all the actors faces are conveyed and delivered beautifully. One thing I will say is that the conclusion of the film will not suit every viewer. It may have a very abrupt ending but it is an ending that allows the viewer to draw their own conclusion. A wonderfully acted film from what is a very small cast and a great piece of drama. Highly recommended.".

A previous reviewer mentioned that he thought that 'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia' was more successful in its use of the slow burn. I felt myself that once that excellent movie moved back to the city it lost that mystical intrigue and bordered on the ponderous. If I have any criticism of 'Like Someone in Love' it is that I wanted it to go on longer! Most people have mentioned that the abrupt ending comes so unexpectedly and so swiftly that it feels to some like they've been cheated. I can understand that point of view as you want to know how things pan out and you DON'T but I don't think Kiarostami is interested in narrative structure in the way that Hollywood would insist upon. His interest lies in identity and concealment and how our behaviour and persona are affected by our relationships with others. And there are not many countries where the real self is more consistently hidden beneath a veneer than Japan.All in all I was mesmerised partly due to the physical beauty of Rin Takanashi and the fragility of her character. The phone message sequence in the taxi is absolutely heartbreaking. The look of the film had me transfixed also the reflections on glass windows and the deliberate physical compartmentalisation of the characters was such a vital part of the film's meaning and was also aesthetically beautiful.I can't wait to see it again but I know others may feel differently.".

I feel like it's the long uphill struggle on a roller coaster only when you get to the highly anticipated top the tracks flatline for five miles going two miles per hour and then switches tracks and goes up again. Many of the side stories go absolutely nowhere and dissolve into thin air. Who is this old man? In the beginning of the film the main character is told she must see this man and she'll understand why when she gets there. I still don't understand. Is he supposed to take care of her? The film also makes the boyfriend look like a bad person but his girlfriend lied to him. She is the one at fault for not telling him she was a prostitute. The end of the movie is absolutely worthless. The man spends his time walking around looking out the windows only to be hit by a rock. The end. Where was the plot? Oh yeah it called in sick and decided to move as far away from the movie as possible. This review jumps around with incomplete thoughts to simulate how the whole movie went.If movies were compared to food a good movie would have the appetizer followed by the side dishes and main course then a sweet dessert conclusion. This movie had no meat nothing sweet and nothing nutrisious to eat! It was more like a bag of expired potato chips each chip being as boring as the last nothing different. Pretty soon all of the chips movie scenes are gone and you're just looking in an empty bag with no filling satisfaction.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie's main attraction is of course the protagonist played by Viktor Tzoi  famous Russian rock mucisian who died tragically in a car accident merely two years after making this movie. The film's plot is quite primitive and unoriginal.  Moro Tzoi comes to AlmaAta and tries to save his junky girlfriend from drug addiction but runs into trouble with the local drug mafia. The lowest point of the film are Tzoi's pathetic attempts to imitate Bruce Lee.  Plus his coolness comes off as a bit forced and pompous. Despite all that director Rashid Nugmanov was able to create some pretty cool moments with addition of postmodern twists and some surreal scenes. Piotr Mamonov's performance as an evil doctor also helps.The film's soundtrack including original music by Tzoi's band KINO is also very cool and really contributes to the overall feeling of the movie.This movie was originally released in Russia in 1989 and as a teenager I still remember that all the people especially the young impressionable kids agreed that the movie's final scene was quite a highlight.  I don't want to give it away although it's not as mindblowing as you might think and it's definitely not up to the standard of contemporary Western movies but I still think that it's pretty effective especially with KINO's hit song playing in the background. To sum it up I will say that if you are not Russian and not into rock music there isn't much you will get out of this movie. Personally I still like it quite a bit but in a nostalgic sort of way.".

Piotr Mamonov's performance as an evil doctor also helps.The film's soundtrack including original music by Tzoi's band KINO is also very cool and really contributes to the overall feeling of the movie.This movie was originally released in Russia in 1989 and as a teenager I still remember that all the people especially the young impressionable kids agreed that the movie's final scene was quite a highlight.  I don't want to give it away although it's not as mindblowing as you might think and it's definitely not up to the standard of contemporary Western movies but I still think that it's pretty effective especially with KINO's hit song playing in the background. To sum it up I will say that if you are not Russian and not into rock music there isn't much you will get out of this movie. Personally I still like it quite a bit but in a nostalgic sort of way.";

	schema:reviewBody "The mere presence of a celebrity is not enough to guarantee commercial as well as critical success of a film. A good film should also possess content depth and form. Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov made history of sorts in 1987 when he made Igla during the heyday of Glasnost and Perestroika in former Russia. At this juncture it would be right if one mentions that we need to eternally thank Russian leader Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev for those bold initiatives which were instrumental in making freedom an attainable dream for countless young Russian people. It is true that Igla refers to a needle but the entire film is not a tragic discourse about drug addiction in Russia as on an official level drug addiction did not exist at all in Russia. It was considered a purely western phenomenon. In Igla we get a chance to see that director Rashid Nugmonov has shot a film which speaks more about the myth surrounding an impossible love which in many ways symbolized the difficult life of young generation in communist era Russia. Igla scores well in all artistic departments as it has great music by Viktor Tsoi which blends perfectly with constructive meaningful lyrics. The major highlight of the film is its imagery which brings forth the bleakness of a troubled nation. For example a visually rich scenes features an abandoned ship lying lost in dry sands of Aral sea. The late Russian rock star Viktor Tsoi is one of the principal reasons to watch this film due to his character having two distinct yet interesting styles. He appears credible as a comical hero who doesn't hesitate to use force in order to accomplish some true to life action scenes. The overall mood of the film is nice despite a minor dose of profane humor.".

He sits above them gathering them into a jar and tells Dina that he never saw scorpions there Kazakhstan 3 years before. Is he simply talking nonsense or is he speaking about the return of the Kazakh people or is he speaking of the failures of the Soviet Union which took away Kazakh identity in exchange for failed modernization? I am a huge fan of the band KINO I remember first hearing their work in the mid80s. I sat down with the director Nugmanov who is a great person. I have also seen The Wild East. I love foreign cinema. Does this mean that my review is biased? Yes to a point....The Needle only available on DVD either nonsubtitled from Russia or in PAL format with multisubtitles from Sweden is one of those movies for those who were fans of Tsoi. You'll read this over and over and over again! However by only taking that position one doesn't understand the HISTORIC importance of a band like KINO or a movie of this type.Once upon a time there was a place called the USSR. There was no allowance for individual expression nor was there any films that were outside of State ideology. There was no drug use there. There were no gangs or blackmarket. That's how it was. Right??? NO. For one Tsoi was extremely popular and his lyrics were beautiful and poetic and his music illegal. Movies that never existed in the eyes of the State somehow did exist The Kommissar Benya Krik Color of Pomegranates. The Soviet Union had its problems just like every country. When you think Vodka what country pops into one's head? It was great to be the state and control EVERY aspect of one's life for Socialism.However there were some great breakaway filmmakers that wanted more regardless of what SSR they originated. Tarkovsky was one he went into selfexile Paradjanov was crucified by authorities but others like Romm were able to toe that fine line. How some other movies passed while others didn't is well worth analyzing. Nugmanov who was best friends with Tsoi made this sole feature that starred the late rock star. Because of this Nugmanov's Igla and The Far East shall go down into history books as significant to the study of the Soviet Union and glasnost film and music and the Kazakh New Wave cinema movement. These movies were made in the waning years of the Soviet Union...The movie is nearly a type of commercial vehicle for Tsoi but it is also a slap in the face to the socialist regime that attempted to squelch free speech. Note the huge ship in the middle of a driedup sea I believe the Aral. The Kazakh people like Nugmanov definitely saw that their country was destroyed by socialist policy. Like the Indians in North America with alcohol abuse drug abuse was a way of life in the SSR but not allowed to be shown. There is no happiness through socialist realism. In reality the SSR is barren overcast seedy and sad. That it the way Nugmanov showed it and he enjoyed placing Tsoi as the lead in it. There are other great characters and acting in the movie most notable is Dina Smirnova and Spartak Bashirov. Oh and the movie is about drug abuse and failed policy but also about the coolness of Tsoi. But the needle could refer to the feelgood socialist realism that is like a drug by the State to distance or hide people from the reality of life. It can also be Nugmanov using film as a needle to inject the audience with a bit of reality. Note how scenes of the movie begin and end with television programs. Try to read that!It's not an entirely original plot but it sure is a good movie even with its ambiguities like why has Tsoi returned and who is he?. Decent film compositions use of acting talent and yes music by KINO!9 of 10.  E.".

While the sequence of events is simple it is revealed obliquely with snatches of information and actions or set pieces that avoid obvious exposition. The real exceptional element is the grim surrealism in how the events are shown us  Dima wearing a mask as Moro first reunites with her is much more eloquent than just saying she seems changed. These elements with artistically outthere steps such as the inclusion of brief drawnon animations and the atmospheric inclusions of outside film and sound clips create an overall feel that's impossible to quite put into words. And the postmodern elements are all included very intelligently  such as when the scene begins to imitate a KungFu or action film only long enough to subvert the trope and show Moro get knocked down. All this is quite impressively film against a very bleaklooking late Soviet Kazakh backdrop that definitely adds to the atmosphere. Tsoy does a very good job actingwise  like some other talented performers without specific acting training he communicates a lot of simple realism and directness that works very well. While the film assumes an antidrug position from the outset there as powerful sense of nihilism in its total position considering the demonstrated outcome of taking personal action the way out hero does.

And what's more there are unexpected phone callers that sound like Eddie and there's a car like Eddie's that dips its lights in the same way that Eddie used to do.  The belief that he may still be alive is reinforced even though Eddie died some 18 years ago.  An intriguing situation!Much of the film is in flashback jumping to  fro between the band of today and the band of years gone by.  One adjusts quickly because Eddie it seems always wears a black leather jacket.In a particular interesting scene Eddie takes his girl friend to an old junk yard one night.  He explains that as a kid he used to hang out there.  One of the workers at the yard built a castle of steel from bits and pieces selected from the dump.  Eddie in a growing mood of despondency explains it is a memorial to nothing.  Much like the boys from Jersey they built up a band from nothing.  I liked the analogy.  Long live nothing he screams below the huge junk heap now illuminated with a million light bulbs.It is interesting that fans refuse to let their rock stars die. I guess it is true  that they really do live on in the songs that they created.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mystery surrounds the death of a rising rock star in director Martin Davidson's Eddie and the Cruisers' starring Tom Berenger and Michael Pare. With one successful album under their belts lead singer and guitarist Eddie Wilson Pare takes his Cruisers into the recording studio to make an album he hopes will stand the world on its collective ear.  Drawing the title from a work by Nineteenth Century poet Arthur Rimbaud they begin to lay down tracks for A Season In Hell.'  But all is not well with Eddie and the band there is dissent and at least one among them bassist Sal Amato Matthew Laurance disagrees with the direction in which Eddie has taken their music.  Early one morning toward the end of the recording sessions Eddie's car goes off a bridge into the river his body is never found.  Now eighteen years later a reporter Maggie Foley Ellen Barkin is doing a story on the Cruisers and attempting to uncover the mystery behind the disappearance of the master tapes from the recording sessions which inexplicably vanished the day after Eddie's apparent death. Pare is perfectly cast as Eddie the Bruce Springsteenlike rocker he lipsynchs convincingly to John Cafferty's vocals and deftly captures the persona of an early sixties rock n' roll idol on the rise.  Tom Berenger who is actually the star of the movie does an excellent job as lyricist Frank Ridgeway the keyboard player known as  Word Man' by the band. Davidson tells the story by effectively using flashbacks through which we get to know Eddie and his band and which establishes the relationships so pertinent to the present day conflicts which emerge during Foley's investigation of Eddie and the missing tapes.  The focus is mainly on Ridgeway therefore as the story unfolds it is predominately from his perspective that we learn what really happened especially on that last night in the recording studio.  That there is a comparison being drawn between Eddie and Jim Morrison of The Doors is unmistakable the plot draws heavily on the myth that Morrison and Eddie is still alive and may have Pulled a Rimbaud.'  Poet Rimbaud who is considered a genius and to whom the creation of the form of modern poetry as we know it is attributed committed artistic suicide' at the age of nineteen at which time he abruptly quit writing and disappeared for the next twenty years only to reappear at last on his deathbed in France.  That the title of Rimbaud's masterpiece is A Season In Hell' is no coincidence.  The parallels are drawn convincingly which heightens the interest and adds to the credibility of the mystery. The supporting cast includes Joe Pantoliano Doc Helen Schneider Joann David Wilson Kenny Michael Antunes Wendell and Kenny Vance Lew.  An excellent soundtrack of original songs written and performed by John Cafferty provided Davidson with a solid base from which to launch his story.  Eddie and the Cruisers' is entertaining if not entirely memorable but the music and performances are good and all in all this movie will do for a pleasant evening's viewing with maybe a little popcorn thrown in for effect.  If you haven't seen this one try it out I think you'll be glad you didn't let it pass you by.  I rate this one 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me preface this by saying that I was born in 1949. I have lived through the evolution of rock 'n roll. Beginning with my older 7 yrs sister's obsession in the 50s and watching American Bandstand as a child. Although Perry Como was my first idol that quickly evolved. And yes I am still a Beatles Girl. I think that I was one of the few people that actually saw this movie twice in its original theatrical release in 1983. I was mesmerized. Yes it could have been the combo of Pare and Berringer et al. Truthfully it is THE perfect blend of music characters mystery Old Nancy Drew enthusiasts do not fade away add a dash of chuck it all I am out of here  and who among us has not entertained THAT idea? class distinction college kids and working class you have the perfect recipe for a kick arse movie. I think it is significant that it is set in 1963 in that tiny little sliver of time that was post JFK election change and youth his assassination November 1963 and before The BeatlesBritish invasion February 1964. When this movie was made MTV was barely a toddling toddler born 1981 and they actually played music. Anyway here it is thirty years later and I am accidentally catching this movie again on AMC.

	onyx:emotionText "Let me preface this by saying that I was born in 1949. I have lived through the evolution of rock 'n roll. Beginning with my older 7 yrs sister's obsession in the 50s and watching American Bandstand as a child. Although Perry Como was my first idol that quickly evolved. And yes I am still a Beatles Girl. I think that I was one of the few people that actually saw this movie twice in its original theatrical release in 1983. I was mesmerized. Yes it could have been the combo of Pare and Berringer et al. Truthfully it is THE perfect blend of music characters mystery Old Nancy Drew enthusiasts do not fade away add a dash of chuck it all I am out of here  and who among us has not entertained THAT idea? class distinction college kids and working class you have the perfect recipe for a kick arse movie. I think it is significant that it is set in 1963 in that tiny little sliver of time that was post JFK election change and youth his assassination November 1963 and before The BeatlesBritish invasion February 1964. When this movie was made MTV was barely a toddling toddler born 1981 and they actually played music. Anyway here it is thirty years later and I am accidentally catching this movie again on AMC. The music characters and story line are still viable. Even the onslaught of 30 years of life is what happens when you are planning something else this movie still mesmerizes me.";

	schema:headline " Best rock  roll movie ever";
	schema:reviewBody "This film along with Amadeus and This Is Spinal Tap has woven its way into the culture and lingo of musicians around the world. Classic lines like Do it my way with the cesarean We ain't greatwe're just a bunch of guys from Jersey and the all time rocker WORDS AND MUSIC with the appropriate finger gesture can be heard in every recording studio and rehearsal room in the English speaking world.So if you're a musicianor even if you just want to hang out with musiciansyou must watch this film otherwise you'll look like a total n00b.Even to nonmusical audiences this movie is a work of art. It's a nostalgic and poetic trip back to the early 1960s when America was just emerging from its cocoon of innocence. The entire film is a metaphor for this. Eddie's music like life itself dared to venture beyond the bubble gum into a world of complex social and personal issues... literally the Dark Side of American life.Once you grasp this fundamental theme you will appreciate the entire film on a deep level. It's not just a rock'n'roll romp. It's a profound commentary on the growing pains our society endured in the 2nd half of the 20th century. Told in flashback the story takes on a particularly tragic air as if you were browsing through a dusty old scrapbook of your childhood memories now gone forever.The storymystery is set in the first 5 minutes and for the remaining 90 mins it unravels concurrently in 2 timelines to a brilliant finale. Acting is absolutely flawless camerawork is both tense and dreamy and the clincher is the fantastic music a retro soundtrack by John Cafferty with songs you'd swear you'd heard from the 50s but were actually written in 1980 On the Dark Side Tender Years  Wild Summer Nights to name some of the best. Check em out on Youtube if you can.Vivid characters bring this story to life. In Eddie and the Cruisers the two lead characters personify the duality of a soul. First there's Eddie Michael Par who is the dark explosive force yearning to evolve. His counterpart is the nave kid Ridgeway played by Tom Berenger showing off his amazing versatility as an actorjust 2 years before his role in Platoon as the sadistic Vietnam commander. Can you believe it's the same guy?!. The two characters wrestle with each other at times best friends at times worst enemies but always bound together by the thread of music. I'll leave you to discover the philosophical implications of their conflict and its outcome.Notable supporting performances are made by young actors Joe Pantoliana Risky Business The Fugitive The Matrix perhaps best known for The Sopranos Matthew Laurance tons of 80s90s TV Ellen Barkin The Big Easy and Eddie's girl played by Helen Schneider who surprisingly never did any other feature films.Some people criticize this film as being B grade or cheezy. Sure why not. To me that only added to its charm. The 80s itself was a time of innocence  simplicity relative to today's gritty cinema. Isn't it fitting that we living in our megaproduced paranoid cynical new millennium would enjoy watching an honest 80s flick which itself is taking a look back to the warmth of its prior generation? It's like a window within a window. Don't miss the magic of this experience.I've seen 20 or 30 rock'n'roll films and this is hands down my favorite. Other faves include by decade they depict Jailhouse Rock a surprisingly angsty 50s Elvis flick of course Eddie early 60s and Head late 60s trippy Monkees flick Spinal Tap a 70s metal spoof Music  Lyrics an 80s pop spoof Anvil! The Story of Anvil 80s thru present day comeback attemptcomedydocumentary and Garage Days a 90s Aussie rock comedy by the director of The Crow. Worthy of note is Looking for an Echo 2000 by the same writerdirector who did Eddie it presents a parallel story of what might've happened to a 50s singer if he slowly faded into obscurity.Hope this review made sense to you. I nearly broke my fingers typing it. Haha. Watch the movie and you'll get it.P.S. If you see the film make note that Wendell the sax player is actually the one who played sax on the soundtrack. In addition the writers went to great lengths to ensure that the instruments of the era were used Wurlitzer 140b piano old Fender Strat guitar etc. But notice how the piano isn't plugged in! Doh! Almost perfect. Almost.".

Again if you haven't seen this movie you really NEED to. It is truly a Classic 80's movie. Also watch garage sales flea markets thrift stores.

It reminds artistsmusicians about the desire to create something that will last and how to keep your dreams alive.The cast was great and for the most part have gone on to terrific careers. Michael Pare was sensational! In the disposable society that we live in Eddie and the Cruisers reminds us of how tough the music industry is for newcomers.

Do they try to keep it going or let go and move on? Do they ever try to go back? Et cetera. Mr. Kluge's inspiration for this was the death of Buddy Holly in 1959.

Apparently it was also the decade where Joe Pantoliano appeared in music films because he is both here and in La Bamba. Roger Ebert wrote at the time that the film was so frustrating so dumb so unsatisfactory but he was so wrong. This may not be high art and it may be odd to hear Springsteenesque music allegedly being played in 1963 but it is a darn fun film.Although the film had a strong cult following when it was played repeatedly on HBO those under 30 today may not remember the movie. Yet the hit single On the Dark Side still receives regular radio play so it is anything but forgotten. This might be the time to visit or revisit the film especially now that we have had thirty years to reflect on the careers of Michael Pare Tom Berenger and Joe Pantoliano.Hats off to Shout Factory for releasing this as a double feature on Bluray. Unfortunately it comes as bare bones release with only subtitles to speak of. Michael Pare was not asked to do a commentary though he probably would and it would have been a really cool thing to include a remastered soundtrack CD.

Though physically not very accurate to Agatha Christie's description of the little Belgian detective for this one movie everything worked and the discrepancy was not a problem.  The film is wellpaced with all the plot turns and clues coming with perfect timing not too fast to be confusing but not too slow to strain the rather flimsy fabric of the story. The whole cast is very good especially Bette Davis as a malevolent old spider of a woman gleefully tormenting her longsuffering companion Maggie Smith. The scene where she smiles indulgently at a group of Egyptian children waving at her on the river bank only to sink into mortified disgust as they turn around and moon her is a highlight of the movie.  The climax of the film is quite surprising and unlike many mysteries does not cheat the viewer by withholding vital information until the last moment.  We feel the pleasure of being honestly fooled throughout and the conclusion is thoroughly satisfying.".

Anthony Shaffer the author of Sleuth milks it for all its worth. Snippets of wit trying not to obstruct the implausible plot. Tough gig. Dressed in a fantastic Nino Rota score Jack Cardiff does his marvelous thing and Anthony Powell envelopes the stars in costumes that are not only stunning but character revealing in the most entertaining way. Peter Ustinov's Poirot is great fun and the cast moves through the carefully plotted story with disarming precision. Mia Farrow is the only one who plays it for real. Her jealousy is so believable that in a way we're guided by her pain and dismiss the obvious. Bette Davis does a Bette Davis impersonation for our benefit I guess and she gets away with it. Maggie Smith Davis's long suffering lady in waiting is always fun to watch and I imagine she had a lot of fun herself pushing around Bette Davis. My favorite? Angela Lansbury's Salome Ottobourne. Her alcoholic pulp fiction writer is a complex compassionate realistic caricature. David NivenJack Warden Jon Finch Olivia Houssey Lois Chiles Jane Birkin etc complete the who's who of this whodunit.

The script fashioned from one of her best works gives a number of interesting actors roles they can chew the scenery withand most of them do. I can't praise Angela Lansbury enough for her deft and daffy portrayal of a tipsy authoressso good she deserved at least an Oscar nomination. The only real flaw is the film's tendency to move at a rather slow pace before things get more intense.Other acting kudos among the suspects aboard a Nile steamer belong to Bette Davis as an elderly dowager with a penchant for stealing jewelry her servant Maggie Smith with whom she exchanges some priceless barbs Simon MacCorkindale and Lois Chiles as lovers Mia Farrow as a vengeful exsweetheart and of course Peter Ustinov as Poirot. David Niven has the least colorful role and can do little with it as he endeavors to help Poirot solve the mystery. The plot has all the ingenious twists we come to expect of Christie and is a very clever oneif slightly improbable when you stop to think about itdepending heavily on luck and coincidence.But it's all delivered as entertainment and wrapped up in a package designed to stir the senses with an excellent musical score some fine scenery and Oscarwinning costumes. It's a relief that the writer decided to keep the period of the novel in the 1930s rather than update it as has been done with other Christie storiesnotably MURDER IS EASY '82 which was updated to include computer technology as part of the plotline. The period flavor here is an added pleasure.Flavorful and highly amusing whenever Bette Davis and Maggie Smith have a go at some wisecracks with an ending that will surprise you if you fail to catch some of the clues.

Peter Ustinov gives a wonderful performance as Christie's world famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot who along with his sidekick has to solve three violent shootings on a luxury cruise ship sailing off the coast of Egypt. The story is full of red herrings great and really well acted characters and lots of fantastic humour. It is also very gripping with a crime that is forever tricky to work out and a truly unpredictable killer gives the film a perfect ending. I would suggest to all fans of classic British Murder Myestries to see this 1970's Agatha Christie tale but you will have to be prepared to be blown away by it. I overall give Death on the Nile 810 stars.ONE OF THE BEST DETECTIVE STORIES EVER WRITTEN!".

	schema:reviewBody "The screen version of Agatha Christie's Death On The Nile would be one of the definitive adaptions of the very old fashionedbut still strangely popular murder mystery genre. After twentyseven years the movie holds up very well.The most was made of the Egyption setting of the film as it was filmed mostly on location and the stunning ancient sites of Egypt are filmed beautifully. Tourism in Egypt apparently increased significanlty after the film's release. Not surprising.Also making the film a treat is the wonderful cast. Peter Ustinov stepped into the role of Hercule Poirot for the first time and despite no resemblance to Christie's descriptions of Poirot made the role his own for the next decade. Ustinov gives a stern but comic portrayal of Poirot which is balanced with the casting of Ustinov's close friend David Niven as Colonal Race Poirot's sidekick.Heading the feast of suspects is the legendary Bette Davis as a grand dame with a sour Maggie Smith as her paid nursecompanion. There bickering scenes together are a hilarious highlight of the movie. Angela Lansbury is also a scene stealer as a tipsy uninhibited novelist who does a hilarious tango with David Niven. Mia Farrow delivers a very good dramatic performance as the women scorned which almost steers away from the usual cardboard stereotype characterisations of Agatha Christie.Director John Guillerman let his great cast have fun with their characters partly because veteran thriller writer Anthony Shaffer wrote the screenplay. Although the murder mystery is a clever one and played out very well Shaffer injected the script with more wit and spice than the original novel had. The Bette Davis and Maggie Smith scenes being the best example The soundtrack of the film is an underrated gem with veteran composer Nino Rota producing a grand sumptuous inviting and mysterious soundtrack which perfectly complements the setting and the drama. Also his arrangement of the tango tune Jealousy is the best I've ever heard.All this makes for a fun lively old fashioned treat of a film that can be returned to from time to time.".

	schema:reviewBody "An heiress is murdered while honeymooning on a Nile cruise. Fortunately the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is holidaying on the same paddle steamer and begins an investigation. However it would seem that all of the other passengers on board have clear motives for committing the murder.This was the second of Agatha Christie's novels featuring Hercule Poirot to be filmed after the success of 'Murder On The Orient Express' a few years earlier. The great Peter Ustinov who so recently passed away took on the role this time and injected it with his own droll humour. Indeed the whole film seems rather tongue in cheek with the all star cast having fun with their roles. Bette Davis Maggie Smith and Jack Warden all enjoyably ham it up but Angela Lansbury manages to outdo them all with a delightfully over the top performance as the perpetually drunk author of erotic novels. David Niven ever the archetypal British gent proves a good foil as Poirot's partner in the investigation.Where the film really scores is in the locations and photography. Egypt proves a stately backdrop to proceedings and veteran Cinematographer Jack Cardiff makes the most of it. The 1930's setting also gives an air of genteel opulence to the surroundings. While the film couldn't claim to be a classic tension filled mystery it is a pleasant laid back and enjoyable entertainment that's clever enough to keep you guessing until the end.".

However it would seem that all of the other passengers on board have clear motives for committing the murder.This was the second of Agatha Christie's novels featuring Hercule Poirot to be filmed after the success of 'Murder On The Orient Express' a few years earlier. The great Peter Ustinov who so recently passed away took on the role this time and injected it with his own droll humour. Indeed the whole film seems rather tongue in cheek with the all star cast having fun with their roles. Bette Davis Maggie Smith and Jack Warden all enjoyably ham it up but Angela Lansbury manages to outdo them all with a delightfully over the top performance as the perpetually drunk author of erotic novels. David Niven ever the archetypal British gent proves a good foil as Poirot's partner in the investigation.Where the film really scores is in the locations and photography. Egypt proves a stately backdrop to proceedings and veteran Cinematographer Jack Cardiff makes the most of it. The 1930's setting also gives an air of genteel opulence to the surroundings. While the film couldn't claim to be a classic tension filled mystery it is a pleasant laid back and enjoyable entertainment that's clever enough to keep you guessing until the end.";

The scorned Jackie pursues the couple wherever they go and when she follows them onto a Nile cruise it seems that Jackie is not the only one who has a motive for murder. Of course the ever dependable Poirot is on hand to solve the incredibly cleverly planned crime.This film contains some fantastic scenes set in the heart of Egypt along with an all star cast. The most brilliant performance of all comes from Angela Lansbury who plays Mrs. Otterbourne a drunken old writer who apparently used Linnet in one of her overly erotic books and is consequently being taken to court where she may loose everything. Lansbury captures the humorous side but also the unfortunate aspect of the character and it is this immense acting ability that should have won her an Oscar.The chemistry between the main characters is marvellous and at the end when the final solution to the affair is presented the audience is shocked when they learn who did it appreciating fully the extent of Christie's genius. This is a fantastic film which builds up tension fantastically and is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made and is always underrated.".

The latter had been adapted for the screen in 1974 by one of America's great filmmakers Sidney Lumet.Like its predecessor Death on the Nile was filmed with a fine allstar cast in which Peter Ustinov Bette Davis Angela Lansbury Maggie Smith Mia Farrow David Niven and Jack Warden stand out. Ustinov's Hercule Poirot is perhaps a bit less eccentric than Albert Finney's or David Suchet's but I actually like all three interpretations.The film is as lavishly produced as Orient Express. It has nice costumes and beautiful natural locations. John Guillermin isn't as strong a director as Lumet is. Consequently the images in Death on the Nile are pretty but less artistically interesting than those in the preceding film. Moreover Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail which tends to become a bit tedious after a while and the first half could have been shortened a bit. Still the direction is way above average and Guillermin handles the action scenes and the solution in a convincing way.To me Murder on the Orient Express is the most artistically satisfying Poirot film but Death on the Nile is the most entertaining of the Poirot adaptations with Ustinov as the Belgian detective. Evil Under the Sun is also enjoyable since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition. I'd give Death on the Nile a rating of  out of .".

So is everyone else. They seem to fit into their parts almost as well as the characters in The Maltese Falcon. Lois Childes isn't much of an actress true. She has an accent that is straight out of the San Fernando Valley. I don't like being compared to a babewn. That last vowel if it were in German would demand an umlaut. But she is positively juicy looking. What a sinuous back! The usual unsavory or suspicious characters are aboard all of them done very well. The best perhaps is Angela Lansbury. She is absolutely outstanding as a sexcrazed novelist caressing the stone rams along the road lauding their ruttish nature. Her wardrobe deserves some kind of prize for its outrageousness  she wears fuzzy turbans her eyes are circled with black like a lemur's and she wears what appears to be a long ton of beads which droop in festoons down to her belly button. And her acting is priceless. Half drunk all the time and all drunk half the time she bats those awningsized eyelashes rolls her eyes at the overhead practically swoons with selflove and is utterly magnetic. She comes on like a woman out of Aubrey Beardsley a treat to watch and to listen to. Everyone else seems human by comparison.The mystery makes sense. The plot is easy to follow. The characters are supposed to be quirky  and they are. Excellent use is made of locations mainly the ruins at Luxor south of Cairo. There is a stunning scene of Childs and her husband racing across the desert on two Arabian horses that can't be beaten not even by Ben Johnson in a Ford western. Nino Rota has written one of those orchestral scores called epic and for this scene he slyly quotes from Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. The film has no ambition to be anything other than what it is Gott sei dank. Watch it if you have the chance.".

It hosts some of the best performances to date of the likes of Ustinov Lansbury and Mia Farrow and brilliant characterisations from Maggie Smith Bette Davis and Jane Birkin. To be honest they all gave this film their best. The locations are magnificent the costumes stunning and the intrigue is masterfully worked on. Simply the best Christie film of them all. I was a Bette Davis fan before the film and when I saw it upon release I was introduced to so many other performers that I have this film to thank for that. 10 out of 10 !!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Filthy rich Lois Chiles is killed on a ship traveling down the Nile River in Egypt.  Good thing that detective Hercule Poirot Peter Ustinov is aboard. Unfortunately everyone on board had a reason to kill her.  Poirot tries to figure out who did it while the bodies start to pile up....Visually beautiful and totally fascinating adaptation of an Agatha Christie mystery.  It was a deserved Oscar Winner for Costume Designall the clothing was in period and looks truly beautiful.  Also they shot on location in Egypt which helps.  The cast went through hell thoughit was very hot and the clothes they wore were heavy and uncomfortable.  Bette Davis especially complained loudly about the clothes and tore into Olivia Hussey for playing loud music in her cabinat 630 in the morning.The cast however is very good in their roles.  Ustinov is perfect as Poirotmuch better than Albert Finney in Murder on the Orient Express. Bette Davis does wonders with next to nothing in her role as a jewel thief. David Niven just tags along with Ustinov helping him solve the mystery.  Mia Farrow is sadly miscastshe struggles in a very difficult role.  Angela Landsbury obviously enjoying herself runs away with the movie as an alcoholic novelist.  George Kennedy barely registershe's very underwritten.  Maggie Smith playing Davis' maid is a treatthe sparring insults between her and Davis are VERY funny.  Jack Warden is OK faking a fairly convincing German accent as a doctor.  Lois Chiles looks absolutely stunning...but is killed off.  Olivia Hussey is sadly underused.  Simon MacCorkindale is very good as Chiles' husband.  And Jon Finch is very wooden as a revolutionary.  Still everything works.I saw it back in a theatre in 1978 and loved it.  Over 20 years later I STILL love it.  Much better than the overrated Murder on the Orient Express.  A definite 10 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " One of the best film adaptations of an Agatha Christie novel that I have ever seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "Agatha Christie's DEATH ON THE NILE is a wonderfully crafted suspenseful drama set aboard a river barge floating on the Nile against a beautiful backdrop of Egypt and its famous landmarks. Director John Guillermin adapts the novel for the big screen successfully transferring most of the prime aspects contained in the book including both characters and scenery resulting in a breathtaking and highly entertaining film and most definitely a highlyrecommended followup to 1974's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.Guillermin handles the huge cast with such ease you can easily see the likeness in his earlier film THE TOWERING INFERNO in which he gracefully directed more than 15 major stars and their roles and made the audience care about each and every one of them. Here Guillermin directs 13 stars of which include Bette Davis Angela Lansbury Maggie Smith Peter Ustinov David Niven Mia Farrow George Kennedy and Jon Finch.Surprisingly DEATH ON THE NILE was only nominated for one Academy Award ie. 'Best Costume Design' of which it won. I thought Angela Lansbury Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith all played wonderful roles. Ustinov is Hercule Poirot the infamous Belgian detective whose 'vacation' is ruined by senseless murders and it is up to him to figure out 'who done it'. Here he is assisted by David Niven who plays a Private Eye hired by the lawyers of the initial murder victim a wretched and wealthy American woman played by Jane Birkin who has stolen the fianc of Mia Farrow and has brought herself a death wish by upsetting just about everyone she comes into contact with. On board this barge are a group of characters who all have it in for her including  Angela Lansbury a famous erotic novelist who is currently battling a defamation suit with her  Bette Davis a conartist on the prowl for her next scam the victim's set of priceless pearls  Maggie Smith Davis' illmannered servant whose father's career was ruined by the victim thus leading her to a life of servantry.When the victim's body is found with a bullet in her head Poirot must step in to solve the mystery. Everyone is a suspect and all with good reason but who really killed her and why? The outcome is fiendishly delicious and extremely gruesome but you will revel in the delights of your favorite actors doing what they do best  entertaining you. Lansbury nails down her role as a batty old drunk who writes steamy novels. Davis turns in a highly camp performance as a miserable old wretch who has eyes only for the victim's jewels. Ustinov easily nailed down the performance of Poirot taking the reins from Albert Finney as he fills his shoes to portray the detective audiences and readers across the world have come to love.Some funny scenes to look out for would include Angela Lansbury riding a donkey Bette Davis scrambling behind an entourage holding a parasol and the countless clues that may help you solve the mystery if you don't already know who did it. Between the actors featured in DEATH ON THE NILE are 4 Academy Award winners and countless nominations. The most surprising thing that I found while watching the movie are the multiple death scenes featured in this 'supposed' PGrated film. Three women get their heads blown off by a hand gun and another woman has her throat slashed with a scalpel. This film is probably not suitable for children but most adults will enjoy this classic feature. In a year where movies such as DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE SWARM filled theater screens and driveins DEATH ON THE NILE was the lone gem that outshone them all.My Rating  9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death on the Nile based on Agatha Christie's bestselling novel is the best mystery movie ever made. Mystery buffs probably rank Murder on the Orient Express as the best. I liked Murder on the Orient Express but I like Death on the Nile better. I was into this movie right from the start. I never got bored watching this. I found it entertaining from start to finish. A spectacular allstar cast came together for this intriguing film about a murder on a steamer boat while traveling down the longest river in the world the Nile. Peter Ustinov takes over the role of Hercule Poirot that was played by Albert Finney in Orient Express and does a great job of portraying the famous Belgian slueth. Ustinov gets terrific support from a cast of wellknown stars. The best performance in the movie is turned in by the great Angela Lansbury as Salome Otterbourne an alcoholic romance novelist caught up in the dangerous adventure. I think she should have gotten an Oscar nomination for her work here. Who knew that six years later Lansbury would get her turn at sloving crimes on TV's Murder She Wrote. It should be noted that in between Death on the Nile and Murder She Wrote Lansbury portrayed Agatha Christie's other famed detective Miss Marple in 1980's The Mirror Crack'd. In addition to Lansbury there's the great Bette Davis as the jewelry obsessed Mrs. Van Schyler Maggie Smith as Davis' employer Miss Bowers David Niven as Colonel Race an officer who helps Poirot in the murder investigation George Kennedy as Andrew Pennington an American traveling in Africa Jack Warden as the doctor on board the ship Olivia Hussey as Lansbury's daughter Rosalie and Mia Farrow as Jacqueline De Bellifort a woman caught in an unusual love triangle. When the murder occurs I kept trying to guess who did it and the outcome surprised me completely. Death on the Nile directed by John Guillermin of The Towering Inferno and King Kong 1976 remake is a classy production. The cinematography and art direction are fabulous as well as the Oscarwinning costumes. Of all the movies that have been made based on Agatha Christie novels both theatrical and TV Death on the Nile is easily the best. out of four".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of my all time favourites. As an Agatha Christie fan I am carefully critical about adaptations of her works. The screenplay is as good as one of her better novels it makes a seamless transition from book to screen eliminating some subplots and more minor characters e.g. the Allertons in order to achieve a flowing and 'easy to understand' plot with no holes. The choice of Peter Ustinov as Poirot was inspired. His Poirot is distinctly recognisable as that from the books but the talent and ability of Ustinov shines through. Albert Finney would not have been as good in this film.The supporting cast is brilliant. Each gives a performance that makes you wish they were on screen for longer Angela Lansbury as a drunken novelist Mia Farrow as a cold calculating murderer etc.. One of the best is the young Simon MacCorkindale for whom this was his breakthrough film he is currently Consultant Harry Harper in BBC One's Casualty for UK readers as the man torn between love and then led to murder. Also David Niven gives an especially strong performance as Colonel Race.All in all it is in typical Christie fashion a satire on the lives of the upper class that is buoyant with snippets of humour and romance as well as the inevitable murder or rather four and a suicide. The score is very good too and the movie has a good old straight backed stiff upper lip feeling to it that makes it a pleasure to watch and makes one wish they could be there themselves.".

	schema:reviewBody "If one pays scant attention to the news in Japan seen Iwai Shunji's All About Lily Chou Chou or read short stories and novels by Murakami Ryu one knows that Japan like other countries suffers from an escalation of violence in schools. This violence works in three ways student vs. teacher teacher vs. student and the most common student vs. student. Although it is still rare the newspapers and news programs are peppered with stories of bullies beating someone to death or the bullied killing his bullies. Murakami Ryu and Yu Miri have both focused on these subjects in their literary works. Toyoda Toshiaki through his film Blue Spring also touches on this controversial subject.The kids attending the all boys Asahi High School would basically be considered the dregs of Japanese society. The school is rundown and the teachers teach such a drypan apathetic manner that it is not surprising that the kids could care less. The only teacher who seems to actually care about any of his students is a dwarf who waters the flowers on the school grounds all day.However although the teaching might be unstructured there is a rigid code of hierarchy enforced by the tough kids. A leader is chosen by a suicidal ritual in which a student claps his hands as many times as possible while falling backwards. After he claps a certain amount of times he grabs the guardrail. Miss the guardrail instant pancake.At the beginning of this film after the graduation of the senior class Kujo played by the extraordinarily handsome Matsuda Ryuhei wins the contest. Kujo is a bit indifferent to his new found power but goes along with it because he has the support of his friends Aoki Yukio Yoshimura and Kimura. Although many of the students are not satisfied with the way their lives are shaping they seem to basically concede that good jobs and college are not in their future and that they are either on the track to become either a menial laborer or a member of the Yakuza.Blue Spring is an interesting film that depicts individuals who are not on the normal road of becoming a good Japanese citizen i.e. Graduation work stable family. It shows the dregs but the dregs also show that social hierarchy exists from the lowest to the highest.I think that the film is quite well done. The filming is dark but it fits the atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack is excellent.".

Aoi Haru draws us into the lives of Japanese teenagers who aren't so lucky in life who have to make their own destiny from the left over scraps of others who happen to throw them their way.Aoi Haru is based in a public all boys school called Asahi High. A extremely miserable place where teachers don't bother to encourage the boys to excel gang graffiti tags are everywhere marking their turf and the yakuza's frequently hang around outside the school trying to recruit young members. The boys learn early on that if you don't fight for what is yours and what you want then you better keep your mouth shut and stay out of the way. And even though these boys do act tough and dish out violence like a ice cube down the back of your shirt the boys feel lost and confused due to the fact they cannot understand why they can not make their dreams come true. Almost feeling forced into the violence and self destruction they create because it will be their only real legacy they can leave behind before they enter the real world and pretty much dead end lives. On the 25th Graduation ceremony at Asahi High a group of the new seniors head up to the Schools roof for a deadly tradition held by the boys who wish to rule the school. A initiation that involves the boys hanging off the side of the building and seeing how many claps they can do before they give up or just fall to their death when they can't grab the rail in time. And this time Kujo wins the leadership which does confuse the other boys abit because he is quiet and constantly deep in thought about things but accept it because he won fair and square. Even though Kujo does seem to be harmless and gentle when it comes down to it he can be the most violent member of his gang. Though Kujo is the leader of the gang and his Best friend Aoki adores him deeply Kujo doesn't really want to change anything. He doesn't want to rip the school apart with violence unless he has to. He just feels lost about not knowing what the future holds and what is beyond High School and constantly asks his friends what they will do after High School because he secretly doesn't know what to do himself. Which annoys Aoki greatly because he has all of the power and he doesn't want to do anything with it. With this Aoki decides to break off and turn Asahi High into a living hell for everyone who is unlucky enough to get in his way which in turn rips these Childhood friends apart. But can they fix their friendship before it's too late?In the end this Movie really is for all the Gofers Wannabes Dreamers and lost souls out there. Because everyone can relate to at least one of these characters in Aoi Haru".

	schema:reviewBody "I read a review of Blue Spring on a movie festival page and thought it sounded interesting at the very least.  I purchased it blindly hoping it would live up to some of the rave reviews it received.  Not only did it live up to it's billing it replaced Takeshi Kitano's Fireworks Hanabi as my alltime favorite movie.From the opening scene we get the feeling that this is not your normal highschool and these are not your normal students.  However the students face problems that are extremely similar to the problems we have all had. However we come to realize that the setting and the characters are not that different and that the story is in fact believable.  This above all else is the reason why Blue Spring touched me so much.The main character Kujo wins a game of Clapping and becames the boss of a gang at an allboy high school.  The idea of the game is to clap as many times hanging from a rooftop fence without falling to your death.  At first he finds his role mildly amusing as he deals out punishment to anyone who disrespects him or his best friend Aoki.  Eventually as with everything he grows tired of his role and begins to lose his control of the school.Aoki is dependent on Kujo.  He needs Kujo to tell him what to do how to act.  But when Kujo alienates Aoki it sends him into a tailspin of destruction.The other members of the gang hit were very easy to identify with.  One member devoted his entire childhood to chasing the dream of taking the baseball team to Nationals.  However when he blows their chance on the final pitch of a game he can't get past it and is unable to move on with his life.  What makes this even more difficult for us to watch is the fact that he is a tutor of sorts to a freshman student who is beginning to take the game too far and is seemingly destined to live out the same fate.Another student has no absolutely no direction.  No clue as to what he wants to do.  As the time for him to decide begins to run out the pressure becomes to much for him and he commits an unbelievable act.  Perhaps my favorite character in the entire film.Other kids include many who are controlled by the whims of the leaders some who genuinely want to get out of there and go to school and one who is cruely called Ghost even by teachers because he has a terminal illness.The direction is simply amazing.  Toshiaki Toyoda always manages to find the right angle.  Some scenes are absolutely beautiful.  One example is when a character waits on the rooftop after school lets out and the camera fastforwards through the entire night and into the morning as he waits for the next day to begin. Another is when Ghost is seen running away from school as other students contemplate his motivation.  Yet another example is one student's penchant for coloring things black and there is a quick shot of him standing atop the school which has been seemingly been painted black over night only to have a another cut back to reality shows the school is still white leaving the viewer thinking Did I just see that?Dramatic moments are intercut with shots of the beautiful cherry trees that border the school one character takes care of them with extreme devotion blooming flowers clouded skylines ect.  Even in moments of extreme violence or desperation we are never allowed to forget that this is a beautiful film. The soundtrack is simply one the best I've ever heard.  The Japanese punkrock fits in perfectly as it pounds our ears during slowmotion shots and equally well with chases through the school and acts of violence.The ending of the film is unforgettable.  It's one of those endings that  when the credits roll  you're just left staring and wishing it didn't end but you know it couldn't have ended any other way.  I've never given a film a 1010 before but I wholeheartedly believe this film deserves it.  It's not particularly easy to watch but it's undeniably moving and powerful.".

The high school movies I am used to usually transform everything into a battle between characters where in the end the good guy wins. Or maybe he loses. But what if you don't want a battle? What if you just don't know what to do or you just don't care?In Aoi Haru a deadly game decides who the leader of the school will be. A lonely quiet guy wins the game but he does it only because he doesn't care enough to fear for his life. He actually does it for the game not for the leadership. That annoys the hell out of his friend ex boss himself who can't understand someone that does not want to abuse his power. In the end their friendship is brutally ended.There are some interesting metaphors in there like the flowers that the boys are trying to grow even if just one of them lives to see them blossom. It is also interesting that it is a boys only high school maybe that's the norm in Japan I don't know.There is also in the movie the hidden message that neglect and inaction can do more damage than acting badly. I am talking here about the teachers in the film that are just dictating machines with no will to educate or care. I mean doctors can be accused of malpraxis. Lawyers too. Yet teachers who are supposed to create social beings from adolescents are not held responsible for their mistakes.Enough babble. This is a good film maybe a bit long but it does need almost every scene. The soundtrack is also very nice and fits the plot. It is worth watching.".

Here the kids all run around in gangs sleep in lectures and fight at break times. Every wall in the place is covered in graffiti. Ryuhei Matsuda the effeminate guy from GOHATTO stars as Kuja a senior who becomes the school's official gang leader by winning at The Clapping Game. This game involves the kids hanging from a railing on the edge of the school roof letting go and seeing how many times they can clap their hands before their nerve fails and they grab back on.From here we follow the progress of his friends and enemies throughout a part of the school year the challenges to his leadership and the pressure of the school system felt by everyone. There's a hell of a lot of violence goes on in the school and we get the impression that life as a Japanese school boy is a difficult dangerous business.It's a pretty bleak and cheerless vision  between this and BATTLE ROYALE you'd be forgiven for thinking that the Japanese school system was on the point of explosion or collapse with the youth as disaffected as they come. How close this is to reality I don't know but the friend I saw it with tells me that the classroom scenes are pretty close to how it actually is.The cast all perform well  Ryuhei Matsuda has such a striking appearance that he doesn't really need to do anything to create an impression and indeed he spends most of the movie being aloof and impenetrable. This contrasts with the energies and frustrations evident in the other characters particulary his best friend Aoki.I enjoyed the movie a lot... good characters and well filmedscored with interesting developments. It's based on a collection of autobiographical short stories from a manga artist which shows a little bit in the episodic nature of the plot but it's all weaved together well for the movie. Worth looking out for if you don't mind your high school movies nihilistic violent and bleak.".

I find it a lot like go which also has Hirofumi Arai Aoki. Both violent highschool movies. Some people have compared it to Battle Royale... although I think this has a better basis in reality. Someone mentioned this movie was strung together from several short manga stories which makes sense since we tend to jump through several character's story lines. It isn't necessarily a bad thing as we get to see where each character is coming from and where they end up. The variety is nice but it I felt like the movie lost it's focus at points. Overall though I felt it draws the viewer in and manages to stay kinetic throughout. There was rarely a boring moment. Even a girl waiting for her boyfriend ended up being very amusing. The movie is rather violent and disturbing at points but managed to still be funny and introspective. I'd probably recommend it to people who can still remember what highschool was like.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Aoi Haru' is a very bleak movie that derives its beauty precisely from the haunting sense of nihilism. The almost ruined school with its dingy rooms and dense graffiti is not just the set to the action it seems to represent the characters' lack of prospects. A movie that makes something of a pun on the word 'adolescence' together the kanji for 'ao' and 'haru' read as 'adolescence' cannot help but make considerations about the future but these are without a doubt not promising. The schoolground is a yakuza recruiting ground in the most literal of ways and the initiation into gangs is not so much a temporary revolt from troubled teens as it is a preparation for a life of crime. Dreams are hinted at only to be thoroughly dashed. Violence runs rampant but is handled soberly by a camera that know just how much to show to elicit a reaction.It is against this background that the main story unfolds a friendship between two boys gone wrong. Matsuda Kujo gives a stunning performance his cool demeanor matches sociopathic tendencies very well and make him believable as a ruthless and detached young man with little interest even in his own life. The clapping game will have anyone hold their breath and is shot in such a way as to make it even more disturbing. Arai Hirofumi is also very competent as the bosom body whose fall out seals his descent into darkness.A strong soundtrack adds to the impression of things going wrong in an artistic way. Juvenile delinquents or not the human aspect of boys in a sticky situation provides reasons for the viewer to see past the almost intrinsic seediness of it all. Ryuhei cutting Araki's hair as they discuss what to do when they grow up is surprisingly moving and the climax of the movie brings it all home in a painful but excellent way. Apart from these two leads there are minor characters that are equally interesting such as the sickly boy fascinated with worms that despite being so peaceful frightens Kujo because he has a purpose a psychopath in the making the boy that wants to go to Koshien. All people that are adrift without guidelines.Grownups are not absent but they appear sparingly and only the little person teacher that teaches the boys how to water flowers is a positive influence. The focus is strongly placed on the young actors and they truly do shine.'Aoi Haru' is realistic despite being a very artistic movie. It should be seen back to back to Miike's 'Crows Zero' that is a take of the same concept in a much more fanciful and less bleak way. But 'Aoi' is brilliant in its own right by adhering so steadily to an ethos of bleakness and loss. Growing is without a doubt not easy.".

I was surprised to only see one other negative user review thinking it was my fault but nah not really. FIRST i enjoyed the cinematography acting and score. the jaltpunk rock soundtrack was amazing utilized not a lot of diversity but it was as rattly and raw as what was unfolding on the screen so props for that. the acting was also nothing crazy but the nihilistic tones of the film were conveyed very well with sincere acting that depicted withdrawn yet oddly human characters. the imagery and overall cinematography was quite beautiful and visually it was pleasant to watch special mention to the sakura porn that popped up every once in a while because those were especially beautiful but thats just my inner weeb talking. BUT i really wasn't a fan of the actual characters and plot. i thought they were icyand i'm not talking reserved icyi mean detached disconnected and barely relatable. so as the events were unfolding throughout the film i didn't really care to keep up with the people at the centre of the conflicts. i also didn't like the plot as it was vague with seemingly random events at times. i've seen other reviews defending the film saying its a fascinating take on disillusioned teenage Japanese boys ala battle royale and how they struggle to find their meaning as adults blah blah blah. i'm not going to argue against that i've just seen similar ground covered in related works that make this film look weak and barely pointed. if anyone's seen suicide club i think that touched on similar themes but really drove the meaning home. in terms of trying to find one's place NANA  a bunch of other manga series make a much greater effort and execute their message effectively. i didn't see that in this film and a bit of metaphor and musing from characters for 5 minutes max definitely doesn't interest me towards the whole comingofage story its trying to push. maybe i don't get it maybe if i was Japanese it would make more sense but i've enjoyed works in a similar vein and found little to love with blue spring aoi haru".

	schema:headline " Haunted house movie or melodrama?";
	schema:reviewBody "A haunted house. An often recurring motive in horror movies and here we have an early example. It differs from other haunted house movies in several ways. Even Indian cinema has quite a few of them. Thus we have already seen an evil bhoot spirit a sympathetic bhoot a frustrated bhoot a bhoot seeking justice a horny bhoot a bhoot who loves kids... And here for a change we meet a female bhoot who is deeply in love. She doesn't even look like one she is astoundingly beautiful sings and dances and as if that were not enough you can have a normal conversation with her as well. Sure at last we find out that she is not a bhoot at all but merely the old gardener's daughter playing tricks until she loses it herself. A very pleasant surprise at least for me I guess I have already watched so many real bhoots that the possibility didn't even occur to me that this one is just an ordinary person of flesh and bones.Obviously Mahal differs from other haunted house movies even more. Usually a new family settles in an old home and in the beginning little happens. Somebody hears a mysterious noise or sees something odd in the mirror weird accidents happen... little enough for the household skeptic to remain a skeptic for a long time. But here things happen very quickly for Hari Shankar the love story of the previous inhabitants of the house and a certain similarity of the guy to himself are enough to persuade him. When the pretty lady bhoot starts singing songs for him he doesn't have to think long. Hari is deeply convinced that he is the previous house owner's reincarnation and that the bhoot is the great love of his former life. It doesn't take long before the romance starts once more.I should add that unlike most other haunted house movies Mahal is not a horror movie at all. It is more like a drama movie with a touch of the supernatural. More than anything it is about psychology. All in all Mahal has more in common with Kabhi Alvida naa Kehna than with Bhoot.Personally I like it when a movie has a tempo like Mahal's first half hour. I found myself wondering if things are moving so quickly what's going to be next? And here comes a surprise during the following one and a half hour almost nothing happens at all. All we see is Hari's inner crisis deepening while his obsession with Kamini grows. Until his family and friends convince him to get married to another woman and finally get the hell out of that house. Nevertheless Hari can't forget Kamini and keeps thinking of her turning his poor wife's life into hell. That's the first half of the movie. In the second half we know that Kamini is not a bhoot at all but suffering from a heavy case of mythomania. Everything evolves now around the question what will happen next. Hari has pretty much lost it and even though Kamini has already told the truth he cannot accept that it was all nonsense. Clearly a story like that cannot end happily and so Hari dies a stupid death his friend has to spend the rest of his life with a gardener's egoistic daughter whom he has nothing in common with but this entire unfortunate history and KaminiAsha instead of having the man she loves now has two lives on her conscience and a husband she doesn't love and probably never will.I genuinely love old movies but there is a lot I miss in Mahal. A story like this is very very dependent on building atmosphere and I'm not sure the film makers succeeded in that. Granted the camera performs true miracles at times but as a whole this movie reminds me a bit of a Wagner opera about which Debussy once said wonderful moments horrible quarters. Although the music of Mahal undoubtedly belongs to the better soundtracks of oldschool Bollywood I have a feeling that there were too many songs which made the longish movie even more longish. Although the story is interesting in itself I have a feeling the script could have done more justice to it. Compared to other film scripts from the old days when script writing was still an art and not merely a craft it fails to impress.With the actors I have a similar problem. The acting is surely not bad but I miss that... that something. Ashok Kumar obviously does not have the kind of screen presence of a Humphrey Bogart a Marlon Brando or a Robert Mitchum. Madhubala's role consists mostly of dancing and being beautiful. Besides it is hard to identify with any of the characters in the movie. Hari is essentially a naive weakling who in addition to that treats his poor wife more than horribly. Kamini turns out to be a cold calculating wouldbe femme fatale who doesn't even seem to feel sorry for all the trouble she has caused. Both Hari and KaminiAsha are sad examples of how sick and obsessive love can be. Ranjana Hari's wife is utterly colorless. The most reasonable person in the story is undoubtedly Hari's friend Shrinath but at least at the beginning he is portrayed as a complete bumpkin. Together they are a bunch of egoistic unsympathetic people who actually deserve all the bad things coming to them. All in all Mahal is certainly not a bad movie but it does not live up to the expectations raised during the first half hour and more importantly it could have done more justice to the promising storyline. As a matter of fact I think this movie could be the starting point for a pretty decent remake. Not that I'm a great fan of Shahrukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai but I'm sure they could do a terrific job here!".

Although the music of Mahal undoubtedly belongs to the better soundtracks of oldschool Bollywood I have a feeling that there were too many songs which made the longish movie even more longish. Although the story is interesting in itself I have a feeling the script could have done more justice to it. Compared to other film scripts from the old days when script writing was still an art and not merely a craft it fails to impress.With the actors I have a similar problem. The acting is surely not bad but I miss that... that something. Ashok Kumar obviously does not have the kind of screen presence of a Humphrey Bogart a Marlon Brando or a Robert Mitchum. Madhubala's role consists mostly of dancing and being beautiful. Besides it is hard to identify with any of the characters in the movie. Hari is essentially a naive weakling who in addition to that treats his poor wife more than horribly. Kamini turns out to be a cold calculating wouldbe femme fatale who doesn't even seem to feel sorry for all the trouble she has caused. Both Hari and KaminiAsha are sad examples of how sick and obsessive love can be. Ranjana Hari's wife is utterly colorless. The most reasonable person in the story is undoubtedly Hari's friend Shrinath but at least at the beginning he is portrayed as a complete bumpkin. Together they are a bunch of egoistic unsympathetic people who actually deserve all the bad things coming to them. All in all Mahal is certainly not a bad movie but it does not live up to the expectations raised during the first half hour and more importantly it could have done more justice to the promising storyline. As a matter of fact I think this movie could be the starting point for a pretty decent remake. Not that I'm a great fan of Shahrukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai but I'm sure they could do a terrific job here!";

In this respect he reminds me of Orsen Welles whose debut venture Citizen Kane was his best and one of the greatest movie of all times. What upsets me most is that Mahal is considered a ghost story by many commentators. Nothing could be further from truth. It's a great suspense story told in a straight forward way and yet exceptionally hard to guess the surprise ending on first viewing. Khemchand Prakash's music is among the finest in Hindi movies. But for his early demise he would have been as much an icon as Naushad he introduced to Hindi films.".

That doesn't mean Mahal is bad necessarily just that it is different and so it is difficult for a nonIndian to offer a review that most Indians won't consider to be wildly off the mark. At the end of the day though all you can do is offer your opinions and views and let people think what they will Like most Indian films this one has a 150odd minute running time thanks largely to both a number of musical numbers and a slow meandering plot which occasionally captures the appropriate atmosphere for which it is obviously striving but which for the most part falls a little flat. The hero wellplayed by a brooding Ashok Kumar suffers inordinately for his love for the woman he believes to be a ghost but who is in fact his gardener's daughter. The film plays this as if it is some huge twist when her true identity is revealed at a trial but nobody in this day and age will be surprised by the revelation. The object of his affections it has to be said is something of a hottie and firsttime director Kamal Amrohi allows the camera to lovingly caress her beauty at every opportunity pulling in so close that her face fills the screen.The film doesn't have the kind of plot needed to fill out the lengthy running time and the sombre ruminations on fate and love and the forces beyond our understanding that control and toy with us all grow a little wearing after a while. But having said that it's not difficult to understand why this film is so popular in India.".

	schema:headline " Comical and violent Corbucci western with Mark Damon as sly and dandyish bounty hunter Johnny Oro";
	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning we watch Johnny Oro Mark Damon dressed up in a jet black and tight costume with just a hint of gold at the right spots and introduced by the riveting lyrics 'Non importava dell' amore  a Johnny Orooooooooooooo' riding into town and killing off a few Mexican bandits walking out of a church wedding  but sparing the youngest one ... Big mistake he's back soon enough along with some Indians a rare appearance in Spaghetti westerns! to take Johnny out  and the whole town of Coldstone as well. A lot of dead bodies there at the end of the movie as the Indians are shot in dozens body piles everywhere they even start using their dead ones as shields. In the end the whole town is literally blown to hell.Johnny is characterized as the type who is on the side of justice only to see get the gold reason given he was born in a gold mine full of himself he is having a good time ridiculing and shooting his enemies and cashing in the money and one cannot help but smiling along with him. Johnny has the kiddo feel to him and he never gets serious right until the end of the movie  even after the bad guy shoots his love interest right in the face at close range off screen. It's THE role for Mark Damon who can get pretty tedious if cast as a serious character The fun he is having while performing Johnny's gleeful pranks is highly contagious.Contrasting Johnny's character is the sheriff played by Ettore Manni a principled man well beyond reason himself with a son and a wife to boot. The two of them play off well enough against each other.Plenty of violence from the bad guys including a drunk Indian. Shady owner of the saloon and 'businessman' he deals in weapons Andrea Aureli does some highly enjoyable sleazy acting and ends up with an ax right in the middle of his bald patch. Figure that! After all it is only 1966.Those violent bits help to remind that director Corbucci did 'Django' with Franco Nero the very same year so very different in tone. If 'Django' is the tragedy this one is the satyr play.All in all the movie stays lighthearted throughout and you can have yourself a few fine laughs and enjoy a wild ride in the pasta west.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grand Canyon Massacre director Sergio Corbucci made his fourth western Ringo and His Golden Pistol 1968 after Django 1966 but before Navajo Joe 1966 and this represents Mark Damon's first Spaghetti western. HalfAmerican halfMexican the eponymous character is a blackclad bounty hunter with a black mustache who prefers to be paid only in gold. Gold means everything to Ringo who is as fast on the draw and as accurate as a frog catching flies with its tongue. Damon looks rather villainous in his solid black outfit and he dresses more conventionally like a 1950s' Hollywood gunslinger. Unfortunately Ringo and His Golden Pistol doesn't rank as one of Corbucci's better westerns and Damon lacks the charisma that Giuliano Gemma radiated in the first Ringo western director Duccio Tessari's A Pistol for Ringo 1965 as well as in Tessari's followup The Return of Ringo. Ringo and His Golden Pistol pales Corbucci's other westerns. Ringo Mark Damon of Johnny Yuma wipes out three of the Perez Brothers after they force a defenseless woman to marry into their family. The last remaining Perez brother Juanito Franco De Rosa of Ballad of Death Valley wants to wreck revenge on Ringo for the deaths of his brothers. Juanito doesn't wield either a rifle or a sixgun but he expects his armed henchmen to be crack shots. Juanito aligns himself with a renegade Apache chieftain Sebastian Giovanni Cianfriglia of The Relentless Four and they decide to decimate the frontier town of Coldstone. Town marshal Bill Norton Ettore Manni isn't amused by their threats. Norton arrests our hero when he defends himself from an ambush within the city limits and relies on a bomb to blow his adversaries into little bitty pieces. Sheriff Norton rules Coldstone with an iron fist and puts citizens in jail if they refuse to abide by his rules. Meantime Sebastian and Juanito decide to join ranks and kill as many of the frontiersman as they can. Juanito gives Norton an ultimatum. He must hand Ringo over to him or he will wipe out the town. Predictably Norton doesn't give up Ringo. The rest of the townspeople leave Coldstone before Juanito and his Apache allies attack. While Ringo sits in jail Norton and his wife along with another freed prisoner decimate the aggressive Indians. Unfortunately Norton does something truly inept. He sends his son off on horseback to ride to the nearest cavalry fort and bring back enough guns to run the villains off. Our heroes need not have done anything based on their collective marksmanship. Of course Norton's son doesn't get far before the Apache seize him. Eventually Norton comes to his senses and gives Ringo his golden pistol and our hero polishes off Juanito when he uses Norton's young son as a shield.Ringo and His Golden Pistol refers to the goldplated revolver that our hero wears tied down to his thigh. Clocking in at 88 minutes this Spaghetti western isn't as bloodthirsty as A Fistful of Dollars.".

Also included is a romance between fictional characters played by Robert Wagner and Debra Paget.In that beard with those pince nez glasses Clifton Webb looks remarkably like John Philip Sousa in that period and by reputation Sousa was as much a dilettante as Webb normally played on screen which made him perfect casting. After leaving the Marine Corps band Sousa formed his own orchestra which became world famous and toured the globe well into the Twenties.But our story concerns Sousa the March King. Though he composed all kinds of music it is his marches that have come down today and have given him his reputation. The Marine Corps official march Semper Fidelis was composed by Sousa and the incident involving President Benjamin Harrison as depicted in Stars and Stripes Forever is somewhat true. The Marine Corps Band was playing at a White House reception and the Harrison who was not the most social of presidents ordered Sousa to speed up the tempo so the receiving line would move at a brisk pace. Ruth Hussey is cast in the Myrna Loy type role of the perfect understanding mate for her genius husband and she fulfills the role admirably. Even Clifton Webb does make you forget you're watching Clifton Webb and you do think you are seeing the real Sousa.Stars and Stripes Forever is an admirable film and of course the finale does have several bands and marching armed forces personnel playing and marching to Sousa's most famous composition.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Philip Sousa's position in American and World music is set in stone by now. Others have composed great marches the English composer Edward Elgar with his four Pomp and Circumstance Marches for instance two of which are memorable and such major composers like Wagner and Mendelsohn. But Sousa remains the March King. Like Johann Strauss the Younger Alexander Scarlatti and Scott Joplin he is recalled for his domination of a single area of music marches in this case rather than waltzes sonatas or rags. But this really does not explain why he remains the March King. There is a sense of fun and spirit in Sousa's marches that transcend what a march is usually supposed to do.Marches were originally meant for troops to walk in step either on a training field or on the battlefield music was used until the end of the 19th Century to keep up the spirits of the soldiers and even to help orchestrate the speed they were to fight at when running across the battlefield. Sousa came from a musical family his father was a musician in the Marine Corps band. Sousa followed in his father's footsteps but played several instruments and rose to be the bandmaster. He began composing pieces for the Marine Corps Band such as Semper Fidelis The Washington Post March Manhattan Beach and he tried to expand his abilities into other fields. When he left the Marine Corps he formed his own band which he developed with a perfect balance of brass stings percussion and woodwinds. His band would go around the world performing not only his own pieces but also other composers as well.The movie does touch once or twice on Sousa's attempts to broaden his musical ability by doing Broadway shows operettas. At the start Clifton Webb as Sousa does play the melody of Semper Fidelis for his wife Jenny Ruth Hussey as a tune to be sung. It doesn't quite work. He would do a successful operetta which is still revived called EL CAPITAN which starred DeWolf Hopper we hear an actor as Hopper singing a tune at a rehearsal during the movie. However EL CAPITAN had a book by Charles Klein a major dramatist of the 1890s  1915 he drowned in the Lusitania disaster. Klein was not a W. S. Gilbert but his libretto was serviceable. Unfortunately Sousa never had another librettistlyricist like Klein and spent the rest of his career seeking his Gilbert. As a result the leading operetta composer from the U.S. in Sousa's lifetime and since was Victor Herbert.Sousa was talented in other ways too. He sometimes wrote clever lyrics to comic songs such as A Typical Song of Zanzibar. He wrote about five comic novels too. He designed the special marching tuba the Sousaphone which is shown in the film being designed by Webb and Robert Wagner. But it is the string of great marches that he left which are his great donation to our culture. The reason is more than just his gift for melodious music. He was a genius at composition and orchestration  probably the best orchestrator among the major American composers.His best remembered march is the title march for this film THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER. The film mentions how Sousa on a trip for his health was walking the deck of the liner at night and thought of the beat of the music. We hear Webb describing the moment quoting a passage from Sousa's memoirs MARCHING ALONG and the film ends with the playing of the great march. The film does not mention that that Sousa also composed words to be sung to it which occasionally still are sung. A few years ago the U.S. Congress formally adopted THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER as the national march.I have gone into a great deal of detail regarding Sousa and his career for the movie for a biography skims a lot. His literary efforts are not dealt with and the film ends really with the playing of THE STARS AND STRIPE FOREVER. That was in 1899. Sousa would live until 1932 and would be a public figure until then. He was still composing until the 1920s. Webb had an extensive musical comedy career in the 1920s and 1930s he was one of the stars in Irving Berlin's AS THOUSANDS CHEER for example. But aside from an occasional tune he sings like When I wore a Tulip or a dance he does with Jeanne Craig in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN he never did a musical. STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER is his one musical film. He is credible as Sousa but the film never really goes deeply into the great man. The dramatic portions are handled by Robert Wagner and Deborah Paget as friends and lovers whose love affair is twisted for awhile by the Spanish American War. The film is certainly watchable the cast is game and the music is first rate but it is not a showcase for Webb's talents in musicals. Ironically he could have been in Vincent Minelli's THE BANDWAGON with Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse but opted for the lead as Sousa. Probably a bad decision  but it is hard to say. Every July 4th STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER is shown for it's great holiday music. What we lost in not seeing Webb opposite Astaire is not enough to prevent our still seeing Webb as the great maestro composer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watch this movie to get a historical perspective on some of America's and the World's Best Marching Band Music by John Philip Sousa!The film is a chronology of snippets about the life of John Philip Sousa his wife and two apparently fictional friends written into the movie to have a young romantic subplot.  All other performers in this film are not interesting enough in character to comment upon.  Most of the actors were not even credited in the films running credits.Clifton Webb real name Webb Parmalee Hollenbeck was 63 years old when this movie was released in 1952.  While his written dialog is not all that dramatic Mr. Webb was a long time actor singer dancer silent screen performer and theater performer before making this picture.  Clifton Webb doesn't really have to act in this film.  He carries the part of John Philip Sousa by standing straight with a stiff back wearing many colorful marching band uniforms looking very snobbishly British with a stiff demeanor while putting on the airs of a musical taskmaster demanding perfection yet with a silent softness in his heart for the two younger performers a 22 year old Robert John Wagner and the vivacious effervescent and energetic 18 year old Debra Paget real name Debralee Griffin. Mr. Webb died in 1966 at the age of 77 years old.Ruth Carol Hussy at age 38 years plays Sousa's wife Jennie Sousa. Research reveals that Sousa's wife's name was Jane van Middlesworth Bellis whom Sousa met during rehearsals for a stage play she was performing in. They married when he was 25 years old.  Ms. Hussy portrays the role of a wife and homemaker who runs the Sousa household and cajoles her husband to be sympathetic to the secret romance of Willie Little and Lily Becker. She is the binder' of the Sousa household and the understanding' wife behind the scenes.Internet research reveals no existence of the two characters Little and Becker in real life.  A web site of the Dallas Wind Symphony has a listing of every band member who performed in Sousa's Band.  The name of Willie Little is not listed among them.  The movie explains that Willie Little is a Marine Private who joins the Corps with the desire to perform in Sousa's Band.  The Little character comes to Sousa's home unannounced with a Sousaphone Little claims to have invented and had built for Sousa's march music to make the sound better than a standard tuba which is too brash a sound for a concert hall.  Sousa takes a liking to Private Little and takes him into his band.  However Sousa himself gave a personal interview to the Christian Science Monitor on May 30 1922 and claims that he Sousa approached the J.W. Pepper Company in Philadelphia and commissioned the Sousaphone to be made in 1893 one year after Sousa gives up his directorship of the Marine Band.Debra Paget best known for her part four years later as the beautiful Lilia the Water Girl' in the epic The Ten Commandments gives this film all the levity of young romance and a love tension which the mature WebbHussy parts can not produce.  It is a pleasure to watch her dance and sing numbers as well as the way she gives Robert Wagner love kicks in the shins.  At the age of 28 years Ms. Paget married for the third time and quit the motion picture business.  A loss to all whom appreciates a beautiful woman!When the battleship USS Maine is blown up in Havana Harbor on February 15 1898 Willie Little reenlists in the Marines and goes off to Cuba to fight in the four month SpanishAmerican War of 1898.  He loses a leg and returns home to his secret wife Lily and a seat at a Sousa concert to entertain the hospital patients in Washington D.C.Historical data from various web sites highlight that John Philip Sousa was placed into the Marine Corps in 1867 at the age 13 years as an apprentice musician by his father John Antonio Sousa who was a trombonist in the Marine Corps band because young Sousa wanted to run away to join the circus.  Eight years later Sousa was discharged from the Marines 1875 at the age of 21 years.  In the next five years Sousa builds a reputation good enough for the Marines to contact him and offer him the Directorship of the Marine Band.  Sousa returns to the Corps and accepts the Directorship in 1880.  Sousa is 26 years old and is now being referred to as a Sergeant Major however his uniforms display no marine enlisted rank until he departs the Marines at age 38 years 1892 to form his own civilian marching band because he cannot afford to support his family of wife and four children on Marine pay.  Real photos of Sousa show him with a thick dark beard which makes it believable that the 63yearold Webb can play the 38yearold Sousa during the Marine years.Watch this movie to get a good dose of the famous Sousa marches Semper Fidelis 1888 the Official Marine Corps Hymn Washington Post March 1889 and the Stars and Stripes Forever 1896 the Official March of the United States. You will even enjoy the band's playing of  the song Dixie as well as the inspiring gospel choir performing the Battle Hymn of the Republic when Sousa's Band marches into Atlanta after their commission to perform at a convention was canceled.  If you like pretty late19th Century dresses and snappy military band uniforms this is a movie to see.  No one else could play John Philip Sousa but Clifton Webb.  And next Fourth of July when you see the Boston Pops Playing The Stars and Stripes Forever you will have some historical background into the world of the man who composed this enduring Spirit of America.".

But if you want to spend a couple of very entertaining hours then you're in for a real treat.First off the arrangements here are absolutely top notch and feature excellent renditions of Sousa's music. Second you have the always entertaining Clifton Webb at the top of his form...this time without the sarcasm that most of us learned to love. Webb is no less entertaining here but it is a bit of a different role for him. And you have Robert Wagner...who was...well let's just say it...beautiful at this age as well as being a very pleasant actor to watch. Debra Paget is fine as Wagner's love interest as is Ruth Hussey as Sousa's wife.This is not a perfect film. The whole Wagner role is simply fiction but that liberty helped make the film so very entertaining and gave the film some context. The conclusion is a rousing rendition of the title song and I have to say that more than once even now I have seen audiences roused to cheering with that number.This is a very entertaining film. And you can say that while you are watching this film Clifton Webb IS John Phillip Sousa! I last saw it when I was only a boy probably on Saturday Night At The Movies and I remembered it as being very entertaining. Now in 2012 I still find it to be wonderfully entertaining.P.S. And now in 2017 with the new Blu Ray edition I enjoyed it once again. The color here is stunning Technicolor. There is a very slight graininess but the transfer is still top notch.Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " A Perfect Hollywood Biopic with a Bit of Fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "John Philip Sousa was not only America's March King he was a skilled organizer and entertainer who also composed much music now thoroughly unknown to most Americans and fans elsewhere.  His life spanned the era of an optimistic brash America where live music was the only music to the burgeoning and eventually triumphant victory of an insatiable technology that even in Sousa's lifetime was employed to record almost everything. Sousa benefited from the new world of recording and he can be heard on compact disc in his later years conducting his famed quasimilitary band.20th Century Fox enlisted a cadre of fine performers for a seamlessly entertaining biopic of John Philip Sousa with a nice anachronistically innocent fictional romance interwoven with the band leadercomposer's story.As Sousa Clifton Webb brings to life a character who was as in reality ambitious and driven to succeed.  Sousa left the Marine Corps where he led The President's Own to start his handpicked band.  In uniforms which the leader designed the outfit mirrored great military bands of which the U.S. as opposed to England had a clear shortage during Sousa's life. Sousa understood the importance of touring and he was light years ahead of the twentieth century's pops ensembles in making his musicians  and his music  as ubiquitous as travel of his day allowed.Sousa's patient and adoring wife Jennie is well played by Ruth Hussey.A nice romantic plot is the courtship of aspiring singer Lily Becker and the alleged inventor of the sousaphone Willie Little.  Lily is the gorgeous Debra Paget and Willie the young and upcoming Robert Wagner.  Neither character existed in real life but their romance is well threaded into Sousa's story and is coyly affecting.1952 was a hard year for many Americans.  A selfdesignated lame duck president presided over an unpopular war the first in our history in which victory in the traditional military sense wasn't a strategic or political objective.  The Stars and Stripes Forever was a refreshing patriotic film that didn't require thinking about the realities of the day.  I remember seeing it as a kid and loving every minute.  I still watch it occasionally.Credit also goes to the producer and to director Henry Koster for including a scene at an Atlanta festival where a black chorus sings The Battle Hymn of the Republic under Sousa's baton right after a rousing version of Dixie was performed.  This was two years before Brown v. Board of Education the Supreme Court's belated start of the final assault on the obscenity of legalized racial discrimination.  I doubt everyone in the South felt good about that scene.Musical pieces are well interwoven with the story and the final minutes have Sousa's most famous march also the movie's title played with a segue from his band to contemporary marching marines and soldiers. His superimposed spectral leading is a fine reminder of his role.  A very nice touch.Folks who only know Sousa from a relative handful of oftperformed and wonderful marches should check out his less wellknown music.  NAXOS is currently releasing a series of CDs of works that reflect Sousa's extraordinary creativity.  But above all Americans owe him an everlasting debt for composing stirring music that still animates listeners as it did when first performed under his baton.1010".

	onyx:emotionText "John Philip Sousa was not only America's March King he was a skilled organizer and entertainer who also composed much music now thoroughly unknown to most Americans and fans elsewhere.  His life spanned the era of an optimistic brash America where live music was the only music to the burgeoning and eventually triumphant victory of an insatiable technology that even in Sousa's lifetime was employed to record almost everything. Sousa benefited from the new world of recording and he can be heard on compact disc in his later years conducting his famed quasimilitary band.20th Century Fox enlisted a cadre of fine performers for a seamlessly entertaining biopic of John Philip Sousa with a nice anachronistically innocent fictional romance interwoven with the band leadercomposer's story.As Sousa Clifton Webb brings to life a character who was as in reality ambitious and driven to succeed.  Sousa left the Marine Corps where he led The President's Own to start his handpicked band.  In uniforms which the leader designed the outfit mirrored great military bands of which the U.S. as opposed to England had a clear shortage during Sousa's life. Sousa understood the importance of touring and he was light years ahead of the twentieth century's pops ensembles in making his musicians  and his music  as ubiquitous as travel of his day allowed.Sousa's patient and adoring wife Jennie is well played by Ruth Hussey.A nice romantic plot is the courtship of aspiring singer Lily Becker and the alleged inventor of the sousaphone Willie Little.  Lily is the gorgeous Debra Paget and Willie the young and upcoming Robert Wagner.  Neither character existed in real life but their romance is well threaded into Sousa's story and is coyly affecting.1952 was a hard year for many Americans.  A selfdesignated lame duck president presided over an unpopular war the first in our history in which victory in the traditional military sense wasn't a strategic or political objective.  The Stars and Stripes Forever was a refreshing patriotic film that didn't require thinking about the realities of the day.  I remember seeing it as a kid and loving every minute.

	schema:headline " starchy Sousa '50s romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Having spent 6 years in orchestras and marching bands before graduating from high school often playing Sousa's best known marches I anticipated this partial biographical film. Clifton Webb does indeed come across as the real Sousa and certainly appears much younger than his 60 years. He much reminds us of Frank Gilbreth in Cheaper by the Dozen another perfect role for him. The inclusion of the fabricated young couple played by Robert Wagner and Debra Paget was understandable serving to lighten things up from time to time as contrasted to Sousa's rather starchy exterior. However they come across as basically a '50s show biz couple interjected into an 1890s historical film. I was disappointed that more of Sousa's best known marches were not featured nor the background of how he came to compose some of them revealed. After all he did compose more than 100 marches of which at least 8 should be recognized by every American as classics. In addition to The Washington Post Semper Fidelis and The Stars and Stripes Forever prominently featured in the film The Thunderer The Liberty Bell King Cotton El Capitan and The Corcoran Cadets March should be instantly recognizable. In the film we briefly see Sousa on a ship talking to himself about an idea for a classic march. But we never find out that it is Christmas day he is on a ship bound from Europe to America and is composing The Stars and Stripes Forever in his head. Also it could have been brought out that his popular march The Liberty Bell was due to have quite a different name. However after he saw a large backdrop of the Liberty Bell and coincidentally received a letter from his wife saying his son was marching in a parade honoring the Liberty Bell he changed his mind. Sousa's opposition to recording his band and to radio broadcasts of his band could have been brought outTrue radio broadcasting had not been invented during the time period covered. Although he did allow many recordings of the Marine Band around 1890 he later became strongly opposed to recordings of his own band until very late in his career. In this resistance to new electronic technologies that allowed many unseen people to enjoy his music whenever they wished he was in sympathy with Irving Berlin.Sousa was not quite the onedimensional genius popularly supposed. The film brings out to some extent his ambition to be a composer for the musical stage. He also composed several novels. The film could have also brought out the fact that Sousa was recognized as one of the top trap shooters in the world and initiated a national organization for trap shooters.Sousa's name and origins were a subject for speculation. Several sources claimed that he was from various European countries and that Sousa was a stage name the usa part representing USA his adopted country. Im fact he was born and raised in Washington D.C. his father being a member of the Marine Band. His ancestry is mostly Portuguese and Bavarian Sousa being a rather common Portuguese and Spanish name. Variant spellings include d'Souza Soza and Sosa.One of film's highlights is the defiant appearance of his marching band in a southern city after notification that it's booking had been canceled due to popular opposition. I don't know if this incident has any factual basis but Sousa's music and band are depicted as seen by many southerners as a purely Yankee institution. We see the faces of a group of African Americans when The Battle Hymn of the Republic is played but I wonder what the reaction of the typical Caucasian southerner would have been. This inspirational Civil War favorite was in fact an unintentional collaboration between South Carolinian William Steffe who composed the tune shortly before the Civil War and unionist Julia Ward Howe who provided the lyrics one of various lyrics sung to this tune in both the North and South. Thus it might have been interpreted as a unifying symbol.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came across this movie on the TV network Movies!. If we look through recorded history at people who stand out and the contributions they made in music John Philip Sousa has to come up on any list. He was a multitalented musician who ended up in the Marines and became the leader of the Marine Corps Band. It became the official band for 5 different US Presidents. He wrote most of the best and most famous marches and even had a new instrument built the Sousaphone a bass with a particular design that allowed it to be played bellforward and adapted to marching bands.Clifton Webb is simply great as John Philip Sousa. After achieving great success while still in the military he chose to get discharged. Ask why by his superiors his answer was simple and logical he could not support his large family with 5 children on his military salary.When he struck out on his own he picked only the finest musicians each one up musically to the same standards Sousa held for himself. There is a funny scene where a trumpet player is auditioning. Sousa took the cornet and played a fast and complicated piece Variations on Carnival of Venice to show what he was expecting and the other guy just took his horn and walked away. I am a trumpet player in high school college and community bands as an adult we played all of the Sousa marches that scene struck a particular chord with me. Though I would not even in my prime have been good enough to play with his band.Robert Wagner was barely past 20 a young soldier named Willie Little who desperately wanted to play with Sousa's band. In one scene he shows up at Sousa's home with the instrument that came to be known as the Sousaphone and young Willie named it that in honor of the man. But that is a fabrication for the movie the Sousaphone was in fact a creation of Sousa himself he gave instructions for its fabrication to an instrument builder.The young love interest was provided by Debra Paget still in her teens as Lily Becker a stage performer who wanted her own career. I had forgotten how pretty and delightful Paget was and she and Wagner are both in good form here.All in all a fine entertaining movie covering a key part of the great bandsman's life and accomplishments. Plus it is filled with famous Sousa marches.".

The end result thoroughly charmed that weary preteenager in 1953 and did again when I saw it on a TV broadcast many years later.I have to confess that I watched it again to catch that absolutely amazing number Father's Got 'Em! performed with energy to burn by the gorgeous Miss Paget in some of the tightest white tights I'd ever seen before or since.  It's hilarious and a heck of a lot sexier than the struttings of most of today's socalled divas.Since this was a preCinemaScope Twentieth product possibly produced while the threestrip Technicolor process was still in use the VHS tape transfer may very well look as vividly rich as it did on that big screen so many years ago in Boston.".

Here in this movie were US Marines playing music. I no longer thought of music as sissy. I took 7 years of piano and have been in bands since 1955. Here at age 61 I'm still in a community band church choir cantor director of a small band at church and a girl scout band. None of this would have happened without this movie coming to town at just the right moment.Now for the negative part. The character played by Robert Wagner was an invention  he didn't exist in real life. The Sousaphone or marching tuba was jointly invented by Sousa and an instrument manufacturer. There are several historical inaccuracies so many that according to the official J.P. Sousa web site the family will have nothing to do with the movie.But this doesn't diminish my admiration. This is my favorite musical and I think was extremely well done. I recommend this film to everybody.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to the prolific ccthemovieman1 the main problem with this film is that there isn't enough of John Philip Sousa and his music. Instead too much time and emphasis is placed on a completely irrelevant plot with Robert Wagner and Debra Paget. It was as if the studio thought that the life of Sousa wasn't interesting enough so they had to spice it up with this romantic subplot. Well I thoroughly agree with ccthis is a major problem with the film.In fact if you are looking for a biography of Sousa this film is NOT what you are looking for. None of his early life is shown in the film and only the tiniest portion of his career as a band leader in the US Marine Corpsis even shownsomething for which he is most famous! I am NOT an expert on Sousa and perhaps he was a dull guy though I strongly doubt it because of the many places he went innovations he made and success he achieved. Why not just let the film tell the truth without all the silly falderal that you see in this film? By the way I used the word 'falderal' as it was a popular word from the era of Sousa and it means foolish nonsensean apt description of the unnecessary elements of this film.As for the acting in the film much of it was pretty good. Clifton Webb was always a terrific actor and I'd watch him in anythingeven this silly film. Also of note is character actor Finlay Currie as he really stretched his range in STARS AND STRIPESplaying a Southern gentlemandespite his IrishEnglish heritage. He was surprisingly good here and not much like roles he played in films like IVANHOE.Another thing I liked about the film is a small scene featuring a Black singing group. They sounded great though it also got me thinking that it was sad that Blacks in Hollywood films were generally absent during this era. It was nice to see this positive image.So despite the obvious flaws in the film is it worth seeing? As I said above there were some big pluses for the film so it is worth a look. But it's also pretty easy to skip as it's a rather colorful but empty biopic. Not bad mind you but also not particularly goodespecially as too much emphasis was placed on the stage dancing of Miss Paget and not enough on the real Sousa.".

	schema:headline " America's uplifting band leader and march king";
	schema:reviewBody "Clifton Webb stars in this entertaining and uplifting musical biopic of John Philip Sousa. The king of the march was an American icon and legend from the late 19th century to 1932. A composer and bandleader he wrote more than 130 marches 15 operettas several other musical compositions and hundreds of arrangements. Besides that he had time to write five novels. Among his most famous marches still played today are the official Marine Corps march Semper Fidelis The Washington Post march in response to the newspaper of that name running an essay contest in 1889 and Stars and Stripes Forever. The latter is one of just two official songs of the United States. The Star Spangled Banner is the national anthem of the U.S. and Stars and Stripes Forever is the official march of the U.S. The movie Stars and Stripes Forever doesn't cover his early years but starts with Sousa as a sergeantmajor in the U.S. Marine Corps. At the time he had been principal musician and bandleader of the Marine Corps Band in Washington D.C. for 12 years. He had served and led the Marine band under five U.S. presidents. The film covers the last days with the Marines and then his years with his private band the Sousa Band. He was 35 years old in 1892 when he left the Marine Corps to build a band like no others of the day. He combined the best of what was popular at the time and had a band that one reviewer described as a military orchestra. The band toured America for two years to sellout crowds everywhere. And then went on an international tour. He received honors from royalty and government heads all across Europe. Sousa continued to tour and play across the U.S. and on a world tour for nearly 40 years. The Sousa Band was unquestionably the most famous band in the world during that time. Anyone who's ever played in a high school college city or other band has played Sousa's music. The film is a fair portrayal of Sousa's musical life through his most productive years. The characters of Willie Little and Lily Becker are fictional for the romantic and comedy effects. Robert Wagner and Debra Paget play them well. Ruth Hussey is Jennie Sousa. All of the cast are very good. The musicians chosen for the film were superb and gave the music the energy that Sousa displayed in his directing. Movies such as this are good for showing the works of the great musicians. I would have enjoyed some more of a closer look at Sousa the man and his family. But this is definitely a movie to get one up on his or her feet to stomp around the room to the music. The film has a nice blend of humor. Here are some favorite lines. For more see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie. John Philip Sousa What in the name of all get out's been keeping you so long? Jennie Sousa I was hearing the children's prayers. Sousa Does that take all night? Jennie They were praying for you.Sousa It's always a pleasure to meet young ladies whom I find sitting on my lap. Jennie Sousa And as to hearing you sing my husband would be delighted. Won't you Philip? Sousa If you say so dear. Lily Becker singing a silly song of the day Father's got 'em. Father's got 'em. Got the hycumflukies of the brain.Sousa Upon my word ma'am I've never danced with so charming and graceful a twostepper. Jennie Sousa And upon mine sir I've never danced with so charming and flattering a liar.".

She's poor he's nobility.Perrin's understated performance is a deadon portrait of adolescent longing. His eyes tell the whole story. It's difficult to imagine that any man could watch him without experiencing flashbacks to his own adolescence. He doesn't know whether to hope or not but he can't help hoping anyway. He doesn't know anything about adult courtship so he improvises as he goes along. He's unfailingly achingly kind and polite see first clause previous sentence. He's brave as he pushes against and sometimes breaks the rules that bind a young man not yet old enough to make his own rules.Claudia meanwhile also provides a deeply thought performance as a young woman whose poverty constrains her every move. She wants some tiny measure of security her fear of of the very real possibility of being out on the streets in palpable. She has no way to reach safety without depending on a man but men have been awful to her. And she wants desperately not to cross the final line of degradation and become a whore. She'll take money but only if she can satisfy herself that it is a gift that is only if she can feel that she still has some measure of choice in what happens next. Several men including Perrin are trying to help her. We see her hesitate and calculate in almost every conversation trying to decide if the safety offered is real calculating what she will have to give up if she accepts. Claudia is not in glamor mode here she is beautiful and the men are swarming around her but her clothes are cheap and she's living out of her suitcase.This is a fine film but it's not likely to be in anyone's top ten. I think most people will find it moving and well worth watching.Why not a GREAT film? I think this is not so much because of particular flaws of the film as because of its modest dimensions. The film is not trying to make a grand statement. It delivers deeply felt and moving drama and two completely believable and interesting characters. Enough for me. P.S. On the dubbed version the voicing is surprisingly good.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Unrequited Italian Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Underrated and little known to the Hollywood mainstream this is an ofttold unrequited story of a boy falling in love with a woman. Jacques Perrin plays Lorenzo a wealthy boy of about 16 years old falling in love with a poor nomadic notsosuccessful showgirl named Aida played by Claudia Cardinale. Lorenzo becomes Aida's patron and guardian of sorts looking after her as Aida doesn't fully appreciate the boy's attention and kindness until the end. Instead we see her gravitate towards men who promise her a job and attention which many men will do to a beautiful girl. But they don't give her kindness but instead break promises. Aida thinks fondly of Jacques as help but like many girls she thinks of it as that and simply friendship to be repaid. Lorenzo is the only person who treats her with dignity. At what point does she realize he loves her if she does? But then I can't give you spoilers. It's a oldfashion romantic story without sex and romance. Just reality.Often mentioned as CC's first vehicle this was actually her 15th film at a young age of only 22 when it was made. Jacques went on to a fairly successful film career which included Z and Cinema Paradiso and Claudia has had one of the longest film careers of any leading lady over 50 years of consistently making films. Most of Claudia's movies are neorealist dramatic roles suitable for arthouses and auteurs rather the popular boxoffice hits. This film is not much different from her other films in how it approaches a love story from a neorealist view.Valerio Zurlini directs with simple taste nothing fancy and uses simple sets to tell his story. Zurlini made few films but this is his gift for us his masterpiece. With cinematographer Tino Santoni the two crafted a beautiful blackandwhite story highlighted by the two lead actors. Three scenes represent their skills best namely the scene on the swing as Aida sings to Lorenzo after they separate from the party. He gently puts her hand on hers and as he does she never notices and we don't see the hand until we see her eyes and expression. Then the camera slowly pans down to their hands as she stops singing. That scene was simply brilliantly directed and acted. The second was the long beach scene one of the finest and most touching in Italian cinema history. It was long silent scene of the two on the beach at dusk. Starting not romantic but as she tends to his cuts they stare at each other and the camera and lighting was simply beautiful for the two young faces. In today's quick catchy witty dialogues we forget acting is the eyes and face. That scene and the final scene if I wrote the details it would be a spoiler no? at the train station were tributes to Italian chiaroscuro and Caravaggio the art of dark and light. Like many Italian films this film ends with a slight melancholic feel and without Hollywood closure.Claudia Cardinale is incredibly sexy and beautiful with little makeup and simple attires. It's amazing that she rarely dresses glamorously in her movies but still manages to show her beauty. She and Jacques give great performances. Compared to Sophia Loren or Gina Lollabrigida Cardinale is a slightly better actress but many of her best roles were never mainstream Hollywood and she didn't have that English accent Loren was able to master. She acts with her eyes facial expressions and gestures extremely well.This was named one of the Ten Best Movies of the Year by the New York Times and also made their 1000 Best Films list. Girl with a Suitcase La ragazza con la valigia is still occasionally shown in arthouses and museums today.Similar films are Summer of 42 which is nostalgic 710 and more favorably I'd compare and recommend two other foreign films Baran FrenchIranian and Malena Italian. I'd give Baran a 910 also which has incredibly beautiful scenes in a neorealist flair. The cinematography by Mohammad Davudi in that film directed by Majid Majidi is brilliant. Like Girl With a Suitcase the plot is simply but the film is brilliant. Malena is cute funny and touching with beautiful Monica Bellucci but simply not as good 7.510.".

Like many Italian films this film ends with a slight melancholic feel and without Hollywood closure.Claudia Cardinale is incredibly sexy and beautiful with little makeup and simple attires. It's amazing that she rarely dresses glamorously in her movies but still manages to show her beauty. She and Jacques give great performances. Compared to Sophia Loren or Gina Lollabrigida Cardinale is a slightly better actress but many of her best roles were never mainstream Hollywood and she didn't have that English accent Loren was able to master. She acts with her eyes facial expressions and gestures extremely well.This was named one of the Ten Best Movies of the Year by the New York Times and also made their 1000 Best Films list. Girl with a Suitcase La ragazza con la valigia is still occasionally shown in arthouses and museums today.Similar films are Summer of 42 which is nostalgic 710 and more favorably I'd compare and recommend two other foreign films Baran FrenchIranian and Malena Italian. I'd give Baran a 910 also which has incredibly beautiful scenes in a neorealist flair. The cinematography by Mohammad Davudi in that film directed by Majid Majidi is brilliant. Like Girl With a Suitcase the plot is simply but the film is brilliant. Malena is cute funny and touching with beautiful Monica Bellucci but simply not as good 7.510.";

	schema:reviewBody "This following to Closeau series is a new attempt to maintain the slapstick franchise in spite of Peter Sellers death by means the substituting in Italian actor Roberto Benigni . This eight installment is a passable and average comedy because the formula is run out  it stars Robert Benigni replacing Peter Sellers as one man show accompanied by an excessive Herbert Lom . After making life intolerable for clumsy Inspector Closeau  previous Chief Inspector Charles Dreifuss Herbert Lom encounters Jacques Gambrelli Robert Benigni who reminds him painfully to Inspector Clouseau  the man who drove him nutty and got insane . With good reason Gambrelli is Clouseau's son . While a princess Debrah Farentino is in France to accompany her daddy Oliver Cotton a king from far Orient on a diplomatic mission . She is abducted by some delinquents Robert Davi  Jennifer Edwards who obligate her father to abdicate  which he will not do even for her. And since her nation has such close ties to France the Police Prefect instructs commissioner Dreyfuss to go where the princess was abducted and directing the investigation. On the way he runs into the kidnappers and were to be shot when a Gendarme stumbles into them and saves Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss oversees that there is something familiar about this patrolman. When he goes to the local police chief and says him that he will be handling the investigation and asks for his best man he assigns him Gambrelli who just happens to be the Gendarme he met earlier . And having another meeting with Gambrelli he goes to his home to encounter his mummy Maria Claudia Cardinale and is shocked to discover that results to be Closeau's son .The revenge of the Pink Panther  release was the fifth part of series of Inspector Clouseau from French Surete and the last entry by the late Peter Sellers though he would follow playing but with outtakes in films as Trail of the Pink Panther. After that  it was continued by The curse of the Pinnk Panther that turned to be another flop and starred by Ted Wass . The son of the Pink Panther  is the eight part of Closeau series and a light comedy starred by the great Roberto Benigni as the inept and bungler Inspector of the French Surete . The movie gets entertaining and hilarious moments here and there. This slapstick picture contains amusing  funny scenes  fresh and diverting moments but also flaws and gaps . Herbert Lom steals the show parodying his classic character including his ordinary faces  grimaces and gestures . Appears as secondaries the usual series as Burt Kwouk  Grahame Stark and of course a mature Claudia Cardinale . The actors seem to enjoy themselves immensely but they are supposedly amusing holidays . Lively and atmospheric music by habitual Henry Mancini with songs arranged by Bobby MacFerrin  furthermore magnificent opening and ending cartoon titles by Chris Hummel . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Dick Bush . The film is regularly penned and directedas alwaysby Blake Edwards. Several chuckles and gags  the result of which is one acceptable entry from series but inferior to precedent outings as the original The Pink Panther A shot in dark Return of pink pantherRevenge of pink panther. Director Blake Edwards although gets some inspired bits penned by him however he attempts to alive his classic personage with no much success . The flick will appeal to Pink Panther series buffs and Roberto Benigni fans. This is arguably one of most mediocre of the series about the botcher and bungling Inspector .".

And since her nation has such close ties to France the Police Prefect instructs commissioner Dreyfuss to go where the princess was abducted and directing the investigation. On the way he runs into the kidnappers and were to be shot when a Gendarme stumbles into them and saves Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss oversees that there is something familiar about this patrolman. When he goes to the local police chief and says him that he will be handling the investigation and asks for his best man he assigns him Gambrelli who just happens to be the Gendarme he met earlier . And having another meeting with Gambrelli he goes to his home to encounter his mummy Maria Claudia Cardinale and is shocked to discover that results to be Closeau's son .The revenge of the Pink Panther  release was the fifth part of series of Inspector Clouseau from French Surete and the last entry by the late Peter Sellers though he would follow playing but with outtakes in films as Trail of the Pink Panther. After that  it was continued by The curse of the Pinnk Panther that turned to be another flop and starred by Ted Wass . The son of the Pink Panther  is the eight part of Closeau series and a light comedy starred by the great Roberto Benigni as the inept and bungler Inspector of the French Surete . The movie gets entertaining and hilarious moments here and there. This slapstick picture contains amusing  funny scenes  fresh and diverting moments but also flaws and gaps . Herbert Lom steals the show parodying his classic character including his ordinary faces  grimaces and gestures . Appears as secondaries the usual series as Burt Kwouk  Grahame Stark and of course a mature Claudia Cardinale . The actors seem to enjoy themselves immensely but they are supposedly amusing holidays . Lively and atmospheric music by habitual Henry Mancini with songs arranged by Bobby MacFerrin  furthermore magnificent opening and ending cartoon titles by Chris Hummel . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Dick Bush . The film is regularly penned and directedas alwaysby Blake Edwards. Several chuckles and gags  the result of which is one acceptable entry from series but inferior to precedent outings as the original The Pink Panther A shot in dark Return of pink pantherRevenge of pink panther. Director Blake Edwards although gets some inspired bits penned by him however he attempts to alive his classic personage with no much success . The flick will appeal to Pink Panther series buffs and Roberto Benigni fans. This is arguably one of most mediocre of the series about the botcher and bungling Inspector .";

Whether this is the fault of Blake Edwards or maybe he intended it to be that way is unknown. Roberto Benigni is the Son. O.K he is now an academy award winner but in 1993 a complete unknown. If anyone on the movie wanted it to be a success then a bigger name should have been chosen a David Jason Dudley Moore or Rowan Atkinson. Benigni does quite a good impersonation of Peter Sellers throughout the movie but this aside isn't very funny or charming. The return of cast members like Herbert Lom Graham Starke Burt Kwouk and Liz Smith is good. But overall the movie seems forced and is something of a hit and miss. Lets hope the upcoming Mike Myers remake breathes new life into this series.".

	schema:reviewBody "No this movie is not as good as the earliest Pink Panter movies and no Roberto Benigni ain't no Peter Sellers but fair is fair this is an entertaining and fun enough comedy that showed some potential for a new fresh start of the Pink Panther series.Everything in this movie indicated that they intended this movie as a new and fresh start of the Pink Panther series. The movie was more of its time and modern and looked more like a James Bond movie done comedy style than an old fashioned made slapstick like all of the other previous Pink Panther movies were done in.Too bad that people never really gave this movie a fair change. People just thought that the Pink Panther series should had stopped with the death of Peter Sellers in 1980 and director Blake Edwards should had never went on making more Pink Panther movies as he did. This was the third Pink Panther movie without Peter Sellers so people were already mostly fed up with it and after the previous too disappointing Pink Panther entries the expectations for this movie naturally weren't really high. But I for one however wouldn't had mind seeing more Pink Panther movies with the son of Clouseau in it.No I never really have been a Roberto Benigni fan since he mostly only plays naive smiling jumping and screaming comical characters but he simply was well cast in this movie and did a good job with his role. I think it was a good move that they didn't let hem try to impersonate Peter Seller's performance as the famous 'brilliant' inspector but instead letting him be a total different character with Benigni his own interpretation.Nevertheless it's not a movie that totally abandons the style or spirit of the previous Pink Panther movies. It still let some old character reappear in this movie such as Police Commissioner Charles Dreyfus finally he got his promotion Professor Auguste Balls Cato and Sergeant Francois Duval. It however also becomes painfully obviously that by now the actors who are portraying the characters got terribly old and it became time for some fresh blood. As much as I loved Herbert Lom in all of the previous Pink Panther movies as Dreyfus he really was too old for his role in this movie to be still believable and good in it. Same goes for Burt Kwouk as Cato who at the time of this movie already was well in his 60's. The fact that this is a more comical approach of James Bond also means that there is some more story present this time with a real villain and a love interested action shooting as well as most other typical genre clichs. The feeling that this is a more comical version of James Bond is being strengthened by the presence of Robert Davi who previously played the main villain in the James Bond movie Licence to Kill. Basically he plays the same role as he always does a ruthless criminal boss who always is looking for more power and money. But if you're so great at playing these sort of roles why wouldn't you take it? A only complaint could be that he doesn't play his role comically enough. He is serious as always though I'm not to sure if this was what the filmmakers originally had in mind. The different approach of the entire movie might also be a reason why some people have difficulties accepting this as a Pink Panther movie but I in fact think that all of the Pink Panther movies are somewhat and always wanted to be like James Bond movies only done in a complete different comical style.Director Blake Edwards with this movie shows that old fashioned slapstick can still be incorporated properly into 'modern' movies if done and handled correctly. Blake Edwards with this movie shows that he still had it in him which also makes it sort of a shame that his career pretty much died right after this movie.Give this movie a fair change and you might end up liking it for what it is.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Benigni Is a nice choice for Sellers' illegitimate Did I spell that right? son. Not only does he kind of look like Sellers but he has the gift of completely falling on his face and making it look like an accident. Burt Kwouk is entertaining as always as Kato. As is Graham Stark as Auguste Balls. It is nice to see them both in this movie. I also liked seeing Claudia Cardinale back in this one. But I have to give special kudos to Herbert Lom. The first film I saw him in was A Shot in the Dark and it made him my favorite actor. I often found myself watching the other films in the series mainly because of him. He does an impressive job for being as old as he was I think he was about 75. When the bomb blew up in Maria's house and he was standing there in his smoldering suit with the poodle humping his leg I almost died laughing. Also Edwards gives more focus to his character of Charles Dreyfus. Instead of ending up in an insane asylum like he usually does in the other Pink Panther films He manages to solve the mystery AND get the girl. He giggles he twitches he goes a little nuts but he wouldn't be Dreyfus if he didn't. What's really great is that he makes peace with his enemy Jacques Clouseau and he becomes a father to his son and it's hard not to wish him well. God bless you Mr. Lom. Long may you twitch.P.S. I have heard rumors that a new Pink Panther series is in the works with Mike Myers as the lead. It will never work. I'm not saying that Myers is a bad actor. I don't think he is. He just can't play stupid. When Peter Sellers did something stupid you didn't think it was acting. When he fell off a couch you were completely convinced that his character WAS that dumb. It honestly didn't look like acting. I just don't think that Myers will be able to do that. He's to confident. Maybe he will prove me wrong. I hope that the movie's creators bring back Lom Kwouk and Stark though!".

	schema:reviewBody "While riding the subway eight years ago I saw the billboards for Son of the Pink Panther and I really didn't think much about it then. I had yet to become a fan of Blake Edwards' work and I really hadn't seen any of the previous Panther films.Flash forward to 1999. Turner Classic Movies had shown the first six entries in the Panther series and I had watched them in chronological order which I think is a good idea for anyone to do. I had seen Curse on tape and I decided to check out Son of the Pink Panther just out of curiosity. I had read some reviews which were pretty dismal. So I had no reason to expect anything great.Imagine my surprise when I found myself laughing a lot during the 95 minute running time of Son. This was a clever funny and very original entry in the longrunning Panther series. Blake Edwards' instinct was right on the money when he cast Italian comedian Roberto Benigni in the role of Clouseau's illegitimate son. Benigni displays all the traits that made Peter Sellers such a great talent. He plays the comic scenes very straight which sells it so much better than if he had played it slyly. And the films he has made since The Monster Night on Earth and Life Is Beautiful which was sort of his own Being There just confirms my initial reaction. And of course what is a Panther film without Dreyfus played as always by Herbert Lom who works well with Benigni in many memorable sequences.If I have a complaint about Son it is that it tends to get too preoccupied with the plot. The best Panther films didn't depend on plot as much as characterization and Son suffers because of it as did Edwards' previous disappointment Switch. But Son has a manic comic energy and polish that Switch lacked and the payoffs work as in Switch they did not.Son of the Pink Panther is a better film than Curse Revenge and the original film but not Strikes Again Return and A Shot in the Dark of which this film has its roots in Sadly Edwards retired from theatrical features after this although he still works in TV. He showed so much vigor and life in Son that makes me want to see him make another Panther film especially with Roberto Benigni. I'm still waiting.12 out of 4 stars".

Of course it's up to him to solve the case which I won't even bother going into detail with. My favorite scene uhhh... some physical comedy with a bicycle toward the beginning. Can't we all as a whole agree to never make or support another Pink Panther movie ever again?

	schema:reviewBody "After the success or rather lack thereof of Curse of the Pink Panther Blake Edwards realized he had to accept that Peter Sellers was no more and that he still needed to bring the name Clouseau back into the franchise even if it meant giving Sellers' classic character an illegitimate son.Enter future Oscar winner Roberto Benigni who would actually receive the exact opposite of an Oscar for this role. He's cleanshaven part Italian Jacques Gumbrelli Clouseau Jr. not mustached Jacques Clouseau making this a new character and leaving Benigni to the type of humor that works for him.Unfortunately the humor doesn't work for the entire movie. The movie moves almost completely away from the overdone routines of the rest of the series but there are only a few laugh out loud scenes with some small chuckles in between. The biggest problem with the film though would have to be the plot. Pink Panther plots have been mangled messes before but never to this extent. There's so much political intrigue and scandal involved that it's hard to figure out what anyone's motivation in even during the climax.Herbert Lom is back for his final performance as Chief Inspector Dreyfus now more sane and subdued. Burt Kwouk is also back reprising his reoccurring role as Kato the late Clouseau's humble servant. Disguise master Professor Balls played in the most recent films by Harvey Korman is now played by Graham Stark a friend of Sellers who appeared in different roles in many of the films. These performances almost make the movie feel like a valid part of the series.Henry Mancini's score as in all of the films is the highlight and Bobby McFerrin's performance of the theme music is perfect. Especially when it provides the background for a battle between an animated Benigni and the famous Pink Panther cartoon character racing around a live action concert hall.But the bottom line sadly is that the plot's a mess and the film isn't as funny as the Peter Sellers classics or even the previous entry sansSellers Curse of the Pink Panther. Maybe if the movie had been a buddy movie involving Benigni's character and Sgt. Clifton Sleigh the protagonist of Curse the actors' combined talents would be enough to create a comedy that could shine in Sellers' shadow. Unfortunately that wasn't to be.".

In Curse there was some wonder among Dreyfus and Francois if Clifton Sleigh was related to Clouseau. Here it's confirmed that Gendarme Jacques Gambrelli Roberto Benigni is indeed Clouseau's son by his mother Maria Gambrelli returning Claudia Cardinale previously Princess Dala in The original Pink Panther. She replaced Elke Sommer of A Shot in the Dark. It's also confirmed that it's been ten years since Clouseau's death perhaps a little after the events of Curse perhaps?. Besides the always welcome return of Herbert Lom as Commissioneronce again!Charles Dreyfus we also get again Burt Kwouk as Cato Liz Smith as Marta Balls she previously appeared in Trail of the Pink Panther in outtakes from The Pink Panther Strikes Again as well as Curse and back as her husband Professor Auguste Balls the always versatile Graham Stark though Harvey Korman played him in Smith's previous entries. With Andre Maranne seemingly unavailable Dermot Crowley takes over his role of Seargent Francois Duval here. Also new to the cast is Debrah Farentino as Princess Yasmin who falls for Gambrelli Robert Davi as the villain Hans Zabra and Edwards' daughter Jennifer as Yussa. All are good in their roles. Incidentally the director's son Geoffrey Edwards who previously was cowriter on Trail as well as Curse is second unit director here as well as the director of the liveaction section of the title sequence. Okay I liked Curse despite the ending so I wondered how I'd feel about this one after what happened there. I was very glad no mention was made of Clouseau's going over to the other side so I half wondered if that was conveniently forgotten or what. Anyway Benigni was fine mixing his and Sellers' characterizations in making us believe he really was Jacques Clouseau's son and his scenes with Lom are pure gold. Kwouk as Cato is also nicely done compared to his overthetop attacks on Curse. In fact I liked his disguise as a Jewish man and his surprise attacks on the villains though I half wondered if he'd die when one of them kicked him back in the refrigerator. Not every set piece was laughyourheadoff funny but I was pretty entertained from beginning to end. Oh and there's a cameo by Benigni's wife Nicoletta Braschi involving another twist that I won't reveal here. And the beginning liveactionanimated title sequence by Desert Music PicturesKroyer Films Inc. respectively marked a new kind of hilarity as conductor Pink Panther who is passed the baton from Henry Mancini in a nice cameo tries to stop the animated Benigni from wreaking havoc in the musicfilm projector studio as we see Bobby McFerrin use his unique mouth to warble his own version of Mancini's Pink Panther theme. So with this series entry we say goodbye to the cast and crew of the previous nine including this one Pink Panther movies especially Mancini as he'd die not long after. This also turned out to be Edwards' last feature film as once again Son of the Pink Panther flopped. So in a way this was indeed the end of the ORIGINAL Pink Panther series. However someone decided to reboot the series thirteen years later. Next up The Pink Panther 2006...".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Blake Edwards has produced a lot of funny films during his time. His most famous film that comes to mind is The Pink Panther 1963. Ironically enough Edwards ended his theatrical film career with one of his most disappointing sequels to the pink panther franchise financially and commercially. Thankfully there are still a few fans that believe Son of the Pink Panther is not a total waste of time.The story continues of the last Pink Panther film where the audience follows the actions of Jacques Gambrelli a clumsy and light hearted inspector played by the brilliant Roberto Benigni. Unknown to him Gambrelli has no idea that he is the son of the great detective Jacques Clouseau but he's still just as klutzy like his father. Benigni was an interesting choice for the offspring of Peter Sellers' character. Like most think Benigni wouldn't make a great follow up. But to put it in perspective he's actually not as bad as one thinks.Benigni is not a professional at speaking the English language but he at least knows how to do it. His voice is a little choppy and his goofy antics are slightly over the top but doesn't that go well with his gaunt figure and puffy hair? I liked him here. Also starring in his last theatrical film is Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus. He has some good moments mostly when he's around Gambrelli. I can't say that any of the comical elements in this film are original but I had some good laughs a lot of the time.Robert Davi plays Hans Zarba the main villain of a terrorist group. I didn't really care for Davi's character. He doesn't make Zarba anything worth noticing for. Oh well you can't have everything. Henry Mancini did the final soundtrack for this franchise as well. Nothing sounds out of the ordinary and that's a good thing. Too bad he's not around anymore though. Mancini's a good composer.Even though many people think so Benigni doesn't disappoint in this movie. Son of the Pink Panther is still goofy and it has a lot of the components from the beginning films that made this franchise a success.".

It wasn't a good idea to make a movie about a member of ETA when the PP Popular Party was governing the country they were totally against the Basque separatism and of course against ETA.
