	schema:reviewBody "The Yotoden feature isn't really a film. Well it's not how Yotoden was ever intended to be seen anyway. In the UK Yotoden has been released in it's original OAV format in 3 one hour parts. In the US however aforementioned series was bought up edited down to 90 minutes removing most of the story segments in favour for the series' admittedly brilliant battle sequences. What story was left was turned into gibberish by an unintelligible dub and the rest is history.Yotoden is one of the better Anime series to make it over here during the 80s. Bubblegum Crisis it ain't but when you think that BGC aside the era it's from was typified by Robotech and Fist of the North Star even the American feature version looks quite solid. The story is reasonably strong never overegging itself too much but keeping dramatic tension high regardless and the character design and animation is inventive. Many reviewers have commented on it's similarity to the better known Ninja Scroll and this is a fair comment but the extra restraint Yotoden shows makes it a more subtle and satisfying watch than Ninja Scroll.Still it has it's down points. The ending is both anticlimactic and slightly annoying the main character actually gets to do very little despite apparently being 'the only one who can stop this disaster' etc etc and the movie is showing its age much worse than some of its peers perhaps because of its rigid attachment to the constraints of the ninja genre. If it mixed it up a bit more Yotoden would come out of enjoyable and into great but it just doesn't manage it. Also the American voice actors don't really fit too well with their characters and the story in the halflength version is butchered so badly as to make the series incomprehensible.If you can track a full unedited version down add two points to the above score and check it out. However as it stands there's not enough going for the US version of Yotoden to really recommend it over other more coherent films like Ninja Scroll or Shadow Skill. Yotoden in it's original form is a great sleeper hit from the 80s but getting your mitts on it will be very tricky.".

Start from the very beginning the story is all around battles fights death and revenge.  It goes on and on for entire one and a half hour.  It was interesting at the beginning but I grew very tire after before the show was half way through.  Unlike other animations this one is lack of humor.  There are not many interactions between the characters either. The good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice.".

The film is well put together and John Kielty for example is a young actor at the outset of his film career at the time. It may not be a blockbuster but for a young Scottish actor it was the perfect entry into film.

Is that not what films are supposed to be about!? But it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests May Thomas is onto something we should pay attention to. For independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive a lot can be learned from watching this film technically it has everything going for it the use of light music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise. The actors performances are believable to a point if not slightly under played i felt there was much more in there more depth in particular from the male lead John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really does bother me as a film maker myself is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour?  Do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? Or is this the future of wonderful affordable film making?".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched the DVD of this award winning film. One Life Stand is a stark drama that through it's pace black and white shots and atmospheric music paints a very compelling and honest picture. It's a story about life's dilemma's around power sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. The mother very well acted by Maureen Carr is uptight and drawn in on herself. The father only appears on the sidelines and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama. Money is hidden in boxes and shoes.The writing was superb and I liked the sensual closeup shots of details such as nails red lips a candle mirrors etc. The way the camera was used made it very intimate. It's a harrowing tale with sexual undertones while the Glasgow drizzle on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters.There are some highly memorable shots conveyed simply by a walk or a dropped shoulder  such as Trise walking away under the bridge. And the stunned and hurt look on Trise's face in the call centre which hopes to helps people through using tarot cards as she listens to a caller talk of her own abuse.At the start we see John Paul wideeyed and innocent having photos shot as he wants to try modelling. Trise his mother is deluded and making poor choices for him in a way pushing him away while she tries to keep him. John Paul's modelling turns into escort work and Trise's boss offers her money and eventually they go on a date. There are also moments of humour and subtle irony. One excellent scene is when they are having a fairly normal meal and starting to open up a bit when the father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything over. But this and other things offer moments of hope.I felt at times the pacing of the film was a shade too intense but this is a small detail in another wise challenging and memorable film and something a bit different. It stands in start contrast to most American films which are either total fantasy or the real' world' as seen through tainted glasses. This film depicts life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images. This isn't 'light entertainment' but a thought provoking and real life drama.One Life Stand is a truly involving and emotionally honest film.".

This is a very quirky interesting piece and I will be looking for anything else made by the same team. The director is certainly one to watch.";

The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants. It then shits to Naruto Sakura and Shikumaru hunting down a ferret for what they think is going to be an easy assignment. They soon find out otherwise as they are also attacked and Naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior clad in armor. They both are injured and taken in by a caravan and soon after Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wishes to create a utopia. Of course all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around. My favorite was the one involving Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly which is a very big mistake. The concluding fight is rather good too involving Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of those in the previous movie.".

However one must be a blind deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film's faults. Whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable there were a lot of things that could be improved on. Naruto Movie 2 however takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.The action first of all was incredibly cinematic. The lighting setting and style was three fold as effective as in the first movie. In the first we were given basic action well animated and choreographed animation but nothing eye popping however this movie's cinematography was exceptional the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fighting.The animation was very good. It rivalled Disney however since this is a movie about TV characters there was nothing exceptionable about the character design or detail to the actual characters however the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used twice the amount of cels for each second because there was absolutely nothing jittery about the animation at all it was incredibly fluid.The music... I think that's where this movie fails. The original composerconductor for the TV show was used for the film and I don't really feel that he did that good of a job. The music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good but the synthesisers used for the film couldn't convey the tune very well. However they didn't fail the film at all adding as a good accompaniment to the action. But except for a few violinstring pieces towards the end and some choral work the music didn't excel any boundaries or act as anything special.The story was fun. It was a reasonably typical storyline for Naruto and was very similar to the first movies except again it took everything that had been wrong with the first film's story and improved upon them. The characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film. It kept making you think the film would be ending any second now but then it would move on but instead of feeling dragged out the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and exciting.Overall this film is a goodun but however good it might be it is most definitely one for the fans. I enjoyed the film but thats because... I'm a fan! But I can see just like with Final Fantasy's Advent Children it doesn't excel as a movie but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half. Though I think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current nonwatchers it won't give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to Naruto screens. However despite all this it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of upsetting fillers.".

The animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining! I especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with kankuro and the fight with Gaara fighting the shape shifting female warriors! All the characters you want are here! Naruto Sakura Gaara Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari was in the movie Shikamaru could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion! And maybe they could have a PASSIONATE KISS! In my summary at the top I say that this qualify's more as a piece of Cinema than just an extended episode. And it does!

	schema:reviewBody "When I rewatched this movie recently it was actually only the second time I had ever seen it. I had seen Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow like a dozen times back in the day but I only saw this one once. This was another strong Naruto movie. It is quite different from its predecessor in a lot of interesting ways.The film has an engaging enough story with a pretty strong message. A world without war is something that we all want but trying to make it happen at the expense of many other people's lives is the wrong way to do it. A better way to make it happen is if we are all willing to work together.Temujin was quite an interesting character and his character arc was fun to go along with. Even though a lot of people might have seen it coming the reveal at the climax that Master Haido was using Temujin the whole time really makes you feel for Temujin. Having him go through that redemption at the end was pulled off well.Sakura and Shikamaru are Naruto's allies in the film and they are utilized pretty well. Gaara and Kankuro also got their time to shine even though they didn't have much involvement until about halfway through.Despite some slightly questionable lighting during some of the fight scenes the animation on the whole is really good. The fight scenes themselves are as energetic and well choreographed as anyone could have hoped. The final showdown against Master Haido was a bit long but never lost my attention.It's a close race between this one and Land of Snow. I might say I like Land of Snow just a bit more because it had better pacing. However this one is still a great followup that I definitely recommend.RATING B".

Gaara and Kankuro also got their time to shine even though they didn't have much involvement until about halfway through.Despite some slightly questionable lighting during some of the fight scenes the animation on the whole is really good. The fight scenes themselves are as energetic and well choreographed as anyone could have hoped. The final showdown against Master Haido was a bit long but never lost my attention.It's a close race between this one and Land of Snow. I might say I like Land of Snow just a bit more because it had better pacing. However this one is still a great followup that I definitely recommend.RATING B";

Also the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is all about great fun great action great story ... But then came the 2nd movie. I was very hyped because the first movie turned out great. But it didn't satisfy me one bit... The story was lame action wasn't all that great... especially compared to the Anime series... same goes for the quality of animation. I found it very poorly... Could the story get any lamer... ANY ??? Where's the kyuubi of Naruto ?? Not once does he turn demon... I mean ... COME ON !!! My advice is... see the series  until episode 140  then it's just fillers  and then read the Manga because that's still great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future...All and all I gave it a 4 just because it's Naruto...".

	schema:reviewBody "After much waiting for all major Naruto fans the second Naruto movie has been released with English subtitles courtesy of Dattebayo. This movie features another storyline that has nothing to do with the anime as was done in the first movie. The movie follows the theme of creating a utopia but the irony lies within the bad character.Once again Naruto and his friends this time it's just Sakura and Shikamaru yeah Sasuke is still kidnapped by Orichimaru seems noone really cares anymore. Yet we also see the appearance of Gaara and Kankuro adding a wider array of wellknown characters to the film.The movie itself was created quite well. I enjoyed the graphics quite a bit it was really well drawn. The music was quite nice as well considering the standard for normal Naruto anime music. Interestingly though is that I don't think they used the theme song that is sung by Naruto his actor really called OH ENKA! Ending theme Ding!Dong!Dang! was quite nice.I reckon this storyline was however worse than the first movie. The first movie had reference to Kakashi's past and we actually see a flashback with Zabuza in it that actually makes the movie fit in with the series whereas in this movie you have a totally random storyline that links probably only with the relations being the country of Fire and the country of Wind.The utopia idea was good and using the bad guy to manipulate the truth and making it look right was ingenious. Yet the story lacks a bit of information on the traveling tribe focusing on Temujin and his family.The fighting was not very satisfactory although the scene with Gaara in it was nicely done. At the end I was hoping that Naruto would somehow combine his red Rasengan with the blue one that Temujin made out of his crystal. At least then it would look more interesting. But instead he used them separately and that blew the climax of the film. Compare this to the first movie Naruto creates a 7colour Chakra Rasengan and aims it straight for the enemy sending him spiraling into a tall glass wall. There was less fighting overall and because there were quite a few each fight was much shorter than it should have been.Some viewers may be able to overlook the bad sides of the film and trust me there are quite a few however true Naruto fans will be disappointed at the storyline. It's not boring but it's not interesting either which makes the one and a half years wait in vain.Bad movie first Naruto movie was much better but even then the first movie was nothing to be especially proud of.".

With new jutsus and garra in the movie u know it is good. and the music was good as well but i find it to be lacking something. But the ending theme song was a plus. dind dong dang i think was a really good song. I totally recommend it.all in all i give this movie a 10 because i just love it. if u do decide to watch it enjoy it. lol".

Dennis tells lies in order to impress his wannabe' girlfriend he is overheard in a pub boasting about a fictional drugs ring by a policeman the ever excellent Micheal Elphick  But the so called drug deal by the seaside is not just a lie the police have been trying to crack this for a long time. Dennis becomes a supergrass and gets dragged deeper and deeper into it The trouble is he doesn't know anything or does he.....? The Supergrass is one of those films you are still trying to work out is Dennis just the goon you think he is or does he know more than he'll tell? Though the Supergrass has its truly funny moments it is added to by the terrible 80's fashion and music which obviously was not supposed to be funny first time around. Dennis buys a horrible red leather jacket identical to Micheal Jackson's thriller one was this actually cool in the 80's or was it intended to be funny? The Film is made up of great individual performances Peter Richardson Keith Allen Jennifer Saunders Daniel Peacock Nigel Planer all put in exceptional shows of acting and who can forget Alexi Sayle's most annoying policeman. The only thing missing is Rik Mayall. If you are a fan of British Comedy and the likes of the young Ones etc this is a must own film    ".

The beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes Robbie Coltrane...! Not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you haven't got much else to do like I did. You might need to hunt around for it though  I was lucky as my local video store stocks it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a typical British comedy starring Adrian Edmundson who is well known for playing Vivian in the Young Ones. If you don't know who the Young Ones are then all I can say is find out. It was a series made in the early eighties about four university students who lived together. This movie has a similar feel to the Young Ones except that Edmundson's character Denis is actually much more nerdy.Denis is a mother's boy and wants to impress a girl so he makes up a story about how he is a courier for a major drug ring. Unfortunately some policemen overhear him and arrest him. When they go to charge him the computer tells them that he is a very important criminal and summons a detective from Scotland Yard. He is then made a deal either go to gaol or help the police bust this heroin ring. He chooses the second option and asks for 3000 and a jaguar and goes to the seaside town of Hope Bay with two detectives who happen to be exlovers.This is a clever movie because we are never too sure what Denis is. He claims to be a courier but once things start getting hot he confesses that he made everything up but did he? Namely because there is a lot of evidence found that points to a drug ring operating in the area. The end also leaves a little question because Denis sees some heroin being smuggled out and decides not to reveal it.Supergrass is more of a movie about the relationships between the three main characters Denis Harvey and Harvey's exgirlfriend. Denis wants to be popular to have a girlfriend and to have money but he is trapped in his mother's house. Thus it seems that he continued his deceit to the police because he saw a way to get what he wanted. Harvey is constantly tortured because his exgirlfriend is with him and making a lot of moves onto Denis. It seems that she is doing that to torture Harvey.This is quite a funny movie and has both Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in it as well as Alexi Sayle. I have never seen French and Saunders but I do know what Sayle and Edmundson are like. This movie is funny and for fans of British Comedy it is a good one to watch.".

So to get her to come along with him on a romantic getaway he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and entice her to spend some time with him. Trouble is Dennis' lie is that he's somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring and while telling her a couple of policemen overhear his boasting and nick him. And so begins this witty movie full of slick comedy and crude jokes. Dennis is banged up in the local nick and much to the arresting officers' delight there seems to be no way out Andrea's earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of Stand by Your Man by the two officers'. Then comes along Commander Robertson Ronald Allen Chief Intelligence Scotland Yard. He makes a deal with Dennis that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases. Dennis agrees and is teamed up with Harvey Duncan Peter Richardson and Lesley Reynolds Jennifer Saunders. The rest is an unforgettable ribtickling experience with Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adding humourous colour to the film. His walk along the drydock against Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes is superb and probably the best scene in motion picture history. The two officers' who nick Dennis are wonderfully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin and Alexei Sayle as the motorcycle cop is a laugh! If you want something good to watch on a Saturday night then I suggest you rent this. You won't forget it!".

Saunders Edmondson and Richardson were very good at portraying the odd trio and it was nice to see Ade and Jennifer in a more serious role than those in their usual repertoire. All three of them were very sweet especially Ade as a naive supergrass. This comedy is very different in plot as well as style from other works of my favorite married couple of comedians but that is what makes this movie so special and original at least to me. People who aren't fans maybe won't like this flick. There's nothing groundbreaking about it and it's humor is much more subtle than Ab Fab or Bottom but nevertheless it made me laugh a lot.

We don't see and feel the changes everyone undergoes as a result of staying in the Italian villa as we do in the remake but Ann Harding does her best to get that point across.  She is ethereal and pretty and her hothouse flower talent would seem wellsuited to the part.  It's interesting to compare the two versions and see how the 1992 version managed to successfully capture the flavor of the period without sacrificing anything to a modern moviegoing audience's baser expectations for entertainment.

All the elements come together to produce a movie that although nearly forgotten now still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.The actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. Ann Harding is the freespirited wife longing for 'wisteria  tranquillity' far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle. Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past.The men in the story are also well cast. As Miss Harding's husband Frank Morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen as Miss Alexander's spouse is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for England his hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bathtub is made even funnier with the assistance of Charles Judels  Rafaela Ottiano as the castle's harried servants. Finally Ralph Forbes one of the decade's finest forgotten actors is joyously eccentric as the ladies' lighthearted landlord.Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Ethel Griffies playing the proprietress of the Hampstead Housewives Club.".

While the basic plot exists the lush detail that makes the 1991 version so delightful is completely missing. We only get a hint as to how the women change during their enchanted April.While Morgan does an OK job as Wilkins Owen is overbearing and oafish as Arbuthnot and he dominates far too many scenes with his overacting. Ralph Forbes as Briggs the landlord also gets little to do and his ultimate attraction to Caroline is pretty much bypassed in favor of reconciliation between Harding and Morgan.The power of the 1991 version lies in its focus on the four women their growing friendship and how their enchanted April breaks down the differences in their ages and social strata very important in 1920s English society. This version smartly downplays the men's roles as secondary to the women's. The 1991 version is a story about how women can grow when freed from their marital and social roles. The 1935 version never gets to this as the women are subservient to the men.Worth seeing for Ann Harding but don't expect the magic of the 1991 version.".

Harding and Alexander arrive at the castle to find two other invited guests Jane Baxter and Ms. Ralph having taken over the main rooms with Ralph so determined to remain uninvolved with the other guests that she vigorously pushes her desk in front of the door and saunters off with her cane even though she's obviously well over the age of supposedly doing anything so physical.

	schema:reviewBody "Many other reviewers inexplicably focus on how the 1935 adaptation of Enchanted April isn't faithful to the 1922 source novel by Elizabeth von Arnim or is somehow inferior to the longer 1991 version. Sadly for them they're missing the point. Firstly this is a work complete in and of itself and neither enhanced nor diminished by specious comparison to a related work. Secondly it isn't actually based directly on the novel but the successful 1925 Broadway play that the novel inspired hence this being a US as opposed to Europeanmade film. A single viewing makes this fact abundantly clear. What's more at a mere but adequate 95 minutes the excellent 1991 version is not  and could not  be faithful to the novel either.What we do have here is an utterly charming and concise little film that despite its US studiobound production effectively establishes both mood and miseenscne especially by clever use of rear projection matte paintings and spacious wellappointed sets. Even within the necessarily limited characterisations and plot development dictated to by its abbreviated running time of 66 minutes it manages to squeeze in much humour both subtle and slapstick wry witty dialogue and an unexpectedly powerful and poignant ending. Lastly and perhaps most of all it leaves you wanting more what more could one ask of any film? Enchanted April is a masterclass in brevity and economy in its storytelling and filmmaking and is highly recommended to all fans of early talkies.As for actually seeing it aside from infrequent TV airings as of 2017 is via the only authorised home video release a 2005 region 2 French DVD on the Editions Montparnasse label titled Avril enchant. It features a very clean print from an unconverted NTSC PAL master hence its unaltered running time and optional French subtitles in a small yellow font. Additionally there is an informative 2 minute intro  in French sans soustitres  by film historian and restorer Serge Bromberg of Lobster Films. Just be careful to avoid the lesser quality counterfeit Spanish DVD titled Un Abril Encantado on the Vrtice Cine label.You're in for a rare treat  enjoy!".

I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi a man she just met. Of course he was a friend of her brother.I did appreciate the monastery. One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have some fun. Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to popmusic that would have been another matter.Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid nations trying to destroy each other is stupid but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as part three and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no rewatch value. I can't imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once.".

The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation and you're turning Me down?!?! Yet even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents.It appears that the football coach ? has his own private gang army and he allows them encourages even to torture others. He says If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor you make them eat it Yea RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together dressed like a bunch of 1950 throwback thugs in their tight jeans and tight matching black tshirts and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home told me this crap was going on you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent.The coach ? beats up his students outside on the field in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE though was the coach telling his gang to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says MEET ME AT THE DOCKS OK see Id go inside Julies house pick up the phone call the cops and SAY Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough Then let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep and arrest his butt. This movie was just lame.".

Second the script has its weak spots it did have its moments such as with Miyagi's humour. Third there are some unrealistic moments here the ending especially. Fourth it isn't as efficiently paced as the first or third films.However it is nicely filmed the cinematography is good and the scenery is very nice. The soundtrack is pleasant and the karate is good. The direction is good enough and the characters are still at least engaging. The acting is decent Hilary Swank is a worthy replacement for Ralph Macchio while Pat Morita elevates this movie to a better level acting who is arguably the best character of the film and giving a strong performance in the process.Overall it was pretty decent and better than its reputation. It could have been better but I have seen much worse movies. 610 Bethany Cox".

To show her defiance she sneaks out a lot. Where does she go? That's right. Swank visits an injured hawk on the top of her school building that she feeds raw meat to every other day.

The FBK is pretty ridiculous. Somehow they get away with trespassing vandalism arson property damage and assault because they are some sort of pseudoROTC. And what was with the promnight bungeejump scene? The love connection between the two homosexuals Swank and Conrad is entertaining. As is the first fight scene at the gas station. Miyagi taming a vicious Doberman and the owner of the dog picking a fight with him because of it? . And of course watching Swank perform Karate moves is nothing short of hysterical.Best Line of the Movie Miyagi explains to Swank Your Grandpa saved Miyagi life... a long time ago... so Miyagi tried to say thank you... teach him karate. He love Karate. He teach your father. Your father teach you. To which Swank replies And then they died. Everybody died. Awesome. It was this scene and the delivery of that line that I learned the real range of Swank's talents. I also projected what I was drinking out of my mouth across the room.

The Karate Kid 2 managed to entertain me enough without making it seem like the fourth attempt to keep milking the original.In this fourth installment the boy has left and in place is a girl. She's a teenager and has lost her parents so her attitude and mood are affected by that. However when the great karate master in the past three films comes to babysit for a while things get tense.At first the girl is annoyed by him as she was her aunt I believe however after much time and a trip to see Monks the girl soon becomes happy. Soon she gets a date to prom and then of course things get crazy! But that's for you to find out!Anyway I rate this 710.".

Unlike Daniel Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school Miyagi went to check on her and saw her change clothes in the process. That was very funny! And the classic Wax on Wax off scene was different as well. It was funny when Miyagi tells Julie Uhoh missed spot. The set in Boston was a far cry from California. The Militant group in that group was like the Cobra Kai in Boston. And Michael Ironside's Col. Dugan was no John Kreese. His group practically deserted him when Julie kicked some serious butt. They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they'll find redemption from Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid sets some morals unlike the last three which talked about Honor and Respect. Hilary Swank is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does. Movie 9 Hilary Swank 10!".

This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. First off....I realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old Macchio in this film.....But why could'nt they have had Miyagi read a letter or something from Danielsan...maybe explaining what happened to Daniel...hell they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something. But no...and to compund the already bad script....they added those stupid monks...I thought monks take a vow of silence...guess these yapping monks don't take their vows seriously...hehehe. The training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid...and the paramilitary group of young males....were a confusing concept to say the least....this was far from even being a martial arts movie...with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene....and then she didn't even come close to getting hit even once...by the male fighting her....give me a break...she would have gotten hit at least once....I guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one. I could go on and on...but basically...I'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad....even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even look atshe was sorta butch looking....I can only think of a handful of movies that I have sit through...that compare to just how bad this flick was.....DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE..........".

You can't become that good in two weeks at a monastery. Julie just too easily falls under the guidance of Mr Miyagi. The tough kids at school are too much of a cliche'. But the overall message is good the need to find yourself to look for the good in yourself and others to respect all life even the cockroach. Most of us like a story where the bad guys get put in their places. And the pretty but sad young girl becomes happy.

She becomes fascinated by the sight of a young man Michael Burns who sits in the park getting soaked in the rain. After her guests leave she invites him into her home to get warmed up and after discovering that he is mute an odd relationship develops between them. We soon find out that he he has the power of speech but she is none the wiser and his silence allows her to open up a little. After that things get well complicated. I don't want to spoil what follows but it's fascinating to watch the events unfold and Dennis' performance is terrific. Sadly she passed away in the early 1990s Sean Penn's terrific 'The Indian Runner' being her last movie. I know nothing about Michael Burns but he is also very good and the supporting cast includes small but important roles from Altman regular Michael Murphy and cult actress Luana Anders 'Dementia 13' 'Easy Rider' 'Greaser's Palace'. 'That Cold Day In The Park' has been neglected for far too long. It's an excellent movie which I highly recommend.".

It's the first of four dream films centering on the psychological distress of primarily female protagonists that Altman would make over the course of his career. Sandy Dennis plays a Canadian spinster who takes in a younger man who's only too happy to let her buy him clothes food etc. There is no sexual component to their transaction but the sexual tension nonetheless builds to a breaking point at which point Dennis's character goes off the rails in a macabre finale.Dennis is quite good and tones down her mannered acting habits. The film stylistically bears many of the hallmark Altman traits like images broken up and refracted in reflective surfaces or the roving camera that will zoom in on a particular detail. I quite enjoyed this film and think that it deserves more mention in discussions about Altman's canon than it customarily receives.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set  in Frances Austen's the Sandy  Dennis character apartment. But the film builds to a disturbing climax.The characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed this considering the style and structure of his other films. Still the trademark Altman audio style is evident here and there. I think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis. It's definitely one of her darker characters but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as the mute young man. Regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small part. The solemn moody set fits the content of the story very well. In short this movie is a powerful study of loneliness sexual repression and desperation. Be patient soak up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script.I praise Robert Altman. This is one of his many films that deals with unconventional fascinating subject matter. This film is disturbing but it's sincere and it's sure to elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to see an unusual film  some might even say bizarre  this is worth the time.Unfortunately it's very difficult to find in video stores. You may have to buy it off the internet.".

He finds her odd and continues his silence although we find out later that he isn't mute at all and that he reports to his sister everything that is going on between him  the woman. I won't give away the rest of the plot. If you can find this film watch it. You cannot take your eyes off of it. What makes it so interesting? Well it is totally unique. I've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. Especially when you find out what this bland boring obsessive spinster is capable of.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love Frances Austen Sandy Dennis keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends. But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length. As for Frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them. One early evening as Frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man Michael Burns sitting alone in the cold pouring rain. Feeling that he's homeless and alone after her friends leave Frances goes outside to the park and offers the young man shelter at her place until the rain subsides and even to stay over for the night at a guest bedroom that she has. You can see right away that Frances is more interested in just having the young mans safely out of the cold and rain then she wants to have him as a friend lover or even playtoy all for herself and as the movie progresses you see that you were right. A really amazing performance by Sandy Dennis that in a way is very much like that of Kathy Bates' Academy Award performance in the movie Misery that was made in 1990 some twenty one years later. Frances thinking that the young man was alone and homeless and later when she meets him mute sees the perfect person for her to have as a true friend. He's in no way her equal or better then her like the friends that she has doctors lawyers Indian chiefs and thus is totally dependent on her. It later turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person that Frances thought that he is. It's when she slowly finds out that he really doesn't need her as well as him manipulating her instead the other way around it sets off something in Frances' mind that turns out to be a compulsion of murderous proportions. A really weird film by director Robert Altman that goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind. Actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as the Dr. Jekyll and Miss. Hyde personality in her acting as the lonely but at the same time dangerous Frances Austen and it's a pity that not only didn't she get an Academy Award for her role in the film but wasn't even nominated for it. Like most Robert Altman movies there seems to be a lot of improvisation among the actors in the movie and ad lib dialog especially between the young man's sister Nina Susanne Benton and her boyfriend Nick David Garfield. The only thing in the movie that I found confusing is when we see Frances go to a city clinic to have a full gynecological exam and tells the doctor that she expects to get married very soon. Was her husband to be the young man staying at her apartment? But besides that the movie sticks to the story pretty well and the ending is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man. When he finally in the end realizes that Frances is not only a bit offthewall but murderously insane as well.".

Ultimately a parable about the consequences of dishonesty in romantic relationships moral it will destroy all parties involved it is also an interesting 1969 period piece and a must for Altmancompletists.  You'll see some of Altman's early experiments with improvised and overlapping dialogue and an indication of his interest in using a gynecologists' office as being a window into interaction between women later to play out a fulllength picture as Dr. T and the Women.possible spoilers Sandy Dennis portrays Frances Austen a woman who has been aged by her environment.  As is usually the case with Dennis her performance is outstanding.  She completely inhabits the character.  We learn that Frances lives in the former apartment of her mother who resided there with Frances until her death bemoaning the loss of her husband and highlighting the inadequacy of her daughter as company.   Her small social circle consists of people at least twenty years older than her  inherited friends of her mother.  Her maid is also a remnant of her mother's existence  she has stayed on to help her.  She lives a solitary life with no discernible employment or real social life.  Early in the film while hosting a dinner party for her elderly friends she spies during a heavy downpour a young boy camped out on a bench.   On a whim she goes outside and invites him into her home to dry off.  This invitation is eventually extended into an overnight as Frances finds herself drawn to him.  Though it isn't initially revealed we eventually discover that the boy is not a mute as he pretends to be.  His pretend muteness  his idea of a harmless prank  is unfortunate for both Frances and himself.  His lack of communication enables Frances to chatter incessantly and to impose an identity on him which really only exists in her mind.  We can tell that things aren't quite right with Frances and that she is more than just a lonely woman when she begins locking the boy in his room at night.  He makes a window escape to return to the rundown abode of his hippie sister and her lover who's a war veteran and it is revealed that he was originally meeting them in the park that fateful day.  The image of him as a motherless innocent scamp alone in the world that Sandy and the audience shared up to that point is dashed for the audience.  There is also a vaguely incestual relationship between brother and sister that doesn't really play into the movie much aside from a few scenes of them romping together unbeknowst to Sandy at her apartment. Sandy discovers the next morning that his bed is empty and she seems resigned to his departure if somewhat saddened.  He makes the decision to return  though its unclear why.  We can assume that the warm bed and lush though somewhat stale accommodations Frances offers seem a more attractive prospect than the dilapidated barracks of his sister and her lover and the overpopulated home of his family.  Abandoning his former identity he willingly accepts the identity that she's created  allowing her to dress him and feed him.  Material gain clouds his judgment.  The film loses some of its pacing here as Altman's foreshadowing has made it pretty clear that none of this can end happily.  Though the boy likes Frances he remains in her company for the material comforts she offers.  Frances on the other hand is becomingly increasingly obsessed with her imagined relationship with him and more and more dependent on having him in her life.  After a seemingly obligatory 70's let's get high scene which is perpetrated knowingly by the boy upon Frances with some herbally enhanced brownies her offbeat manner is revealed to be something deeper and darker and much more frightening.  She randomly screams crazily then laughs hysterically and though the boy still doesn't know what's up  we clearly do.  The next day she visits the gynecologist's  telling them that she is single but soon to be married.  This trip seems to represent her lastditch attempt to lead a normal life with the boy  the end result of these preparations  to be a traditional couple.  This scene is enjoyable because it's indicative of the style which Altman would pursue and perfect later in his career.   The acting feels improvised  a group of women discuss various birth controls and their experiences while Sandy wanders aimlessly clearly uncomfortable hearing these women speak casually about sex something she knows nothing about.  The overlapping dialogue and long tracking shot is also nice.  He sneaks out again that night which leads to one of the movie's most affecting scenes.  Sandy comes into his room opening her heart to him sharing her fears of a lonely life and describing how her elderly friends repulse her particularly the politely amorous doctor who has had just propositioned her albeit unsuccessfully moments before.  She summons the courage to lay down on the bed beside the boy and reaches over to touch him.  Instead of stroking his hair the head falls to the side  revealing that the boy is gone and has constructed a dummy in his place.  She screams  horrorstricken desperate and enraged at the same time.  That night when the boy sneaks back in he notices his dummy has been taken apart and that his bed is properly made.  Shrugging it off he dozes off.  Of course all is not well and his final imprisonment begins.  The movie draws to a close after Sandy has fatally stabbed a hooker she brought home for the boy.  He stands frightened trying to hide in the shadows while she tracks him down effortlessly and strokes his face in control and out of her mind.  Though today we would be more likely to see an ending where in a crazed penultimate moment desperate Frances flings herself from the boy's escape window to her death Altman was content to the leave the ending ambiguous.  An honest relationship has resulted but at the cost of Frances' sanity and the boy's freedom.".

Kids from dysfunctional families do run away from home sometmes feel lust for their siblings and exhibit strange mannerisms. The sadness of the film is that the different ways in which the two main characters are dysfunctioning keeps them from communicating their individual needs. This is a more sympathetic study of a repressed and unstable woman than more recent garbage such as Fatal Attraction. And of course Altman is already spicng up is film with colorful minor characters and background conversationthe conversation in the women's clinic is  very funny.

	schema:reviewBody "A rich but lonely spinster Fraces Austen Sandy Dennis invites a stranger young man Michael Burns to her home and lets him live with her. This movie sounds intriguing because the plot and the promotional materials suggest the subject matter of sex even more so involving an older woman but if viewed through today's standard this would likely confuse and could potentially garner the worst rating from its audience. And that is because this movie is totally something different. I say this pertaining to how the story was executed. More recent films tend to spoonfeed moviegoers to avoid alienating them from the story of the movie but at the expense of losing the audience's active participation. I have realized that the movie holds up because it does not follow that trend. It offers so much more beneath the surface for the thoughtful and patient viewer. This is certainly a film that would get better upon repeated viewings. The performance of Sandy Dennis alone is a testament to that. With her almost blank facial expression her performance adds to the emotional depth of the character. She is perfect for it. The direction of then newcomer Robert Altman who would later direct classic films such as Nashville and M.A.S.H. is rightfully subtle. He was able to both reveal and conceal elements for the benefit of the material.If you are looking for a movie with straight forward storytelling and a clear quick payoff to enjoy and relax to this might exhaust and bore you to tears. But if you are interested with unconventional narratives that will make you more an active watcher and immerse you in the subject of psychology or simply in how people in the same position think and behave this will pass as entertaining to you or even more than that. You will surely be rewarded one way or another.".

All the more surprising that it is an Altman film I hadn't seen but then I assume this only had a modest release and then disappeared. Easy to see why as it is a difficult film to describe and recommend to someone and pretty much in a category of its own although I do recall someone suggesting there might be a small genre of 'women going madsploitation' which I guess was to include to include Repulsion and the earlier Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. Strangely I was reminded more of the 2007 British film Hallam Foe which had something of the tone and obsessiveness. That had humour though which this has little of and what there is is very hard to laugh at. Sandy Dennis is amazing and particularly in that she has to talk to herself for most of the movie. At turns this is worrying and vaguely amusing that only makes it more worrying and even disturbing. There are some surprises but right from the beginning it is clear this is not going to end very well.".

Easy to see why as it is a difficult film to describe and recommend to someone and pretty much in a category of its own although I do recall someone suggesting there might be a small genre of 'women going madsploitation' which I guess was to include to include Repulsion and the earlier Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. Strangely I was reminded more of the 2007 British film Hallam Foe which had something of the tone and obsessiveness. That had humour though which this has little of and what there is is very hard to laugh at. Sandy Dennis is amazing and particularly in that she has to talk to herself for most of the movie. At turns this is worrying and vaguely amusing that only makes it more worrying and even disturbing. There are some surprises but right from the beginning it is clear this is not going to end very well.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the very earliest of Robert Altman's films in fact it was his third and it's a far cry from the large ensemble films he made later in his career like Pret a Porter and The Player.The film centers around a rich single woman who spots a young man sitting in the rain in the park across from her apartment and invites him in to bath and get warm. She invites him to stay feeding him clothing him giving him a room and gradually building a attraction toward him. The young man remains mute throughout their interactions except we discover that not only can he talk he has a home and family but while he sneaks out to see them he returns to the house.Eventually she asks him to sleep with her one night as she lays on his bed only to discover he has snuck out again and she goes crazy. Nailing up the windows and doors finally making him a complete prisoner at which point he reveals he can talk. She then goes and hires a prostitute for him which makes her insanely jealous which in turn has dire consequence.The copy of the film I watched was very old and worn which of course subtracted from the viewing experience but the story is an intriguing one. She is such a quiet and passive character that she barely seems predatory but just lonely and in some ways her actions do come across as good deeds. Sandy Dennis is superb in the role of this calm seemingly sane woman who's actions become more desperate. The film however suffers because it feels stagnant during the middle part where nothing really happens and then you have this sudden change of character which even then felt very subtle. It would be interesting to see how this story would be made today.More of my review at iheartfilms.weebly.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Altman didn't hit the big time until MASH in 1970. Most of his work prior to that was on television though he did make a small handful of theatrical films. That Cold Day in the Park came the year before MASH. Sandy Dennis stars as a lonely socialite who spies a young man Michael Burns sitting on a park bench across the street. Presumably he's homeless  he stays there even in the freezing rain. She invites him in to dry off. He seems to be a mute. The mystery behind him is intriguing but surprisingly quickly it's dismissed as his secrets are revealed and are fairly banal. At first I was disappointed. Soon though it becomes apparent that the audience's expectations about how this plot will develop are subverted. This film has kind of a middling reputation but while I wouldn't call it one of his absolute best I don't think it should be ignored among Altman's oeuvre. His signature style may not have come until MASH  though the sequence at the women's clinic definitely is a precursor  but he would revisit similar story lines later on most notably in Images another of his most undervalued films. Anyone who's a fan of Sandy Dennis ought to check it out. She's fantastic in it. Olive Films has given That Cold Day in the Park a long overdue DVDBlu Ray release it's not the best looking Blu Ray I've ever seen but it's more than acceptable. If you don't want to spend the money there's also a decentlooking VHS rip on Youtube.".

I was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on NBC in late 1986. Also starring was the fine German actor Jan Niklas who had previously starred in NBC's other Russian epic Peter the Great. I felt that Part 2 skipped over some important details of Anna Anderson's trip to America. It's important to know too that in 1986 less was known about the Anna Anderson story. Back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. By the late 1990's more was known and Anna Anderson is now reputed to have been a fraud.

The power of Amy Irving's acting lies in that she successfully represented Anderson's selfassuredness the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing.

Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released I sometimes still think she was. Such is the power of Amy Irving's acting in this 2parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tearjerking drama and Irving's totally convincing performance.I was not consciously aware of Irving before this though I must have seen her without realizing it in Carrie another favourite film. In Anasasia I never felt for one moment that it's only a film. For me this woman WAS Anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family I knew that come hell or high water I had to see the second part. I just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed I felt an intense hatred of Rex Harrison's character though I greatly admire him as an actor.When I saw the movie listed again in the TV guide I convinced my Mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as I had been to watch part 2. Then I bought the video and can totally recommend it. Anastasia is one of those rare TV movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting I have ever seen on TV and it doesn't really matter whether you believe the legend or not.".

Unfortunately that is exactly what this retelling does time and again. Anastasia The Mystery of Anna cannot be successfully counted as a biography of this Anna Anderson nor is it fictional enough to be compelling. Overall this madeforTV film has the feel of a documentary created with limited research. It is a shame that the movie shoved aside historical accuracy and important details of the book where an excellent cast was involved with several large names including the late Rex Harrison. The first half hour displays a compressed tale of the Romonovs' captivity until their execution the following year using information from the foreword of Anastasia The Riddle of Anna Anderson the biography upon which this film is based. The acting was well done the story close enough to accuracy. Since little is known of the Romonovs captivity and exclusively their death liberty can be taken with this part of the biography with little effect. A half hour into the film Anna Anderson falls off a bridge in Berlin in 1923. This event in the book had occurred in 1920. Later during her first interrogation 'Anastasia Tchaikovsky' never claimed that her bastard son was dead as she had in the movie on the other hand according to her was alive and well in Rumania. Furthermore she had never herself claimed that her son was named after her brother Alexei that was wrongly concluded in a supporter's notes. Anna herself had denounced this statement explaining that she had named the young Tchaikovsky after her father and not her brother. The acting is well enough and the production overall has the feel of a documentary in cinematography and tone. With a threehour running time this movie could've well been so with more attention to historical detail and the book itself. Leaving out details is not an object such as the facts that Anna spoke some German French and English as well as limited Russian and that she was wrongly identified as Tatiana by Clara in the beginning changing them does. There is only one thing to be said read Anastasia The Riddle Of Anna Anderson for the truth. This film is a documentary gone wrong without a doubt and is at best useless.".

I don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. But having such a nonsensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? Avoid this at all costs.The prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voiceover to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed it wasn't clear what was happening ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to Some riots are happening in Petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution so I could fill in the details those pesky Communists. The prologue is best ignored.This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. It sets up this premise in the asylum. It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no empirical evidence. It sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong it'll believe anything she says. Okay a soppy romance. No because it makes no sense. The love interest seems like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic bursting out in wild gestures. This also doesn't work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite there being plenty of love scenes I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. I find romcom romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other.It could have been a thrillertype thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity. No the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better film.The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. None of this in the film either. There's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next'Twelve Monkeys'type informant. Thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story.".

Robert Sacchi incidentally is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right more to the point the body and facial language are there.

Then he encounters Elsa Olivia Hussey the plain sweet virginal daughter of a retired propsmaster who has been murdered for no discernible reason. In the process of investigating the murder Sam shortly runs across  the Gene Tierney lookalike daughter Michelle Phillips of Anastas an avaricious obscenely wealthy Greek shipping tycoon Victor Buono turning in a creditable Sidney Greenstreet his hapless longsuffering second wife Yvonne deCarlo who manages to play a variety of putupon emotions without saying a word his two smarmy henchmen Herbert Lom channelling Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson doing a reasonably accurate Lionel Atwill and Anastas' vicious amoral MiddleEastern potentate Franco Nero who comes complete with a glamorus and bafflingly loyal mistress Sybil Danning all of whom would give anything to acquire the Eyes of Alexander two huge perfectly matched star sapphires. When Elsa is murdered Marlowe's interest in solving the case becomes personal and he sets out through a labyrinth of Los Angeles landmarks including the Hollywood Bowl the scatological and esoteric attractions of Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Catalina Island in pursuit of the rocks determined to get at them before either of the two wealthy competitors. Throw in cameos by Mike Mazurki and assorted others the traditional dumbbutsympathetic ally on the police force and a plethora of nicely drawn character turns that provide dimension to practically all players and despite an unfortunate title song you have to my mind a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.".

I thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and pulls off a good Bogart. His nose is a little big his voice is a BogartColumbo mix and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise he was fantastic and this film was wonderful. No one can be a perfect Bogart but he was great. Remember Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and isn't going to do everything he did. He mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real Bogart's character's. But it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast including some beautiful women.

They could've had fun with it and tried to capture the look and style of Bogart's classic movies but this modestlybudgeted affair is for the most part shot and staged like a 1970s TV movie complete with a cheesy softrock title song!  Sacchi though amiable enough is a better impersonator than actor. True he's got Bogart's mannerisms and appearance down and he sports a wry streak at times but he becomes disappointingly wooden in love scenes and other parts of the story that require him to show emotion.  No being wooden in a love scene is not the same as having a woody in a love scene!   Having said all that BOGART'S FACE is still pleasant light entertainment if you just want some goodnatured mind candy to while away a rainy afternoon at home. The interestingly eclectic cast also includes Franco Nero as a Zachary Scott wannabe Herbert Lom as a Joel Cairo type Victor Buono as Phillips's Sydney Greenstreetesque father Misty Rowe as Marlow's ditsy blonde secretary ...she looked like Marilyn Monroe and made as much sense as Gracie Allen... and Olivia Hussey and Sybil Danning as damsels in various forms of distress.

Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty as Gena Anastas. However the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a Hollywood film. One wellknown professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. The scene which ends up being an important part of the plot occurs in a lushly beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing. The pulsating music the swirling veils and ringing finger cymbals freeflowing undulations and beautiful costumes  and a surprise twist involving the seductive Sybil Danning  build tension and excitement until the very end. The three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty Kamala Almanzar one of the US' leading belly dancers since the mid1970s. She was handpicked by famed Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the road. Guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene. If you watch the trailer on this site you will see a glimpse of Kamala playing the finger cymbals behind Sybil Danning. If you're not yet a fan of belly dancing you will be after watching this movie and if you're an aficionado it holds up very well after repeated viewing.".

The thoroughly plotted story has a whole bunch of random investigations that eventually come together the search for the Eyes of Alexandria  two sapphires as once a struggling privateeye Sam Barlow finds himself being showered in clients money and danger. He's constantly in someone's sights  for good the ladies or bad hooded hoodlums. Also the script manages to throw around plenty of movie references and that's part of its selfknowing charm.

The Maltese Falcon is right up there on my list of Bogey favorites so having that one under your belt probably gives you a leg up on the stuff going on in 'Bogart's Face'. Most of the references are right out there like the 'Eyes of Alexander' sapphires in place of that evil black bird. But there are subtler ones as well like Sam Marlow Robert Sacchi hiding a note in the bedpost in an aside to Casablanca. Even some of the characters parallel the greats  Buono for Greenstreet and Lom for Lorre but the depth of the talent doesn't carry on down the line. As the two detectives tailing Marlow and the gems Richard Bakalyan and Gregg Palmer don't have the personality to parry with Marlow the way Barton MacLane and Ward Bond did in the original. As for Sacchi he's a credit to Bogart and his mannerisms and if you're watching a slightly fuzzy VHS copy of the film there are a few scenes where he's a complete dead ringer. But he did overdo it with the facial grimace Bogart did it for emphasis and effect. Sacchi just does it all the time and it gets a bit tedious. Still you can have some fun with this one Bogart fan or not. My recommendation  play it Sam play it one time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Man with Bogart's Face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30'slate 40's film era.  It fails miserably for several reasons. First Sacchi while looking reasonably like Bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms completely lacks any of Bogart's charisma or acting ability.  This is really apparent whenever Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films.  Second the film does not have the first rate character actors Bogart was able to work with. There are no Peter Lorre's or Sydney Greenstreet's in this one folks. Sure we are treated to performances by Victor Buaeno Olivia Hussey and George Raft amongst others but they just aren't of the same caliber or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast.  Third the attempts at modern humor all fall through.  All of the underwear jokes having Marlowe almost never remove that damn hat and trench coat even though Bogart would have etc. just aren't funny and really pull down this film.  Fourth I've never heard a goofier theme song this side of Mitchell.  Finally the film's false reverence for Bogart and other classic actors work is truly irritating.  Bogart almost never played a straight hero on those occasions he was a hero.  He played complicated characters.  This movie makes Bogart out to be a triggerhappy moralistic dogooder.  While this may have been true about some film characters Bogart's characters rarely fit that bill.  It's movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl crap with low production values.".

	schema:headline " Silly set up to a somewhat interesting plot concerning Alexander the Great";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie should have been called The Eyes of Alexander and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face but after the first 1530 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller where two palm size sapphires purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great for him and seen by him right before his death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction but it makes for a good movie anyway. So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background which I really liked ending with a dated shark attack you couldn't go to a movie in '79'80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience. There is a yacht named Euridice Alexander's father's young wife a man named Alexander Philip Cleitus? it's been about 5 years since I've seen the film so can't remember all the details Olympias some street names and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director obviously an Alexanderphile himself put in. When all is said and done the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kind of a neat ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting or instance the handannotated by Aristotle version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life even on his many journeys across Asia would be of incalculable value if found today. Olivia Hussey my all time favorite bmovie actressis killed off way too early and should have been the main actress throughout not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's...though she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on but beyond that I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.Yours Nick".

Unfortunately she is only given a bit part and then killed off?  She does have some funny moments though when talking about her missing father.  Her name was Elsie Borsche and her father's name is Horsche borsche.  Which she delivers with a straight face in a bantering dialogue with the Bogart guy...hysterical!  Being a huge Alexander the Great fan I was intrigued by the imagery and allusians throughout the film on the genre. A boat in the background is named Euridice the film is centered around two large palm sized deep blue sapphires which were inset into the eye sockets of a marble head of Alexander himself.  One of the main characters was named Alexander.  According to the movie script legend stated that it was the last thing that Alexander laid eyes on before he died.  Rest assured this is fictional.  The film ends with the camera focused on the gems lying on a bed as the credits rolled by.  It's been a few years since I viewed the film but if you like all things Alexander this film is worth checking out just to find all the little background features related to his genre. With several films coming out on the great conqueror soon 200405 it might be also worth your time just for the fun of it.  If you're interested in seeing a regurgitated Humphrey Bogart you'll likely be disappointed.  I am too young to really know what Bogart was like but clearly the similar face and dead pan vocal style of this actor is as close to the real Bogart as this film gets.  I also got the feeling that they started out with a concept of making a Bogart spoof film and ended up with a historicalcomedicmystery. As an afternote their is a scene with a shark at the end of the film which attacks a character and supposedly bytes off the prosthetic arm which was holding a pouch containing the gems.  In this film erathanks to Jaws every time a character entered the water a shark attacked him...it was expected.  This scene alone dates the film to the late seventiesearly eighties without even knowing outright that it was released in 1980. Overall the film is not much more than a B movie destined to live out its days molding in some closet of a Hollywood producer and then likely just disappear.  The relative rarity of Alexander films makes it worth owning for the hardcore Alexander fan but unless you want to do a filmography on Olivia Hussey or one of the other up and coming stars of the era avoid at all costs...which shouldn't be hard to do given the fact that you'll probably have to special order it anyway.  It's been fun commenting on this film and I welcome any questions about Alexander the Great.".

	schema:headline " Extremely relevant audacious and very impressive pseudodocumentary";
	schema:reviewBody "My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film which now has been released on DVD for the first time in the UK has been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has excelled himself in his audacity and technical skills. This pseudodocumentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and up to date.The film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the US when the government has increased its legitimized use of violence and oppression while the antiwar movement reacts increasingly violent and radical. In order to deal with both this the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training to riot police units the government has introduced the socalled punishment parks. Convicted 'criminals' mostly activists are given the 'choice' to either be locked up in prison for years and years or spend three days in one of these parks where they either gain their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence. The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations however. It reminded me of a sort of realistic version of Battle Royale 2000.The film's structure is extremely effective and recalls parallels with Cannibal Holocaust which is made almost 10 years later. Both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked even though aware of the fact that this is a film. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of mankind but where Cannibal Holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning above all it is an exploitation movie in every sense of the word and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world Punishment Park does just that.I have been profoundly impressed with Punishment Park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content about the way power structures in this world function. I do not agree with the critique that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes because the movie depicts activists and the keepers of the legitimized power structures who are in reality as polarized as they are here. If they weren't there would not be any conflict and therefore no change in our societies. In reality confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms whether you place them between activists and establishment in Latin America Russia or New York City. If these groups would not be polarized to these extremes the activists would be part of the silent majorities that tacitly complain but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world.As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction on the DVD the actors in Punishment Park are for the most part amateurs. Most kids were real activists from LA most policemen had been part of the national forces and even some of the members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of the time. Not introducing both groups previous to the shooting of the scenes taking place in the improvised court room adds to spontaneous and improvised feel. Parallels are drawn with issues of the time such as the repression of Black Panther members one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the convicted charismatic BPleader Bobby Seale and the trial of the Chicago seven.I admire Watkins' obvious and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern with human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments nowadays in the name of the War in Terror to silence those that do not agree and refuse to be brainwashed. Punishment Park remains to be an extremely important movie that should be shown in schools and seen by everybody who shares these concerns. Maybe its marginalization can finally be made up for.".

	onyx:emotionText "My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film which now has been released on DVD for the first time in the UK has been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has excelled himself in his audacity and technical skills. This pseudodocumentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and up to date.The film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the US when the government has increased its legitimized use of violence and oppression while the antiwar movement reacts increasingly violent and radical. In order to deal with both this the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training to riot police units the government has introduced the socalled punishment parks. Convicted 'criminals' mostly activists are given the 'choice' to either be locked up in prison for years and years or spend three days in one of these parks where they either gain their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence. The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations however. It reminded me of a sort of realistic version of Battle Royale 2000.The film's structure is extremely effective and recalls parallels with Cannibal Holocaust which is made almost 10 years later. Both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked even though aware of the fact that this is a film. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of mankind but where Cannibal Holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning above all it is an exploitation movie in every sense of the word and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world Punishment Park does just that.I have been profoundly impressed with Punishment Park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content about the way power structures in this world function. I do not agree with the critique that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes because the movie depicts activists and the keepers of the legitimized power structures who are in reality as polarized as they are here. If they weren't there would not be any conflict and therefore no change in our societies. In reality confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms whether you place them between activists and establishment in Latin America Russia or New York City. If these groups would not be polarized to these extremes the activists would be part of the silent majorities that tacitly complain but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world.As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction on the DVD the actors in Punishment Park are for the most part amateurs.

	schema:reviewBody "You can't watch a film like Peter Watkins' Privilege a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by big business the state and even organized religion without thinking of creatively degenerate commodities like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears who hawk corporate giants like Pepsi or some other poison for money. Or any number of entertainers in music or movies who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like Scientology and Kabbalah. A film like Privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when released in 1967 so fantastic was its premise. Today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted giving little thought to its more alarming implications. Watkins' vision has not only become reality we tacitly accept this reality as normal.Now consider Punishment Park. As Privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us and why Punishment Park demands that we reckon with what is being taken from us and why. Heaven help America and for that matter the world if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film. It is already so close to reality that in viewing it recently I experienced a genuine nauseating feeling of anxiety.Watkins again skillfully employs a documentarystyle narrative. Whereas in Privilege some rough edges to this technique were apparent in Punishment Park it has been honed to sharp seamless perfection. The sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious economical believable portrayals by the entire cast. This is the kind of acting Hollywood has completely turned its back on to its detriment in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections. The cast has firstrate material to work with in Watkins' screenplay. Many cinematic visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their complacent false sense of security. No one has ever achieved this result with such stark and chilling accuracy as Peter Watkins does here.What seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and excluded Americans such as these people back into the national community the Administration has chosen to accept and exploit the present division within the country and to side with what it considers is the majority. Instead of the politics of reconciliation it has chosen the politics of polarization.To paraphrase one of the characters we don't have to call them pigs because they know what they are. Better than we do.".

It makes you face the issue are you for the people's right of dissent in a time of war or for the constitution being compromised in the name of national security? The protagonists are forced by the government to race to the American flag in a game that undermines the very ideals the flag stands for. The acting is totally convincing.

	schema:reviewBody "I had to see this movie with French subtitles as I understand it was unavailable for 30 years. I can see why. As a mock documentary it thinly disguises a diatribe against American society during the Vietnam era  the country's hypocrisy and its culture of violence. It is a forthright piece of agitprop mock verite filmmaking that I can imagine would easily provoke strong reactions among the youth and among the left during that divisive era. That of course is its strength and its purpose. The narrative itself cuts between two scenarios. Neither is meant to be 'realistic' each is exaggerated for impact and to push the metaphoric value of the situation. On one hand you have a group of radicals neatly representing various factions of the left  a feminist a pacifist a revolutionary a black activist a political activist a musician for free expression. They are brought one by one before a kind of kangaroo court made up of various bigoted closed minded fascistic prowar America Love it or Leave it' types. These 'pigs' are there to determine the guilt of these left wing 'subversives' and then give them a choice  fifteen years in a federal prison or  Punishment Park. The second scenario involves a group of radicals who have been sentenced to Punishment Park and are about to find out what that means. This story provides a second metaphor concerning American injustice and its cults of violence division and oppression. This group must get across the desert in 90 to 100 degree heat to a final destination where the American flag has been placed. They have two hours to get a head start before a group of ped off and bloodthirsty troopers and National guardsman will attempt to hunt them down. They must then surrender or be shot. The chances  obviously  are slim. By going back and forth between these two scenes  the absurd tirades of right wing bigots against the left to the hopeless cause of radicals running for freedom in Punishment Park  the point is made quite clear. The effect of the relentless documentary style and of the film's punishing politics keeps your interest and still manages to incite and indict. Many of Watkins' images recall images of the 60's  assassinated radicals dead blacks assaults by National Guardsmen gags in court and strong echos of the McCarthy hearings. The cumulative effect is strong stuff. Where it could have gotten silly and where it could feel dated  it still disturbs. It is a fabulous premise for a political satire. It would work well now with the neo digital Verite style of  the Blair Witch Project in practice and the purloined presidency of  George W. and his oppressive cronies in charge.".

If this is really true the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway.The movie is a socalled mockumentary although I think the topic is too serious call it like that. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. After an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park. In that they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an American flag posted 50 miles ahead while they're are followed by police and army troops.The movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the tribunals and the hunting through the desert filmed by European film crews. All the facts are explained the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People stare directly into the camera shouting at it. It seems very very real. Talking about realism here is nonsense. This movie is not about how to make a realistic film it is about how such a film would look like if it was real. And it certainly would look like this. If it would be filmed anyway. In an 'utopian' state like this there surely wouldn't be a European film crew allowed to film those things.There are many things that frighten us. The defendants are people from all social classes. Political leaders musicians authors philosophers unemployed etc. They seem to be hopeless rebellious or scared. They are no heroes. They talk a lot in the tribunal knowing it doesn't lead to anything saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before. One says he's not afraid to die. Is this true? Well he doesn't have to run through the desert hunted by cops. The defendants have no chance or at least their only chance the decision between prison and punishment park is no chance really. The way they decide in the end and the way film ends makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide.These tribunals remind us a lot of tribunals in the Third Reich. The officials use the same kind of idealistic speeching ignoring all the arguments from the defendants starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet. They warn the defendants of watching their language and insult them much more. They ask them questions the defendants can not answer but it's never intended they should. These scenes are a statement about what we call justice.The scenes in the desert are on a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time we realize that they realize they haven't got a chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains feeling the sun and the thirst they don't have a clue how they should stand those three days. The film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness. They argue should they play the game or escape or revolt? It all leads to the same and no one is surprised. Some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state? Why not? It empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they want to. It is not a gas chamber but the Nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built. The comparison is fair since there is no real difference.The movie is scary and depressing. The problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore. This is not sciencefiction. Talking about poverty unemployment and crime is not utopic. The film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us is not only useless but dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution. The defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight this. They do things but for nothing. Even if this delivers no solution to us it still is a statement.To me the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie. Here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom moral and peace. It accuses the government a fictional government nevertheless to be dangerous and inhuman. And then this very film is practically banned.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains SpoilersThis is a Peter Watkins film. If one has seen his BBC masterpieces Cullodden and The War Game one will recognize the style and his voice within seconds after the start. Made in 1971 it is set in a very near future when the Vietnam war has escalated even more and now seems to involve China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with violently using drumhead tribunals outwardly civilian with 'everyday citizens' as judges. Because prison building can't keep up an alternative is introduced The Punishment Park. Delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunt in a hostile environment in this case a 85 km trip through the Californian desert at 100F. If they reach an American flag at the end without being caught by National Guard or Riot Police they will be set free or else they have to serve their sentence or be dead as we will see. The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a tribunal and the course of two groups already sentenced. Scenes jump between the tribunal tent the hunting troops and the hunted condemned. Watkin's scarce off commentary gives us raw background information time temperature etc.. The tribunal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one side and a wide range of personalities on the other ranging from real terrorists over 'undesirables' to clearly innocents e.g. a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies. The defense lawyer who does take his job seriously has to take abuse from both sides. What makes these scenes especially eerie is their resemblance to the rhetoric of todays administration to the detail. Meanwhile some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that the 'rules of the game' don't really apply. The question remains open whether it is rigged from the start or arbitrariness by the troops due to those events that leads to the outcome I suspect it is both. At the end we are back at square one with the next group going to Punishment Park. This description may indicate a heavily biased or even demagogic propaganda movie but that would be misleading. The behavior all participants were nonprofessionals as usual with Watkins looks and sounds real the tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real contemporary trials. I'd say that this could be sold as the 'real thing' without problem. With Watkins's The Forgotten Faces the reaction was We can't send that or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore because this is indistinguishable from the real thing. With Punishment Park it ought to be the same. Effectively banned in the US as far as I know this is a must see that hasn't lost its power or its relevance especially today.".

I'd say that this could be sold as the 'real thing' without problem. With Watkins's The Forgotten Faces the reaction was We can't send that or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore because this is indistinguishable from the real thing. With Punishment Park it ought to be the same. Effectively banned in the US as far as I know this is a must see that hasn't lost its power or its relevance especially today.";

	schema:headline " a film that questions how to live how to die and what it means to be in a country at war";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Watkins' film Punishment Park is nothing if not a sincere cry for justice. Of course the film is a metaphor a provocation a sort of alternate reality that could have been a science fiction fable if it wasn't so naturalistic as a fake documentary. And of course there weren't 'Punishment Parks' in America in 1970 when the film was made where dissidents and rabblerousers and draft dodgers were taken and given the chance to either participate in the 'game' or go to prison without a fair trial. And sure at the time the film got panned for being too blunt an instrument of provocation of being so much about its subjects of the US versus THEM element that it was too much.But what can be said of the film today? At the time for those who didn't know it was a fake documentary like in Finland they panned the US government for allowing such a thing like this to happen! This is perhaps the best kind of compliment Peter Watkins could have received  certainly he fared better there than with the film critics who panned it and ultimately the film got four days of distribution by a nonothing company before being pulled from NY city screens it fared worse in being shown on TV or elsewhere where for years it was just unavailable. Seeing it in 2010 is still a shocker some forty years later. Not because of what it says about its time and place that's a given about the rift between those in power and those not but that it could still happen in a slightly less extreme form today just look at the atrocity of justice with Guantanamo Bay for that.There's something about this film that gets under my skin. It got its way in within the first ten minutes by sinking its teeth with its structure of it being a British documentary on this 'Punishment Park' out in the California baron wasteland it could be Death Valley but whatever it is it's unbearable conditions and how nothing is made to look fantastic. The nerve of the film is like that of Night of the Living Dead in its noholdsbarred handheld approach to photography only in this case the police seem to be the zombies albeit with more of a brain which is perhaps much more frightening. Watkins cuts between this demonstration of what the 'Park' is  a three to four day excursion from one point to another where those who volunteer and there are many as the alternative is years in prison who have to get to an American flag. Which is not easy when you have police just getting ready and more than willing to kick the crap out of those dissidents and of course shoot to kill.This is all meant as metaphor and the most contemporary example I could think of as comparison would be District 9 though that film didn't carry out its artistic premise anywhere near as thoroughly as this. But the metaphor is strong because of a what was happening at the time with Chicago and Kent State and the trial of the Chicago 7 Bobby Seale's gagging during the trial is recreated here with one such African American on trial and of the attitudes at the time. The what if shouldn't be diminished because of thinking practically about what would happen if this really did occur. What matters is making it seem real carrying the documentary aesthetic and toying with it  Watkins goes from objective reporter to subjective WTFing at the police killing and maiming people from one scene to the next which is chillingly effective  to make the experience last in the mind.Aside from it being a rigorous example of filmmaking and a satire that is about as funny as a burning schoolbus on a field trip Punishment Park gets some major points. And the fact that many in the film never acted before or wouldn't again some of which were actual dissidents and protesters as the kids and some of the cops were actual cops heightens the tension and moral identity of the scenes. But really its ultimate impact is that it lasts in the mind as well as the consciousness of a nation. The US has laws in place to keep this from happening to be sure but at what point does the line thin away? Most recently there's been question of how to put on trial those accused of terrorism against the US. That too is an extreme example but again where is that line drawn? A question I was left with at the end or thought people might have by the end of it is What will be done about it? Or more precisely What can be done? It's a call to arms that shook me up and made me depressed but I can't say it didn't do it in the way that matters. It's one of the great incendiary films in our history that it's also an experimental piece in the realm of documentarymeetsfiction breaking all boundaries for its message is further extraordinary.".

It made me angry. It made me feel sick. It made me think. I could not believe it was made such a long time ago. It seems to reflect exactly what is going on right now in Cuba with those prisoners who still have not been charged. What the hell is going on and how can they do that? Totally contravene international law on human rights. This film covers so many themes and issues about society and how we treat anyone questioning the status quo. The film shows a tipping in the balance of power. The point where the state runs amok and is allowed to carry out its ultimate goal of simply removing dissenter from the equation. Surely diversity is the essence of humanity? What is particularly sad is that Peter Watkins himself is not given carte blanche by some British television channel to make what he wishes as this is clearly a man who has something to say.

Although the film is somewhat dated watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface. It's clear enough early in the film that Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the unpatriotic elements of American society. This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society but it is CREDIBLE. At times I find myself believing that the USA could easily slip into fascism. As I watched this film I could only think about how I hear similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily. This movie is a raw concentrated distillation of America's PRESENT political scene. I am both impressed and saddened that something this relevant and yes accurate was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you take a more moderate view of the movie and choose to believe that this couldn't happen here look more closely at Guantanamo Bay some of our enemy combatants the rumored CIA secret prisons and the many incidents similar to the one in Greensboro NC in 1979 8 full years AFTER the making of this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in a California detention camp in an indistinct future an English film crew capture proceedings as young students and political dissidents are put on trial under a fictional 'Insurrection Act' that allows the United States government to suspend civil liberties for its own citizens in cases of emergency without the right to bail or the necessity of evidence. In such cases the government is authorised to apprehend and detain anyone they believe may engage in future activities of sabotage. The group on trial includes a feminist a black panther and a folk singer.Those convicted by the a Conservative tribunal have the choice of a lengthy prison sentence or three days in Punishment Park in which they can attain their freedom by reaching an American flag in the desert. They must accomplish this without food or water. They are also to be pursued by armed National Guards and police who can return them to the camp if captured to face the penal sentence attributed to each person convicted. The reality is different those that choose Punishment Park are hunted and killed or brutalised with no hope of gaining their freedom after a policeman is found dead in the park. The park seems to be a training ground for the police and guards who need to master these acts of suppression so they can be put to use in open American society.Shot on 16mm and in the documentary style developed by Watkins in his celebrated Culloden and the controversial The War Game for the BBC he interacts with the prisoners and guards and observes the unconstitutional trial inter cutting between them to create a totally convincing political movie that still remains vital and relevant. Using his knowledge of the medium Watkins has produced a driving relentless and ultimately frightening film portrayal of an entirely fictional American political detention camp that would not convince if it wasn't for his flawless construction. Many of the actors are amateurs improvising with broad characters. The sparks fly in the trial scenes in which each case is heard in part to the fact that Watkins kept those on trial away from the jury until the filming of those scenes. Watkins also claims that the actors are often expressing their own opinions which certainly explain the ferocity as well as the believability of their performances.The film has been heavily criticised for polarising the opinions of those that see it. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unequivocally represents that conservatism and war are the root of America's social problems. While these criticisms may be valid it is important to consider that the film is working on a fictional metaphorical level and it is perhaps the realism that the film so cleverly constructs that encourages such a heated opinion on its content. In fact the films most important theme is the problem of polarisation itself. The 'conservative' judges and brutal law officers are on one side and the 'liberal' convicts are clearly on the other with no concessions made on either side. This seems to be what the movie is really about. The new law and the park itself is the outgrowth of a situation where mediation between the two political positions has been lost.Made during and in protest to the Vietnam War and the treatment of those who opposed the war in America the films main themes of Governmental persecution of its own citizens and Conservatism impinging on civil liberties still strike the same chord in the era of the Patriot act and the identity card. It also strikes a disturbing chord with news footage of Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners at the hands of Allied forces.The threat of internal 'terrorism' is such a volatile issue that the film cannot fail to connect with current attitudes to the subject. Not surprisingly the film has had a checkered distribution history being marginalised to an extreme due to its content but the disturbing fact that this movie is that can still remain so relevant today suggests that the wait has not been for nothing. Punishment Park is a film that has had to fight to be seen anywhere and it demands your attention.".

As an alternative to life in prison these convicted criminals are offered three days in Punishment Park. Their objective inside the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie. This brilliant film from Peter Watkins even predates Battle Royale and Series 7 though its angle of attack is more blatantly political. Shot in '71 it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is razer sharp. The narrative cuts back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthylike trials that convicted them. Today this film still retains its power. In '71 there was nothing but nothing quite like it. This is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels. It has the balls that most people today have lost.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Peter Watkin's Culloden and The War Game a few months before this and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same or at least very similar in this film detailing on the one hand a trial of dissidents in California in the apparently near future and on the other the attempts of a group of convicted criminals to slog through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in a governmentrun punishment park as an alternative to prison. Watkins films everything in a documentary style which causes for more than a little awkwardness or required strong suspension of disbelief how is it that the camera crew is with the group of starving and parched prisoners over 2 days without either offering help or sharing in their misery? And that's merely the most obvious example. But questionable storytelling aside this packs a punch no question you have to be interested in political filmmaking to really get involved but the film really isn't like anything else of its era it pulls no punches offers no simple solutions. The leftist political figures are certainly painted broadly at times but they aren't all alike the rightwing government functionaries seem a little more cartoonish but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity. Overall the film gives much to think about and leaves an indelible taste.....810 DVD rental".

There's so many different ways to take it and unfortunately it forces you to take it a particular way even if you don't want to.Punishment Park is about extremes rightists versus leftists and the destruction inherent. Two camps of protesters are put together the violent and the nonviolent and both are punished together by being forced to trek 50 miles through Death Valley in the middle of summer without water... if they fail they die. If they succeed... well...The thing is that this movie is hateful. It's utterly predictable but not in that way where it's condescending or stupidly written but in that terrible way where you know what's going to happen and don't want to see it but do. It's entirely a necessary product one that HAD to have been made during the era it was and unfortunately one that HAS to exist even if it's simply a terrible experience.What angers me so much about it is that it proves itself. The way it's a pseudodocumentary and it's vastly leftist politics makes it almost insulting makes you want to just ignore it as the ranting of a zealot. If the people are in the desert for instance with a camera crew nearby why aren't they asking the camera crew for water? And once they start to get desperate how come they never attack the camera crew? Major difficulty in a movie where the director speaks.Besides the alien looking extreme rightists in this movie are almost laughably caricaturistic making one really feel preached to. This movie seems to beg us to not believe it to feel incredulous that such levels exist.Yet the movie exists as it actually happened because of people's treatment of it. It was banned in England pretty much not allowed release in America and got very little release in very little places. The credits roll and the directornarrator points out that at least one of his crew was subsequently imprisoned. The treatment of this movie by those in power profoundly reinforces its themes which is terrible because its themes shouldn't exist.And then I'd love to say that this film should now be forgotten considering the bygone era but noooooo!! Current political landscapes and people's readiness to turn Iraq into another Vietnam either by making poor decisions or repeating said fact with slogans on picket signs makes this movie come back to the forefront again a painful Big Brother a terrible paean to the fear and hatred that consumed many during that era which people seem eager to reclaim in this era. Basically it angers me to no end that this had to exist it angers me more that it's still palpible but not because of the movie itself but what it represents.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Camp Opera Right Here Right Now!Ten years ago I read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His picture was acted by some nonprofessional actors citizens like you and me and others. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie a documentary? Both actually.Over the years I realized how hard it was to find it. Maybe I would by coincidence? Anyway it's yet an old story. I saw it a short while ago. Totally impressing. My very favourite peace of art Punishment Park is its name. I love this docufiction this truecastmovie this realityshowfictionnal what ever. After all the shock movies I saw I reach the best with this strong and intense cinematography'experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough on the net to know many things about the movie. It is even to buy on DVD with additional stuff. The only words I want to add is about my own experience with this film. I can only trust such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and for people those who direct act or watch. A cinema which is simply a real human experience within an art adventure or the opposite. So I'm not talking about all the 'mucs' we can see on TV especially the 'real'shityshow' whom the concepts of people playing themselves are interesting but used in a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park we can see some real individuals living as they are. We only put them in a very specific context with a few lines to follow and we let them be what they want to be. It's a kind of therapy a way of 'individuation' for those inside the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens. Then to end the director's touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie a desperate scream a 'Death Camp Opera' where some folks are on the run after virulent trials. Punishment Park is for those who want to grow. See this film and have the opportunity to choose your own morality. Grow up and harmonize yourself with it! If you can feel it! If you can see it!! In my case Punishment Park is stuck in me for ever with all my love consciousness and will.".

After all the shock movies I saw I reach the best with this strong and intense cinematography'experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough on the net to know many things about the movie. It is even to buy on DVD with additional stuff. The only words I want to add is about my own experience with this film. I can only trust such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and for people those who direct act or watch. A cinema which is simply a real human experience within an art adventure or the opposite. So I'm not talking about all the 'mucs' we can see on TV especially the 'real'shityshow' whom the concepts of people playing themselves are interesting but used in a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park we can see some real individuals living as they are. We only put them in a very specific context with a few lines to follow and we let them be what they want to be. It's a kind of therapy a way of 'individuation' for those inside the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens. Then to end the director's touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie a desperate scream a 'Death Camp Opera' where some folks are on the run after virulent trials. Punishment Park is for those who want to grow. See this film and have the opportunity to choose your own morality. Grow up and harmonize yourself with it! If you can feel it! If you can see it!! In my case Punishment Park is stuck in me for ever with all my love consciousness and will.";

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Watkins' Punishment Park is a compellingly brutal film serving as commentary on the polarization of America and the treatment of those with unpopular viewpoints in the Vietnamera. Shot in 1971 on a miniscule budget the film offers its ideology on American youth at the time the dehumanization and corruption of government and the torment of people with the looming thought that they may have not even been doing anything wrong.The film was one of the very first to be shot in the style and tone of cinma vrit a technique used by filmmakers to generate a documentarylike vibe and to persuade the audiences into believing what they're seeing is real footage. It is 1970 and the Vietnam War is escalating with president Richard Nixon losing control and running out of options. He declares America as a state of emergency and proposes the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 which gave federal authorities the right to detain those who appeared as a risk to internal security. We follow members mostly young university students of various political movements such as the feminist movement the antiwar movement the civil rights movement and the communist movement who are arrested and given the choice of either serving their full time sentences or spending three days at the ambiguously named Punishment Park. Many of them choose the second option where they are told that if they can run fiftythree miles in brutal California desert heat and make it to an American flag checkpoint with a two hour headstart before National Guardsmen and federal authorities are dispatched to try and stop them that they will be released and their pending dues will disappear.As we see many young students run helplessly through the desert with temperatures well over onehundred degrees we focus on another group of students who are pleading their cases to a group of men and women in a tent on why they were resisting and evading the Vietnam war. The people are simply not interested in hearing their views and constantly interrupt them leading to contentious interactions involving heavy cursing and strong morality and ethics that increasingly come into play as time goes on.The cinematography is as raw as they come with extensive shots of desert locations inhabited by sweaty breathless students desperately clinging to their last hope for survival and humanitydriven choices. Watkins directs this picture with numbing realism that stems not only from the provocative cinematography but from the screenplay composed of extemporaneous dialog and improvisation on the actors' part. Their performances are coldly real and chillingly authentic.Punishment Park sort of tires out in its third act being that it greatly established its point and purpose within the first two but the film relentlessly tries to depict a brutal reality filled with dissent isolation and strict government control that thankfully never was prophetic. What is amazing is despite ones assumption that the film's ideology and issues are dated and no longer relevant in a post911 Patriot Act NDAA world it would appear we must look onto films like these as poetry for the present.Directed by Peter Watkins.".

I am not strange to that feeling since I may know too much for my own good and also like to do my best to fight this putrid system we were all born into. Punishment Park is shocking because it is happening. I've seen it. While your average Joe rants about the increase in taxes while drowning his frustration in a can of beer there are others who actually take action. And are at risk of suffering the torments of the socalled law in the name of a distorted justice and selfcreated ideals such as patriotism or morality. The judges portrayed in this film do exist full of absurd and obsolete ideas believing to be the voice of reason while those who actually speak sense are treated like criminals gagged and beaten by the arm of the law individuals just like any other people who by the almighty and imaginary power of state are given the authority to command and do as they please with the common citizen. This movie is not a false documentary. It's a depiction of what has been happening for years in America in Europe in Asia in every continent and with every government. You thinking you can be as free as you can possibly imagine whose biggest worries are what to have for dinner take heed. The body lying on the pavement could be you murdered by those who claim to come in the name of peace. At another time the honorable thing or the right thing to do might be to be a policeman or to be President. Right now I think the honorable thing to do is to be a criminal".

It takes sort of a SteveMartinesque view of the tender absurdity of humans and their feelings about each other OK OK I just saw a stage production of Picasso at the Lapin Agile and the tone reminded me somewhat of this.  Although there is physical humor too what I liked most were light touches like how Ellen DeGeneres' character instantly wordlessly went back to working for her boss played by Kate Capshaw as soon as she got the apology she felt she deserved  after insisting with great finality that it was all over.I also felt this film was a celebration of the beautiful but almost lunatic breadth and diversity of the kinds of feelings we group together under the heading of love  everything from young and older wideeyed lust to slow steady enduring commitment.  As well as friendships coworker relationships like the one just mentioned family bonds . . . the list goes on.Most of all I guess I appreciated the fond loving tone of the movie.  The artists seem really to like and love people.  Yes there ARE quite a few characters and they're all different ages and different sexes they're about different trials and tribulations but they're all treated with lighthearted love and respect for the sometimes silly but vulnerable beings we all are.So if YOU like people I think you'd like this movie.".

Kate Capshaw does a good job of carrying the film and maintains a good chemistry with her costars. Tom Everett Scott fits the part.It was odd to see Danner play Capshaw's mother because the age difference did not seem believable enough. Tom Selleck was alright. Ellen Degeneres and Geraldine McEwan are scene stealers. In addition I was amazed by the whimsical soundtrack that flows beautifully with the film pumping some energy into it and would work well as a standalone score. IU felt the film would have benefited more had their been more comedic situations. At times it gets too serious and that needed to be toned down a little. I liked how it ended without showing the two lovers kissing as has been evident in x number of romcoms but instead suggesting a promising future for them together.

Waiting in the wings is Tom Selleck the town fireman who has held a torch for Capshaw all his life. These are all pleasant folks to spend a couple of hours with. The town is picturesque and the background score is romantic by Luis Bacalov composer of Il Postino. It's interesting to note that everyone does not end up with whom you expect. Supporting roles are ably though too briefly handled by Blythe Danner and Gloria Stewart Titanic. Director Peter Chan who has been involved in the Hong Kong film world has done surprisingly well with this material which is so American. I'm sure we'll be hearing from him again.".

The town is picturesque and the background score is romantic by Luis Bacalov composer of Il Postino. It's interesting to note that everyone does not end up with whom you expect. Supporting roles are ably though too briefly handled by Blythe Danner and Gloria Stewart Titanic. Director Peter Chan who has been involved in the Hong Kong film world has done surprisingly well with this material which is so American. I'm sure we'll be hearing from him again.";

Director Peter Chan's take on the story looks good on the screen what with the picturesque setting of Rockford Ma. as the background and all the cute houses where the story takes place. The result is a film that is easy on the eye but alas like eating a Chinese dinner it leaves us hungry for more.Helen the owner of a book store finds a letter between the cushions of the couch of the shop. She reads it and it sounds intriguing because the writer goes to express how deeply he feels for the person the letter has been sent to. Since it has no name Helen assumes it has been intended for her alone. She believes Johnny the young assistant has sent it to her. The young man who likes the older Helen is only too happy to tell her how he feels about her.Basically The Love Letter is a story about missed opportunities. Helen who was in love with George the local chief firefighter married someone else but her marriage failed. George also is getting a divorce. George confesses he had gone away to New York when he was younger to get away from Helen and his life in town and he had also sent her a postcard from New York which Helen had kept but had not read the message inserted within the card. It's at this moment when Helen comes to her senses when she realizes her affair with Johnny is only a summer fling.The film will be liked by the audience for which it was targeted. Kate Capshaw who produced the movie is fine as Helen. Tom Everett Scott plays Johnny. Blythe Danner Geraldine McEwen Julianne Nicholson Tom Selleck Ellen DeGeneres and the rest of the cast do good work also.The film has an ironic twist at the end when the real recipient of this letter is revealed.".

This film might not be as good complex deep or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship such as L'ecole de la chair' or 'Post coitum animal triste' but The Love Letter' can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship.

While it was not as popular in theaters it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on VHSDVD. Set in a seaport town in the good old USA I forget the exact location this is the story of a mysterious passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters each who think the letter is personally addressed to them. By the end of the film we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. The cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on TV and film among them Kate Capshaw in the lead role of middleaged beauty Helen a bookstore owner comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friendemployee Janet Hall young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny the young 20 something guy who falls for the older Hellen and an older Tom Selleck as the firefighter George Matthias who must compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are cameo roles by veteran old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly Rose in Titanic 1997 and a cameo by Kate Capshaw's own daughter with husband Steven Spielberg Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middleaged woman an older man and a young man each of whom feel as passionately for Helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person ? Which man has the most to offer her ? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own and is in fact a kind of reminder of what Helen was like at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life.

There are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town rendered beautifully by cinematographer Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs   I've Never Been In Love Before I'm In The Mood For Love and Only The Lonely. Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall who is consistently late to her job at Helen's bookshop who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy  is simply wonderful. She has not lost her comedic flair even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on TV or film because only about two years before her hit mid90's TV show Ellen was cancelled because of her coming out as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show. Here you even find comedian Jack Black long before he made it big in the bit part of a fisherman. This is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books letters and music but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship. This is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.".

While it was not as popular in theaters it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on VHSDVD. Set in a seaport town in the good old USA I forget the exact location this is the story of a mysterious passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters each who think the letter is personally addressed to them. By the end of the film we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. The cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on TV and film among them Kate Capshaw in the lead role of middleaged beauty Helen a bookstore owner comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friendemployee Janet Hall young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny the young 20 something guy who falls for the older Hellen and an older Tom Selleck as the firefighter George Matthias who must compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are cameo roles by veteran old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly Rose in Titanic 1997 and a cameo by Kate Capshaw's own daughter with husband Steven Spielberg Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middleaged woman an older man and a young man each of whom feel as passionately for Helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person ? Which man has the most to offer her ? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own and is in fact a kind of reminder of what Helen was like at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. A cultured intellectual he takes Helen on an opera date where the tragic death of Puccini's ultraItalian heroine Tosca moves Helen to explosive tears. There are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town rendered beautifully by cinematographer Tami Reiker.

Although at first this works since in life we don't always know everything about everyone else and because the point is being made that perhaps Helen is slightly selfinvolved it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other characters.Secondly the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. The letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and again although this works well in some ways it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behind.Overall this film is sweet and goodnatured with some genuinely hilarious moments  for example Janet explaining condiments to an avid audience. The lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed but the film isn't quite as intelligent as it's trying to be. It just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life. However it's still good and if you get the chance it's definitely worth seeing.".

Title represents expression in a muddled and confused manner.

She works in a bookstore with Ellen DeGeneres and are frequently visited by Tom Selleck who plays a fire fighter once involved romantically with her. She regrets a past mistakes involving a post card and hopes to correct the mistake upon his upcoming divorce. Tom Everett Scott plays a student who works at the bookstore and hopes to go to college but upon discovering the letter he believes Capshaw wrote it to him. Clever although not satisfying in its conclusion. Director Peter HoSun Chan does well with presenting the true author. Capshaw brings one of her best performances while DeGeneres delivers on comic relief as well as the best lines. Selleck is charming and Scott pulls off a humorous performance as he embarks upon blind romance. Gloria Stuart makes her post Titanic appearance to offer that last minute presentation of love and endurance. Superb film that echoes lost opportunities and how one simple love letter can cause so much trouble. Score 8  10".

The plot is fascinating. A trouble maker but heroic naval officer Robert Taylor is given a secret assignment by President McKinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing American finance. He finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot Barbara Stanwyck and must decide between love and duty.Not everything about this vintage film works well but overall it is a good slice of studio filmmaking. The plot gimmick would be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for Mother Night the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by Nick Nolte and seems quite believable at least within the confides of studio make believe. As a fan of old movies I am always thrilled when I stumble upon one that I have never seen and This is my Affair was no exception.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an unusual film because although it was made by TwentiethCentury Fox because it's one of the few pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had been making films for many different studios RKO Paramount and Selznick at about the time she made THIS IS MY AFFAIR but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to Foxsomething studios occasionally did during this era.The film is interesting because many reallife people have roles in the film though the piece is otherwise pure fiction. You'll see actors playing William McKinley Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can't recall any film with McKinley or Dewey in it as a character though I do remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a couple other films. Three cheers for seeing a lesser President in a film as a major character! The film begins with McKinley taking a young lieutenant Robert Taylor aside and asking him to be a special agent for himand telling no onenot even the Secret Service. That's because the President fears that someone within the agency is tipping off a gang that has been making a long string of robberiesall based on inside information. So it's up to Taylor who is NOT known for his manly rolesespecially at this stage of his career to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible AND the inside man.However there are two serious complications. First while he is able to find the gang members one of the gang member's stepsister is Stanwyck. Taylor finds that he's fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities. Second because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth SERIOUS problems develop when McKinley is assassinated and Taylor is on death row for the crimes!!! The film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context. While today most people don't remember McKinley nor remember that he was assassinated the film is set in this interesting time period. The acting is pretty decent as the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy though I must admit that Donlevy's role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. Overall it's very interesting well written and not too sappy in the romance department. A good outing for all.".

It's a question that was left unexplored here because I take it Americans of the thirties never saw the event as anything but the act of a lone fanatic instead of as a conspiracy. After all audiences were still recovering from the aftermath of a Depression and the movies of the time were more concerned with stamping out the Little Caesars and Duke Santees of the day than uncovering political corruption.  Allan Rivkin The Farmer's Daughter wrote an interesting story about a naval officer Robert Taylor who in secret correspondence with McKinley uncovers the linchpin behind a wave of bank robberies in the upper Midwest centered in of all places St. Paul Minnesota.  The screenplay gets sanctimonious in the hands of Lamar Trotti and the script did not inspire William Seiter to more imaginative heights.  Brian Donlevy plays the crime boss with his usual menace while Barbara Stanwyck of all people as his halfsister is made to sing She's barely onkey like Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel. and wear big floppy hatseven in her stage act.  The only one I've ever seen on screen who could pull off wearing headgear like these is Mae West and she was at least in on the joke.  Stanwyck on the other hand is forced to be unswervingly sincere throughout.  Her character Lil and the officer idle on Lake Como and get serious about each other much to the dismay of Victor MacLaglen who's Donlevy's sidekick prone to playing practical jokes and thinks he has it in with her.  The acting is uniformly bad I guess Stanwyck and Taylor were too much in love at the time to care.  The story deserved better than this. A secret only you and the President share you would think should take precedence over runofthe mill movie romance.  Unless it involves a cigar and a stained dress...".

	schema:reviewBody "A pair of nuns escort a group of schoolgirls through Arlington National Cemetery where they stop at the grave of Richard L. Perry a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. When the nuns are unable to answer a girl's query as to why Perry is buried therein the film flashes back to 1901. The young Perry played by Robert Taylor is at a White House reception where he is called into conference with President William McKinley. The President asks Perry to pursue a gang of bank robbers who evidently have inside information from a high government source. Fearful that information sensitive to national security may also be at risk the President tells Perry to drop out of the Navy without giving any reason change his identity and break contact with friends and only report by secretly coded letter to the President personally. This farfetched premise sends Perry without any apparent funds to St. Paul for no given reason where he begins his quest for the robbers and the government leaker. Viewers who can swallow the credibilitystretching plot conceived by Allen Rivkin and Lamar Trotti may find a few nuggets of silver among the gravel that constitutes This is My Affair. Even the generic title which offers no clue about the film's subject matter is forgettable. Directed by William A. Seiter and filmed in black and white by Robert Planck the movie is barely passable entertainment largely for fans of the stars. Robert Taylor in his youth was always too pretty for toughguy roles and he plays Perry without the necessary grit to convincingly stand up to his tough costars. Always a fascinating actress even in undemanding roles such as this Barbara Stanwyck is Lil a club singer and unwilling gangster moll. Lil performs clumsily at times in a club operated by Jock. Splendidly played by Victor McLaglen Jock is a boorish childish jokester in love with Lil. When Taylor pursues an initially reluctant Stanwyck the expected conflict with McLaglen arises which like everything else in this tired script is a clichd retread from dozens of other movies. Brian Donlevy as Batiste the brains behind McLaglen and John Carradine offer convincing support. However Sydney Blackmer's corny impersonation of President Theodore Roosevelt is embarrassing listening to him say Speak softly and carry a big stick over and over will make audiences cringe. Although This is My Affair is somewhat vague as to what affair the title refers the flimsy contrived plot offers little beyond a gangster story wrapped up in early 20thcentury period costumes. Like the unnecessary prolog in Arlington Cemetery the intrusive musical numbers that regularly interrupt the film only serve to extend the running time. Stanwyck was not noted for her singing or her dancing and even her skill as an actress fails to convince that she is a great stage presence. While Taylor is handsome and Stanwyck is worth watching McLaglen gives the film's best performance as Jock the big overgrown kid who always has a new joke or trick to play. However other than McLaglen Stanwyck and Donlevy This is My Affair could be retitled This is a Dull Affair.".

Robert Taylor is a federal agent utilized by President McKinley in 1901 to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers. This leads to the capture and sentencing to hanging no witnesses in his favor as the president is assassinated. Barbara Stanwyck plays the Lillian Russell like singer ironically named Lily whom Taylor falls for and is the only person who can possibly save him.This enjoyable period drama with a few nice musical sequences is a delightful pairing of the reallife couple who married several years later. Stanwyck's husky voice isn't Merman or Garland but is pleasant and perfect for the period. She looks wonderful in the period costumes and her acting excellent particularly when she goes to see President Theodore Roosevelt for help. She hit her stride this year with her first Oscar Nomination for Stella Dallas and Taylor rose above romantic leads where he was overshadowed by the leading ladies he was being cast opposite at MGM.Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy also stand out as members of the gang McLaglen giving a memorable breakdown scene where he fights against his imminent hanging while in prison. There's a hint of the Alice Faye musicals of the time that 20th Century Fox was making especially the soon to be released In Old Chicago.".

It sounds like an extremely lame plot and while no one would ever accuse this movie of turning into a classic if you want to see an acting couple who eventually got married you can rent it. Bob goes undercover with only a secret symbol to write on his letters as proof that the president is on his side and along the way falls in love with nightclub singer Barbara Stanwyck.One of the fun parts of the movie besides seeing the lovebirds together is Sidney Blackmer's Theodore Roosevelt impression.

	schema:reviewBody "1937's This is My Affair could have been better but as it is barely gets by. Robert Taylor stars as a Navy lieutenant who is asked by President McKinley to get the name of the men robbing banks all over the country and his mission is to be kept secret between the two of them. Taylor infiltrates the gang by becoming a criminal himself. He meets the dumb big practical joker Victor McLaglen and the brains Brian Donlevy  but there's a head name whose name he can't get. McLaglen has it bad for Donlevy's halfsister a saloon singer Stanwyck with whom Taylor falls in love. The premise isn't bad if you can suspend your imagination and the end is fairly tense but This is My Affair just isn't a wellmade or wellthought out film. First of all Stanwyck was one of the most versatile and multitalented actresses in Hollywood but singing wasn't her greatest talent. In fact she couldn't sing with the exception of Take it Off the E String Play it on the G String in Lady of Burlesque and a little number in Banjo on my Knee that can't count as singing. Her outfits were from the Mae West School of Design and overpowered her tiny frame.Then there is the awful scene with Theodore Roosevelt where he invents the phrase Speak softly but carry a big stick  embarrassing. Taylor slugs through it professionally but why did makeup people always slather so much pancake and eye shadow on him? This is a 20th Century Fox film by the way not MGM Taylor's usual studio but MGM did it too. Fox never made Tyrone Power up like that with the exception of Lloyds of London. Taylor was a handsome rugged man. I guess they couldn't leave his face alone. Victor McLaglen isn't very good but Donlevy in a usualtype role for him does a good job.It is a chance to see the two married stars work together.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a recent biography of Barbara Stanwyck I learned that Darryl Zanuck was keen on teaming Stanwyck with her soon to be husband Robert Taylor. Stanwyck freelanced and was currently owing 20th Century Fox a picture so Zanuck must have worked something out with Louis B. Mayer at MGM to get his favorite star over to Fox.The year before the TaylorStanwyck team starred in His Brother's Wife which I'm sure did good business but wasn't exactly memorable. Neither would This Is My Affair if it hadn't been for the fact that it starred a couple that were a hot gossip column item.What Zanuck did was give Bob and Barbara a vehicle that must have at some time been intended for Tyrone Power and Alice Faye. It's a period piece set at the turn of the last century. Barbara is even given a couple of songs by Alice's own songwriting team of Harry Revel and Mack Gordon to do as well as some period public domain music. Apparently she does them herself because I see no credit for voice dubbing. They would have been better had Alice Faye done them however.Taylor is a Navy Lieutenant on detached assignment to work a job for President William McKinley personally. McKinley is worried about a successful gang of bankrobbers operating in the Midwest who seem to have inside information about vault combinations and even have keys to let themselves in at night so no breakin is required. He has Taylor go under deep cover and report only to him if needed.It takes months but Taylor does find the gang which is headed by Brian Donlevy and Victor McLaglen. He also finds Donlevy's stepsister Barbara Stanwyck with whom he falls for. But still his duty is clear.The notion that a President of the United States is taking such a personal interest in apprehending a gang of robbers is interesting. William McKinley's administration was one that had a lot foreign and domestic concerns. I can't believe that particular president could have involved himself in this crime investigation. But also the banking system was not so tightly regulated that one man could have had all that inside information. It's not even that tightly regulated now even with the creation of the Federal Reserve which was a dozen or so years in the future.In fact McKinley's own assassination nearly cooks Taylor's goose. Frank Conroy looked very much like William McKinley and his character portrayal was accurate right down to the cigars McKinley enjoyed the only vice this most Christian of presidents was known to have. Sidney Blackmer played Theodore Roosevelt many times on screen and really does make you think you're watching TR himself. He was much better at it than John Alexander from Arsenic And Old Lace.The two stars who soon married never did another project together while they were husband and wife. Taylor and Stanwyck did do The Night Walker after their divorce almost thirty years later. None of the three films is at the top drawer of credits for either star.".

	schema:headline " WouldBe Allison Hayes";
	schema:reviewBody "After Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal Provine is more the girl next door type. She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy but the material lets her down. Lou Costello however proves he can do a movie without Bud Abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags. Gordon however establishes that all he can be is blustery perturbed and pushy much the same character he creates later on The Lucy Show. Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing for the time but I would have liked Dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous. As the movie's lead character she takes second billing to Costello who is in all of the movie with Dorothy several times vanishing like a subplot. The whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There's a lot of good scenes some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film. Still I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one. If this movie had a chance to be remade today I'd highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original script. Courtney tops my lists of actresses who I believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses although I have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me I'd go quietly !!".

	onyx:emotionText "After Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal Provine is more the girl next door type. She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy but the material lets her down. Lou Costello however proves he can do a movie without Bud Abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags. Gordon however establishes that all he can be is blustery perturbed and pushy much the same character he creates later on The Lucy Show. Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing for the time but I would have liked Dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous.

	schema:reviewBody "30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock The 1959  12 out of 4 A historically important film for all the wrong reasons this one is. This sad feature was released five months after the death of its star Lou Costello but it's also best remembered today for it being his sole feature without Bud Abbott. In the film Costello plays Artie Pinsetter a simple man who is in love with a town beauty Dorothy Provine but the two have to keep their relationship quiet because of her jerk uncle Gale Gordon who pretty much owns the entire city. Their secret is revealed once Artie's new wife enters a cave and grows to 30feet tale. THE 30 FOOT BRIDE OF CANDY ROCK is a very sad film to watch but there's a point near the middle where a character states that he's against laughter and that he doesn't do it. Perhaps he was talking about his feelings towards the movie itself because there are very few laughs here and all the clich comedy bits are just downright pathetic. Costello was a masterful comic and there's no question that he and Abbott were among the greatest comedy duos in history. It's also well known that his personal life was falling apart during this period and you can just look at him and see that he's really not himself. His eyes look shot throughout the picture and there's simply none of that childlike passion and fire that we all know him for. Even worse is that he's pretty much a supporting character. The first fifteenminutes get off to a horrible start because there's a subplot with the uncle running for Governor and we get an extremely long sequence where the uncle abuses Costello except when a reporter is around then he treats him good. This abuse was clearly meant to replace Abbott but it fails. The entire comedy structure around this is just embarrassing to watch and the bad dialogue doesn't help matters. It's also hard to watch this film and not think of ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN which was released a year earlier. This film here has none of that campy charm and whereas that other film is so bad it's good this one here just comes across weak unfunny and the boring. Heck the screenplay doesn't even try to explain why the woman ends up growing. There are also other errors including the fact that she's supposed to be 30feet tall yet she comfortably fits in a two story barn. The special effects are all rather obvious and especially during the scenes where Costello is talking to his bride yet looking in the wrong direction. Some fans debate whether or not this movie would have been better had Abbott been in the uncle role and I think the answer is no. The story is just too weak where no one could have saved it and it's a sad reminder of being Costello's last and only solo role.".

There was Allison Hayes' vindictive 50' woman and now there's the putupon dumbbell Dorothy Provine who at 30' decides that no man other than Lou Costello would want her. Even though he's the local trash man he has a gift for science fiction that is and thanks to his wacky invention she grows to enormous proportions gaining the confidence to stand up to her pompous uncle Gale Gordon and any woman who threatens to come between her and that heman Bud. Of course the military becomes involved at reports of the sighting of some monster from outer space not helped by the frisbee she creates out of a water tower lid and soon both Dorothy and Lou are being targeted by missiles. Thanks to Lou's wacky machine he ends up going back in time eventually being conked on the noggin with prehistoric rocks before the machine gets it right and has him back in the present day almost out of danger.This is juvenile comedy with Lou in his last film working at Columbia where the Three Stooges were still present making silly features of a similar nature. Unlike Stan Laurel Lou hadn't aged to looking way beyond his years or out of place doing slapstick but it's still sad to see him without his straight man Bud Abbott. Provine is appropriate eye candy and when she stands on top of a building laughing at the townspeople who either hated her for being too cutesy or simply for being the obnoxious Gale Gordon's niece or were simply in lust with her she adds a lot of presence and more than just in her height. She's not the vindictive wife of Attack of the 50' Woman so she's much more appropriate for children to see even though it's obvious that this was a lampoon of that cult classic.Gordon not yet the imperious Mr. Mooney or Mr. Carter of the Lucille Ball sitcoms was famous already for playing the nononsense principal Mr. Conklin on Our Miss Brooks and here he goes from education to political wannabe with great ease. He's a buffoon and one of those types you can't wait to see being taken down a peg. Ironically Charles Lane who employed that dizzy redhead on The Lucy Show before Gordon did is also present playing the head of the town's welfare bureau. The special effects are pretty laughable but there are many amusements throughout whether it be Lou's travel through various periods of time or the final hysterical shot which left room open for a sequel which never came. Not a sad finale to Lou's career it's still not up there with his earlier classics but is basically harmless fluff that puts a smile on the viewer if not a few eye rolls here and there as well.".

Complications ensue especially after Gordon insists on them being married without knowing the full extent of what's happened to his niece.I think Lou would have been better off if he had chosen a property that would have allowed him to play someone closer to his actual age a father figure of some kind. His scenes with Provine just don't gel.In addition to this being the last film of Lou Costello this was also the final big screen appearance of character actor Jimmy Conlin playing the Justice Of The Peace who marries the mismatched couple. Conlin was a member in good standing of the Preston Sturges stock company you'll find him in many of his films.Not a good film to go out on for Lou Costello.".

As it happens one of the jokes centers around the fact that people weren't allowed to say pregnant on screen.Basically the movie is an innocuously silly sendup of all the scifi flicks about people becoming giants. And besides how can you not like the sight of Dorothy Provine wearing a parachute and looking like a vestal virgin in a swordandsandal epic?

Maybe so but I think that the movie merits a lot of discussion about its era. The relationships between the sexes is obviously very dated. As it happens one of the jokes centers around the fact that people weren't allowed to say pregnant on screen.Basically the movie is an innocuously silly sendup of all the scifi flicks about people becoming giants. And besides how can you not like the sight of Dorothy Provine wearing a parachute and looking like a vestal virgin in a swordandsandal epic? It's not anything special but if the point is to entertain then it succeeds.The sight of Dorothy Provine dressed like that is going to elate me for years to come.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this obscure filmthe ONLY feature of the Our Gang kidsI was expecting a featurelength version of one of their shorts so naturally I was quite unhappy with GENERAL SPANKY. Watching it again after many years I find it more strange than unsatisfying. There are a lot of excellent elements in the film yet other parts of the film are cringeinducing or surreal. Producer Hal Roach managed to take Laurel and Hardy from the world of comedy shorts to the world of features with great success so it's not surprising that he would want to take the Our Gang kids from shorts to features. My only question is...why a Civil War vehicle with Buckwheat as a slave! The box of the MGMUA video states the Roach was inspired by the success of Shirley Temple in THE LITTLE COLONEL to cast Spanky Buckwheat and Alfalfa in an Old South setting but Our Gang's brand of comedy is much different from Shirley Temple's. Interestingly Hal Roach returned to the Old South setting a few years later when he teamed Oliver Hardy with Harry Langdon Stan Laurel refusing to resign his contract with Roach in ZENOBIA another strange film. Perhaps Roach was inspired to cash in on the GONE WITH THE WIND phenomenon with ZENOBIA? Since Mr. Roach was from New York State it's interesting that he would buy into the romantic Old South mythology. In any event as I said above there are some excellent elements in this film. Buckwheat Thomas and Spanky McFarland are fantastic charismatic performers who can easily carry a feature film on their own. Buckwheat in particular is quite moving when he is looking at a birthday cake while incredibly hungry and since he's never seen a birthday cake before he thinks the cake is on fire and because he is hungry he starts to cry. The underrated Phillips Holmes best known for the 1931 adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's AN American TRAGEDY who reminds me somewhat of Onslow Stevens is quite impressive as Marsh Valient the Southern Gentlemen who takes in Spanky and Buckwheat. Holmes' scene with Spanky where the two of them discuss the nature of war was quite moving and still has a necessary message today it reminds me of Oliver Hardy's speech on racial equality in ZENOBIA. Ralph Morgan turns on his gruff charm as the Union general who refers to Spanky as General and treats him as a peer throughout the filmthe effect is somewhat surreal. Irving Pichel is superb as the arrogant and sleazy Union officer Simmons. On the whole however GENERAL SPANKY is such a strange experience I don't really know what to make of it. Any serious Our Gang fan should see it and people attracted to weird cinematic misfires might find it interesting also. It's still available cheaply from its early 90's VHS release. I've never been much of a fan of Alfalfa and fortunately he doesn't appear in the film until half way through and soon after he does his patented off key singing routine. It has not gotten any better with age. Fortunately the film belongs to Spanky and Buckwheat and they do a great job.".

Once Spanky and Buckwheat are in Marshall Valiant's home Spanky tends to interact mainly with the adults and the chemistry of the children is essentially lost. The Old SouthHuck Finntype setting really doesn't do much for the plot except allow the children to be out of doors a great deal. Ralph Morgan is the most engaging adult but then the other roles really don't have much substance to them. Louise Beavers manages some funny moments with a Yankee soldier towards the end. The villains aren't really villainous enough and the lovers not intense enough.

After all for his age he was a dandy actor...and cute as a button. However in hindsight their choice of material was a bit on the grotesque side. It's not that setting the story in the South during the Civil War was necessarily a bad thing but the whole slavery issue is very weird when you see it today. After all in this film you see lots of black slaves standing about and singing for joy as they apparently love their lot in life!! And when Buckwheat who is a runaway slave begins to cry because he wants to have a master too it's just too much! If it weren't so evil it would be comical. It's sad. Because without the racial insensitivity the film is very good. The kids in the film are all good actors and Buckwheat really is quite adorable and effective in the film.Rather surreal...that's for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "General Spanky 1936 out of 4 By 1936 Hal Roach was attempting to shut down his short productions and making Our Gang Charley Chase and Patsy Kelly among others join the feature ranks. This film attempted to put the kids on the map of features but it's also clear that it was a pet project for the topbilled George Spanky McFarland. In the film a Southern gentleman Phillips Holmes takes in Spanky and his slave friend Buckwheat. Soon the children are in the fields playing war as the Civil War is breaking out and the kids end up getting mixed up with real Yankee soldiers. GENERAL SPANKY is a rather controversial movie today because of its subject matter and the way it shows slavery to be something blacks needed and wanted. I'm really not sure what the mindset was in 1936 but it's clear Hollywood really hadn't changed their ways and wouldn't for nearly another two decades so that's important to remember when watching this thing. As far as the controversy I would never blame anyone for being offended at the idea that blacks enjoyed being slaves and we're constantly going around with smiles on their faces. What's even more disturbing in this film is some early stuff where Buckwheat loses his master and cries about it before walking around a boat hoping someone will become his new master. There are countless stereotype jokes aimed at blacks but I think the idea of a black child needing a master is probably what's not going to sit well with many. What didn't sit well with me was the poor screenplay which really doesn't try to do anything and I do find it easy to see why Roach and his features didn't work well for anyone. I think the biggest problem is the screenplay never seems to be too worried about being funny. I thought it did a good job at showing the South just before the Civil War but the majority of the jokes just fall flat. Check out the longwinded scene where Spanky is being fed fried chicken while Buckwheat is under the table and wanting a few pieces. Spanky sends them down but the dog gets them instead of Buckwheat. This entire sequence has zero laughs because the scene is told so poorly and the timing is off so bad. Another scene that doesn't work is when the kids are playing war not knowing that the real soldiers are coming down on them. The stuff with the gunpowder I'm sure was meant to be funny but it wasn't. It's a shame the screenplay is such a mess because the performances are actually pretty good. McFarland is as cute as ever and fits his role just fine as does Billie Buckwheat Thomas and Carl Alfalfa Switzer. GENERAL SPANKY rightfully or wrongly will probably always be looked down upon for its subject matter but even if you can get past that you're left with a pretty bland comedy that feels overlong even at just 71minutes.".

But this fulllength feature throws all that out the window here is a story set in the South and presenting enslaved black Americans as happy sweet simpletons treated wonderfully by their owners. It's not Birth of a Nation bad  more Song of the South bad. There's even a conversation 10 minutes into the movie between two slave owners bragging at how well fed and cared for their slaves are. Buckwheat here an enslaved child overhears the violence these owners say they would do on a recaptured runaway slave and as he is runaway he is terrified. It's supposed to be a funny moment  but to any halfway caring human being knowing what really did happen to recaptured run away slaves the incredible violence and humiliation that was all too real it's painful now to watch this scene to watch this reality made light of. It would be like watching an old movie making fun of the Holocaust. Lots of other cringeworthy moments as well like Spanky proudly proving he's a Southern Gentleman to Alfalfa by showing off his slave smiling happy Buckwheat.So why did I give it a 7? Because it is a PERFECT example of how 70 years after the Civil War  and beyond  the myths of the happy slave the genteel white slave owner the noble and brave fighters for the Southern cause and the boorish cowardly Northerners wasis perpetuated in the USA this time with the overwhelming cuteness and charm of Spanky and Buckwheat probably the two most popular members of the Little Rascals they were always my favorites.".

What I will mention however is that the movie is pretty tough going even if you can look beyond the controversial content. I guess I should mention is that I have never gotten into the Our Gang shorts finding the child stars to be poor and annoying actors. So seeing them in a full length movie for me was an excruciating experience. But what really sinks the movie is that the script is a mess. Certainly the humor is really lame but there is almost no plot just a bunch of vignettes that are barely connected together. And while the movie is just 71 minutes long it moves at a snail's pace.

Go watch the Stallone film 'Cobra' and you'll see what I mean. This show actually has very subtle humor which says a lot both for a show that aired on adult swim and for a show about a walking ass.All the standard genre clichs are in place that made movies like Dirt Harry and Cobra so great and ripe for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner who is  as per the genre  levelheaded and constantly apologizing for his partner's homicidal behavior. The police chief is of course a firebreathing hard case who lives to scream I want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning! The overthetop and sometimes completely nonsensical manner in which the 1980's 'Renegade Cop' film is parodied suits the subject matter well. For instance while breaking up a bus robbery one of the criminals stops to ask Assy Hey where are you going asshole!? To which the title character snaps off the oneliner I'm going... to shoot you. Highly recommended for anybody who loves 80's action movies and has actually viewed enough of them to understand the humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Network The Cartoon Network Adult Swim Genre Animated Comedy Parody Genre TVMA for pervasive nudity strong language sexual content drug use and graphic animated violence and gore Available on iTunes Perspective Contemporary star range 1  4 Seasons Reviewed 2 seasons The streets of Exeter New Hampshire are a dangerous beat. It's as if they just dumped out the sewers and let the filth wash over the streets of their fair city. Walking backwards onto the scene to set things right is Assy McGee a rogue cop who plays by his own rules. Standing about 3 feet tall Assy is only a bare buttocks with legs. He talks in an 80s raspy jerk cop mumble cheeks undulating with every drunken slur. Wielding a gun from a holster with what can best be described as unseen hands Assy voiced by Larry Murphy unstopped and at times adored by his straightlaced family man partner Don Sanchez also Murphy dispenses his own brand of justice against the filth of the city as well as any innocent bystanders that happen to be in the way.Assy McGee is such a deliriously outrageous creation that it just may leave you slackjawed at the sheer nerve of it. Which is why it is so much fun and has become one of the most reviled thing on The Cartoon Network's Adult Swim a network that has made a schedule out of the outrageous. I've never been a fan of Adult Swim's pension for lookatme weird for the sake of weird where the randomness of Robot Chicken or the obvious parody of Venture Brothers passes for hip. But Assy stands out from the pack with a focused storydriven parody of a very specific set of pop culture clichs. For the most part I'll get to that later the show doesn't do very much winking and nodding to the camera as many others can't help but do. Assy simply barrels forward through ridiculous stories  surrounding such originality as priests selling druglaced cologne the government stealing bikes off the street and trading them with terrorists poloniumlaced sandwiches and underground squirrel fights  and expects the audience to just get the metajoke. Many may find it meanspirited and disgusting but my lord can it be funny. And I'm not a fan of the fart joke.In fact the pilot Murder by the Docks had me laughing so hard I was gasping for air which hasn't happened since the Rick James Chappelle's Show. Over 200 years ago President John Adams' favorite whore dies of a soot allergy. Cut to present day where the body is found and from the moment our hero walks in and shoots up the crime scene he's on the case to find that whorekiller John Adams. Assy's attempts to narrow down the suspects by simply randomly calling up names in the directory and expecting someone to confess over the phone is just about the funniest single bit I've seen in a while. Assy is one of those shows that actually gets funnier the more you think about it. Just keep applying real world logic to any bit of it and you'll peal back layer after layer of different laughs. This about as smartly crafted as a stupid comedy gets.The rest of the series doesn't quite have the impossible level of lunacy the pilot does but Assy as a character is rarely not a riot. Yes we've seen a talking ass as a character before  on Family Guy and TV Funhouse  but Assy leaps beyond the onejoke setup of that series with original stories and the sheer detail put into Assy's character. He hits on flight attendants can turn a baby into a weapon and blows away a blimp with a rocket launcher that appears out of nowhere. All the while with some odd character quirks he's illiterate casually racist got a bizarre sense of humor and is unbelievably stupid an outofwhere Cuban ancestry some strange phobias and an endless supply of puns and lame conventional cop oneliners. Just about everything said in Larry Murphy's barely intelligible Assy voice tickles me.What I also love is the way the show plays with the mechanics of Assy's physical appearance. He has to stand in the car but sits backwards in a chair without arms. His eyes opening in a POV shot. He chatters his teeth. And the show makes numerous references to Assy having unseen male genitalia via his frequent patronage of the oriental massage parlor. Even better because nobody in Exeter appears to think anything odd of taking orders from a talking ass Assy is able to slip undercover with the greatest of ease by simply donning shirts hats ties glasses and in one case just a bow tie Assy complains to be suffocating in this penguin suit.After season 1 Assy became something of a cult comic legend with me and my friends. Could this be the next great animated comedy? But as the show enters season 2 it falls back to Earth. It gets what I have come to call Family Guy syndrome  a show played best as a nonsensical parody that starts taking itself too seriously and seeks to make us care about the story and characters when it works better as unholy anarchy. In season 2 the chief is more tolerant of Assy's behavior and much of the episode's perfectly precious 10minute running time are swallowed up in an odd ultimately pointless storyline involving the stress and dissolving of Sanchez's marriage. Huh? Assy's gleefully excessive use of blood guts torture and crude sexuality as well as the generally disgusting and cruel demeanor in which Assy and everyone else in Exeter apparently conducts himself will turn off many viewers. The show's animation is cheap and crude. To say that Assy McGee is not for all tastes would be the understatement of the year.     4".

This would fit nicely in a mix of episodes of Sealab 2021 Wonder Showzen Xavier Renegade Angel Metalocalypse and Superjail. The used car lot advertisement between some segments were a nice touch. On that note i read rumours that one of the main reasons the show was cancelled was due to a lack of sponsors. Couldn't get someone like Hanes or Fruit of the Loom or Joe Boxer? Even though I loved the whole series if I had to pick an episode or three as favourites I'd say Ring of Fire Conviction and i guess Irish Wake.One of the recurring characters that I love because he's just so odd is the doctor featured in episodes like Ring of Fire The Ballad of Blind Anthony and Mexican Rain.I really hope one day we'll see a return of Assy or at the very least a decent DVD release of the series with extras.".

	schema:reviewBody "Assy McGee is an outofcontrol hardnosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks.The cheap lowbrow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. That is not to say that Assy is devoid of fart jokes just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs not groans and eyerolls. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme. In one photo a police cruiser is shown and the camera zooms in on the front license plate holder which is vacant. The meaningless zoomin satirizes the production of the typical 70s80s cop drama and incidentally makes me laugh every time.All the typical characters are included the frustrated police chief who can't control Assy the loyal minority partner who acts as a foil to Assy's recklessness the regular cops who detest Assy's means.... all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama.The voice acting primarily performed by Larry Murphy is nothing less than spectacular. Assy's voicebreathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken sluris so clever and unique that it ranks alongside alltime greats like Stewie Griffin Family Guy and Homer Simpson Simpsons. Though the voice is slurred the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other Adult Swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understand.Besides the fantastic production and voice acting the script is also hilarious. Assy's no nonsense directness fuels most of the humor particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force.If you have access to the Adult Swim comedies Assy McGee is certainly worth the watching. Each episode clocks in at a mere 89 minutes so you really have little to lose.".

Assy drinks too much and plays by his own rules as you might have guessed. The only other funny moments are Assy shooting manymany people and spending time at home  in the bathroom.

	schema:reviewBody "Straight up I love this film.  I love everything about it.  It has a great soundtrack it has a lot of recognizable faces and it is funny as hell. There are so many plots in this film and every one of them is funny in one way or another.Where as Spicolli lit up the screen two years back Drake is almost as memorable of a character.  All he wants to do is have fun.  He moves out of the house without his parent's consent he skips work whenever he feels like it he is obsessed with sex he loves his drugs and booze and he tries to be a good friend.  It is his lacksidaisical attitude that makes him such a joy to watch.  And he comes out with some great lines.  And there are so many tiny observations that you don't see coming but they make you laugh at the sheer velocity when it hits you.  One particular moment is when Tommy and Bill are talking about Bill's ex girlfriend dating someone else now.  At the end of the conversation Tommy takes his huge beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder casually.  He then says good night and the scene ends. It is a perfect scene.  Tommy's world is his own.  He really lives to party and have fun.  When the conversation is over his time is over and he doesn't care who he offends in the process.  He has an innocence about him. It's casual is his favourite saying.Another such classic scene is Reggie handing Bill a donut.  He says something to him that me and my friends will never forget because we rewound the film ten times and watched that part over and over again and hurt ourselves laughing.  It has to be seen to be appreciated.Wild Life is a throw back to when teen comedies were funny raunchy had a good ear entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world for 90 minutes.  Wild Life does all those things perfectly.  If this is a film that you haven't seen give it a chance.  It is a classic.Also check out the army store guy that Jim has problems with.  He is a very familiar face now and it is his first role on the big screen.".

I was just starting college when this movie was released so I could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and I still to this day will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie. As much as I liked Sean Penn's Character Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times I actually enjoy Chris Penn's Character Tommy more because he is the lead character with more of a actual speaking roll opposed to just a series of one liners such as with Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably pop this film in his VCR and use it for motivation to lose some weight. Yes the subplot with the Randy Quaid Vietnam vet character does seem a little out of place but he does a convincing job in the role. If there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as Fast Times etc. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I hold its predecessor Fast Times At Ridgemont High as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared The Wild Life is one of the better lesser known films from that timeand a worthy sequel if you can call it that. I believe its tagline reads From the makers of FTARH something even faster. This definitely holds true. Though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates teen sex and abortions The Wild Life is nonetheless a great flick. It's pure chaotic fun especially due to Chris Penn's overthetop character Thomas Drake. If Spicolli was high on coke instead of weed he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz in his first major role is great as the straightlaced Bill Conrad. The two characters work well off one another. Think a younger hipper Odd Couple complete with 80's gloss. Outside of them there are so many other great things about this film worth mentioning. Lea Thompsom has never looked cuter especially during the scenes of her working at the donut shop. Jenny Wright is just delectable and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a great nerdperv who is dying to get in her pants. Thomas Drake's wrestler buddies are hysterical especially Benny the little Puerto Rican guy who says some pretty memorable lines. One in particular that he yells out during a night out at a strip club had me on the floor the first time I saw it. That's saying something! Finally the movie ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film ever. Look out for special appearances by Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones Leo Penn Sean and Chris Penn's dad and a random Michael Jackson lookalike at the party. Throw in a score by none other than the man himself Eddie Van Halen and you can't go wrong. For Van Hagar fans keep your ears open for riffs that would be found on such albums as 5150 OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.If anything disrupts the flow of the movie it is a small subplot involving Randy Quaid as a burned out Vietnam vet. It just seems out of place and unnecessary. Other than that it's near perfect. If your a fan of mindless but fun 80's movies and have not yet seen this one you're in for something special. RENT IT NOW!!! p.s.The credits say Cameron Crowe has a cameo as one of the cops in the film. Does he have his back turned during his scene because I have yet to find him. Someone please help me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 'Wild Life' like other 80s teen movies are just one of those movies you watch not for story since there really is no single distinct plot directing the characters but simply because you can have fun with the series of scattered events with which our characters wade through.This one follows the spirit of 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' minus most of the controversial plot lines 'Fast Times' addresses abortion but this one only somewhat addresses strung out vets. Although that is not surprising since Chris Penn's character Tom Drake so closely models Sean Penn's character Jeff Spicoli. This movie is what a spinoff of 'Fast Times' would be like if Jeff Spicoli were the main character.There are essentially five main characters Tom Drake Penn the anarchistic party animal recent high school grad Bill Conrad a timid Eric Stolz who once played fellow surfer bonehead to Jeff Spicoli in 'Fast Times' who wants to prove that both masculinity and adulthood hinge on his having his own apartment Anita Lea Thompson who is dating a sleazy cop Eileen the spunky Jenny Wright who is much more independent that Anita but no less able to entirely refuse her idiot boyfriend Tom Drake and Jim Conrad IlanMitchell Smith the gloomy brother who is slightly less weirder than Josh Miller was in 'The River's Edge.' A crazy assortment of characters is typical in this variety of 80s comedy. Without a main plot our characters' situations lead to some pretty hilarious subplots most of them being between Tom Drake and Bill Conrad who eventually become the 80s 'Odd Couple' when Drake moves in.Look for minor roles by Rick Moranis as Eileen's completely nerdy boss Harry Randy Quaid as drugged out Vietnam Vet Charlie Lee Ving lead singer of 'Fear' who briefly appears as the cable guy and Michael Bowen Tommy in 'Valley Girl' as Tom Drake's equally braindead jock friend.And of course it wouldn't be an 80s teen movie without boobs beer and house parties.I didn't like this movie the first time I saw it because there is really no point to most things that transpire in the story. Why is the scene at the strip club or the younger brother's fascination with the war important? It doesn't matter. I watched it a second time a little tired and giddy and the 'Wild Life' became the perfect late night lazy movie. Turn off your brain and enjoy. That party sequence at the end is hilarious.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is nothing not to love about this film...it still holds up as a very funny film with some great characters attached.For The Wild Life the obvious connection and comparison will forever be Fast Times at Ridgemont High...which is fair and fitting. Like many of us Cameron Crowe didn't just write down his reflections of his high school days...he painted a narrative as only he can. Visual thematically accurate and draped with the soundtracks of our youth. As great as Fast Times is The Wild Life is equal to on many levels and equally as enjoyable. Fast Times takes place during a school year chronicling several different characters as they go through the trials and tribulations of going through high school...where The Wild Life chronicles the lives of some high school kids during a summer break that is coming to a close. One of the things that never gets mentioned is how so much of the film takes place during the night...which for me was an underscore to the high school years for a lot of us who went to high school in the late 70's and early 80's. Outdoor parties cruising around with friends always looking for something to do and generally staying out all night...only to do it all over again night after night....perhaps Art Linson had the same snapshot in his head when making this film...the story being told mostly in the evening has never been lost on me.From a character perspective Christopher Penn Eric Stoltz Jenny Wright Lea Thompson Ilan MitchellSmith were perfectly cast in their respective roles....with Hart Bochner Rick Moranis Ben Stein Sherilyn Fenn Michael Bowen Angel Salazar Robert Ridgely and Randy Quaid among others offering terrific supporting roles that enhances the film. The musical score penned by Eddie Van Halen is also a great accent to the film....just terrific pacing.The Wild Life is a very enjoyable film that has several memorable lines memorable scenes with a goof or two mixed in....but the film works to this day still holds up. Hats off to Art Linson for making a good funny and memorable film...released in 1984...it still resonates with those of us who remember those days fondly. Enjoy!".

One of the things that never gets mentioned is how so much of the film takes place during the night...which for me was an underscore to the high school years for a lot of us who went to high school in the late 70's and early 80's. Outdoor parties cruising around with friends always looking for something to do and generally staying out all night...only to do it all over again night after night....perhaps Art Linson had the same snapshot in his head when making this film...the story being told mostly in the evening has never been lost on me.From a character perspective Christopher Penn Eric Stoltz Jenny Wright Lea Thompson Ilan MitchellSmith were perfectly cast in their respective roles....with Hart Bochner Rick Moranis Ben Stein Sherilyn Fenn Michael Bowen Angel Salazar Robert Ridgely and Randy Quaid among others offering terrific supporting roles that enhances the film. The musical score penned by Eddie Van Halen is also a great accent to the film....just terrific pacing.The Wild Life is a very enjoyable film that has several memorable lines memorable scenes with a goof or two mixed in....but the film works to this day still holds up. Hats off to Art Linson for making a good funny and memorable film...released in 1984...it still resonates with those of us who remember those days fondly. Enjoy!";

After these many years I still remember the rumour Canadian spelling  lol that Bananarama was called in at the very VERY LAST moment to compose the track for the film and that they wrote the song on the plane bound to the recording studio to record the song and just after they recorded the song they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track. I heard that this entire process from start to finish took 4 hours to do! If this is true then they truly are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time.Anyhow this is just a rumour I had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later. Perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify. Thanks.".

	schema:reviewBody "A standalone monument in cinema history Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say 2001 A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait the one with like the spaceships and stuff? while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you get it or not nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects but as Kubrick said is ...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness. In it of itself exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one that's sheer genius at its highest form.At its premiere 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200 including Rock Hudson who asked Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about? The New York Times remarked Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring. Superb photography major asset to confusing longunfolding plot Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 trash masquerading as art. It's understandable though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extraterrestrial life was everyday talk audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise 2001 did the paradoxical leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism Kubrick saw ahead highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity respect and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible man with his limited senses cannot comprehend the absence perfect black of color or light Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public for if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd William Sylvester it may cause cultural shock and social disorientation. It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes and with the discovery of bones as weapons kill their own race for a puddle of water possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors at heart mankind has been and will always be selfish.Far before The Terminator 1984 or The Matrix 1999 accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence there was 2001. H.A.L 9000 voice played by Douglas Rain was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice unpredictability and especially his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans irony. Neither Dave Bowman Keir Dullea or Frank Poole Gary Lockwood display much emotion throughout the film while H.A.L albeit a machine exhibits some while pleading for life singing Daisy which by the way is a heartwrenching scene and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank Dave and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L contrast to what he may think is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race but if we are not careful they soon will.This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous Star Gate sequence Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod he watches himself age rapidly through onepoint perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating suggesting that man no matter how advanced will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later he reaches out to the monolith alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened he inevitably dies.A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a Space Baby an infinitely more advanced race marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius Kubrick ends hopeful giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending and it's a question for you to answer.There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot averaging 13.6 seconds possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.But of course it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zerogravity effects clever rotating sets fastidiously constructed spaceships the brilliant use of slitscan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.Finally the choice of music is outstanding. Originally Alex North was appointed to score the film but Kubrick turned it down in postproduction. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly North's rejected score which is available on a recording is a good job of film composition but would have been wrong for 2001 because like all scores it attempts to underline the actionto give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.But why all the slow parts? asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily to establish tone. Unlike the lowbudget commercial science fiction movies preceding it 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not challenges humanity's fate and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fastpaced like we see in most movies. Space is slowreally really slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.Thankfully its ingenuity was gradually recognized and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive 6 on the BFI Sight and Sound Critics' poll in 2012 ties for 2nd in the Director's poll places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of greatest sciencefiction films of all time.2001 A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags the dialogue is unnatural the static camera creates no visual interest there are barely any emotional punches characters are monotonous and none of the protagonists if there even are have dimensionality arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless it's transcendental and sublime aweinspiring and thoughtprovoking visually revolutionary technically impeccable monumentally imaginative substantially rich and way ahead of its time thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.".

For anybody to dismiss 2001 A Space Odyssey as boring they must have no interest in science technology philosophy history or the art of filmmaking.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous  they understand their audience.Thankfully those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in science fiction and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology and the past in the awe inspiring opening scenes.  The film's greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001 and that's just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief  I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.  The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological and social development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001 not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects camera work and set design Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human and where the human race is going.  Yes the ending is weird and hard to comprehend  but that's the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it now it's up to the audience to continue.  There's no neat resolution no definitive full stop because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest filmmakers the world has known and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 1010.".

Beauty is an underrated concept. Sure you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.   '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong plots and characters are good but they're not the beall and endall of everything. There are different KINDS of film and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty PURE beauty unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.  All art is quite useless   Oscar Wilde.".

	schema:reviewBody "A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly 2001 is one of the best sciencefiction films made to date if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost singlehandedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played all classical compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story while seemingly simple is profound. Sequentially several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film and sometimes slows down it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist HAL 9000 the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me for a film with such profound ambition and execution there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Instead of writing a paragraph I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time  1 It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate or at least are the most accurate  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science but also adds  to the mood of the film to be discussed in a later point with HAL.  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release it was a favorite trip movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time sorry  Phantom Menace fans!  2 Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats such  as Scorsese but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies such as M  and Touch of Evil Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the  audience a psychological viewpoint. Even he uses extreme closeups of  HAL's glowing red eye to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3 HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  wholeheartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still although  having see this film several times feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4 The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001's meaning in general is I'd like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie openended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning not the end of a meaningful  discussion on man's past present and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie save the great  Citizen Kane leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.".

It's a great loss and I write about 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other not only revolutionizing science fiction but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke his cowriter had a vision but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope a version of our rebirth through the starchild's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE or contain strong eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything HAL will be his most memorable character dangerous murderous and artificial. It was a halfdecade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms his own time and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.".

And that's not because I can't appreciate art. I love a good film with profound messages brilliant cinematography and great directing.This film just isn't one of them.My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slowpaced to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it. Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? Let me break it down for you Spoilers throughout For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music waiting for the actual movie to begin.For the following minute and a half you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight see the monolith fight some more pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.Finally we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz A pretty quicktempoed waltz as I understand yet here it feels absolutely agonizing. At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with antigravity.Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed again filling our ears with that horrible ringing I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!. The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.Seven minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's realistic to portray it as such but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its realism. Let me tell you about this realism thing I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.Anyway now we get to the most interesting part of the filmthe part with HAL. Forget Dave the stickofwood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal chillingly villainous ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the Open the pod bay doors sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into toolong goings on.Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly painfully losing intelligence with every minute voice getting lower and slower singing Daisy Daisy all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel again with that thricecursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.I'm not even going to try to explain the ending mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring.Call this crummy film art if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting art in the local museum. And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of 2001 A Space Odyssey a process that unfolds along a spacetime continuum. We see our primordial past and we infer a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective a conventional egocentric plot seems superfluous.

	schema:reviewBody "200l A Space Odyssey is a supremely intriguing spacetravel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the Blue Danube with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion a rich statement to the power of cinema...But 2001 reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's instead a philosophical enigma a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else...2001 is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic sciencefiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of thingsthe mountains the desert the technology the space capsule the computer named HAL who is more interesting than the humans and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story too it is a towering achievement not on the same screaminducing level as Hitchcock's Psycho but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a manape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclearpowered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!As a spectacle 2001 assaults the mind eye and ear with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually without a single line of dialog the zerogravity toilet with its great list of instructions the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips the magical alignments of Sun Moon and Earth the Starchild returning home to charm the orb...2001 is filled with poetic imagery the view of the Sun rising over the Earth the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...2001 is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question... Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film But for those who can accept mysticism the climax is deeply moving...".

	schema:reviewBody "Originally I was writing a huge analysis of this film to post on IMDb going through the film thinking about it in detail and peeling back all the different layers to it. About half way through I realised that it was getting too long and I should perhaps be more concise with my review. This however showcases the huge amount of substance and detail to be found in this film. In my opinion the best films aren't the ones that tell you things. The best films are the ones that ask you questions so that you can think about it for yourself.The biggest theme in this film in my opinion is tools. Near the beginning of the film we are watching two tribes of apes just after the creation of the world. They are rival tribes but then there is a pivotal moment which changes everything. One tribe discovers tools in the form of using dead animal bones as weapons and they are automatically superior. When one apes is playing smashing a bone against another bone he throws it up in the air and we witness one of my favourite cuts of all time. Suddenly it cuts to a spaceship with a similar shape millions of years later and we come to witness the tools that were discovered by the apes now defining who the humans are. The place they are staying in a spaceship is a tool. Breathing which should be a wholly natural thing can only be done through a tool. A man's only means of contacting his family is through a tool. For a large part of the film the characters wear spacesuits which to me although it is all up to interpretation is symbolic as without their spacesuits a tool they would be naked. Later in the film we spend a long time following an expedition to Jupiter which has on board an artificial intelligence computer HAL an astronaut Dave and about three other Astronauts in hibernation. The thing that is striking about this section of the film is that Dave and the other Astronaut who awakens both give extremely unrealistic and unemotional performances. That probably sounds like a bad thing to you but that's exactly what the director wanted to convey. The fascinating thing about it is that in a ship full of a number of humans and a computer the computer seems to have the most humanity.In this section the two Astronauts decide HAL the computer has gone out of control and they must unplug him. HAL finds out and a fascinating situation arises. HAL feels fear. Here it is easy to view HAL as a one dimensional villain who just wants to destroy things but really I think he fears being unplugged in the same way a person would fear being killed. I also think he reacts in quite a human way killing the the Astronauts in order to save himself. However Dave reaches HAL's control room and so begins a scene that I think is more disturbing than most things you find in a 12 I'm British but I think that translates to a PG13 in the USA. In this scene Dave unplugs HAL and the most interesting question in the film arises. Is this murder? Whichever way this is a very sad scene as HAL shows genuine human sadness and fear. At the end of the film after an odd sequence consisting of Dave going through a light colour tunnel and then seeing various landscapes in weird inverted colours he lands in an eighteenth century room. This is a highly debated scene and is completely open to interpretation but I will give my views on itIn this scene I think that Dave has travelled so far out that time and space are insignificant. What I mean is that he has travelled to a place where it doesn't matter where or when you are time moves randomly. You could be in the eighteenth century you could be on earth you could keep getting older or you could keep getting older which all happen to him it doesn't matter. And then what I think is the most ambiguous ending in film history unfolds. A much much older version of him appears dying on a bed then you see a baby on the bed replacing where he was which grows and in the final shot you see it next to the earth a similar size. So what does the ending mean? What does the film mean? What is it saying about tools? Was the unplugging of HAL really murder? Is HAL really human? What makes us human? Is it trying to imply we are too reliant on tools? Perhaps it is trying to imply that we ourselves are becoming the tools as the beings with the least humanity. This brings me to my first point. 2001 never makes any statements it only asks questions. And the great thing about that is that they are interesting questions I can think about for as long as I want and never come to a conclusion as I don't think there ever was one.".

Three minutes of blackness with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complementthree sleeping people two people named Dave and Frank who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil coldly ruthless supermind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock puts on a spacesuit and turns HAL offagonizingly slowly. Then apparently there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.Here's the movie with the pauses taken out Apes see monolith kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies Dave gets a prerecorded message and evolves at Jupiter.This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure it's realistic but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly every character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves and nothing would change.".

And then there's HAL the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil coldly ruthless supermind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock puts on a spacesuit and turns HAL offagonizingly slowly. Then apparently there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.Here's the movie with the pauses taken out Apes see monolith kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies Dave gets a prerecorded message and evolves at Jupiter.This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure it's realistic but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly every character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves and nothing would change.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm always surprised given that the famous title track of 2001 is called Also sprach Zarathustra that nobody nobody I've read anyway has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work Also sprach Zarathustra. The idea of man's rebirth into a star child an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being is an explicit part of N.'s Zarathustra there is a prominent passage called On how a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child transcending both the ascetic altruistic side of man the camel always asking to bear more weight and the rapacious brutish willtopower side of man the lion. The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also Zarathustra said that man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman. The structure of the movie fits that description a brief history of man as beast until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason then a long sequence about man the rope as it were and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred and the suggestion that an external force caused them is also Nietzschean in Zarathustra he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider Zarathustra to show us how to go under. Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the nearend could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960'sstyle attempt at depicting the mystical going under.I know these parallels are pretty broad and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy and it is in my opinion explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of Zarathustra updated for the modern age. Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche.".

I mean the story is absent the characters don't really get through you and the ending...who gets that ending?? SPOILERS BELOWThe end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel the space child... Maybe I'm just plain stupid but spending two and a half hours looking at space slooowww space and in the end just watch a man in bed then a baby in a bubble no explanations no nothing... Truly if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it art or whatever simply explain it to me I would be very thankful not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it maybe ten years from now.That been said why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time I should put myself at the time the era the social paradigm the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note that I am talking about the visual effects and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era a filmmaker visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can't reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it so the movie reaches its goal to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this we just watch them to get some good action scenes visual effects whatever but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype controversy and most importantly a vision of the future he is creating a cult movie...a classic. To sum up as I said in the beginning when i read people calling it a classic a masterpiece I have to agree but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read some of the last critics and was astonished that ratings for this movie are either very high or very low which shows that these people weren't critic at all. I had a great deal of expectations when I watched this movie. Many friends said it is superb and I like all the other Kubrick movies I watched so far. But yeah. First of all the complete movie is filmed with a very keen eye on details. The ape costumes for example are great and the space vessels seem very realistic. The effects are much ahead of its time and are still remarkable today. But there is much missing. After the initial ape scene which has some great shots the really boring part begins. Wee see spaceships with Strauss' Danube waltz in the background. It is pretty for about 5 minutes but after it is just boring. The music keeps repeating and all is very very slow. Some of the former critics say that you have to appreciate the beauty in it. Well spacecrafts aren't exactly beautiful and the statement you have to enjoy this movie as a picture is stupid because it is a movie after all. Maybe Kubrick chose the wrong medium for his 'art'. Later on even the music itself stops and it gets worse and worse. Some critics said the ships must be slow for being realistic. That is stupid because in space velocity is relative and it wouldn't be less realistic if the ship was faster or slower. Over all there isn't much of a plot which doesn't need to be a bad thing if the rest is entertaining. But it isn't entertaining therefore plot is missing. I have to admit that the end became interesting again. After a psychedelic sequence where one doesn't know what it means come a few very good scenes. My friend insisted that one can't really grasp the whole thing without reading the book along. But that is not the characteristic of a great movie. The psychedelic experience could also have been caused by a lack of oxygen leading to a dream sequence. One couldn't know the difference. I believe if you'd take only the first ape sequence and the last aging and rebirth sequence you would really get a fascinating movie. What I most hate about the movie are the people watching it and telling me it is one of the best movies of all time. These are the same kind of people that visit an art gallery for the sake of telling other people that they are interested in art. Even my friend who praised the movie suddenly admitted that the movie is in fact boring for the most part. Art is not good because it bores you. It is the same mentality as saying that culture has to be boring and that boring things are culture. And yes I am not the kind of person who loves action movies. If it would be an intelligent movie it wouldn't be boring because really intelligent movies aren't boring. People brag about the philosophical meanings of this movie. What is the meaning of a flying spacecraft? Why has to be a philosophical meaning in a fictional short story containing aliens teaching mankind? There simply isn't one. Most people say that this movie is awesome because their friends do and this makes me angry. To sum it up Boring as a whole but has some interesting genius scenes. It is not a bad movie but also definitely not great and it is certainly not mediocre.".

They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It's a collection of very long very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudointellectual drivel is a director who thinks he's quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film a segment he labels the dawn of mankind near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It's disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction horror fantasy and preteen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren't nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It's almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we're not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be interpreted by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making.".

	schema:reviewBody "2001 is the perfect movie for a certain group of people. You know who they are. Over the internet in your college maybea student or possibly a philosophyartfilm professor. A person with a passion for avantegarde films with wacky imagery and little else. They're the type of people who find a college thesis' worth of material from the dialogue in the Matrix sequels they're the ones that boldly declare a film 'art' and anybody else who disagrees with them 'just didn't get it.' 2001 is art alright. The kind of art that I can only liken as being assaulted and nearly beaten to death by an Andy Warhol painting. Yes this movie is art and you will hate it for that.This is a shame since normally I like Stanley Kubrick movies but 2001 is an experiment in filmmaking and nothing more. The plot is incredibly vague revolving around monkeys battling a black monolith a mission to space and a computer program called Hal going insane since that's what most selfconscious computer programs do. The film is then peppered with other psychedelic imagery that are supposed to convey grand ideas. They'll only convey those types of things if you're pretentious and into that kind of thing otherwise you'll view it as utterly pointless.2001 revolves around these whackedout LSDinduced images to string together some kind of story that interests you. It does not. A parade of shots that have little to do with one another and randomly show things happen does not a movie make.There are no doubt going to be people out there who will try to explain 2001's plot and why you should accept it as being a wonderful film. The thing is this much like if you have to explain a joke then it isn't funny it's the same thing with movies. If you have to explain to someone the plot and its various interpretations then it isn't a good movie.Ultimately I can't change the opinion of the viewers and critics that loved 2001 but if 2001 proves anything it's this keep your art to yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "r54Only Stanley Kubrick could create a film like 2001. It is unlike anything made before or after it and whether you like it or not it is an unforgettable experience. I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance  I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' Thus Spoke Zarathustra to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series movies parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is in every sense of the word a masterpiece. Nothing is halfbaked or average about 2001  it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of moviemaking itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket which were all far more accessible movies after 2001 he couldn't top this his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001  it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film It's all in the images and music and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a superintelligent computer called HAL9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming you must be some kind of super genius as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible vast endless dark empty and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull Kubrick uses this to his advantage the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer and 2001 is the prime example of this The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud actionpacked Star Warstype adventure. The long periods of nearcomplete silence the lowkey dialogue HAL's monotonous voice a stroke of genius and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers. The special effects are pitchperfect still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this as well as many of his other films the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies give 2001 another chance. At first viewing I thought it was tiresome and drawn out. At second viewing it was the most perfect movie ever made. If you're open minded this is for you if Pirates of the Caribbean is your favourite movie of all time it's not  and I don't say this to insult fans of Pirates I'm just saying that this film might not be up your alley.I hope I don't sound too pretentious because I know how horrible many of 2001's rabid fans can be. I know for sure that it is not certain you'll enjoy 2001  but I urge you to give it a chance. It is the ultimate acquired taste and in my opinion a masterpiece of epic proportions.".

Starting from space slowly and majestically approaching prehistoric Earth settling us in to witness the birth of mankind. And it keeps going on from there. All the way to the end.The one thing that impressed me the most about this film is its technical supremacy. This is a film that was made in the 60s. Computer effects had barely been imagined back then and they wouldn't be widely used in decades. And yet this film has some of the most amazing visual shots I've ever seen. I frankly have no idea how they even made some of them. Or at least made them without going to ridiculous lengths in setbuilding. And it looks great perfect even.As for the story it's a Kubrick alright. None of the man's films are what you would call fastpaced but this right here just might take the cake. I enjoyed the beginning a lot. The slow pace allowed for the majesty of the imagery to shine and it reflected the slow buildup of mankind rather beautifully. But the space scenes did not pick up the pace and I do think that they should have. Just a little bit. I get that the style is what it is and when the mood leans more towards horror it does work but I still think that the same story could have been told in a briefer fashion. Easily.Still I cannot fault the film too much. It is quite unique in its mood approach story and scope. An iron hard classic for a reason and definitely an inspiration for all the science fiction that would follow. Owe it to yourself to give it a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went. When I read the cover at Blockbuster I thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie. The movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. There was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay I thought it would be developed that in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. Beside each one are two attractive women. The men begin asking Do you hear that or Do you see them. We conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. The women do not see these creatures. This was fine for the first five minutes BUT THIS SCENE GOES ON FOR A FULL HOUR. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is this about? We never find out. The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. At the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab but why? What is the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! The makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went. When I read the cover at Blockbuster I thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie. The movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. There was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay I thought it would be developed that in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. Beside each one are two attractive women. The men begin asking Do you hear that or Do you see them. We conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. The women do not see these creatures. This was fine for the first five minutes BUT THIS SCENE GOES ON FOR A FULL HOUR. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is this about? We never find out. The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. At the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab but why? What is the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! The makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline. Sorry but this movie was a waste of 4 and the time I spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. Take my advice. Don't rent it.";

Still it's my own fault for watching a Christian movie in the first place.My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like. Something I am very interested in indeed. This movie almost hit the target. It was more like on the edge of the target more on the tree than the target itself...The basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments. However because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms the men of the couples are now able to feel smell hear and see the demons of the spiritual world. In that order. Apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.This movie is very clichd. They took the title seriously as the men while chained to the beds demand their women look behind them because there is something there.Although a good effort for what it was I think the special effects could have been done so much better. The demon scratching at the woman was in a word hilarious. The wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died. We were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair though.The message is one that I don't care to comment on other than I think the Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.And so I give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault I am not a Christian and don't like this type of message and I got a kick out of making comments throughout. My friend and I watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of MST3K.".

However it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a Cormanproduced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you get it for 2 or less as did I you won't feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made.";

The acting was your typical slasher film acting but probably about as good as When a Stranger Calls. The lead girl was attractive and the rest of the cast filled their roles well.

This movie has a very visibly low budget and less than impressive acting that were the movie's downfall but the body count was decent and the killer was sadistic and stopped at nothing to bring fear to this poor babysitter and the stalk sequences though handled in a silly amateurish way did bring some suspense and creepyness to the film enough to make you look over your shoulder especially if you watch it alone in your home. The acting was beyond atrocious thanks to a horrible script and unoriginal story but towards the end it seems like everyone tried their best to step up their game which led to an effective harrowing finale which might make you think twice about babysitting. Overall it's obviously a ripoff unoriginal flimsy but its brutality creepyness and ballsy nature will creep under your skin sure it wasn't amazing but as a generic rip off of stalk and slash it isn't half bad. Rent it. Have zero expectations leave your brains at the door grab some popcorn and enjoy. 6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "When a Killer Calls is clearly an obvious rip off to the remade 2006 film When a Stranger Calls. The plot is pretty much the same too. A babysitter named Trisha receives anonymous and scary phone calls late at night asking her if she checked the child she is babysitting. The exact same thing the stalker asks in When a Stranger Calls. This film opens up with a rather chilling murder scene which also includes us seeing two young children and their mother being stabbed to death. Probably a first in horror to actually see children being murdered on screen it was pretty brutal. Then we meet Trisha who is babysitting little Molly. The scenes with them had a real Laurie and Tommy from Halloween feel to it which was nice.Most of the call scenes involving Trisha and the killer were actually very well done and a little unsettling. The house was lit just well enough to give that spooky atmosphere. We get introduced to some other characters as well. Trisha's boyfriend Matt their two friends Chrissy and Frank as well as a nosy neighbour. All of course are put in the film to add to the body count. The murders are pretty brutal. Not really gruesome but the number of times he stabs each victim is just brutal.There is a decent revelations to the killer's identity but the last twenty to thirty minutes of the movie is where it fails for me. I don't need to see Trisha tied up and being tortured by watching her friends be cut and stabbed. It was REALLY overdone. There was a scene at the end that lasted almost five minutes of just her tied up screaming and crying. It was definitely overkill to say the least. I also didn't think showing three kids being murdered by the killer was necessary.Overall an average low budget horror movie. The acting is decent but you could clearly tell it was low budget. There were some unnecessary torturemurder scenes but some genuine creepy moments during the phone calls helps make the movie watchable at least once.510".

This killer is so coldblooded and remorseless he ties up his prey with rope takes phone photos and makes them wait out their execution. Like Michael Meyers the killer breathes across the phone when he's across the phone with Trisha and this is the device he uses to torment her over the period of the night. She believes that the one calling her repeatedly on the cell phone is Matt her boyfriend. The parents of the child Trisha's babysitting actually know the killerwhich means he's a local citizen and we hear his voice which sounds surprisingly friendlyand they make the unfortunate mistake of stopping off to see if he needs assistance. Ring. Ring. Ring. Prepare to hear a hell of a lot of ringing because the phone jingles over and over in this movie THE ASYLUM's answer to WHEN A STRANGER CALLS which might also bring to mind SCREAM. Matt brings over his pal Frank and Frank's girlfriendsome victims to stab and sliceafter Trisha specifically ordered him to not allow anyone else to come. The killer continues to threaten Trisha on the phone until she Star 57's his assthe killer also sends her pictures of victims he butchered. Frank is a rabble rouser a trouble maker who made a previous babysitting job for Trisha a disaster smashing the parents' china cabinet. His gal Chrissy is also a bit of a bad girl and when the two go into the basement a little surprise will be in store for them interrupting their makeout session.There's a murder similar to what you might remember from BLACK Christmasthe use of a plastic bag to suffocate a victim while he's being stabbed several times. The killer is savage in how he beats and stabs victims with blunt force in furious anger the sound effects on the soundtrack extra loud to emphasize the brutality of his actions. Regarding the endless phone call harassments I did keep asking myself why she just didn't silence her phone as to keep it from ringing continuously but then the movie would lose it's purpose the heart of the terror of the situation is the killer's menacing voice and what he says to the heroine over the course of the running time. There's a particular scene directly lifted from WHEN A STRANGER CALLS which is more than a bit insulting. There's included the typical staircase scene where the killer falls down the steps and the heroine must cross over him with the usual hand grabbing ankle. The barbarism towards children is especially disquieting in that the killer was just as violent towards them as other more adult victims. One victim takes a shot to the mouth with a lead pipe which knocks his teeth out! And the killer plays with Trisha by having her ropetied while slaughtering a victimnot to mention he rips her shirt exposing her breasts humiliating her. With Rebekah Kochanone of several in THE ASYLUM's HALLOWEEN NIGHT another slasher which ripped off various classics including HALLOWEENas Trisha Robert Buckley as Matt Sarah Hall as Chrissy Derek Osedach as Frank and Mark Irvingsen as the psycho. This came out the same year as the official remake of WHEN A STRANGER CALLSstarring Camille Bellwhich proves once again that those of THE ASYLUM have no shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "When A Killer Calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by Asylum so far. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly Have you checked the girl? Naturally she has the calls traced by the cops after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks  hanging up when he calls waiting ten seconds and dialing 57. Sound familiar? Yeah that's why I rented it too.Well it should. And I hate to say it but this could've been more entertaining than the bigscreen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake  Rather than revelling in Bmovie ripoff glory it tried to do something original. It tried to make the lead character sympathetic rather than having clichd campy fun with her. Mind you this could've worked with a talented actress. But she wasn't. Sure she looked good and she screamed and cried but . . . oh well whatever.Then came the horrific ending. Not horrific in that it was horrifying horrific in that it was BORING. The pacing up until that point about an hour in was campy clichd and fun. Then it heads in another direction and it veers away from just another dumb fun slasher movie with a sexy teenage cast to a Hostelesquire goreborefest.I guess this falls into the Oh well whatever category. The lead actress flubbed a line? Oh well whatever I don't feel like reshooting it. We forgot to give the killer motivation? Oh well whatever I don't feel like rewriting it. The pacing completely changes halfway through? Oh well whatever I don't feel like shaving fifteen minutes off. Continuity errors? Oh well whatever.If you like this kind of movie dumb cheesy predictable campy splatter movie with sexy cast then you'll be fine up until the ending. The ending is stupid it's not fun it's not scary it's not campy or cheesy or quicklypaced. In fact there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD and looking around at the stuff in the room then screaming and . . . whatever.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a Killer Calls 2006  12 out of 4 The Asylum's mockbuster of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS the remake has Trisha Rebekah Kochan going to babysit when she starts tor receive harassing phone calls. Pretty soon she starts to think it's her boyfriend but when he shows up at the house she knows it must be someone else and soon they're all under attack. WHEN A KILLER CALLS is a film that you'd think would be horrible but I have to give director Peter Mervis credit for actually delivering a pretty strong film and one that certainly isn't going to be for the weak. I say it's a film that's not for the weak because it has quite a bit of guts to go as far as it actually does. There's certainly lines that you don't cross in movies and especially in American movies but this film here pushes those lines to the side within the first five minutes of the picture. Normally killing a child or children is a major no no and when a film does it you know it means business. The body count here is extremely high which is something that was missing from the remake. I think fans of gore should be entertained by this thing because it's quite savage in regards to the violence and there's a lot of the run stuff going around. I even thought Mervis built up some nice tension early on in the film which must be a first for The Asylum. With all of that said there are still some problems in the film including a pretty boring second act. Once all the teens get to the house things really slow down quite a bit and the 91minute running time could have probably benefited from some of this stuff being cut out. Another problem is that some of the performances really weren't all that believable but Kochan is decent in the lead and Mark Irvingsen is good as the killer. WHEN A KILLER CALLS really shorts itself because many people are going to pass it up because of it being a rip of another movie but that would be a shame. While this falls well short of the 1979 film this is much better than the remake and I'd say better than several genre pictures out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people find this movie to be something amazing but I can't help but feel that the people voting for this film are people upset by the fact When a Stranger Calls didn't live up to their horror expectations.The producer must've got the entire cast and crew to come here and make kickass movie! comments because unfortunately no one with human taste would find this movie to be as good as they claim it to be.Watching this movie I just can't help but feel this is done by a 17 year old dude who just learned a couple of new camera effects. The special effects in this film come up as high as weak lighting twitchy cameras and rain storms that doesn't even seem to cover an entire patio. Seriously did these people use lamps and hose pipes for these effects? The deaths come up very short to today's standard creative deaths. Nothing but stabbings and slitting throats. And when I say nothing but I mean it literally. It's 2006 at least someone could've burned! These stabbings which looks VERY fake by the way just don't do for anyone anymore it's not 1980 anymore.The characters are all predictable and unlike it's alternate When a Stranger Calls which I think this title is only a lure for the emokiddies who were upset with the lack of gore from it's alternate you have no reason to care for these characters. The protagonist Trisha comes up nothing bigger than the average blueeyed teenage blondie with a hottie boyfriend slutty attitude and mistaken rep from the adults. She is the character we used to love to see get killed back in the early Halloween series. You know back when characters were stereotyped. The only thing this movie is missing is the shower scene that literally turns into a blood bath.I do like the idea that this movie gives no mercy to the children. You rarely get to see children die and if they do die then you never get to see them actually get killed. It was actually disturbing but never done before. I doubt it'll start a new wave for the horror genre but it's a good moment to look back on.The acting was... it was... unnoticeable. It's hard to throw a compliment or a complaint because I doubt you'll be paying attention. Not because the film itself is so engaging but because no one really cares about no name cast. I could easily talk about how the protagnist's scared reactions and frightening faces come up super short but that would be like trying to prove to someone that a pickle is green.Overall the only reason I might've given it this high of a number is because I was airdrunken enough to watch the fake ass looking slashes.".

And when I say nothing but I mean it literally. It's 2006 at least someone could've burned! These stabbings which looks VERY fake by the way just don't do for anyone anymore it's not 1980 anymore.The characters are all predictable and unlike it's alternate When a Stranger Calls which I think this title is only a lure for the emokiddies who were upset with the lack of gore from it's alternate you have no reason to care for these characters. The protagonist Trisha comes up nothing bigger than the average blueeyed teenage blondie with a hottie boyfriend slutty attitude and mistaken rep from the adults. She is the character we used to love to see get killed back in the early Halloween series. You know back when characters were stereotyped. The only thing this movie is missing is the shower scene that literally turns into a blood bath.I do like the idea that this movie gives no mercy to the children. You rarely get to see children die and if they do die then you never get to see them actually get killed. It was actually disturbing but never done before. I doubt it'll start a new wave for the horror genre but it's a good moment to look back on.The acting was... it was... unnoticeable. It's hard to throw a compliment or a complaint because I doubt you'll be paying attention. Not because the film itself is so engaging but because no one really cares about no name cast. I could easily talk about how the protagnist's scared reactions and frightening faces come up super short but that would be like trying to prove to someone that a pickle is green.Overall the only reason I might've given it this high of a number is because I was airdrunken enough to watch the fake ass looking slashes.";

The storyscriptwriting was poor the unnecessary tortureromantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing ending.The start of the film was rather slow the fakelooking gore not much of interest. Trisha arrived at the house and there was some premise for a good storyline.Trisha started to receive the threatening phone calls which heightened the suspense. This momentary suspense the best feature of the movie began to build but then the friends crashed the place wrecking all potential suspensehorror in the film.The plot then becomes obtuse from here on. Chemistry sparks between the two couples and then the killer picks off Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged on and unnecessary.The killer then makes her way for Trisha and ties her up. There is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long. As the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all and it bores more than shocks.In summary the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this film.310.".

It does have its flaws certainly most acting is not good often pretty bad though Robert Buckley's eyes are gorgeous. They were disadvantaged by that the characters really got on my nerves not because they were stereotypical but they were made to do irritating things and just weren't that likable. The script also is left wanting a lot of it has a corny and senseless quality to it and the story aside from being very derivative has one too many moments where it is predictable and unexciting particularly in the middle. The stalking sequences are on the silly side. However it doesn't look too bad you don't expect much from The Asylum in this regard but it does at least have a decently atmospheric feel to it. Even the effects were creepy. The killings are bloody with some suspense too and the finale is truly harrowing. The killer played by Mark Irvingson in the best performance of the movie is quite sadistic and exudes menace if there was any character that was at least convincing it was certainly him. Rebekah Kochan was also believable as the babysitter. All in all not that bad for The Asylum. 510 Bethany Cox".

I have to admit as has been mentioned before it takes a couple of shows before you get hooked but it doesn't take long before you start realizing the brilliant comedic performance and timing of Kevin James Patton Oswalt Jerry Stiller and Leah Remini. I don't think the few people criticizing the show realize just how much talent it takes to make the world laugh they really don't. However I'm puzzled only about one thing Everybody Loves Raymond but I don't and it is hovering around 5 in the ratings but The King of Queens which totally kicks ass on Raymond isn't even showing up in the top 20 what's up with that? Don't get me wrong because I've watched Raymond and I think it is okay funny but not nearly the caliber that KoQ's is. CBS needs to give a little more respect and focus some PR on the show and especially Kevin James because when movie goers get finally get tired of the very funny Adam Sandler I predict Kevin is next in line or at least I secretly hope.".

	schema:reviewBody "I never thought I would ever say this but...the funniest sitcoms out right now 2002 are on CBS!  The network used to broadcast only shows that the 65 and over crowd would enjoy.  This is a very very funny show! Now most sitcoms depend a lot on forced humor.  This show doesn't.  The writing and performances are very natural.  And I never watch the show without getting at least 10 good laughs.  Kevin James is a great underrated comedian.  He should really get more recognition for his talent.  He always cracks me up.  Kevin's not a bland comic yet he doesn't go overthetop.  He has just the right anecdote to produce big laughs.  By the way he hosted the People's Choice Awards and he was great!  It was hilarious when he walked off stage in his boxers. Jerry Stiller thankfully gets the chance to once again display his incredible talent.  He was memorable as Frank Costanza on Seinfeld and he's actually given a role that lives up to it.  I guess you can say he's the one Seinfeld cast member as of now who's still a television success. Leah Remini is a beautiful actress.  She is great to look at and has a superb sense of timing.  She holds her own not getting upstaged by the two professional comedians.  If you haven't checked out the show as of yet I really suggest you do. It's one of the few funny shows on television.  I'm really discerning when it comes to sitcoms so take my word for itit's great! My score  8 out of 10".

This show was released in 1998 and I didn't start watching it until about a year ago and found it interestingly funny. Out of mostly all the sitcoms on TV this show has a realistic quality about it. King of Queens is a show focus on everyday life of a middle workingclass couple. It's very rare to see a sitcom like this within the past decade. The humor is full of satire which makes the show catchable to enjoy. Arthur played Jerry Stiller is a wellknown comic and as a supporting cast member he is terrific. King of Queens is definitely a show to watch week nights after a days work. Even the repeats are still enjoyable.".

It was just okay upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again however once it went into syndication I caught several episodes simply because it was on twice a night and I'm telling you the more you watch this show the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected this show makes you laugh out loud. Every new episode I watch is more creative than the one beforepeople who only watch this a couple of times will not notice this. The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first this is far from According to Jim. First of all Kevin James is hysterical incredibly charming and a talented comedic actor as is the supporting cast. Leah Remini has excellent timing and Patton Oswalt's Spence is one of the funnier characters on the show. And of course Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. I was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the showhe's a gigantic part of why this show is so greathis delivery of these ridiculous schemes rounding out the crazy dad character are beyond hilarious. And the yellingthe best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling Lemon Icee!!. That episode during which Carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes to get him medicated to make Doug less stressed out guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur yells because he's never been validated. The latter part of the episode where Doug beats up his childhood self in a therapy session is beyond funny it's one of the most creative scenes I've seen on a sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show because it is severely underratedwhile Friends was sometimes amusing and Raymond has some great episodes and characters they both lacked the creative touch that King of Queens has. In an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and are on the whole mediocre King of Queens continues to push the sitcom envelope and show real comic genius. Critics of this show obviously don't get itor haven't watched the show enough to give it a chance because anyone with real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching. It's certainly on par with my other two favorites Seinfeld and The Office in its ridiculous tone. It's the Arthurs Kramers and Michael Scotts of TV that keep us watching and laughing out loud.".

I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast they are so funny. There is a hard edge in the King of Queens that I love and is seldom seen in today's TV comedy. Both Leah and Kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny. I have just purchased the 2nd season while I was in Az this week and I intend buying the full set the next time I am in the US. My son who is 20yrs old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations. I would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show  it's so appreciated to see this kind of TV show in what is in my opinion an era of poor TV fair in general these days with the exception of reruns of Seinfeld and such like...

Despite the topics the show has great characters with original personalities. Arthur is a hilarious character that I think the show couldn't do without. This show reminds me of Everybody Loves Raymond which is just as funny but King of Queens' comedic jokes are easier to figure out than Raymond's.

Despite the topics the show has great characters with original personalities. Arthur is a hilarious character that I think the show couldn't do without. This show reminds me of Everybody Loves Raymond which is just as funny but King of Queens' comedic jokes are easier to figure out than Raymond's. This is a good way to spend an hour of your time because you'll love it.";

And believe me it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once. Other funny people in this show are Carrie Janet Heffernan Spence and Doug Pruzan Carrie's boss. I'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. The show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers. Check it out if you haven't!!".

Too bad the next great sitcom seems billions of years away...The absolute greatest things about this show is that it didn't treat it's audience like four year olds. Unlike other sitcoms that attempt to cram a moral message down your throat Home Improvement anyone? this show told it how it is. Life is tough crazy and unpredictable. Rarely did the story lines come out perfect for all of the characters but the world kept on spinning and the laughs kept on coming...However what I've forgotten to mention is that The King Of Queens was also a tremendously funny show. Kevin James always found a way to make his laughably pathetic Doug into a lovable man as well. And Leah Remini proved to be a perfect costar as the forceful Carrie. But how could anyone forget Jerry Stiller's amazing followup to his role on Seinfeld? In one way Arthur Spooner is very comparable to Frank Costanza but he also brings something new to the table.Well that ends my tribute to one of the greatest sitcoms of the 21st century.

Doug and Carrie deal with daytoday domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face whether it's Doug's fixation with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothing. Doug and Carrie also have to deal with the third highmaintenance member of the Heffernan household  Carrie's twicewidowed father Arthur Spooner Jerry Stiller who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy  his regular excursions with gullible dog walker Holly Nicole Sullivan. Doug's friends Deacon Palmer Victor Williams Spence Olchin Patton Oswalt and cousin Danny Heffernan Gary Valentine round out the cast with their guy humor and diverse perspectives.In a manner that evokes The Honeymooners THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. Last season alone saw Doug loaning Carrie to a wifeless Deacon for help with Thanksgiving dinner the Heffernans suffering through the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their house and Doug and Carrie striving to copy a couple whose photos  of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie's  they accidentally took home. We also watched Arthur grow jealous of a new dog that Holly added to her route and Doug finding out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog Rocky three times behind his back. Throughout the series showcases James' incredible physical comedy Remini's hardedged wit and Stiller's unique comic presence.You can't... You shoulden't Miss it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I heard people say This show is so funny! and It's possibly the funniest show I've ever seen! I thought Hey maybe they're right. So I decided to give it a try myself.Now I wish that I hadn't. I'm even amazed to see how people can possibly consider this show to be a comedy. People ignore the fact that when people watch a funny show they expect to laugh while watching it. This socalled show in my opinion is not funny but crude disgusting stupid and horrendous. Let me begin shall I1 Kevin James You know it still amazes me to see how so many people consider Kevin James to be a funny comedian. Well he's not in my opinion. Kevin James stars as Doug Heffernan an overweight lazy slug who has a job at IPS delivering packages and only shows affection for one thing and one thing only food. That's it. His character is so stupid that I'm so sick and tired of watching him doing such stupid things on this show. pretending to be injured just to get whatever you want from your wife that's not funny. taking a disgusting disturbing inappropriate picture of his private with a tiny Abraham Lincoln hat at a wedding and then assigning the blame to his cousin that's crude. going to get a new doublestuffed chocolate filled apple pie or whatever they call it at a fastfood place and leaving your wife waiting for you in the pouring rain that's disgraceful. just because a new IPS worker didn't invite you to his BBQ means you have to go at great lengths to try and get him to invite you that's mean. you're nervous about telling your wife your new trainee is a hot blonde but then when she says Don't worry about it. I'm not mad. you become disappointed that she's not jealous of your new trainee that's absolutely immature.Let's continue2 Leah Remini plays as Carrie Heffernan in this show. Oh my God! I just cannot stand her. Her attitude what she does to Doug to their friends just makes me want to march right down to that studio and slug her right in the face. Why it's absolutely unfunny of the way she acts so selfishly and sarcastically. a barking dog from your neighbor's house is keeping you awake all night. okay here's a tip for you just go down there and tell them nicely to stop their dog from barking not I'm gonna call 911 and tell them there are two murderers next door! or Oh but you're gonna be nice. Let me just punch them once in the face and they're all yours! that is crude. you join your husband in the kitchen to color some designs on a piece of paper but your husband has a crayon that you want so here's a tip for you wait 'til he's done then you can use the crayon not tattletale on him to your father this is a freaking' crayon we're talking about here! that is so childish. you've donated money to a charity fund. that's good. but just because you're not on the Patrons list you have to constantly and constantly urge the poor elder woman who runs it to put your name up there and it results in her getting fired and you still suggest Can we still keep our names on the library as 'The Doug and Carrie Heffernan Library'? that is disrespectful. you got a speeding ticket for driving around a stopped school bus how on earth can you even say Okay Officer just give me the ticket. or I got a speeding ticket and blah blah blah... that Officer should've arrested you and taken you down to prison for those replies that is horrid. you find out that someone that lived in your neighborhood passed away and you plan to sell off his house for profit? not even caring about your husband's say in the matter and you just wanna get all the money for it that is horrendous.I could keep going on about these two completely unattractive unnecessary unfunny characters. I am sorry but anybody who finds them to be funny or hilarious is just beyond my comprehension.The whole idea for a good comedy show is to make the people who are watching it laugh and find it to be very entertaining. And you know something? That's nearly impossible to happen with this show especially when the wife and the husband are arguing with each other 247 hitting or abusing each other treating their friend's badly and even treating their family relatives badly. This is how I truly feel about The King of Queens. Unfortunately I am aware that this review will find its way all the way in the back because a lot of people will disagree with me but you wanna know something. I don't care.Putting absolute stupidness and unbelievable selfishness does not make a good comedy. Just a cruel offensive disrespectful and horrendous piece of crap.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 'King of Queens' is your basic simplistic American sitcom. A few corny jokes here and there stupid situations and your typical formulaic character arrangement. The show is basically about Doug Kevin James a crude fat delivery guy who is your typical pretentious chauvinist a staple of male characters in American sitcoms these days. Ray Romano 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and Hank Hill 'King of the Hill' are similar types. He is the selfindulgent kind of guy who lives according to the assumptions of what a guy is supposed to do. He shares a house in Queens with annoying and sometimes temperamental wife Carrie Leah Remini. She is the typical wife character similar to the wife on 'Everybody Loves Raymond' only Carrie is funny which is not surprising since they're both on CBS. She is the staple of sitcom wives especially CBS and ABC sitcoms as the guiding figure who tries to get her impulsive stupid husband to see the err in his ways. A more sophisticated version of 'Home Improvement.' To be fair these shows often portray the husband as the idiot and the wife as the allknowing figure and as such the husband comes off funny and the wife just comes off as painstakingly annoying.The other characters in the show is the terrific Jerry Stiller who deserves better material perhaps the more interesting subject of the show as the fatherinlaw. He often has some really oddball ideas some of which tend to get Doug in trouble with his wife. Then like all of these sitcoms of it's kind there are Doug's stupid friends who are so miserably stupid it's often a pain to watch them. Darhma and Greg had this kind of character on the show the man's man guy who worked with Greg at the law firm. At least Darhma's friend were weird but they were funny and not so completely brain dead. Basically 'King of Queens' makes your male characters to be complete and utter idiots and the situations aren't so funny as realizing how stupid these people are. And what do you know they've become pop culture icons? It's no surprise really.'King of Queens' is not all that funny. The jokes are pretty stupid. But Doug as one of those man's man types who have to double check with the book on how men are supposed to behave in order to avoid all appearances of giving in to the woman or worse probably being accused of being homosexual. And it happens with the slightest most stupid things too like how a person stands or what kind of things they may stand next too. Shallow characters are pretty much all that invade our sitcoms anymore and is likely more reflective of American culture overall. Would this and other shows like it be so popular if it weren't? Doug and Carrie and the relationship with the fatherinlaw and friends hardly seem normal. Like the characters of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' where none of the family members seem to be able to tolerate one another it's a wonder why Doug and Carrie would even want to be married to each other. They often seem quite intolerant of each other's habits and so forth at least before the final credits call. The jokes are stupid the characters are formulaic and the entire show is just ridiculous. American sitcoms should the networks decide to put money in anything than worthless reality TV shows are in desperate need of good material. King of Queens just ain't cutting it.".

You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing beautiful voice and the owner does a priceless double take. Nicely done! For some reason I have never forgotten that scene.The Karen Carpenter Story chronicles the meteoric rise of the Carpenters and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. A lot of things are glossed over. This isn't a documentary and the movie left me with a lot of questions. Very little is mentioned of Karen's solo venture the CD was released only a few years ago. If you buy it you will wonder why they waited. It's some of Karen's best work. The songs aren't as timeless as her work with brother Richard but it was a great recording in my opinion.I have heard it said that you can be listening to a cheap timeworn little radio in the middle of the Third World that would seem to produce more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song comes on the radio you would think you were listening to a 1000 HiFidelity unit.Watch this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been a lot of opinions expressed as to the crux of Karen's problems. Certainly the eating disorder was a result and not a cause of the talented singer's anxiety.The controlling mother need for romantic love and career stresses all undoubtedly played a part. However my feeling is that the act of moving Karen from her drums to the center stage mike was the real trigger.The young musician felt comfortable and natural behind the drums. It was where she really belonged despite professional dictates. A drummer's always a drummer at heart sitting behind those traps and wielding those sticks. Her singing emanated from and was intertwined with the drumming and not an isolated entity.The move to center stage and abandoning her trap set was the beginning of Karen's downfall. The move robbed her of her base grounding and natural habitat. It threw off her balance and began her downward spiral to a rash of personal problems.Seems like a small thing yet my feeling is that had Karen remained behind those drums singing her songs she might still be with us today.The TV movie includes lots of great Carpenter hits and includes the contribution of her protg brother Richard who currently in 2006 is alive and doing well in California.".

It threw off her balance and began her downward spiral to a rash of personal problems.Seems like a small thing yet my feeling is that had Karen remained behind those drums singing her songs she might still be with us today.The TV movie includes lots of great Carpenter hits and includes the contribution of her protg brother Richard who currently in 2006 is alive and doing well in California.";

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter nor Richard for that matter so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However from what I did see and learn of Karen I felt her pain share her sadness and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music. I remember the song about the Radio every sha la la la every whoa...so fine etc and I remember We've only just begun! As a matter of fact I memorized many many of her songs and some people quite a few tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her!!!  I am not joking on this. I also used to be anorexic during high school and part of college 19781987 to be exact and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to eventually 120 pounds in 1987. I developed some pretty serious health problems from that which helped me to identify with the actress portraying Karen in the movie. The mother Agnes was very MUCH like my mother in many ways and I could also feel the pain that Karen must have experienced. For my mother was often unfeeling critical and disapproving as Agnes was if this was true to accuracy. The movie was helpful in identifying and getting to know Karen on a more personal note by not just hearing her music but by seeing what she was going through. It is quite difficult to portray a person's entire life in 23 hours and recount every single detail perfectly so I would have to say that there is probably no biography that is that accurate. I will give this story an 8 though! I wish I did know Karen personally! I would have DIED to meet her!! I would have loved to have shook her hand given her a hug or talked to her. I feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed.".

This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.

In the reading I have done about the disease especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book Starving for Attention anorexia appears to be a disease of control. Karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control. She felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life. Don't get me wrong I believed she truly loved the music but she felt she had little control over her career. She truly loved her family but they did not express it well and she didn't know how to make her family understand her. The film could have touched so much more on that.

I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's  and being a childteen singing these songs and learning music  the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman. I never got to she died three weeks before that was to happen. And yes that did effect me for I knew nothing of anorexia  and could not understand completely what happened.When this TV movie got produced I got quite an understanding. Maybe not everything in Karen and Richard's life is open to the television audience but in opening the parts that were shown I got to understand much from the music industry of that time. What upsets me is that I am writing of that time and seeing now. No one has learned a darned thing even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a family's problems in the music industry.These films aren't done for fun they're done to open a door and show us something. Here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight. She was fine. Didn't know it. She got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looksweight than the talent within. With the onset of MTV it got worse. With 'American Idol' it's like a puss festering in an English accent.A wonderful TV film I am sure later someone may give it an HBO treatment but either way many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent.".

She was outgoing and friendly. She had lots of friends especially Olive NewtonJohn. The movie doesn't even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy Karen. Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York she did see a psychologist but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. Also Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid so she could loss weight but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. Also the Karen's husband in the movie is named Bob Knight but in real life was named Tom Burris. Also Karen wasn't divorced from Tom but only separated. Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. Also Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it.".

Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses I thought the movie portrayed Agnes their mother as being terrible.I did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier I thought the metaphor sotospeak there was rather effective. When the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving which is probably the wrong word as well.Overall I feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly quirky sideher genuine personality. Even as the focus of the film there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia though of course no one can really know and almost made it seem baseless. The film was more poorsingerwithanorexia than Karen Carpenter's story in my opinion.I would assume that they changed her husband's nameprofession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him there were some bad terms there but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. On this note I can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.On the whole it ends up as a lowbudget madeforTV movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karen's disease.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film a number of times now and although it has major faults it really is the music and the unique beauty of Karen's voice that steals this film. The soundtrack as you would expect is breathtaking. I loved The Carpenter music and both Karen and Richard were so far ahead of their time that to lose her at such a young age was such a tragedy.It begins with Karen's death. Bringing the harsh reality and reminder that this doesn't end well. It then moves into Karen at 13 and Ruchard 16 i believe. It tells the story of how Richard was supposedly the family favourite and he will become a star with Karen seemingly brushed aside by the family. The family plays a part in both of their future illnesses of both i believe. By Richard's Mum giving him the sleeping pills that he became addicted to throughout the film and the old fashioned way that it is portrayed that the Mother just never said I love you. Yuu really have to see this film to see how profound this possibly or even must've affected Karen.It is interesting in hindsight to read that Richard Carpenter who had major involvement in the this and the music side of the film says he hates it now. He is quoted in the notes of the 35th anniversary CD that most of the dialogue is fictitious. He also states a number of inaccuracies. Apparently both Karen and Richard never collapsed in real life. Equally the scene at the end when Karen's Mother finally says I Love you never happened. It was put in to give the film a happy ending despite was death following. Putting these things aside though it is a film worth watching.Cynthia Gibb plays Karen well. She comes across as a sweet naive yet troubled girl who seems to be innocent through out the film. Of course her anorexia comes from peer pressure being in the public eye and the fact that Karen never believed she was good enough for her parents. Though once again i always thought the chubby little sister quote was true. However after research is was actually Richard that was quoted as chubby.I must say that it really is a lovely film if you can call it that considering how it ends up. Their story is so wonderful from early talent show wins through to songs at the top of the charts. So many of the original songs are here. When Cynthia sings the opening line of All of my life but out of key and then Richard changes it i defy you to not have your breath taken away by Karen's stunning vocals kicking in.The film also tells the story of their demons. As already mentioned Richard's addiction to sleeping pills and of course Karens battle with anorexia and bulimia. It is tough to watch at times as we all know this all albeit with the unreal buts put in really happened. It is quite a short film and it does skirt over things very quickly at times. For instance Karen's marriage and subsequent divorce is played out within five minutes. Though once again i urge you to find a better use of a song when Masquarade is used over these moments.Remembering that this is based upon what really happened and taking into consideration as stated how Richard feels about this film it still is a good watch. Cynthia Gib is so wonderful that at times it is hard to picture her not being Karen she really does play it that well. The already mentioned end scene with her Mother telling her she loves her is really beautiful even if again it didn't happen.The film also gives the impression that Karen did not record any solo material. She recorded a solo album in 1979 though it was not released until 1996.I am by no means slating the film for the inaccuracies. I adored The Carpenters and still listen to then to this day. It is a shame that so called biopics have to change the facts so readily and thus making those facts go into the public domain.Having said that this is a wonderful film to watch. At this stage it has never been released on DVD or VHS. if you see it listed in your television guides catch it. Enjoy the beautiful vocal tones of Richard and Karen maybe even add some of their albums to your collection.".

Of course her anorexia comes from peer pressure being in the public eye and the fact that Karen never believed she was good enough for her parents. Though once again i always thought the chubby little sister quote was true. However after research is was actually Richard that was quoted as chubby.I must say that it really is a lovely film if you can call it that considering how it ends up. Their story is so wonderful from early talent show wins through to songs at the top of the charts. So many of the original songs are here. When Cynthia sings the opening line of All of my life but out of key and then Richard changes it i defy you to not have your breath taken away by Karen's stunning vocals kicking in.The film also tells the story of their demons. As already mentioned Richard's addiction to sleeping pills and of course Karens battle with anorexia and bulimia. It is tough to watch at times as we all know this all albeit with the unreal buts put in really happened. It is quite a short film and it does skirt over things very quickly at times. For instance Karen's marriage and subsequent divorce is played out within five minutes. Though once again i urge you to find a better use of a song when Masquarade is used over these moments.Remembering that this is based upon what really happened and taking into consideration as stated how Richard feels about this film it still is a good watch. Cynthia Gib is so wonderful that at times it is hard to picture her not being Karen she really does play it that well. The already mentioned end scene with her Mother telling her she loves her is really beautiful even if again it didn't happen.The film also gives the impression that Karen did not record any solo material. She recorded a solo album in 1979 though it was not released until 1996.I am by no means slating the film for the inaccuracies. I adored The Carpenters and still listen to then to this day. It is a shame that so called biopics have to change the facts so readily and thus making those facts go into the public domain.Having said that this is a wonderful film to watch. At this stage it has never been released on DVD or VHS. if you see it listed in your television guides catch it. Enjoy the beautiful vocal tones of Richard and Karen maybe even add some of their albums to your collection.";

All of this said there is probably another non madeforTV movie waiting to be made about The Carpenters who really defied their era the early '70s with their wholesome sounds but were caught up in the topsyturvy world of rock as seen in this movie anyway.  And their relationship with their parents was a little unusual.  Karen's death was tragic and the movie tastefully recreates it.  As for the actors Cynthia Gibb was wonderful and really made the movie.  Louise Fletcher just can't seem to get Nurse Ratched out of her system even though she played the allAmerican adoring mother she was icy at times especially in her inability to communicate.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie back in 1994 or '95 during my freshman year in high school when it was on Lifetime. After I first saw it I thought it was wonderful. Sure it may not have run longer but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion regardless of what anyone else may think. Cynthia Gibb was great at portraying Karen and Mitchell Anderson was okay as Richard. Louise Fletcher Yes who played Nurse Ratched in 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was fine as well but I found her version of Agnes Karen and Richard's mother to be a little bit of a control freak. I am an EXTREMELY HUGE fan of the Carpenters and I believe that Karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. It really saddens me about the fact that she is gone and had left this earth too soon but thanks to the never ending popularity of her music and her angelic voice the music will live on. Anyway back on track to this movie it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people fans and nonfans of the Carpenters as to what caused Karen to end up getting this problem with her health. Was it the media that was responsible or was it just Karen's decision? I would not believe that it was her decision. It could have been the media from one article that was printed out about her somewhere in '70 when their hit Close to You came out from what was shown in the film. There are some other moments in the movie as well. Richard's struggle with drugs and Karen's brief marriage. I did not hear about her loss in February of 1983 as I was not yet into watching the news I had found out years later. I don't know if there will be another movie about the Carpenters or Karen made in the future but until then this movie will do fine. I will say this though If Karen had disregarded the false details of that article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling her chubby which must have been quite an insult she would still be here on this earth today. I know that she is in Heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you Karen!!".

Rahul Bose though appears in a much shorter duration of the film does a perfect job as Meethi's love interest Joydeep. There are also fine performances by Dhritiman Chatterjee and Waheeda Rehman.There are three minor drawbacks of this film if I'm at all to discuss them. One is screenplay.

Every time I paid attention to the background music it appeared as if some horror film is going on... even during Joy and Meethi's wedding. And three is the ending.I heard many people who think that the ending is highly influenced by a famous scene in the film Finding Neverland. I don't argue with them... in fact in a way they are quite right. I can only say that though the 'presenting fashion' of this ending is indeed similar to that scene the substances of the two are hardly comparable as these two are completely different kinds of films.

	schema:headline " A very courageous exploration of perception and reality. Oscar worthy!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a multifaceted insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient their and our perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman the story delightfully flirts with physics medicine religion and even politics as it questions our perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us. Within that world she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent not the gibberish that they seem to us in our world.Here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie don't worry these are not spoilers. I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witchdoctor ojha in Hindi performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the ghosts sitting in Mithi's brain. The doctor prescribing shocktreatment as a solution that is believed to work Windows of perception  The scene about the review of Anu's book. The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for maya. News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is no doubt in his mind that there are WMD in Iraq now that is not as much about Bush's perception who I suspect knew the truth as the gullible public's perception about WMD in Iraq.One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu Charu sent this man to beat me and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash.Aparna Sen was bold but not bold enough to pose one big question Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about normal healthy people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history The ritualexorcism scene doesn't go far enough. That would be the ultimate question What is normal? Who's reality is right the Believer's or the Atheist's?IMHO this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than A Beautiful Mind. It looks at the minds of not just the sick person but also the healthy and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world. If the former got 4 Oscars this deserves more  At least one each for story screenplay direction Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was truly a treat to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. This was a story very welltold indeed.".

I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witchdoctor ojha in Hindi performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the ghosts sitting in Mithi's brain. The doctor prescribing shocktreatment as a solution that is believed to work Windows of perception  The scene about the review of Anu's book. The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for maya. News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is no doubt in his mind that there are WMD in Iraq now that is not as much about Bush's perception who I suspect knew the truth as the gullible public's perception about WMD in Iraq.One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu Charu sent this man to beat me and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash.Aparna Sen was bold but not bold enough to pose one big question Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about normal healthy people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history The ritualexorcism scene doesn't go far enough. That would be the ultimate question What is normal? Who's reality is right the Believer's or the Atheist's?IMHO this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than A Beautiful Mind. It looks at the minds of not just the sick person but also the healthy and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world. If the former got 4 Oscars this deserves more  At least one each for story screenplay direction Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was truly a treat to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. This was a story very welltold indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "15 Park Avenue well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'. Its an unending search within each of one of us...The powerhouse performance from Shabana Azmi is a treat to watch. Her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene. Indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because I expected it to be all the way Konkona Sen's terrain. Shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. She burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister  who is more like a daughter to her  and an aging mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. As for the leading actress from Guide  that's how I can recall her instantly  there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there. Ever dependable Rahul Bose plays another pivotal role in the film he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection. This man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr.  Mrs. Iyer and so many others. He is one versatile I really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well. The cameo in the movie is by Shefali Shah remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding. She looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease. She gives you a glimpse of today's Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's prior relationships. The focus of camera has been Meethi portrayed by Konkona. She and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of 15 Park Avenue. She has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience. The fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful. The movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today's modern India and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family. And I believe Aparna has succeeded to certain extent. The helplessness of Meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of. Well after I finished 15 Park Avenue there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me. I wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally. It has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups. Must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema something with a strong purpose.".

The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual. She plays the dominating and fiercely independent elder sister of Mithi who takes care of her ailing sister and aging mother. She refuses to accept that inspite of all her strength and courage she still feels lonely at times. This should have been a very easy movie for Rahul Bose. The role was least bit demanding and anyone could have done the role.The ending of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park avenue experience. It took me a while to digest that the movie had ended. It left me confused and maybe even a bit disturbed. But later on it started sinking in. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they are blue will I still believe that its black??!".

Konkona Sen Sharma is without any doubt the most talented actress of today's generation. Her portrayal of the schizophrenic Meethi is so realistic more so than that of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind. Shabana Azmi is always dependable and here too she is fantastic as is Waheeda Rehman who plays the helpless mother Rahul Bose and Shefali Shah. The film takes place in India and Bhutan and the cinematography adds more to the mysteriousness of the world these characters live in. The film is open to interpretation and I have my own but I won't mention it as you should have your own view. I strongly recommend all to watch this wonderful movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEAD 15 PARK AVENUE My Humble take on this film Now for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine niche films like 15 Park Avenue ought to be palatable to my sensibilities. With this thought and a mild sense of embarrassment that I hadn't watched the complete film earlier I watched this film last Saturday. There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive David Lynch from which this film borrows at least 3 concepts a That at least some truths are relative b The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In both cases the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film c The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch notice carefully the disheveled long hair the effect of the beggar woman in 15 PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which 15 PA also borrows is Blow Up especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the end of Antonioni's masterpiece. Of course the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind A Beautiful mind. Although admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and Shabana who professes it inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those very prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the movie some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences the sisters are alike too. Both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships one out of choice and the other out of nature. So Mithi's pain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with either KunalDhritiman or Sanjeev Kanwaljeet. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways Hypothesis 1 It was Shabana all along There is a certain section of the audience who think so. But that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing Mithi along with her Hypothesis 2 There WAS a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor This POV says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film when in response to a statement by Joy Rahul Bose that Mithi is looking for something that she will never find his wife Laxmi Shefali Shah philosophizes that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia the end of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment There are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by our knowledgeable audience like Hypothesis 3 Shabana and Konkona are alter egos of the same person Hypothesis 4 Shabana too is a figment of Mithi's imagination Hypothesis 5 The old haggard perhaps mad beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story Are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? Well your guess is as good as mine Why 15 Park Avenue? Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the Park Avenue in NY I believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. Remember her stating Jo Jo's profession as Prime minister of Shikakai which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing Shampoos. The prefix '15' is used as it was on 15th December that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after his walkout she remains forever in a time warp. The film has its fair share of flaws lack of use of a strong background score which in films like these can really augment the narrative some sloppy dialogs unabated by some forced dialog delivery. Inconsistent performances Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. I give it 710 as it made me think but not any higher than that because I can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced and for the most part thoroughly enjoyed those previously I have already thought on similar lines earlier. So the experience post 15 PA is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. Where am I coming from? I gave 9.510 to '36 Chowringhee Lane' though rumors still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it 7.5 to 'Paromiter Ek Din' 7 to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and 5 to 'Paroma'. On an existential level it failed to invoke my interest not even as much as say a 'Truman Show'".

Shabhana Azmi as usual has done a riveting performance to be remembered as the sister who sacrificed her life for Mithi.The movie might not be your usual Hindi potboiler but can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a different light altogether.As usual Aparna Sen brings the movie to a different ending rather than any clichd ones we might think off.

I would have given a 10 to this movie if not for the ending which seemed pretty pointless. Without letting in on the ending I must say that I do not see the point of having an ending which forces the viewers to try and understand what actually happened in a movie..15 park avenue ended up being a movie like that. I would not call such an ending intellectual just plain lack of insight on the part of the director or whoever was responsible for the ending to realize that the audience would like to know everything when seeing with a movie that deals with such a sensitive topic. That said Shabana AazmiRahul Bose Konkana Sen and Wahida Rehman are a delight to watch in the movie. Acting can never be an issue in a movie with Shabana Aazmi and Rahul Bose.

The resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manicdepressive psychosis in addition to her schizophrenia. She careens out of control over the years progressively getting worse and sinking deeper into her private 'world'.The juxtaposition of an 'unsettled' divorced elder sister and how her domineering ways make an already bad situation worse is indicative of what a fine line there is between abnormal and seemingly normal. Ms Sen also makes an excellent commentary on the social alienation of such individuals. Social rehab is standard therapy along with all the deadly mindaltering drugs. But what about the poor and the destitute who're always left to fend for themselves and usually fall by the wayside?The romantic connection between Dr Kunal and Anu was unnecessary. Also the cafeteria scene where Dr Kunal explains to Anu how real their world really is to them was redundant. Anu should already know all that. The English dialog is a bit awkward at times though the acting compensates for that. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is every bit worth it. Waheeda Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. Extensive research seems to have been done about this illness its very evident. But its not clear if MDP can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient sidebyside. Also in the early part Dr Kunal recommends E.C.T shock therapy while invalidating the fact that it doesn't work for schizophrenics only for extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder.The ending of the remarkable story is suggestive of an unknown solution maybe no solution. The movie could have ended on a nicer note since worldwide the mentally ill can and do lead balanced and fruitful if not very fulfilling lives under good medical care.Nonetheless its an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject.

The fact that it was shot entirely in English is also quite a mystery because it automatically makes much of it look unnatural. That said the film is very entertaining very slick in terms of cinematography and production and brilliantly acted. Needless to say it is Konkona Sen Sharma who steals the thunder. Sharma dazzles as Meethie erasing everything she is and disappearing into the role to deliver a disturbingly convincing performance which is one of the most impressive of our times. She is just mindblowing dominating her scenes with amazing intensity and wavering between comic and entertaining and moving and unsettling. It's sad that such a brilliant act was hardly noticed. Waheeda Rehman is as good as one would imagine her be but Shabana Azmi and I can't believe I'm saying this is probably the weakest link. This is one of her least impressive performances and much of it might be due to the English dialogue which took its toll on one of the greatest actresses of Indian cinema. She often seems to be too cerebral too thoughtful and as a result not very relatable. Rahul Bose and Shefali Shah provide good support. 15 Park Avenue is an interesting and well made picture which could have been better but the performance of Sen Sharma makes up for many of its flaws.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewed at the River to River Indian film festival Firenze December 2005. The title of Aparna Sen's latest film 15 Park Avenue is an oblique reference to that most exclusive of New York streets where many of the wealthiest people in America used to have their private residences. Meethi an attractive young woman who can be very charming and appealing in her lucid moments suffers from extreme delusions and has been diagnosed as incurably schizophrenic although for a time she was engaged to a sincere young man whom she called Jojo. Jojo was aware of her condition but deeply in love however when her spells became too traumatic the wedding was called off and he married another woman. Meetha has always been under the care of her much older intellectual and domineering sister Anjali. Anjali herself a very attractive divorced woman of a certain age supports the family herself her sister and their aged mother by lecturing on Nuclear Physics and Quantum Mechanics at the local university  a nice touch attesting to India's highly advanced state in the theoretical sciences of which there is precious little awareness in the Western world. A middleaged academic colleague of hers keeps throwing himself at her feet but Anjali has become much more interested in the whitehaired psychiatrist Kuman who has been called in as a consultant on Meethi's difficult case and is more of an intellectual challenge to her. This is also a tricky relationship because Kuman is still committed to his own marriage though obviously interested in the still very attractive quantum professorial Anjali. To complicate matters even more Jojo who has been out of the picture for years with wife and young children suddenly reappears to share in Meethi's delusionary world which has long been centered on the fixation of being happily married to him and living a number Fifteen Park Avenue in Bombay  an address which doesn't exist except in her feverish mind  During this chance meeting at a Himalayan mountain resort Mheeti fails to recognize him as her longlost Jojo but accepts his complicity in her dream world as she feels that everyone else is against her. In the strangely mystical ending of the address on the Monopoly board which is mistakenly mentioned as Park Avenue at several points in the film ...There is actually much more to this picture than the cursory plot summary above might indicate for the insights it provides into the lives of the contemporary Indian intelligentsia as well as for the depiction of the constant battle between cold rationalism and subjective emotionalism which is a leit motif throughout the film. The dialogue especially in the first half of the picture may sound excessively stiff and unreal to Western ears but apparently this is the way westernized Indian intellectuals talk. Moreover the Freudian analyses which take up much of the second half of the film sound like a throwback to Hollywood movies of the forties when Freud was all the thing  and makes it seem like the Indians of today are just now catching up on long overbaked Western psychology ... However  and it is a big however  whatever the trivialities of the plot from a jaded western point of view it is the personalities of the players the excellence of the acting and the humanitarian warmth throughout which makes all else secondary. There are really two if not three central figures 1 Meethi the disturbed young lady as portrayed by Konkona Sensharma a talented actress who happens to be the daughter of director Aparna Sen 2 the charismatic Shabana Azmi  who portrays the older protective sister and is one of India's leading older movie stars  to see her is to understand why and 3 Jojo  the longlost lover with an overweaning sense of responsibility played by now 40 year old actor Rahul Bose a favourite leading man of the director's and an unforgettable presence of every film he's in. Whether a striking piece of work like this will ever be seen outside of festivals is an open question however it seems to me that an enterprising American distributor could do very well with this pic because it has universal appeal and universally appealing performers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Indian FILM  APRIL 18 2014 APARNA SEN'S 15 PARK AVE.15 PARK AVENUE REVIEWED AT FLORENCE Indian FILM FESTIVAL 2005 by ALEX DELEON alexfarbahotmail.com This review originally written for Amazon on Line The title of Aparna Sen's latest film 15 PARK AVENUE is an oblique reference to that most exclusive of New York streets where many of the wealthiest people in America used to have their private residences. Meethi Konkana Sen an attractive young woman who can be very charming and appealing in her lucid moments suffers from extreme delusions and has been diagnosed as incurably schizophrenic although for a time she was engaged to a sincere young man whom she called Jojo. Jojo Rahul Bose was aware of her condition but deeply in love however when her spells became too traumatic the wedding was called off and he married another woman. Meethi has always been under the care of her much older intellectual and domineering sister Anjali SHABANA AZMI. Anjali herself a very attractive divorced woman of a certain age supports the family consisting of herself her sister and their aged mother Waheda Rehman by lecturing on Nuclear Physics and Quantum Mechanics !! at the local university  a nice touch attesting to India's highly advanced state in the theoretical sciences of which there is precious little awareness in the Western world. A middleaged academic colleague of hers keeps throwing himself at her feet but Anjali has become much more interested in the whitehaired psychiatrist Kuman who has been called in as a consultant on Meethi's difficult case and is more of an intellectual challenge to her. This is also a tricky relationship because Kuman is still committed to his own marriage though obviously interested in the still very attractive quantum professorial Anjali. To complicate matters even more Jojo who has been out of the picture for years with wife and young children suddenly reappears to share in Meethi's delusionary world which has long been centered on the fixation of being happily married to him and living at number Fifteen Park Avenue in Bombay  an address which doesn't exist except in her feverish mind  During this chance meeting at a Himalayan mountain resort Meethi fails to recognize him as her longlost Jojo but accepts his complicity in her dream world as she feels that everyone else is against her. In the strangely mystical ending Meethi steps out of this world into the perfect world at the nonexistent address 15 Park Avenue where she is joined by her loving husband and a gaggle of joyful kids  but bear in mind that the Monopoly board location which is mistakenly mentioned as Park Avenue at several points in the film is actually Park Place! There is much more to this picture than the cursory plot summary above might indicate for the insights it provides into the lives of the contemporary Indian intelligentsia as well as for the depiction of the constant battle between cold rationalism and subjective emotionalism which is a leit motif throughout the film. The dialog especially in the first half of the picture may sound excessively stiff and unreal to Western ears but apparently this is the way westernized Indian intellectuals actually talk. Moreover the Freudian analyses which take up much of the second half of the film sound like a throwback to Hollywood movies of the forties when Freud was all the thing  and makes it seem like the Indians of today are just now catching up on long overbaked Western psychology  However  and it is a big however  whatever the trivialities of the plot from a jaded western point of view it is the personalities of the players the excellence of the acting and the humanitarian warmth throughout which makes all else secondary.

	schema:reviewBody "Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue is a film about nature of reality. A young delusional girl prone to imagining things and hearing voices possibly out of sheer boredom is taken to be schizophrenic by her educated father and controlfreak educated elder stepsister. Controlled pitied and treated like an invalid even if out of love and affection she has ghost of a chance to develop as a normal person. When a boy offers to marry her her father and stepsister passionately try to convince him against taking such a step. A traumatic experience caused primarily due to her sheltered existence finally takes her across the line of no return and she lives full time in a delusional world of her own. The family and society around her are intolerant of her delusionsand want to suppress them with medicines electric shock therapy anything even though they all have delusions of one kind or other of their own. Her mother doesn't see the irony in allowing a ghostbuster to treat her of the delusions. Her stepsister is a professor of Physics teaching among other things Quantum Mechanics a subject in which a stream of experts accept parallel multiuniverses and many more dimensions in space than the 3 we see. A friend recounts with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming to hear hallucinatory voices. Far away George W Bush has real or fake delusions of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction and is allowed to invade Iraq. As some viewers have already pointed out Aparna Sen shied away from attacking the mother of all delusions mainstream religions which is a pity. In other words accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believe in. That's been the case since the beginning and lot more powerful people than Mithali in the film among them Bruno and Galileo have suffered as a consequence. The film's controversial and difficult ending was necessary to show it's a film about nature of reality and not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. All the cast have given great performances but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma have excelled. Aparna Sen has produced an outstanding philosophical film.".

An Indian Army Officer's wife Waheeda Reheman was already a mother of 2 kids  a son and a daughter Shabana Azmi as Anjali  when her husband dies. She decides to marry again  with her husband's friend Sunil Soumitra and because she is a typical Indian woman  takes it her responsibility to beget her new husband a child !!So when her daughter Shabana Azmi is already 18 she gives birth to Mitali Konkona Sen  which also means she must have already crossed the age of 40 when she delivers Mitali ! 2. Now science has already discovered that after 30  there are high chances of the birth of an abnormal child suffering from Idiocy or other genetic disorders since the ovum begins to disintegrate after a certain age in women  children are less immune and more prone to diseases !Moreover pregnancy problems and other related tensions  headaches are too much of a torture as one grows older ! Such symptoms creeps in the child  invariable and definitely  and this is what exactly happens to their last born child  Mitali ! 3. She is a quiet child  she is shy and ashamed to play with other kids  who must be having younger looking parents and moreover some servant had told her that the ones she addresses as brother  sister are not her own  all this makes her an unconfident  secluded child who likes to remain alone and aloof with her own thoughts. She is diagnosed as a patient of Schizophrenia and epilepsy and given medicines to keep her normal . 4. Somehow she grows up and behaves normally  singing with friends doing facials  manicure pedicure all symptoms of normal life for a girl and also falls in love. She could not stay in one job for a longer period of time but once she joined as a reporter  her lover suggested her to stick to the job. Just to prove him her worth she sticks to the job and even agrees to go alone to a BengalBihar border to shoot and interview some thugs. The thugs rape her for 3 continuous hours and leave her bleeding in the corridor of the hotel ! Her life changes from hereafter  well anyone's life would have changed after the gory rape that happened to her. Her engagement breaks off and she becomes more lonelier and starts imagining and counseling herself of her good life  with husband  children. Often they show her looking at mad people on the streets and the mad people kind of acknowledged her state  behavior as if they understood her realm probably they also belonged to the same state as hers. 5. Her step sister Shabana is shown as a very practical and sacrificing and responsible woman but no one really understands her. She refuses to have any good time but takes on the responsibility of the aged mother along with her insane sister  all this she was basically doing thanklessly as the sister believed that she makes her do the household chores etc. and is not letting her enjoy life !She lets go of her handsome boyfriend Kanwaljeet and even agrees to go for an older  not at all looking looking doctor just with the hope that a doctor in the family can be of some help after all !The brother  is as usual  shown as a typical Indian thankless  selfish  irresponsible man  happy to be with his wife and children and not bothering about his aging mother or his sister ! 6. In the last scene Mitali's ex boyfriend meets her again after 11 years and tries to help her out to find an imaginary house for her  the number being 15 Park avenue  Mitali is seen entering a house numbered as 15  but not Park Avenue and finds all her imaginary characters there and is very happy to see them all there  along with her husband  her ex boyfriend actually who she fails to recognize in real life  and happily leaves with them  basically goes with them  and in reality just vanishes from the scene  and the rest of her relatives are shown searching for her. Probably she will join the league of other mad people who are often seen on the streets talking to themselves or other imaginary characters !! 7. If the rape episode had'nt happened to her  she would not have become that mad... but would have survived on medicines  therefore it is highly recommended that Ladies should not take up such jobs as reporters and go alone in places inhabited by thugs ! Parents should be more careful .".

	schema:headline " A guideline to understanding schizophrenia";
	schema:reviewBody "As everyone knows by now 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her halfsister.The manifestation of Schizophrenia is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored. There are also those who however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence. I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for 15 Park Avenue. She has done a good turn not only to the general public but also to those who deal with schizophrenics ... relatives social workers psychoanalysts. The film actually helps in dispelling a lot of myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I'm told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her who suffers from this mental affliction. To that effect I'm sure that none of what has been shown is blown out of proportion ... on the contrary it is a true representation of facts.The performances are good on the whole as can be expected. Konkona Sen Sharma Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose are very good indeed. They emerge as very real characters ... credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times. People may think me terribly queer but I think there are moments when one can identify with Meethi as well! I suppose all of us have a streak of insanity inside us .... perhaps some more than others. These are the people who are singled out. After all don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? Impossible ones at times? Would we be dubbed as being off our rockers if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds? Would a person with low selfesteem be considered a schizophrenic because heshe shuns company ... preferring instead to live in a world of hisher own because that's the only space where there is a sense of security?Konkona as Meethi is outstanding!! Her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part. She has shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting! A case in point is the part where she's distressed at the scene shown on TV of Saddam Hussein's arrest. Her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ...as if she's really heartbroken at this tragedy! Her brand of Indian English too is so spontaneous and natural. However the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman splendid actors both seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in English. Their diction is less than perfect ... stilted and affected the fact that they are making a supreme effort becomes more than apparent. Their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the tale.The brutal rape of Meethi Konkona seems somewhat unnecessary. Any other incident would have sufficed just as well I feel. The point here is that something triggers off the extreme manifestation of the illness. As the psychiatrist explains one cannot with any modicum of conviction or certainty say that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia to the fore. Then why are we subjected to the scene where Meethi lies bleeding and unconscious. Was Ms. Sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power?? If so then the scene of the rape is warranted but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film.The ending seems somewhat abrupt. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where does Meethi disappear to? Does Ms. Sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and hence credible holds true? In other words is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity? I'm not very sure.A thoughtprovoking film on the whole and well worth watching. However IF you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... everything cut and dried with a watertight solution to each issue that comes up ... this film is clearly not meant for you!".

	schema:headline " An intellectually and emotionally stimulating movie";
	schema:reviewBody "From 36 Chowringhee Lane to 15 Park Avenue Aparna Sen has indeed traveled a long way. If the first one goes down in history as a dbutant's clean sweep the latter will definitely carve a special place as a mature film. Until you see 15 Park Avenue you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time. Thrilled to see the director's ingenuity and agility in portraying seriously challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity echoing throughout the film. It is not a movie that merely makes you feel 'tchh tchh how difficult life must be for schizophrenics' but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe. Sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we all are in some way or other trying to live in a makebelieve world of our own trying to run after mirages called happiness peace contentment. Along with the depiction of a delusional mind Sen's magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain. The fact that at times we all lose calm break down make wrong choices be haunted by guilt behave selfishly and so on is captured with extreme adroitness by Sen. She showed the cruel dilemma which Shabana had to deal with all her life of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and kids for herself. And in the act of always being beside her sister always being a strong persona providing support making judgments and so on she unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen that her sister needed to bloom. Isn't this a very harsh truth that at times in an attempt to do the best for someone we strangle their assertiveness and end up hurting their selfesteem? Of course Konkona's and Shabana's acting deserves laurels as always because had the ingredients not been so good the dish could not have turned out to be so extraordinary. Aparna Sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave for some foodforthought . Bravo !".

	schema:headline " sterling performance by Shabana Azmi";
	schema:reviewBody "After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna senmostly in English. In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on reality. It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister Konkana Sen Sharma the daughter of Aparna Sen is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali Shabana Azmi . Mithee after her marriage with Jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children in 15 Park avenue in Kolkotta.there is no such address in Kolkottait seems there is one in New York and she is intense in her belief. It is almost like an intense religious belief. Ultimately what is reality? In one scene she tells Anjali if I tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor. The open ending reflects this reality. In a supposedly search for her home in park avenue Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is Mithee looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost. About this concept of reality I am reminded of another film of fifties called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit ? called Harry is always with him and he is always conversing with him. At the end even the doctor believes perhaps there is Harry. What is reality is it what the protagonist believes or what other believe Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with undercurrent of frustration. Konkana Sen Sharma gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic.Yet the film is not as tight as Mrs and Mr. Iyer. There appear to be some loose ends. And perhaps there are too many characters. Those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending here. But the ending befits the theme of the film.Yet another good film by Aparana sen.".

Kids can be cruel and soon he is dubbed with his not so flattering nick name by a group of youthful taunters chanting Nya nya your name's not McCloy it's Gerald McBoingBoing the Noise Making Boy! AT this point the Animation Team does an outstanding job in shifting the emotional gears in the young outcast from happy  carefree to isolated  lonely and finally to depression  despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding not even to his Mother and Father.A frighteningly fashioned dark scene involving a highly UPA stylized run away scene involving a Train and an equally stylized Snowfall brings Gerald right to the brink of absolute despair. But then he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young Gerald is wanted by the producer of some Radio Program to provide the sounds for the show down at the Studio.ONCE the premiere show is done with Gerald starring in the Sound Department he rides off in a huge Limousine which seems to have anticipated those Stretch Limos of our day to the cheers and admiration of his Classmates and the World.IT has been said that there are only so many plots and in that case this story is most likely a variation on The Ugly Duckling for after all a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness.NOTE United Productions of America or UPA for short was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of the Animated Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOINGBOING and several sequels and a TV Series but also the highly popular MR.

And I suppose the animation is not that incredibly amazing. But keep in mind this is 1950 making it one of the earliest if not the first Dr. Suess cartoon. And there is no denying the rhyme and story are quite original and clever.This is no Pixar or anything too deep. But worth checking out if you area fan of Dr. Suess because this story gets overlooked compared to the Grinch or Cat in the Hat.".

With story by Dr. Seuss and Bill Scott of Rocky and Bullwinkle fame this cartoon won the Oscar for best short subject animated for 1950.Some people seem to give this short a hard time. And I suppose the animation is not that incredibly amazing. But keep in mind this is 1950 making it one of the earliest if not the first Dr. Suess cartoon. And there is no denying the rhyme and story are quite original and clever.This is no Pixar or anything too deep. But worth checking out if you area fan of Dr. Suess because this story gets overlooked compared to the Grinch or Cat in the Hat.";

In 1951 MGM and Looney Toons were making some of their very best cartoonswith amazing animation exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then in the late 40s a new style of animation began to appear such as the Crusader Rabbit series on TVanimation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. Unfortunately Columbia Picture's cynical ploy worked!! Instead of the public hating the toons as they should have many accepted them and the Oscar people AMPAS actually gave this film the award for Best Animated Shortgiving legitimacy for an inferior product. Unfortunately in the dollars and sense world of Hollywood this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studiosresulting in rather crappy cartoons. Later it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. The cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. And for this tragedy I blame in part GERALD MCBOINGBOINGone of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. The story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying boingboing incessantly is a pain.".

The film tells the story of Bobby McBoing who never learns to speak and instead just makes various noises including boing over and over. His parents slowly begin to get upset because he can't speak normal words and after a while it's hard for them to know what to do when nothing but sounds come out of his mouth. This is a pretty interesting little short as it's clear they didn't spend too much money on the thing but at the same time there's a strong touch of imagination that makes it worth watching. The animation style is I guess what you'd call simple as there aren't any grand backgrounds beautiful images or rich colors. Instead the drawings are pretty simple and not particularly ground breaking but they are unique in their own way. I think the real key to this thing are the sound effects and how they use them to tell the story. The constant boing is charming in its own way but what's really funny are the train noises and various other ones that scare Gerald's father when he's shaving.".

Everyone from Cooper's righthand man Taft Henriksen to the mysterious Donovan Baker wants a piece of Knight. Meanwhile Detectives Duke Napier and Kincade Rossi are working the case and trying to get to the truth of this tangled web. But when Knight meets an attractive nurse named Laura Laurence things seem to be looking up for Mr. Knight...but in this complicated web of twists turns and constantly changing allegiances who can really tell? And who is going to commit the ultimate FELONY? David A. Prior known to action fans all over as the AIP guy here corrals an amazing Bmovie cast for this nonAIP outing. It was 1995 video stores were booming and with the right cast they had a place for Felony on their shelves. With Jeffrey Combs as the main character Ashley Laurence as the female lead and sidekick and Lance Henriksen with an impressive array of multicolored shirts that was just the beginning. We get Joe Don Baker with a triumphant introduction to his character with an alley rescue scene that is really a lot like the one in Ring of Steel also with Baker. Maybe rescuing people in alleys is his thing. And with his fringed jacket that he no doubt bought at the local buckskinnery he gives Seagal a run for his money. Then there's Napier playing a guy named Duke as he would right around the same time on The Critic and Leo Rossi doing his best southern accent. Add to that David Warner with a grenade launcher and a small role from Cory Everson and you have a recipe that raises Felony above the average dreck.Prior was surely going bigtime with this one indicated by not just the cast and the fact that it was released by New Line but also the level of stunt work with PMstyle carflipping and blowups. Cooper even kills off a lot of cops just like baddies do in PM movies. And of course there is the standard pewpew bullet shooting. He was aiming high and it works for the most part. At least it's betteracted than usual thanks to the experienced cast of familiar names. It's basically as dumb as an AIP movie and we mean that in the best possible way of course with plot holes so big Stephen Hawking has warned us all that they could potentially slow down the spacetime continuum. But this time Mr. Prior has more resources at his disposal than usual. There are even some interesting contemporary references like to the Tonya HardingNancy Kerrigan hoohah that everyone was talking about at the time. If only we could have heard David Warner utter the name Gillooly Felony would have shot up a few points.So go back to a time when strippers stripped to sleazy heavy metal presumably this is the song Dynamite by a band called Psychic Underground listed in the end credits and to a time when an array of Bmovie stars such as this could assemble for a project like this.".

	schema:headline " Bmovie with an allstar cast and a silly script....it's sort of likable if you're in the right mood";
	schema:reviewBody "'Felony' is a Bmovie. No doubt about it.Of course if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential. This film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably don't know their names. It's amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project almost like they decided to do a Bmovie actor reunion. The cast even includes a couple of really firstrate actors David Warner who most people will recognize from 'Titanic' although my favorite of his roles is Jack the Ripper in 'Time After Time' and Lance Henriksen who many will remember as Bishop in 'Aliens'. These two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films.However as impressive as this collection of actors is their talent is never fully manifested on the screen. The writers of 'Felony' spent a lot of money to assemble a dreamteam cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor the common denominator of all Bmovies a silly script.We start with a silly premise. The bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly why bother? In the time it takes them to track down the film crew a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet. The criminals don't seem to realize how futile their effort is and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem. Silly...but I suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie.Then there is the dialogue. It is at times silly at times clich and at times unbelievable...everything you have come to expect from a Bmovie. Of course I have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material. This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved Bmovie status quite deservedly one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts. However it's disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot. There's not much inspiration evident in these performances but then again it's an uninspiring script. Now I'll admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines but honestly even the very fine actors I mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the story.Speaking of the story...even if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy it still would not redeem 'Felony' from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how everything adds up. In an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing. I admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish. There was so much that was never explained that I felt extremely frustrated at the end. If you decide to watch it be prepared to be confused.I haven't even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie but I won't bother. The funny thing is that despite everything I've said I have to admit that I can't give 'Felony' 110 stars. Although I can't exactly put my finger on why I actually found this film to be somewhat likable. The silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it. Plus I really like some of these character actors and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents I still got a kick out of seeing them.Now I realize I have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer. It's entirely possible I have completely missed the point. It could be that the filmmakers' intention all along was to make a Bmovie. Maybe the silliness is all completely intentional. If that's the case and if I were to rate it on those terms I would have to say that 'Felony' is a classic in the genre of tongueincheek action flicks. Bmovie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film will get some chuckles from the script and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns explosions and chases.".

	schema:reviewBody "To begin to compare this film with its successor Alive is like comparing apples and oranges. This movie as well as Frank Marshall's Alive are both capable of telling the story of the 1972 crash of the Fairchild 571 and the Uruguayan Old Christians Rugby Team in the high cordillera of the Andes Mountains. I think somewhere if you amalgamate both movies one would get a reasonable representation of the truth of what happened that Christmas of 1972. Both are very good movies this one is particularly dark with the relationships between the principles at its center. Though the real names of the crash survivors are not used those who read the superbly poignant book by Piers Paul Read know who they are. One cannot help but be moved by the struggle and this film does not gloss over the element of cannibalism of this tragedy. It shouldn't. I am disturbed by the association some of the other commenters have made with some horror movies of the genre. This shouldn't be made out to be a horror movie. It's not that at all. It does have a heart. The scenes in which the father of one of the crash survivors goes all out to find his son is touching. I think it's perhaps the main thing that sticks out in my mind about this movie. That and the music. The vignette at the beginning and end of this movie is touching. The happiness of a group of young men enjoying being together as most of the Old Christians did considering they were from the same neighbourhoods and their families were so close to one another juxaposed against the tragedy of the end where we see the survivors rescued and the fate of some of the 44 passengers known to the world this movie does a pretty good job of showing the truth of what went on.Alive is not a bad movie. The fact that it had the sanction of the survivors and Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa served as technical advisors cannot be overlooked. Their attention to their plight lent a definite authority to the movie but in some cases incidents were manufactured to give a sense of dramatic license. What more did one need to make the story worse than it already was. Survive I feel was more pulled in less showy. Again considering the budget they didn't have for this movie the scenes that depicted the crash and the moments afterwards were pretty good for the time and budget. Marshall recreated the site of the crash and the crash with a lot of realism the Cadenos couldn't considering the budget restraints. To compare this movie with that of a Roger Corman schlock film is unfair. This movie still gets me everytime I see it...which hasn't been recently. The last time I saw this it was back in the eighties. With the advent of the infomercial there isn't much room on the dial for late night movies like this one. I'd love to see it again if not to tape it but to be able to correlate it to Alive. Both movies are not bad and this one isn't terrible. Give it a chance. It's worth at least one viewing. You just might think it's worth another.".

	schema:headline " Real human misery meets Mexican exploitation";
	schema:reviewBody "Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic Alive there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director Ren Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film Supervivientes de los Andes. The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellowpassengers. Of course you can't claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90's version but I definitely appreciate and respect this film more. After all an exploitation film demands a lot more input from both cast and crew while the bigbudgeted Marshall film although intense feels more like routine moneymaking. The sets and special effects naturally can't compete with Alive but Supervivientes... delivers an equally impressive sentiment of hopelessness and creates an even more nightmarish hell of snow. Cardona's film is ambitious surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions ever. I am really astonished that Cardona's take on this story isn't more exploitative and explicit. The scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and consumed are nevertheless hard to digest but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to stress the inhuman conditions of the survivors. Rather praiseworthy for a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like Night of the Bloody Apes and the Santoseries. The unknown young Mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing. The story is wellknown of course so the screenplay doesn't offer any unexpected shocks. Either by history or previously having seen Alive you know which kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only await them. Still this is a good film that shouldn't be bashed like too often is the case.".

SURVIVE! was cut down by 26minutes had a documentary style narration added and of course was dubbed in English. When I saw director Rene Cardona's name I was expecting some major exploitation and while there's certainly some this here is actually fairly wellmade when you consider how small the budget is. Most people are going to know this story from the American film ALIVE and if you're looking for an uplifting look on the subject then that's the film to see. This one here was obviously rushed into theaters to try and capture some of the hot buzz around the story and apparently both version were a major financial success. I was surprised to see how effective the plane crash sequence was here as they had to use some good editing to sell it. The performances aren't all that bad and there's no question that the story itself keeps you interested. There's a lot of focus on the cannibalism in the film and there are several rather graphic moments where we see the skin being removed and eventually eaten. These scenes aren't nearly as bloody as the film's reputation would have you believe but they're still going to turn some off. The American version runs 85minutes and features some narration added to the material just so they could cut out a bunch of dialogue sequences that I'm sure set everything up. The original Mexican version clocks in at 111minutes and contains more scenes of the military trying to locate the down plane and one survivor's father has a much bigger role in the Mexican version.".

Director Rene Cardona spent a lengthy career making Bmovies many of them in the horror and wrestling genres and unsurprisingly he enhances the horrific elements of this particular story. Cannibalism plays an important role in the film and it's depicted in a surprisingly explicit way for the era which makes this film much more realistic than you might expect. The cast members give average performances but the downtoearth style of shooting adds to the aforementioned realism and the script sticks to survival staples rather than adding in flashbacks or melodrama.

I was really surprised to find out that the movie is actually a pretty dull affair. I suppose the negative imdb reviews should have scared me off but the Cardonaflicks always get bad reviews and hey  I would have seen it anyway. You all know the story based on an actual incident A plane crashes in the Andes and the survivors are forced to eat parts of the crash victims in order to stay alive. Much of the running time is filled up with endless talking and the moral issue of their survival is stretched out far too long for it's own good. The movie is not at all as gory as they say  I saw the uncut version and still feel that Alive was much gorier. I'm no real gorehound but in such a slow moving picture as this a little more flesh and blood really would have spiced things up a bit. I would not say the movie is a complete waste of time it does have its moments but unfortunately it lacks the speed and charm of movies like Carlos Hostages! Night Of The Bloody Apes and Guyana amongst others. See them before you see this.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE STORY OF MANKIND 1957 is not a good movie but it's a fascinating one on several levels. I'm most intrigued by the central event of the film a debate over the fate of mankind undertaken in a heavenly tribunal between the Spirit of Man played by stately English actor Ronald Colman in his final film and a rather more sinuous type Mr. Scratch aka the Devil played by Vincent Price on the cusp of his emergence as a major horror star. Colman speaks in defense of mankind while Price argues for allowing the species' impending selfengineered demise. This was the Atomic Age after all. Price offers concrete examples of man's inhumanity to man and nature and the various atrocities the race has committed establishing a whole pattern of misconducttheft exploitation slavery mass murder rape pillage plunder perversionthat extends from Ancient Egypt right up to the present day. Colman glosses over these things preferring to expound rather vaguely on man's lofty ideals and dreams of progress exploration and artistic achievement. When Colman brings up Leonardo da Vinci for instance Price points to da Vinci's detailed plans for highly destructive weapons of war. Price seems much more outraged by the crimes of mankind than Colman is which marks his character as the true moralist in the film.In real life Colman and Price were good friends and one exchange of dialogue in the da Vinci scene where Colman insists that Price knows nothing about painting while Price responds that he never pretended to be an art expert is an injoke reference to Price's already considerable reputation by that point as a connoisseur collector and historian of art. On a more mundane note of cinephilic appreciation I tried tallying up all the footage taken from earlier movies with historical themes. Any time you see a shot with multiple extras and lavish sets you know it's from a different movie. Early on for instance we see John Carradine as the pharaoh Khufu sharing a scene with Price and Cedric Hardwicke as the celestial judge. All three were in Cecil B. DeMille's spectacle from the previous year THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 1956 which took place in Ancient Egypt. Yet when this scene transitions to shots of pyramid building they don't use clips from DeMille's film but instead rely on clips from another film set in that periodLAND OF THE PHARAOHS 1955. Why? Because THE STORY OF MANKIND is a Warner Bros. production and the only color film clips they could use without having to pay exorbitant fees would have to come from Warner Bros. films. So when they go to the Trojan War we see clips from HELEN OF TROY 1955. And when they go to the Crusades and other scenes from the Middle Ages we see clips from KING RICHARD AND THE CRUSADERS 1954. Piracy and ship battles between England and Spain for supremacy of the seas? CAPTAIN HORATIO HORNBLOWER 1951. Elizabethan England? THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX 1939. Western scenes? DODGE CITY 1939. There were some clips I didn't recognize though such as the shot of Rome burning. QUO VADIS? 1951 was an MGM production. Producerdirector Irwin Allen would expand on this practice of mixing cheaply shot studio scenes with more lavishly filmed clips in his TV series Time Tunnel some nine years later. By then of course Allen would be at a different studio and have to rely on clips solely from 20th Century Fox. The recent cablecast of this film on Turner Classic Movies on March 14 2011 was beset by technical problems. The film often froze up and went black. This happened most egregiously during two sequences one with Cleopatra Virginia Mayo and one with Peter Minuit Groucho Marx so I missed several seconds from each. I must say I didn't recognize Ms. Mayo in the dark wig. In another sequence 45yearold Hedy Lamarr turns up as the teenaged Joan of Arc!. Marie Windsor plays a much taller and older Josephine to Dennis Hopper's Napoleon. Josephine actually WAS taller and older than Napoleon but not by that much. Shakespeare is described by Queen Elizabeth Agnes Moorehead as a young actorpoet but is played by veteran character actor Reginald Gardiner who'd been in films for 25 years at this point. Why couldn't they recruit bigger names to play Shakespeare and such other key historical figures as Columbus Anthony Dexter and Lincoln Austin Green? Silent star Francis X. Bushman Messala in the silent BENHUR plays da Vinciand has no dialogue. Cathy O'Donnell plays an early Christian in Rome some two years before appearing in a vaguely similar role in the BENHUR remake. In one piece of gimmick casting Jim Ameche appears as Alexander Graham Bell a role closely identified with his more famous brother Don Ameche. I'm guessing they tried to get Don to recreate it but were turned down. Seven actors in this cast went on to guest star on TV's Batman Vincent Price Cesar Romero Reginald Gardiner Edward Everett Horton Francis X. Bushman Marie Windsor and Ziva Rodann.For years I only knew this film as the last to feature all three Marx Brothers. On that basis I'd always thought it was a comedy. It isn't. Still it struck me as pretty funny to see an opening credits sequence where Francis X. Bushman Franklin Pangborn and Dennis Hopper are among the many listed together ABOVE the title.".

Here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with a frame story about the human race being on trial with a guilty verdict meaning hbombs will go off all over the world. The prosecutor is the devil played with fiendish glee by Vincent Price. OK so it's a little hokey calling the defender The Spirit of All Men but I think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. The Spririt of Man is incidentally played quite well by Ronald Coleman in his last film. It is also the last movie in which Groucho Harpo and Chico Marx all appear but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians in a scene played purely for campy humor. Chico isn't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and Harpo we are told is meant to be Isaac Newton discovering gravity. Most of the other performances are well done though.Other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness. There is something called The Great Clock of Outer Space which when striking midnight may signal the end of the world.But at its heart the movie addresses the problems of WMDs and the eternal question of whether Man is basically good or basically evil and poses it in what I think is an interesting way. Also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie.".

They both use examples from history to make their cases.Here are some of the historical reenactments. Cavemen discover fire in the middle of an attempted murder and rape. Cleopatra Virginia Mayo kills her brother and seduces Caesar and Marc Anthony Helmut Dantine. Peter Lorre plays a drunken Nero laughing while Rome burns. The most embarrassing episode belongs to Hedy Lamarr as Joan of Arc. Her Joan wears bright red lipstick and a terrible wig. Her trial is presided over by Henry Daniell dressed as Santa Claus. Agnes Moorehead hams it up as Queen Elizabeth I who receives military counsel from William Shakespeare! Groucho Marx plays Peter Minuit in a painfully unfunny comedy segment where he rips off Indians for Manhattan island. Marie Wilson is a bimbofied Marie Antoinette. 21 yearold Dennis Hopper is a softspoken Napoleon with 37 yearold Marie Windsor as his Josephine. Among the other stars we see in this are Cedric Hardwicke as the celestial tribunal's judge John Carradine as Pharaoh Khufu Charles Coburn as Hippocrates Chico Marx as a monk offering advice to Columbus Edward Everett Horton as Sir Walter Raleigh Harpo Marx as Isaac Newton and Don Ameche's younger brother Jim as Alexander Graham Bell.Today Irwin Allen is best remembered for his contributions to television like Lost in Space or his '70s disaster flicks like The Poseidon Adventure. The Story of Mankind wasn't Allen's first film but it was his first notable one. This movie came about during the heyday of Atomic Scare movies. The decade was full of them usually in a scifi setting. There were some great classics like The Day the Earth Stood Still made during this era rife with paranoia. This film has the reputation of being one of classic Hollywood's biggest stinkers. Personally I like it! But part of why I like it is because it's so flawed. It's got an allstar cast most of whom are laughably misused. The script is terrible with some of the corniest dialogue you'll ever hear and some truly cringeworthy speeches. The history is inaccurate and blends myth with fact. It's all filmed in lush Technicolor but on cheap sets with tons of stock footage. Still I can't help but enjoy it. It's a movie that falls squarely into the so bad it's good camp for me. Taken seriously it's ridiculous and offensive to your intelligence. Taken lightly it's quite a bit of cheesy fun.It has the distinction of being both Ronald Colman's final film and the final film to feature the main three Marx Bros. together although they bafflingly share no scenes. By the way listening to the Devil's point of view it struck me how that is the more likely view we'd see advocated today not only in films but in reallife discourse as well. Kind of depressing. Worth seeing for a variety of film fans but especially for fans of Price and Colman who have two of the most pleasant voices the movies ever knew.".

It could have kept the hosts and perhaps could have had more engaging portraits of history. It has a fun premise and some good dialogue between Scratch and Mankind.

	schema:reviewBody "The Story of Mankind when I saw it was a movie I initially found difficult to rate. Mainly because it is a big mess. Having said that somewhat it is a mess that is worth seeing.The production values are hardly high art but they are decent. The sets are okay the costumes are interesting and the cinematography is not exceptional but not exactly cheap either. I liked the premise as well and it started off decently with Sir Cedric Hardwicke presiding over things nicely. There is also some good performances. Ronald Colman gives far from his best performance but he is very suave and convincing Marie Antoinette is nicely coquettish and Agnes Moorhead chews the scenery with glee. It was also nice to see the Marx Brothers Harpo and Chico aren't really that funny but Groucho is though there was the odd moment not to do with Groucho more to do with the writing and the way the characters were written that came across as more offensive than amusing. Best is Vincent Price with his powerful voice and magnetic presence he is gleefully wicked.However the direction falls flat as if it is unsure of which direction to go whether it wanted to be a history lesson or an exercise in camp. The dialogue is mostly absolutely abysmal but it is so hard not to laugh at how bad it is. The film goes at an uneven pace with some segments faster than others or better acted and written. The characters are little more than stereotypes and caricatures and badly explored ones at that and there are some unintentionally hilarious ideas incorporated into the story especially with Joan of Arc. I liked the leads and Moorhead and Groucho but the rest of the cast are just bizarre. Peter Lorre though isn't too bad perhaps too young and somewhat too effeminate too but there are some moments of unexpected poignancy but Hedy Lamarr is woefully miscast as Joan of Arc and a very overthetop Dennis Hopper does nothing with the role of Napolean.Overall The Story of Mankind is a mess but it was worth watching and I personally wouldn't put it on my worst movies ever list. 410 Bethany Cox".

Vincent Price is at his best as the Devil arguing against humanity. It was a poor choice in general to reconstruct so many scenes of human history especially since the screenwriters changed the events so much as to make them unrecognizable. The casting is very odd and distracting in these sequences too. The film is chock full of oncebrilliant character actors like Agnes Moorhead who embarrasses herself as Queen Elizabeth and especially the Marx Brothers. I guess one of the biggest reasons you might want to see this is to see what Groucho Harpo and Chico looked like in technicolor which if you remember Groucho in The Big Store was too expensive for their earlier vehicles. They among the numerous actors retain their vaudville characters in this film. Groucho plays Peter Minuit the man who fleeced Indians out of Manhattan island. He makes suggestive comments towards the chief's daughter but none of them are funny. Chico is on screen for 30 seconds as a priest arguing about the shape of the world with Columbus he is the only one to retain his dignity in this movie at least his character was Italian. Harpo plays Isaac Newton in a particularly pathetic sequence. He starts to play his harp and apples drop onto his head. Then he mugs for the camera. No Brother fell further from grace than Harpo.Basically The Story of Mankind forgets its purpose worrying too much about the elaborate recreations than the philosophical argument. This plot could have made a good film I think. Its ending is one of ambiguity which is where it should be. It tells us that the filmmakers did intend to make a serious film. I say that this is worth ignoring. For a better film with the same message we all have and still love to watch The Day the Earth Stood Still. 510.".

Just watch the opening titles. In truth though the actors and actresses are mostly a decade or two past their primes and many of the familiar cast members are secondstringers from yesteryear. The biggest names are probably Hedy Lamarr and Ronald Colman in a cast that also includes Vincent Price Cedric Hardwicke John Carradine Charles Coburn Franklin Pangborn Edward Everett Horton Peter Lorre Agnes Moorehead Virginia Mayo Cathy O'Donnell Henry Daniell Melville Cooper Cesar Romero a young Dennis Hopper and the aging Marx Brothers.The only stars of the film are Ronald Colman and Vincent Price who serve as opposing sides to the argument on the worth of humankind. The movie is set at a celestial trial to determine whether to save mankind or let it destroy itself with its nuclear weapons. This is an Atomic Age fable. Colman represents mankind and defends its goodness throughout history. Price is the devil Mr. Scratch and reminds the court of the evil in human history.The wellknown actors and actresses only appear onscreen in cameos that last about a minute. They play famous historical figures whose stories serve to prove some point at the trial. Some stars are barely recognizable and some roles have no dialogue. The big names don't have screen time together except for Price and Colman. The Marx Bros. are even separated.The movie itself is really kind of a letdown. It seems obvious that the historical crowd scenes and action scenes are borrowed from other films and the new scenes with the cast members are sometimes laughably underproduced. Watch for the scene showing Joan of Arc's capture. The mixing and matching is distracting and emphasizes the cheapness of the new footage. And despite an impressive cast of accomplished Hollywood talent the cameo performances are mostly terrible. The highlight is Groucho Marx putting his spin on the sale of Manhattan.As a history lesson this film won't do. And as an entertainment it falls pretty far short. The movie is still of interest for the cameos and it's fun to play Guess Who That Is with other movie buffs in the room. But it's disappointing that all of these names couldn't have come together in a better movie. The premise could have been executed better and I'd be interested in seeing a new attempt at such a star studded history lesson.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a joy! What a perversely perfect two hours of entertainment!!! It happened that I requested this cinematic phantasmagoria when visiting a friend the other evening and now it's going to be broadcast. Because it was rarely on TV when I was a kid it became a semiholy grail for me as a Marx Brothers fan since it was cited again and again in properly desultory fashion in books about the team as an unsatisfactory end. It was the last feature film the Marxes did togetherand given the blithering idiocy and boneheaded pseudodramatics of the picture overall it's a wonder any one of the cast members' careers survived. It was also the final movie of Ronald Colman who comes off suave sympathetic and dignified if incredibly boring. The same can be said of Vinnie Price except that his arguments make more sense than Colman's. Price is the Devil Mr. Scratch a name lifted from DEVIL  DANIEL WEBSTER arguing that Mankind is a writeoff and should be allowed to destroy itself by the SuperHbomb presumably a cousin to the QBomb in MOUSE THAT ROARED. Colman is the voice of Yes but  pointing out the niceynice things an occasional human being has done for the species.In his third feature Irwin Allen completes his magnificent trilogy of the History of Everything. A P.R. hack whose great talent was promotion rather than production Allen began his career with THE SEA AROUND US which bizarrely won an Oscar and so appalled author Rachel Carson so much she never allowed any other book to be adapted by Hollywood. Allen followed this by the equally dumb THE ANIMAL WORLD a substandard and witlessriff on the Disney sort of documentaries whose only redeeming sequence was the HarryhausenO'Brian dinosaur segment.The misbegotten setup is a swipe from the marvelous fantasy A QUESTION OF LIFE  DEATH from the Archers with its stylized fogbound Heaven where Cedric Hardwicke presides from an oversized judge's bench which appears to be a leftover from a William Cameron Menzies nightmare. A motley crowd of heavenly extras which apparently includes Fu Manchu sit on a semicircle trying not to choke from the overwhelming dryice fog listening to Price and Colman talk and talk and talk some more. Charles Bennett's adaptation of Henrik van Loon's chatty and longforgotten history book is so verbose it's akin to the nonsensical soliloquies given to John Carradine in WIZARD OF MARS or HALFHUMAN. I'd forgotten just how much like a soporific college lecture this extravaganza was. Okay if you HAVE to listen to someone talk it's wonderful that those voices are the mellifluous Colman and Price. But man they just never shut up.As jawdroppingly pedantic as their verbal tennis match is the multiple historical vignettes are even more delicious. The comedic bits are utterly drained of humor and pacing the dramatic bits are so potted and abbreviated they offer all the emotional depth of a tensecond bit from a coming attractions trailer and are often more perversely funny than the intentional humor Virginia Mayo's Cleopatra scenes for instance where she plays the Queen of the Nile as a simpering Valley Girl.Then there's the stock footage a feast for the eyes bits from ELIZABETH AND ESSEX CRIMSON PIRATE LAND OF THE PHARAOHS and any other Warners picture Allen could lay his paws upon as long as it was Technicolor. Rather than add production value this material shows how crummy and cheap the rest of the movie is in comparison with its cramped sets painted stone walls straight out of BRIDE OF THE MONSTER and a dearth of extras.Screenwriter Charles Bennett knew full well Allen was a tasteless and untalented schmuck and apparently continued his professional relationship with him for several years simply for the money. The result here one can only hope represents more Allen than Bennett who certainly has some good scripts in his resume. Given the crappy screenplay and Allen as director it's no wonder the performance levels vary so wildly. Agnes Moorhead's turn as Queen Elizabeth is the epitome of camp a shrieking overthetop barnstorming declamation bouncing off the underplayed Cesar Romero as a suave representative of the King of Spain and a subdued Reginald Gardner as a middleaged Shakespeare. The Napoleon vignette with Dennis Hopper reportedly wearing Brando's handmedown costume from DESIREE opposite Marie Windsor's Josephine is interesting because the two performers actually appear to be acting in the same movie. Likewise Hedy Lamarr as Joan of Arc who I happen to adore. Yes she's too old for the role of the teen aged Maid of Orleans but she's taking it seriously and is given a role unique in her oeuvre. Her interaction with inquisitor Henry Daniell actually manages some brief moments of drama. Daniell with only about four lines of dialog manages to wrest both sympathy and sternness from the script.My friend Kathryn pointed out rightly that the attitude of the backandforth fateofmankind arguments is very very 1950s. It's amazing how many ways Bennett and Irwin Allen let's not forget the talented Master of Disaster can say exactly the same thing in so many ways. Over and over. And over.It is fascinating for its collection of genrerelated performers Price certainly but also Lorre Carradine Hardwicke Daniell Rossitto who waddles through Lorre's Neroorgy segment. It's also fascinating as a cinematic train wreck not topped until the likes of CASINO ROYALE and SKIDDO where every directorial and artistic choice is mindbogglingly cheap wrong and astounding. As for the three Marx Brothers god what a waste. You actually get all three of these guys one last time for posterity and you put them in separate segments? Damn you Irwin Allen.Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "What a joy! What a perversely perfect two hours of entertainment!!! It happened that I requested this cinematic phantasmagoria when visiting a friend the other evening and now it's going to be broadcast. Because it was rarely on TV when I was a kid it became a semiholy grail for me as a Marx Brothers fan since it was cited again and again in properly desultory fashion in books about the team as an unsatisfactory end. It was the last feature film the Marxes did togetherand given the blithering idiocy and boneheaded pseudodramatics of the picture overall it's a wonder any one of the cast members' careers survived. It was also the final movie of Ronald Colman who comes off suave sympathetic and dignified if incredibly boring. The same can be said of Vinnie Price except that his arguments make more sense than Colman's. Price is the Devil Mr. Scratch a name lifted from DEVIL  DANIEL WEBSTER arguing that Mankind is a writeoff and should be allowed to destroy itself by the SuperHbomb presumably a cousin to the QBomb in MOUSE THAT ROARED.

	schema:reviewBody "For years I read about The Story of Mankind as one of the worst movies ever as cited in the book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. I also had a copy of Henrik Van Loon's book of the same name it was based on which I just read. It was updated to the '80s the copy I had. So having read the book I went to the Dailymotion site and watched the movie. It has an interesting wraparound segment with Ronald Colman representing the good side of Mankind and Vincent Price representing the bad side in court before Judge Cedric Hardwicke. Then we visit the various historical segments. Virginia Mayo as Cleopatra is perhaps one of the most inane of those though I got a hoot out of Agnes Moorehead as Queen Elizabeth I. My main interest was seeing The Marx Brothers in one last film together. Only they're not together here Chico is an adviser to Christopher Columbus Harpo is Sir Isaac Newton who plays his harp for the last time on film and Groucho is the guy who swindled the Indians out of Manhattan! Appearing with him in that segment was his thenwife Eden Hartford as the Indian daughter Laughing Water. His daughter Melinda also appeared in a separate segment as a little girl. Both Groucho and Harpo are pretty funny while it's amusing just recognizing Chico when he's on. Producerdirector was Irwin Allen doing his first of his allstar productions though this wasn't as epicladen as his subsequent disaster movies of the '70s as the frequent use of stock footage here exhibits. In summary The Story of Mankind is not even a good movie but it's certainly interesting to watch for the way certain attitudes were presented at the time concerning the way history was viewed at the time. P.S. For anyone who thought Harpo wore a blond wig it must have been quite a surprise to see him wearing a red one in thishis only color film appearance!".

Nick Cravat acts with his eyebrows and adds to the fun. Groucho Marx is a funny Peter Minuit and Harpo Marx has maybe the best bit in the movie as a harp playing Isaac Newton. Virginia Mayo's Cleopatra is amusing for the wrong reasons she sounds like she came to Egypt by way of Atlanta. Agnes Moorehead as Elizabeth I roars and overacts her way through a badly written scene. Peter Lorre is a memorable Nero.

John Carradine as the pharaoh Khufu cannot keep a straight face and grins at the camera in his first scene.In his last film Ronald Colman as The Spirit of Man gets the dreary lines and seems to think he's in a Serious Film. Hedy Lamarr is a Viennese sounding Joan of Arc. Charles Coburn as Hippocrates lectures the camera. Cathy O'Donnell stops the film as an early martyr.

A jaunt through the pages of the history of man. Yes man is tainted with what the Christians  myself among them  call sin. If he were not there would be no need for a Saviour. Even before Christianity  To the earliest of the Pharohs he was defiles And then Moses came along as mortal as even he was.

When Wendy's brother Wendy is one of the room mates comes from England the film starts to become a lot funnier. Well anyway Xavier starts to see things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he will never forget and will change his life forever. Overall a very nice nostalgic film which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast. I thought it was very interesting that you could see all these kids from different countries all of them speaking different languages and having different cultures get along with each other and fun. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because I left the theatre with a smile on my face and thinking about things I haven't done yet while I'm still in college and would want to do before it's too late.".

Drunk annoying insulting but shines through in the end. As well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct.

I'm from Germany not from France and for me it was Madrid not Barcelona but I can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an Erasmus semester in Spain will do to you. From what I hear the story is autobiographic and that's probably why it is so realistic.Let me give some examples mild SPOILER alert  Xavier shares a flat with other students from Italy Denmark Germany Belgium Spain and England. The flat looks EXACTLY like all the Erasmus shared flats I've seen in Madrid. The main characters are nicely developed and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish landlord is also 100 accurate.  The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine who remained in Paris is also very typical. About 90 of all relationships break up during an Erasmus semester or shortly thereafter.  There's a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy his flatmate from England who is kind of uncool to go out with all the others. He finally succeeds and Wendy probably has the night of her life.Another great thing in this film is that it's truly trilingual The students in the flat speak Spanish or English and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so that everyone can understand what's being said. I surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywhere.I can imagine that for nonErasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy but for all my fellow Erasmus I can only say This is YOUR film!

This very charming movie made me feel good and happy although I have never experienced to live in a republic of students.

I made tons of expat friends from all over Europe many of whom departed long ago and eventually Spanish friends as well.I'm older now and settled down but watching this I was overwhelmed with nostalgia and wished that I could travel back in time if only to relive one of those glorious weekends.If you've never done anything like this watching The Spanish Apartment may be the next best thing. The Barcelona tourist office should probably pay me for this.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 l'auberge espagnole was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of these last years Cdric Klapisch presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life either untidy either serious or with a sense of humor. I guess that if the movie worked so well it is because a lot of students must have recognized themselves in the main characters' portraits and especially Xavier's.We follow the movie and so his experience abroad as an Erasmus student through his eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities his faults. An intelligent making with quite a lot of ingenious ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and his anxiety about the world and being an Erasmus student. On that subject the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first one is when Xavier asks a woman at university for the papers he has to send to prepare his DEA. When the same woman informs him about the different necessary procedures all the papers appear on the screen when she is naming them! In the next sequence Xavier's voiceover confides to the spectator his vision of the modern world. Now where to find the second example? Well the scene where Xavier has a thorough medical examination during which Klapisch films his visions is widely sufficient to speak of itself.Moreover the director wasn't really interested by his main character's studies. He left this point lowkey. He rather put a lot of effort into Xavier's private life of course in his love affair with Anne Sophie but also and especially in his relations with his fellow tenants. It is a real friendship story that Klapisch shows us with its moments of happiness but also its arguments and its tensions. Through Xavier's adventure and at the end of his stay he will have been initiated into life which will make him more mature. The message that the author wanted to transmit isn't difficult to guess. You naively believe that you live in an untidy and complicated world. You mustn't give up but intensively search to get what you want even if it is difficult.Apart from this we could also fear that with the topic Cdric Klapisch wouldn't avoid a trap the clichs. Let's be frank about it they are included in the screenplay but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his movie. Then the screenplay contains convenient and predictable moments at the airport and before boarding we see Xavier shedding a tear after he left his family. But fortunately the shortcomings of the script stop here. Quite funny dialogs and cool young actors perfectly at ease in their roles make up the whole.In spite of its weaknesses l'auberge espagnole is to be taken for a success in the movie of young people. Besides the whole atmosphere it brings out lets us think that this movie is directed primarily to a young audience. Ultimately the end of the movie and its big success let us suggest that Klapisch succumbed to a fashion that goes right for American cinema the elaboration of sequels. And indeed the filmmaker currently works on a sequel entitled les poupes russes. Let's hope that it will be as good as l'auberge espagnole.".

But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona. In Spain it turns out that the lectures are being given in Catalonian language. That probably doesn't help the increasement of knowledge. But it helps in tightening the relationships inside the group of foreign exchange students. Especially if they rent a big flat together. There are 3 girls English Belgian and Spanish as well as three boys German Danish and Italian. Our French guy will also get there. A year is a very long time. Long enough to get close and make friends. And get to know some European stereotypes while trying to break them apart.Klapisch treats this special case of a process of uniting Europe with humor and without pecky didactism. He comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same. They like jokes. They like to make irresponsible relationships. But they don't neglect their aspirations. The most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community. They live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own. They are Europe's hope to fight the many problems of the Union. For example the terrifying administration system. In the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences.

I don't care how relatable this may be to the traveling foreigner. I'm just thinking why did they portray this guy so badly. He tells his mother to shut up convinces a married woman to have an affair and got mad when his girlfriend says she has moved on. He disgusts me and it disgusts me that this movie is revered. It makes me question if this is normal behaviour for people in France. Never has a film made me feel such disgust for a character.

The premise is right on cuea confused  disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused  disordered young individuals. But the director's weak swats at symbolism philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark and it leaves us the audience feeling confused  disordered. Bravo.Perhaps if this movie had been presented as a European American Pie flick then I'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. But right off the bat the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the inner self vs. the public self one's mother tongue vs. one's secondary language. Furthermore it dives boldly into the subject of racialnational stereotyping. Off to an interesting start eh?WRONG. That's as far as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epiloguetype ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic. It reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere but the speaker ends by saying So in conclusion I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!Furthermore as other reviewers have pointed out the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes then why did the director introduce a cockneyspeaking beerswilling English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a neanderthal literally banging his chest  making ape noises at one point whilst the Europeans tolerate him superciliously? Why is the British girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs calling French people frogs and butchering the French language while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this isn't a deep or wellthought out film. It's simply an Anglophobe's retort to the Anglophiles. But really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there's a funny irony to consider.OK philosophy artistry  sociopolitical commentary aside I was still very bored by this movie. There is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends but aside from that I was hardly entertained at all. The only reason why I watched it through to the end is that I'd like to brush up on my French  Spanish. You see we monolingual Americans may be stupid but we do try.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Ide de Dpart for this film was a very original one  the trials and tribulations of students in a Foreign Country on the Erasmus Exchange Scheme. Unfortunately apart from a few funny moments and the nostalgic pleasure of seeing all these foreign students speaking their own and other languages together the plot of the film is absolutely hopeless and uninteresting. No clear direction is shown and the film follows its course aimlessly through 1h 50m with a few interesting things on the way but also a lot of totally boring and shallow moments. It's a shame because the subject matter could have produced something far more original. Also the film could have taken place in Barcelona from beginning to end. Useless to have part of it taking place in Paris. The other thing which annoyed me was the stereotyping  AnneSophie is portrayed as a stuckup French bitch and Wendy as a typically sexmad unfaithful English girl. The German is portrayed as typically having no humour when the English Girl's brother makes jokes to him about the Germans. This sort of stereotyping is all well and good but it could be done more intelligently. Also certain others of the characters we learn little about  the Italian the Dane. I thought the Belgian lesbian had her character developed a little more. The central character the Frenchman had I thought a very weak and diluted character and seemed just unable to take it all in  too much pot I suppose . Audrey Tautou's tantrums were unnecessary and she was nowhere near as interesting as in Amlie Poulain.  All in all a bit of a washout  I had higher hopes before discovering the film  and I can't really see it having much success internationally mainly because the plot and acting are so poor. It's main redeeming features are the linguistic aspect its original starting idea and the fact that it may bring nostalgic memories to those  like yours truly who have mixed with foreign students abroad. I did in fact spend 2 months in Spain  in Tarragona  not far from Barcelona and Sitges ! to follow a curso de verano or Spanish Summer school where there were pupils of all nationalities  but the reality was not quite as babacool as depicted in this film ...............".

He's looking for something to help him get a job when he discovers that a friend of the family can get him a job with the EU if he knew Spanish.  So Xavier decides to enroll in an exchange program called Erasmus where he will live and study in Barcelona.After arriving Xavier ends up settling in with about 6 roommates from various European countries Italy Germany England Spain Norway Belgium and the wild cast of characters creates some ingenious comic situations. The film though is quite charming and is dead on in explaining what it is like to live in a foreign land and to escape your roots.  While the stereotypes that are examined are quite played out they are shown in a way that seems unique to the characters and come out very warm and of course VERY FUNNY.  A highlight of the film arrives when Wendy's English brother comes down to visit her and we discover he's a dumb ass loud mouth comic who thinks he knows everything about all the other countries these people come from.  He ends up providing the majority of the funniest scenes by poking fun at every person in the group at his own dumb expense. But the highlight of the film really is how it shows what it means to live in another country.  In the beginning we see that Xavier is awkward from fumbling around trying to find his first apartment to complaining about Catalan and by the end with the tshirt he receives from his roommates on the last day we see how he has been transformed by the friends he has met from all over.Quite a fun film not perfect but definatly a great film to see that will but a big smile on your face and a warm feeling inside you once you have left the theatre.Rating 8 out of 10".

The only thing that is real about the Erasmus community is the fact that you get contaminated by the multinationalism you're thrown into including speaking three languages at the time and acquiring new identities. No I am not such a boring person the Erasmus do go out we do party and we have tons and tons of fun but not at such a low level of human behavior as shown in the film. I'm really disappointed because people get this wrong impression of Erasmus students who are in essence people who love meeting new people and sharing experiences at an intellectual level at the same time as discovering a foreign country foreign way of life and enjoying themselves. Truly talk to the first Erasmus student you meet and check out for yourself! The Auberge espagnole does NOT reflect the Erasmus reality at least not the reality of the majority of Erasmus students!!Europe gives us an opportunity to go on exchange  let's not spoil this great thing by giving an impression of irresponsible disgusting Erasmus students who may exist only in the imagination of film producers who want to sell their work!".

	schema:reviewBody "Xavier Romaine Dupris is a young Frenchman in his early twenties. In order to secure a terrific job in the financial sector he must go to school in Spain for a year and learn how to speak Spanish with ease. With his hippielike mother urging him on Xavier soon lands in Barcelona. There he is befriended by a French doctor and his stunningly beautiful new wife and they offer to house the graduate student until he can find an apartment. Soon after Xavier is fortunate to secure a cheap room in a boarding house where a bevy of other students live. One of them is an English girl Wendy who seems very nice. The place also houses an ultraneat German man a Spanish lesbian and so on. Xavier fits right in almost immediately and everyone gets along well. However Xavier had to leave his beautiful girlfriend Martine Audrey Tautou behind in Paris and this puts a strain on their relationship. Things get more complicated when Xavier develops a serious crush on the doctor's wife AnneSophie. Will he make it through his studies and land the dream job he seeks? First this is a very interesting film but one which seems put together with a bit of splashdash at times. Yes it has some stunning scenes like the one where everyone in the boarding house parties hearty and ends up disoriented on the streets of Barcelona. The camera work at this moment is a unique layer upon layer of images that is truly inspired. But sometimes the movie seems bent on being quirky and wanders off the beaten path. Then too anyone hoping for a Tautou film will be sorely disappointed despite her smiling face in the middle of the cover. Her part is relatively small while Dupris' role is the main focus. All of the other cast members are quite nice as are the costumes and lush settings in Paris and Barcelona. There is some fast and loose morals in the film where sex drugs and drinking are somewhat glorified. Yet despite this tendency the movie really is a terrific look at young Europeans who are just finding their ways into the serious world of adulthood. If you like foreign films you probably should put this one on your list as it has an offbeat and surprising nature that so many nonHollywood movies have. Even so don't expect to be bowled over by the film as it is only moderately successful in its delivery.".

The old Japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in those 60's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express aka Dead Rail seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie  which makes it incredibly absurd.The effects were awful by today's standards. Beyond awful. However not quite as bad as the 60's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as I've ever seen made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. I won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one it just wouldn't be fair to this pitiable plot plus it would take to long to even get started. Most of the acting was awful Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one.SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the cheap thrills channel producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot.

The rest of the special effects goes downhill from there.The plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970's movies called Horror Express and a disaster movie called The Cassandra Crossing. At least The Cassandra Crossing had a better cast an engaging storyline and real train scenes.If you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a B movie party then watch this otherwise Alien Express derailed long before departing from the station!".

They were better than what I was simultaneously watching and I could only tryhope to watch the whole movie just to verify the unanimous disdain excepting one apparent idiot. I don't know exactly how to say this but I think that all of the reviews sell this movie short. It is worse than Plan 9. It takes the cake. It's unbelievably stupid. Actually that last sentence could be misinterpreted. Not only is it unbelievable it's unbelievable that it was even conceived and completed as a movie. And it's way beyond unbelievably stupid. The hemorrhoid commercials every 12 minutes were a real relief and I've never felt that way before! This movie must have been a pet project of SciFi channel's accounting dept. as it can only be some sort of tax writeoff against capital gains. If that's the case the accountant should get any positive recognition as a true visionary. Other than as a wonderful way to rewrite off all of the company's cheepo garbage props out in desert storage one last time maybe and give a bunch of slumming Bactors a busman's holiday out in the desert it must have been a way to hold a clinic for all of their new upcoming producers directors techs etc. They should all consider themselves survivors. And they should all look for new lines of work.A truly deplorable effort. But not exactly a waste of time. I now have a new bar to judge other movies by. And I can't wait to revisit Battlefield Earth. That movie is infinitely better than Alien Express. And to think that they left room for a sequel!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is fairly typical for the SciFi Channel onedimensional characters a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a performance. And save the day. Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable the exwife who goes through the timehonored clich of first disliking Lou then of course comes to love him again at the end. The obnoxious State Senator who gets munched early on and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. Then there's an ecoterrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever except to provide us with 3 more running around. He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.The special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air trailing flames behind it at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. Then it lands on the hood of a car coming in horizontally. Sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor I guess. It really doesn't damage the car much just bends up the hood a little bit. Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. Even though the train only had a two minute head start it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain  this effect must be seen to be believed. It looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. Then the ecoterrorist eventually blows himself up but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. Then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling so why this would keep them on the train I have no idea.Overall if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing and it's down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network well come to think of it some of those chefs are kind of cute. Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them maybe there's a sexy girl some TA or a character that actually has some personality or some suspense or well something. I really didn't see any of that here.".

At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.The train stops. Local law enforcement is summoned. Oh can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady Amy Locane from CRYBABY and MELROSE PLACE who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips STAND AND DELIVER LA BAMBA is the exhusband.Meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train.The train leaves. Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train about 70 miles per hour so that he can save the day. As the buddy's reward he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.Which is another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The cop hero's sidekick must die we all know that. But he's supposed to die near the end of the third act usually while saving several lives.Once on the train Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater tshirt. Yeah Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. The part he's playing isn't worth bothering with but he's in good shape.The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.Soon we have bomb threats multiplying aliens and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges DIFF'RENT STROKES try to save as many lives as they can.There is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirtyfifth anniversary with hopes for thirtyfive more years together. The dude gets banged up but he and the Mrs. both live. Maybe the writers just lost track of them.This is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done better work and really deserve much better than this are probably just happy for the work. Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile or did they cry andor drink themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story the fairly numerous all things considered survivors gather in the last car of the train which is unhooked. The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness reigns. I'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet but I digress.Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.It's gotten to a point that seeing the words The SciFi Channel Presents on an original movie tells us that we'll be glad we have TiVo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. Or better yet just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely.".

And where to begin is going to be start.1 The special effects are not quite Titanic II bad but they still have a very artificial look to them. The train itself is not convincing at all almost reminiscent of a miniature train with the inside shot elsewhere. That may not be the case but that's how it seemed to me.2 A lot of SyFy movies have slipshod editing and Alien Express is no exception. Actually a lot of it is so bad that everything in some scenes look blurred together.3 If you are looking for a good story or a good telling of it look elsewhere. The concept is okay if barely original but like other SyFy movies the execution is awful. The story itself is leaden in pace thin in structure and predictable in how it is written. There is also no real tension thrills or suspense.4 Not only that if you are looking for likable characters Alien Express is not for you. The characters aren't just clichs of the genre but also SyFy clichs. But clichs don't actually bother me as such as long as they are well written and not annoying. Alien Express fails on both counts. The characters are underdeveloped and at the end of the day while there have been far annoying character before especially in the SyFy movies of the past three or so years I just didn't care for any of them.5 Was I expecting the acting to be great? No not really. But I was expecting some enthusiasm. I didn't get that. Everyone seemed wooden and pretty much phone in their performances.6 But if I were to single out the worst asset of Alien Express it has to be the script. Although I do dislike most of the SyFy movies I do keep watching them for the novelty value and to curiously see if they do anything worthwhile. I may have seen about 40 or so SyFy movies in the past couple of months but few have had dialogue as atrociously bad as that of Alien Express. It's all stilted and spoils any attempts to give some tension or thrills with how unintentionally funny it is.Overall a terrible film even for SyFy. Not their worst but towards the bottom end. 110 Bethany Cox".

Turithe director And Steve and Scott the producers Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production. I made many friends Lou Todd Steven and I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. There was not a day that went by that I did not laugh my butt off. The real tragedy isn't so much the special effects it's that every single person who watched this film didn't get to see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that truly went into it. Craftsmen building the set prop masters gafferswardrobe makeup artists script supervisors the cinematographer production assistants extras craft services producers director and actors. It's a given that Sci fi didn't spend a terrible amount of money on the film 2 million But There was a lot of time energy and man power that was instilled into it. I look on the film now as a production that brought a lot of talented people together for a fun project that was shot without complications in less than two months. It was a magnificent cast and crew and I'm just so glad to be apart of it! On a further note to those of you who don't know Lou Diamond Phillips Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. Lou I still am working on my Deniro impression and can't thank you enough for introducing me to midnight Run.

Rawlings wants nothing to do with the crash and orders his train to move which it finally does. Convinced the accident is nothing to just throw away Vic chases after the train and climbs onboard. When his suspicions were right he discovers the train is infested with strange creatures from space that eat human flesh. Discovering this he gets the Senator's Secret Service to help him in dealing with the deadly creatures. When all seems lost he and his wife Rosie Amy Locane find out that the train is on a collision course with a gorge that has no support for it. Finding out that fire works best to destroy the creatures Vic and Rosie decide to plunge the train into the gorge and get the passengers safely out of the way but the creatures make it harder than they thought.The Good News OK I know all about the hate that this movie has generated and while I agree to some extent this isn't the worst movie SciFi has shown. That was Parasite not this movie. This does have a few redeeming factors. Despite what most of you say I think most of the special effects work for the film. It has the same kind of charm that the old monster movies have a cheeplooking creature but nicely imagined that has its own personality. The creatures themselves are given a nice new power they can fly around at supersonic speeds making them nearly invisible. There is a small flash that follows them around so you can tell where they were a few seconds earlier. There is a good amount of gore in the film so this has a small redeeming factor for those fans. We see several bodies completely ripped up lots of skin missing a giant pool of blood around the body as well as the interior being devoured. There is also some great looking dismemberment a gaggle of scratches and rips and even some blood splatter. This does fit the tradition of hardlydry SciFi films. The film is also fastpaced as there is always something happening. What is happening may not be the most exciting or convincing thing ever put on celluloid something is always on screen. Explosions galore lots of blood and some minor trappings of suspense filter through and it does have some great action.The Bad News Frankly where to start. The effects as mentioned above could've been done more convincingly by a secondgrader the explosions are so cheaply made they cost more than the computer used to create them and the dialog uttered by the adults in this film is so mindnerving that a sledgehammer to the face might seem like a more tolerable activity are only a few things that frankly bugged the hell out of me. If you want more in depth reasons as to why this is read the other comments on here. They cover it in much better detail and more accurately than I ever could.The Final Verdict With juvenile effects laughable dialog and a pathetic creature I know it's shocking that I had some good things to say about it. The only people I can really recommend this too are those that perform their own Mystery Science Theater 3000 on the movies they watch or those that loved the 60's monster films and miss the charm in the creatures from then. Otherwise stay away that isn't an option.Rated R Graphic Violence and some Language.".

TiffanyAmber Thiessen stars and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man Now and Again's Eric Close but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community. At first she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him but as time passes she continues to be suspicious of him.While this sounds like the setup for another boring melodramatic TVmovie it is really much better than that because the characters are wellacted by Thiessen and Close and the movie's script allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you'd expect these aren't just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to move the plot along but real threedimensional people and we find ourselves really caring about them. And the movie is smart enough that it is able to provide an exciting involving climax to the story without resorting to dumb action scenes mindless cliches or cheap melodrama. Instead we share in the main character's inner conflicts and fears and are given a realistic portrayal of how she might be able to resolve them and do the right thing.If you get a chance to give this one a look please do so. It's production values are not exactly topnotch it is a TV movie after all but if you can look past that there is an excellent story to enjoy.".

It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The stranger concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society. A serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this movie displays the sickness and crime in a perfect way. My beef with the movie was the non sense situation when Thiessen's character returns home with her deranged husband after he's released on bail. By that moment she knew what he did to his young relative played by the cute Allyson Hannigan. But that's just the typical Hollywood scene that provokes more trouble. The climax scene shows Thiessen following her husband when he's about to commit another rape then she calls the cops who come in time just to capture him. The ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for 99 years in prison in real life. The acting is also pretty good and Tiffany is great and gorgeous as always. The direction is also very good.".

While I was a little disappointed to lose the unique peeping plot I was thrilled when he basically kisses her on the cheek and tells her he's dashing out for a jog and a rape. Be back in a jiff hon! She knows he's the rapist he knows she knows and he keeps rubbing her face in it by for instance laying his gun and rope on the table in front of her. It got a little dark when Alyson Hannigan confesses that he molested her when she was a kid and warns Tiffani to protect her newborn daughter from him ! but it was played for suspense instead of misery. Gerald McRaney is quite likable as a paraplegic and country music singer Lorrie Morgan plays one of the navymen's wives.

Moving at breakneck speed Chris get Jen to quickly fall in love with and then marry him in what looks like less then 24 hours. It's at her wedding reception that Jen's get some disturbing vibes from Chris 17 yearold cousin Dana ALyson Harrigan that there's something very screwy about him that has to do with his very overactive libido. That fact about Chris should have been very obvious to Jen from his very strange and unorthodox to say th least love making habits!It also turns out that Chris a nut about being in the Navy washes out of the service in his fear of being in an atomic sub for three months at a time without shore leave as well as without his gorgeous wife Jen. What really comes to the surface about the boyish and lovable when his manic depression doesn't set in Chris is that he's a triple A sickola in his behavior when he comes in contact with beautiful but unsuspecting in what he has in store for them women. Chris is not only suspected by the cops of spending his free time when he's not with his wife Jen snooping around the neighborhood spying through their bedroom windows on women undressing but even at times breaking into their homes and raping them! When these mental aberrations about Chris become known to Jen she's already pregnant with his and her child and leaving him isn't an option! Especially when the guy who's also a hyped up control freak threatens to murder her if she does. It's hard to take the action that Jen at first does which is next to nothing in her knowing that she's living and sleeping with a man who's at least four cans short of a six pack upstairs in his head. When the couples Jen  Chris child is born Dana lays it on Jen about how her older cousin Chris molested her as a young girl and what he's now capable of doing to their new born daughter when she grows out of her diapers Molly. Meanwhile there's this rapist running around town attacking women at gun point that not only fits the description of Chris but does his thing raping and robing women when Chris is not at work or at home making him in Jen's mind the number 1 suspect.With no one believing Jen that her husband is a psycho rapist and can very well graduate to murdering his victims Jen's has no choice but turn him over to the police and let justice in the fact that he's is the Woolcap Rapist decide his fate. Having no evidence to have her sick but very clever in knowing how to cover his tracks husband brought to justice Jen plans to catch him in the act and then get the cops to put the pinch on him. That was very brave on Jen's part but the big question is what if her suspicions about Chris are wrong and backfire on her! That would not only break up her marriage but have Chris get custody of Molly with Jen being by the court declared an unfit mother! But if in fact Jen is right about Chris how could she not be sure that he'll turn on her before the cops can come to her rescue knowing that he's not only a danger to all the young women in town but also to her and her infant daughter Molly as well!".

That's how likable Close is in this. A good looking guy with personality you wonder why he needs to be a rapist. Also good to see another good actor Gerald McRaney in this as the girl's father. Not much he can do in a ridiculous script. Her phony crying at the end didn't impress me.There are no surprises and again you route for Close to win. But that's show business.

Great villains like Dr. Cesarian Cheapo the discount criminal Klinko and Pushy Galore to name a few.This show is very adult. One villain was named Queen Clitorus. Which led to the obligatory jokes about not wanting to rub her the wrong way she is very sensitive and that men don't believe Clitorus exists. Yes it is immature but still very fun.Cheapo is by far the best villain of all time. His idea of a crime spree involves taking all the pennies in a 'Need a penny Take a penny' tray stealing the change from a fountain and stealing immitation furs.Other great charachters are Chief Stroganoff Stripperella's boss. He isn't complete upstairs. He has a few screws loose. Special Agent 14 is the mentally handicapped agent. Oddly enough he is fairly intelligent. The lab boys get lot of laughs. They are in love with EroticaStripperella and want to make molds of her various body parts at any opportunity.This is a great series and I look forward to many more eps.".

	schema:headline " A definite favorite of mine and a huge guilty pleasure!";
	schema:reviewBody "Stripperella is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones voiced by Pamela Anderson who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as The Tender Loins and as a sexy crimefighter known as Stripperella a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame and creator of SpiderMan.Back in late June of 2003 Spike TV then known as The New TNN premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows. Those shows were Ren  Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi Gary the Rat about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of Cheers and Fraiser fame and Stripperella the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a little let down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good it had an awesome intro song it had some good talent behind it and it was funny as hell! The show was just so silly I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks if not a little less the animation block disappeared which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 100 AM. I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time something seemed a bit off....In the beginning of it's short run Stripperella had great animation. It was dark moody realistic and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's Married with Children if even possible. Also the eye mask actually shows her eyes now before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also the upper part of her costume was kind of a vesttype thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue that changed to her costume being a bluishviolet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand but the secondhalf it became more cartoonish looking and though still laughoutloud hilarious it became more zany as well for example there was a later episode about a werebeaver...yes a werebeaver. Anyway instead of complaining about the midseries changes Stripperella only ran one season but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film Bordello of Blood it may be really campy but it's really fun. As long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons 1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows even though this was the entire show I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee and 2. the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jackasses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny SpongeBob was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.The Breakdown PROS Had a great look to it at first FUNNY AS HELL a very fun show great voice talent for the most part Chief Strogenoff watch the show and see some of the stuff he does and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.CONS The midseries animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this.OVERALL Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. It was a very funny sexy actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy. Check it out even if it is on the lousy DVD. You will laugh yourself silly.Rated TVMA Crude and Sexual Humor and Nudity Runtime About 25 minutes per episode Score 910".

Boy was I wrong!Stripperella has even better production values than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible.The humor is good too on the sexy suggestive and sleazy side. It is very similar if not exactly like the Simpsons style. You may encounter clichs and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless.

However the amount of female nudity decreased and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this. But then again I adapted. One of my favorite episodes of Mork  Mindy was when they got to meet Robin Williams! So of course one of my favorite episodes of Striperella is when Pamela  Tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin! If there really is a Season 2 I hope that I can find it for as a completest I need to complete my collection. I recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes. Hey! Psst!

This is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical mysterious and ... you get the point but do to their own personal lack in thinking they fall terribly short. Like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd  looks the part but his tongue can't speak it. THe writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly  unknowingly i believe  that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I wish i could give an example but i cant recall any  exactly as it was said. The ending was bad as well. But the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady although she as well as the rest had a lot of clich s.So Why would i give this movie a 7 stars if I thought all the above? Simple I give the entire seven stars to LISA KELLER  one sexy a momma. SHE is FINE lol. I am an appreciator of beauty and she is exactly that. But don't get me confused because I'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porno in any way. their is somethin about her I cant explain but i like it. I remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out bumps into Keller. She tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance. He throws her down kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down no panties . Now although she has an AMAZING ass  and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think  it was her facial expression that got me. she wanted it and that look had me thinking i was behind that. I would have torn that booty up! After that expression i jus couldn't look at her objectively anymore I WAS IN LOVE. lol. I am glad to have seen this movie but if Lisa Keller wasn't playing the lead role I would have changed the channel.. well... after i had seen the scene i mentioned above. I am a LISA KELLER fan know but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor seeing this 2003 movie is her latest. But i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it.".

A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back and this time he's armed with a razor.

It doesn't help that the robot characters are a turnoff. They don't have much of a personality they seem very stupid  why should we care about stupid characters? and their voices are very annoying to the ear.The makeup is good I'll admit. But it seems odd that they spent time for the makeup when not bothering to present the rest of this world as a futuristic world the vehicles of this world for one thing are presentday gaspowered vehicles.

	schema:reviewBody "The film had NO help at all promotionwise if there was an advertising promo on TV or radio I didn't seehear it. The only newspaper ad I saw was on it's opening weekend a dingy sludgy B  W headshot photo of Andy as ValCom behind jail bars with headline WANTED! Runaway Robot!  which was also the poster in front of the 3 movie theaters I saw it at NOT the nice little color poster on this site with headshots of all the cast and cartoon of Crimebuster which really wasn't THAT goodthey OUGHT to have used an action scene from the film itselfdidn't they have an onset photographer? A poster is supposed to HELP a prospective audience decide if they want to SEE the moviethere were SO many people who couldn't get into their soldout choice and wanted to know WHAT Heartbeeps was aboutand that poster didn't help! That dingy pic and the only other photos supplied to papers were so indistinguishable in B  W that they were worthless.  There was NO trailer for the film only a slide at one theater consisting of the word Heartbeeps inside a heartshape with a Cupid's arrow through it and one that was a totally black picture just Andy and Bernadette's voices saying ValCom! My pleasure center is malfunctioning! So is mine do you think we ought to tell our owners? THAT is no help to people who hadn't been aware of the movie.During the filming Andy told reporters that he couldn't eat once his plastic lips were applied so he would load up on breakfast and fast during the day's shoot. I don't know WHAT Bernadette did but at the time I'd wondered why they didn't just sip protein drinks through long straws or eat astronautstyle pured food via tubes? PhilCo the baby robot seemed to have been the precurser to Short Circuit's JohnnyFive with the same eyes similar face. I've been trying to find if they had the same designer but no help. I have vintage magazine articles about the film and the design team was immensely proud of their work and were going for a special award for their innovative device to create stenchless smoke for Catskill's cigars. Just shortly thereafter LucasFilm did NOT use that device though they OUGHT to have for Return of the Jedi's scenes with Jabba the Hut a man created steam around Jabba by blowing cigar smoke into a tube joking that all he needed was a glass of brandy and he'd be a happy man. I thought that LucasFilm's using of real tobacco products was insensitive to people who were upset by smoke. John Williams who had then recently succeeded the late great Arthur Fielder as the maestro of the Boston Pops  which was THEN a ratings hitbut it never recovered from Fielder's death and is now a shadow of it's former glory  was using the show to promote films with which he supplied the music. He'd premiered The Empire Strikes Back score there and you would think he'd have helped Heartbeeps along by playing a few numbers there? The one thing that critics had liked of this film was Williams' scoreyet it was NOT available for purchase! I saw one vinyl album in 1982 with half Heartbeeps half another filmbut it disappeared. I only just tonight saw the CD listed on THIS site and have ordered it. If I can ever get a scanner and time to type out the articles I'd like to create a Heartbeeps tribute site. I liked the movie and don't care what dissenters say! The only trouble with the film was that near the end it was messed up logicwise the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to decide their own fate make their own choices yet when the junkyard owners tell them that Phil needs to go TO the factory to have a purpose programmed into him they don't even question it they just glance meaningfully at each other and they go. Along the way each of the adults lose battery power and die. They aren't REALLY dead as they are robots and only need new batteries yet it is treated as death with little Phil crying over them and rolling away. So what was the POINT of this? Phil never gets back to the factory and gets a purpose! AND of course the junkyard owners COULD'VE driven them or given them all battery recharges with backup batteries but the real point was to have this poignant scene where the robots all wore down and Phil is left to cry. At the end ValCom is a golf instructor and AquaCom is I'm not sure what. Catskill is an ENTERTAINERwhat ELSE is HE supposed to be? I'm not sure that they made it clear. The junkyard owners seem to be taking it easy lying on chaise lounges drinking lemonade from Phil their bartender. Val's and Aqua's new daughter PhilsiaI think the name ismaybe it's Sylvaniadoesn't seem to be much more than a table lamp. There is missing footage which is sadfrom photos I surmise that the stuff missing includes a sweet scene where Phil is having a Christmas with Val gifting him with a car's steering wheel Aqua is supplying a horn Catskill has taken the firefighter helmet to give to Phil as we saw and they have Christmas trees. I don't know if any missing footage supplies better logic or if the writers just couldn't think of a better crisisresolution. The film was trimmed to 7275 minutes to pair it with other failing films. No other reason than that. For a DVD I would LOVE to be in on creating as I want to see interviews with the castcrew and John Williams and the Merv Griffin interview. The makingof footage and reediting and restoring the missing footage to make it better.".

The android family now begins slow walk back to the robot factory but their power packs are now running very low.The plot itself is fairly charming if you are not too impatient about the slow pace or the overly redundant dialog. This isn't an action movie or even a sexy romance flick but just a simple lightly romantic sciencefiction movie with rather good makeup and nice special effects but the effects are not plotmover item for the story as is common with the movies these days. It aims for a charming fanciful mindset and achieves it but the pacing is too slow and the story dialog so thin that it really does not have enough oomph to give an emotional investment from the audience. HEARTBEEPS is a slow yet charming movie with sadly not enough script or philosophy to fill out the movie runtime. I find I rather like it for what it wanted to be but many people will not appreciate that and be disappointed. I think this could be remade today now that audiences are more accepting of science fiction in general with a similar budget and a complex conceptually expanded script and succeed as a charming scifi family movie.".

I find I rather like it for what it wanted to be but many people will not appreciate that and be disappointed. I think this could be remade today now that audiences are more accepting of science fiction in general with a similar budget and a complex conceptually expanded script and succeed as a charming scifi family movie.";

At the time this movie was made Kaufman's breakout TV series Taxi had just been cancelled and he had just been diagnosed with a rare large cell carcinoma in his lungs. He wanted to get away from the disastrous InterGender Wrestling gig he started that caused his popularity to fall flat and got him banned from Saturday Night Live. Bernadette Peters had just come off playing a cupiedoll airhead against Steve Martin's moron in The Jerk and Heartbeeps seemed like a good followup role. It's nuances you need to watch for in this film. The unlikely allies of the robots Val Aqua and the Catskill Performer while being pursued by a crazed police robot makes for a simplistic yet classic tale of good vs. evil and good wins spoiler alert!.

They also make a break for it escaping from a factory on a data finding mission. They are hunted down not only by factory employees Charlie Randy Quaid  Max Kenneth McMillan but also by an out of control police robot called The Crimebuster. Val  Aqua are joined by a comedian robot named Catskil voice of Jack Carter and a cute little thing dubbed Phil.It might be just me but personally I found this dopey movie rather endearing. It's not the debacle one might assume it to be Kaufman DID apologize for it during an appearance on David Lettermans' late night show although it clearly won't be for all tastes. Some viewers find it too slow but I thought the pacing was adequate enough the harmless little movie only runs an hour and 18 minutes anyway. It's not particularly witty although the dialogue is good for some chuckles. Catskils' dialogue largely consists of oneliners concocted by Henny Youngman although Carter did come up with some of his own material. Lovely widescreen photography is an asset as is the appealing soundtrack composed by John Williams. The undeniable standout is the makeup created by Stan Winston.The cast is all likable enough. The only thing this viewer didn't like was the fact that Christopher Guest and Melanie Mayron were wasted in minor roles. It's nice to see a variety of familiar faces in supporting parts and bits Richard B. Shull Dick Miller Kathleen Freeman Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel. The great trailer announcer Ron Gans is a hoot as the voice of the Crimebuster. Director Allan Arkush is one of many filmmakers who came out of the Roger Corman school and his other credits include things like Rock 'n' Roll High School and Get Crazy.Heartbeeps doesn't add up to much when it's all over but it's still a pleasant enough diversion.Six out of 10.".

Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career and Chris Rock is his partner a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actorsoap opera doctor.  There are also great supporting performances from actors such as Emmywinner Allison Janney The West Wing Harriet Sansom Harris Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer and Kathleen Wilhoite Chloe on ER.

	schema:reviewBody "LaBute's 'Nurse Betty' tells the story of a young housewife and parttime waitress in search of the man of her dreams. Sounds like another fluffy romance no? Not quite! Her adulterous trash of a husband is scalped. Two hit men a father who's about to retire and his son are after her the father happens to be in love with her. The man of her dreams is a character from a soap opera...she travels half the country just to be with him. Little does she know that it's only an illusion. Yes it is a bizarre little comedy but fun nonetheless. Zellweger proves to be the perfect choice to play Betty. She delivers a very nuanced comic and moving performance. Has Morgan Freeman ever gone wrong? He's just laugh out loud hilarious. Chris Rock too takes a chance playing the villain and does a fine job. Greg Kinnear and the supporting cast that includes Tia Texado Allison Janney Aaron Eckhart Kathleen Wilhoite and Crispin Glover are all good. the soundtrack is beautiful and very romantic. It just adds to the surreal mood of the film. A lot of the film takes place on the road giving us glimpses of the beautiful American landscape and an adventurous feel. Towards the end there's a beautiful scene between Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger well I can't say what it's about without giving spoilers which is the real turning point in Betty's life and the way that scene was presented amidst the chaos in the next room is amazing. 'Nurse Betty' is a sweet film that dares to go against the usual standards of American comedy. There are some very graphic scenes of violence and there's the element of suspense as the father and son track down Betty. Yet it manages to stand as an adventurous comedy that is uplifting and brings a smile.".

If you're the kind of person who is not comfortable with a film unless you can safely store it into one of five or six comfy little categories move on or as Jack Black says go to the mall!.  To quote Roger Ebert audiences lobotomized by onelevel stories may find this confusing.  It's really a sweet little comedy that breaks a number of 'sweet little comedy' rules by introducing real terror and a few count 'em  3 scenes with a bit of gore.  Like Jonathan Demme's minor masterpiece SOMETHING WILD we are taken out of a safe little world Kansas literally to another dimension.  This dimension is part Oz and part grit.  Oz is the fantasy life of the main characters for Zellweger it's Kinnear the fictional doctor on a soap opera and for Freeman it's Zellweger who he sees as a sort of modern Doris Day.  Intertwined with the fantasy is the frighteningly realistic fact that Freeman and his son Wesley are hit men. What hit men do ain't pretty.  I'm personally relieved that this is not a cute comedy with 'widdle cuddwly' hit men who are really not so bad because after all their violence is bloodless we can overlook what they do. UHUH!  We are not left off the hook that easily!  On the other hand Morgan Freeman is an authentically charming guy and in many ways this film contains some of the most sparkling romance real andor imagined that's been seen on the screen in a long time!  This indeed is a film that breaks many conventions while celebrating others but be forewarned this is not a safe cuddly film.  You're not in Kansas anymore!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why I picked for a borrow from mom for Nurse Betty. I think just because I had heard a little bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did. Nurse Betty is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side. This was one of Renee's first big one's before hitting it major in Hollywood. I can see why she is an incredible actress. The scene where she finally realizes what had happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera you can see pain confusion fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to let you in on the movie she plays Betty. A shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband she's a waitress and is in love with soap operas especially one where a certain cute doctor Dr. Dave Revell. When she happens to see her husband's murder accidentally in separate room the murders she notices are two customers she just had Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. She then just looses her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fiance Dr. Dave Revell. So she travels along the country to California to find Dr. Revell and wants a job as a nurse to work with Dave she's seen the show so many times somehow she's just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother. Despite everyone telling her that she is delusional she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy one's. When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell Georgehis real name thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together.Renee was terrific she was so believable on loosing her mind in the movie. She has come such a long way and wither you want to admit it or not she's adorable and a great actress.Morgan Freeman plays one of the assassin's Charlie who is the father of the two. He is so charmed and smittened by Betty and while chasing her around the country he becomes almost just infatuated with Betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley must find Betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities. When Charlie sees Betty and catches her finally she's scarred at first but calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. He's just great.A surprisingly decent performance by Chris Rock the son Wesley. He is so gunho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business. I loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang he's holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap opera's together. Classic. Nurse Betty is a great movie that I'd recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie I think anyone could enjoy.910".

I was attracted to this film because of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock who always deliver but there's also great acting from the rest of the cast most notably Zellweger but Kinnear is also perfectly casted as is the rest no exceptions. All a joy to watch.And then there's the offbeat plot with a woman living in a fantasy of being a soap character that takes over her life and makes her forget that she was just a waitress in Kansas with a cheating husband who got killed in front of her eyes by hitmen. Sometimes I thought the movie was thrown way off balance with the sudden bloodshed but most of the time it was a very warm film. It was the wonderful strange mixture between cold reality and movielike fantasy that made it interesting. It's good for a couple of dosed laughs but I would classify this as a tragic comedy with a relatively happy and satisfying ending tho it may be cheap to some. Funny thing is as life can be stranger than film all in the movie could in theory happen! And the focus is still very much on human emotions so in that way the movie is still down to earth.Better than I expected this film rules can't get enough of Morgan or Chris but really everybody did a great job making this film.8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Cute edgy and very funny";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an adorable if somewhat edgy comedy from a clever and witty script by John C. Richards crisply directed by the very talented Neil LaBute proving that he can handle comedy just as adroitly as he can the art house movie.Rene Zellweger stars as Betty Sizemore a sort of Doris Day of the 21st century a waitress from Kansas whose fantasy life centers around Dr. David Ravell Greg Kinnear star of a TV soap opera called A Reason to Live to such a fanatical degree that she has memorized lines from the show after watching the tapes over and over again. This will come in handy later on.Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play a fatherson team of cocainedealing hit men who ignite the premise of the movie by murdering Betty's slimy used car salesman husband played by Aaron Eckhart who starred in In the Company of Men 1997 also directed by Neil LaBute. Chris Rock is a comedic psychopath and Freeman a fatherly murderer whose favorite dictum is three in the head you know they're dead. One of the amazing and characteristic things about Morgan Freeman is that even while playing a professional criminal he manages to sound like the wisest gentlest man you ever knew.True the plot relies heavily on coincidence Betty copping the keys to the Buick that just happens to have the goods in the trunk precise timing meeting Dr. David and entourage at exactly the right moment and some questionable psychology Betty's partial and convenient amnesia. But such contrivances should be written off as poetic license and ignored. After all who would criticize Shakespeare for the tortured plots of his comedies? More significantly what makes this work is the cleverness of the plot melded well with the personalities of the characters while gently satirizing them and some very funny dialogue. My favorite line is when Freeman looking gravely at a picture of the disappeared little miss Nurse Betty soberly remarks to Rock We may be dealing with a cunning ruthless woman here. I wonder could it be that some of the pseudonymous and humorless reviewers who trashed this movie here and at IMDb are jealous outofwork screen writers?An observation and a question Rene Zellweger has the kind of onscreen presence to delight the most jagged heart. And who really is the reigning queen of contemporary filmland comedy Zellweger or Reese Witherspoon? They are both brilliant. Witherspoon is a little more over the top while Zellweger is more impish. It would be interesting to see them trade roles say Zellweger as goodygoody Astudent Tracy Flick in Election 1999 and Witherspoon as Nurse Betty. Too bad something like that can't be done.Incidentally the song Ca Sera Sera heard in the background won an academy award for best song in the Hitchcock thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much 1956 starring James Stewart and Doris Day. The reason it reappears here is not entirely clear but the resemblance of the wonderfully naive Nurse Betty to the on and offscreen Doris Day who also had a hit recording of Ca Sera Sera goes beyond the strawberry blond hair to a kind of irrepressible innocence. In Nurse Betty however the Doris Day world of white picket fences and monogamy is given a contemporary spin. Although this is to some extent a romantic comedy it is one in which the answer to the question Who gets the girl? is one never seen in a Doris Day flick.Bottom line if you can watch this without laughing old loud and crying some real tears you need to get your hard drive fixed.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

And who really is the reigning queen of contemporary filmland comedy Zellweger or Reese Witherspoon? They are both brilliant. Witherspoon is a little more over the top while Zellweger is more impish. It would be interesting to see them trade roles say Zellweger as goodygoody Astudent Tracy Flick in Election 1999 and Witherspoon as Nurse Betty. Too bad something like that can't be done.Incidentally the song Ca Sera Sera heard in the background won an academy award for best song in the Hitchcock thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much 1956 starring James Stewart and Doris Day. The reason it reappears here is not entirely clear but the resemblance of the wonderfully naive Nurse Betty to the on and offscreen Doris Day who also had a hit recording of Ca Sera Sera goes beyond the strawberry blond hair to a kind of irrepressible innocence. In Nurse Betty however the Doris Day world of white picket fences and monogamy is given a contemporary spin. Although this is to some extent a romantic comedy it is one in which the answer to the question Who gets the girl? is one never seen in a Doris Day flick.Bottom line if you can watch this without laughing old loud and crying some real tears you need to get your hard drive fixed.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "As Betty Sizemore Renee Zellweger secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del Aaron Eckhart being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied small town life to search for Dr. David Ravell Greg Kinnear the handsome and loving hero of A Reason to Love a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Immune to reality Betty arrives in L.A. and becomes Nurse Betty as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile the angered Charlie and Wesley track Betty down convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with Del.Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character's extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her. By clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life Nurse Betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality. Thus while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film Nurse Betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities. In addition Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist's mental state particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between Dr. David Ravell the character and George McCord Greg Kinnear the actor who plays him. Betty's incapacity to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings which stress the magnitude of her delusional state. However in spite of these successes Nurse Betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves. For example while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced. Similarly although the initial scenes establish Del as a detestable man the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife Betty.Finally toward the end of the film Charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for Betty an obsession which results in noble feelings of love and which ultimately destroys him. Consequently since the characters' roles as victims lack consistency the story's victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial. All in all Nurse Betty's indeterminacy rather than creating suspense weakens its characters and pollutes its plot.".

Of three Nurse Betty is the best  deliciously multilayered full of twists and turns making fun of the TV obsessions and turning upside down many genres. What is the film?

It is very detailed clinical description of post traumatic stress disorder and the parallel story of two dreamers who in the same fashion created in their imagination the ideal lovers that were so far removed from reality as Kansas from Oz. And the awakening was truly shocking. Renee Zellweger in a Golden Globewinning performance has never been better before or after Betty Chicago came close. Morgan Freeman has never been as romantic and so much in love at the same time being a coldblooded and meticulous hitman. Greg Kinnear as a man from Betty's dreams so handsome that a bit more and it would be a crime was perfectly cast and funny as the shallow TV star. The presence of Aaron Echhart and Crispin Glover did not hurt the film either. But the real star is the script so rich and unpredictable that it was pleasure following all its turns and twists. Underseen and underrated indie film that has only became better since I saw it first time soon after its release it is a rare treat. This is a very funny and very dark film. It is dreamy and it's one of the movies that make me happy just to know that it exists. Definitely recommended for repeat viewing. The ending is beauty itself. There is another never I have to add Neil LeBute has never done anything as fresh and enjoyable since Nurse Betty.".

Renee Zellweger plays Betty Sizemore who works at a diner and obsesses over a soap opera called A Reason to Love. She believes that soap star David Revell speaks directly at her. After her husband is savagely scalped to death due to a situation involving stolen drugs Betty gleefully sets out to meet the man of her dreams. Too disturbing for laughs but interesting and detailed. Director Neil LaBute presents the fantasy dysfunctional elements mixed with warped reality. Zellweger is radiant poising as a nurse believing a false lifestyle. When she finally does snapped back into reality the film makes some interesting implications especially with Betty. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are excellent as her husband's killers out to find drugs hidden in the trunk of her car unknown to her. Freeman draws laughs through a sudden infatuation with her while Rock is violent and excessive. With that said the violence presented is too graphic for the film's tone. Greg Kinnear plays Revell who sees Betty as an act until the tables are turned. Aaron Eckhart plays Betty's husband who gets in too deep with our two assassins. Bizarre portrait of reality and fantasy collision. Score 9  10".

I am in no doubt that the marketing of Renee as the new America's Sweetheart is the real basis of this effort. So Renee playing the public Renee. Then we have Renee playing Betty. We are lead to believe that the three are simultaneously real. But this has been common for 75 years.What's new is Betty becoming Nurse Betty. Another layer and then full circle as the real nurse Betty becomes the play Nurse Betty. This last is assumed before it actually happens. Finally we have Freeman's fantasy angel Betty which we assume is the root of all the conflated layers. That makes six layers by my count. Think about it this film requires a sophisticated viewer.

	schema:reviewBody "Hard to categorize this movie but many things come to mind. My boyfriend described it as Blue Velvet filmed by the Farrelly brothers and I think that is an excellent description. My problem with this film is that it sets up its premise so exquisitely in the beginning  Renee Zellweger trapped in a waitressing job that she can actually do in her sleep who watches her favorite soap so zealously that she can pour coffee while staring at the screen.

As she soldiers on through the day more and more things unravel around her so that by the time she witnesses the brutal murder of her husband she is completely consumed by her imaginary world. Up to this point Zellweger balances the tension of her delusional positivity with a buried sadness that is so delicate when it comes out every once in a while it is heartbreaking to see. Then LaBute just abandons ship with her and launches into a road trip movie that loses all dramatic tension by creating extremely cartoonish interactions and characterizations that do not come into balance again until Bette meets up with her soap opera star at a charity event. The scene where Bette introduces herself to the writer and some of the cast of the soap opera A Reason to Love is one of the best balancing acts of conflicting views of reality I have ever seen on screen. But once again LaBute abandons Bette to onedimensionality so he can rush over to the Grand Canyon for yet another badly written scene where Morgan Freeman is trying to have a conscience and Chris Rock is just trying to get the job done. The point at which I got anything out of their interaction with each other was the point at which Chris Rock decided to stop acting and just start doing his foulmouthed comedy routine. Finally there seemed to be some spark and life to their relationship and the road trip aspect started to pick up for me. I feel like Mr. LaBute is very good at theatrical manipulation of audience expectation but not so adept at filmic flow and continuity. I am glad he exists and the film was very interesting and very watchable but I think he still has a lot to learn about how to create and sustain a convincing oddball reality throughout the duration of a feature length film.You can't have intermissions in a modern movie theatre but I felt as if there were intermissions in this film that plot lines would ebb and flow like tides until each character was plucked out of the group and given meaning. Perhaps this would have been best done as a play first and then the ensemble cast rounded up to do the film. I was underwhelmed by the artistry but entertained by the quirky story so I think I will just leave it up to other viewers to determine  is the film halfempty or halffull?".

Crispin the creepy thin man Glover has a small role and has been banished to obscurity for his association with this turkey. The only actors that can say they earnt what ever they were paid for this blemish on American Cinema was Greg Kinnear in a role as another self obsessed moron who falls for loveable loon Betty's charm and provides the improbable crapfest its most improbable twist except if someone actually liked this movie!!! and Christoper McDonald is worthy as a sleazy redneck who is Betty's abusive husband before he sends her round the twist.As I said this movie is a mismatch of styles mostly bad all badly done that fit uneasily together to form one of the worst 1 12 hours of my life. I still dream of suing the producersdirector for my ticket price and mental anguish.

After a shocking incident involving two hit men Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock Betty goes into shock and travels to LA believing that she is destined to marry the show's main character Greg Kinnear.Nurse Betty is that rare thing a lesser known film with an allstar cast and a fluffy RomCom plot that surprises with it's terrific script and spot on acting. Indeed such a plot makes one question the R rating but it's warranted all right. The shocking incident that sends Betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie but at the same time it is necessary to believably show Betty's transformation into the doe eyed lovable nut job she becomes.As we go along with Betty on her journey director Neil LaBute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error. An example of this would be Betty's first meeting with her crush. She pours her heart out to him and he plays along thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show. Even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of Betty's ramblings the music swells as she speaks giving us the audience Betty's emotional perspective. We almost believe what she is saying yet we understand that her mind is fractured. Whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding.The banter between the hit men played by Freeman and Rock is priceless the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of. Freeman in particular is excellent as always pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of Betty not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of Betty's nogood husband and he is almost unrecognisable. The other revelation here is Kinnear whose portrayal of the soap's star is not too overcooked. There's a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich as thickly as possible and Kinnear resists instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance despite simply being a soap star.The soap opera is realised so well it could almost exist. LaBute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too. If the soap opera had been too satirical a large part of the film would not have worked. To do a Days of Our Lives spoof as seen in Friends would have been the wrong move for this movie. The dedication to detail pays off as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into Betty's reality more and more while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set feel real as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right.The neat resolution of the final act while being a tad predictable is wholly satisfying overall. It's a shame that after LaBute directed this wonderful film the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of The Wicker Man a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him. Unfortunately one cannot absolve him of all responsibility.If you haven't seen Nurse Betty it's something to discover. If you have it's worth a revisit. There is a charm to Nurse Betty that is infectious even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards. A hidden gem nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "NURSE BETTY is a delicious black comedy that is an affectionate sendup of the film noir genre that takes some effective swipes at the television industry as well. Renee Zellweger stars as Betty a sweetnatured waitress and housewife who is a devoted follower of a soap opera called A Reason to Love. One evening while watching her tape of today's episode Betty witnesses the brutal murder of her slimy drugdealer husband Aaron Eckhartby a pair of ruthless hit men Morgan Freeman Chris Rock. This incident causes a microchip in Betty's mind to blow and she packs her bags and decides to drive to Los Angeles to find Dr. David Ravelle her favorite character on the soap with the hit men hot on her trail who have to take out the only witness to their crime. This comedy makes all the right moves thanks to a razorsharp screenplay and wonderful performances from a perfect cast. Zellweger is absolutely enchanting as Betty an endearing performance that earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy. Freeman is charming as a surprisingly sensitive hit man and Rock as always steals every scene he is in as Freeman's explosive young partner. Greg Kinnear offers a charismatic turn as George McCord the actor who plays Dr.David Ravelle and finds himself enamored with Betty. Allison Janney Kathleen Whilhoite and Crispin Glover offer effective support as well in this delightful comedy that is warm witty smart and heartbreaking. Don't miss this sleeper.".

And also the character himself Kane is very dark and interesting The athlete behind Kanecharacter is named Glen Jacobs. When I've seen at the cinema the logo WWE and Mr. MacMahon as the executive producer I had my creeps. I said these money freaks are messing with my movie genre. Fortunately they aren't. This movie is pretty much a slasher not so different from Friday 13 and it's about Jacob Goodnight the killer obsessed by sins and the eradication of them in the most radical way.This character is crafted in a very realistic way. All of his obsessions belong to his mother which is obsessed as well by sins and by the holy scriptures. This mother creates with a certain satisfaction a monster which has her same ideas and more important the proper physicality to do his job. And he will perform his opera on a group of people convicts working in an abandoned hotel which reveals to be a trap for these sinners. And I'm afraid the plot ends here. Should follow a description of some scenes but you know I don't want to be boring anyway I trust you get what kind of movie this is. Now the style is very modern sometimes it resembles a video clip for a hip hop single. There are no boring points but being a slasher there are a lot of strong violence scenes and the whole movie it's a crescendo for the final challenge.Which is like 3 to 1 in terms of number but Kane has the body he has. . . well it was some 3 vs 3 OK? The actors are kinda OK. There isn' t a lot to recite except a sex scene a nude scene and a lot of vulgarities spoken and suggested. And the respective deaths of course. Kane has been a surprise!! I expected a giant grunting all the time with an horrible expression the same he has when he fights and he actually was. But when talking to the lovely mum . . .more than a serial killer seemed to be Forrest Gump! He has this mutable expression at the end of the movie which left me completely breathless. OK he isn't Micheal Gambon but . . . you see he's putting a lot more than his 6' 8 . . and that's something!!All in all a movie that is entirely shot on the charisma of Kane and that's why it works. This movie isn't the next big thing for the slashers but it's way better than the latter 5 Friday 13 and the latter 5 A Nightmare on Elm Street as well. Note for music lovers the soundtrack SUCKS a load!!This movie has the same problem of all the slashers in the 90s. No evolution. It is what it is. If you like people being killed by a brutish guy with some serious mental problems fine. If you don't. . . what are you doing here?".

Kane makes a pretty good Silent Psycho and the character's back story is decently developed in a series of BW flashbacks. His POV shots are nicely distorted and unlike the vast majority of psycho killers in film today is not simply an unstoppable force. Kane actually manages to find a character in there. A very minimal character to be sure but there is a TINY bit there more than just a ThingThatKillsPeopleForNoReason. On the whole however the acting in the film is best described as notTOTALYsucking. I'm reminded of that Simpsons episode where Groundskeeper Willie sings a song that goes Wouldn't it be adequate? Yes the acting here is indeed adequate but only just. To be fair the actors aren't really being asked to act here it's enough that they are clichd stereotypes. The art direction is generally good if very very derivative of other films like Hostel and the Saw series. It goes a bit over the top with the filth and grime at times but for this kind of movie that isn't really a problem from an aesthetic standpoint. It is a problem from a plot standpoint. The people are there we learn this in the first 10 minutes so don't worry it isn't a spoiler to do public service by cleaning an old historic building. Unfortunately the sheer SCALE of the mess at this building would take that guy from Dirty Jobs and a full hazmat crew a month to deal with. The place is practically a toxic waste dump. There are a few problems which I will NOT detail in the interest of avoiding spoilers with the set and set dressing that are later revealed as not problems at all but rather plot points. Those I can forgive.The film delivers on what it promises A creepy disgusting setting with a creepy violent psycho stalking creepy dysfunctional people with absolutely minimal story plot acting direction sense or purpose to get in the way. It's almost EdWoodian in it's gleeful disregard of knowledge of it's own lack of ambition to greatness. If I may be allowed to construct a sentence that convoluted without being arrested by the Language Police.I had very few expectations from this film Hell after all it IS a WWE film... and the only thing that really disappointed me is the same thing I am disappointed by in most horror films. It was very very predictable. At one point I was sitting there going ...and now someone runs in and saves them only to be rewarded by just that.In the end if you can accept the idea that a correctional institute would send a coed group of mixed violent and nonviolent offenders to do heavyduty industrial cleanup in street clothes and sandals for a weekend with only 2 chaperons then nothing else the film asks you to accept will be much of a problem for you.".

	schema:headline " Good Bmovie Fun";
	schema:reviewBody "This ladies and gentlemen is truly a modern Bmovie. The dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity the premise is predictable there are a few decent twists and characters remain 2D for most of it. And yet there is a certain...charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years and so I'll find it quite amusing when people say it's not much of a reach for him but Glen Jacobs is apparently quite the nice guy so actually it is. In any event he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top Jason would be proud but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. Frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest oh it is QUITE the gorefest. The Rrating IS richly deserved and I actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. In any event a very very fun but fairly bad movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "This ladies and gentlemen is truly a modern Bmovie. The dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity the premise is predictable there are a few decent twists and characters remain 2D for most of it. And yet there is a certain...charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years and so I'll find it quite amusing when people say it's not much of a reach for him but Glen Jacobs is apparently quite the nice guy so actually it is. In any event he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top Jason would be proud but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "All right let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match directed by a former porn director the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy starring a wrestler named Kane and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well here's what I was looking forward to1 Bad acting. 2 A fairly nonexistent clichd storyline. 3 Kane walking around with a scrunched sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4 Tons and tons of gore. Well if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.Obviously movies like this are best seen for free but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was 107 can you beat that? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity running water and a working elevator?I know I know the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uhhuh.I think you pretty much know what to expect but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of Kill him Kane! and I hope you die first! and Chokeslam! echoed through the theater showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However I can see how others could be annoyed by it.Second and this shouldn't even warrant explanation the film doesn't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies! for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic but I was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like Say goodnight his character's last name is Goodnight right before he killed a victim. Instead he uttered four words in the entire film  Nooooooo! and I see it. But hey he delivered them flawlessly!If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like Place your BETTS! or All BETTS are off! It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HORlarious!".

	schema:reviewBody "Eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it out as community service. They soon discover that it's the residence of a hulking psychopath Kane who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs. It doesn't help that the guard watching over them Steven Vidler has had a previous runin with the beast four years earlier. A guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films. Most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example of this. It features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mixture between Friday the 13th Saw 2 and Halloween Resurrection. I really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well. It was really just a bunch of clichs and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently. The death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills. The acting is pretty bland and unremarkable. This is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job. A second rate Jason Voorhees if you will. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers. While the death scenes are gory they aren't necessary scary. There's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. Because of this the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value. Also if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one. It will do little to change your opinion. In the end See No Evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching. Rating 610".

The story naturally revolves around a couple of young but tough women like that's new who have a tendency of getting all the men around them killed. The older characters are very peripheral and somewhat wasted. But that's part of the hangover from the scary movie subgenre which fortunately seems to be slowly fading into the distance and morphing into marginally better films such as this.The worst part of the movie was the supposed plot twist. This was something that if you were to ask yourself what the most obvious generic thing that could happen would be you'll have guessed it long before it happens.Anyway as I said the film is at least honest and for a short disposable hack and slash horror it's pretty reasonable.

A viewer stated above that it is good Bhorror movie fun and honestly thats the best way to describe it. Now the question I was asking myself was how was Kane going to hold up...Well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the 'Jacob Goodnight' character. He sold the role really well and really did look menacing. But what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle. The acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that. The directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done. Considering this was directed by a porn movie director I was quite surprised. I'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun. Think of this movie as a modern day latter Friday the 13th film. And save room for the ending too cuz it's a good one. And stick around after the credits too...".

	schema:reviewBody "The first official release of World Wrestling Entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horrorslasher movie called See No Evil starring Kane one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence hardhitting moves and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling. And let's not pull any punches here while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time mostly by WWE it goes without saying that after having seen this movie I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time.See No Evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course a monstrous murderer played by Kane also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. Without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early1980s slasher flick with most of the clichs intact but without any of the scares that those films accompany. And that's sort of the main problem with See No Evil. It tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next. It's too generic to be scary.The movie's gory no doubt but it's only there for the effect. The dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly. The death scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventive.And the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed. Some can't even portray fear properly they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. So when they die it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts to the monster Kane.As for Kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. There's no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. He has the look and presence for it he just needs better material specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work with.Now despite what may seem like a harsh review I actually enjoyed the film. It's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy. My main gripe with the film again is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments. I enjoyed it but I enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. If that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher. But it didn't. It got laughs because it's a Bmovie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. Nonetheless I enjoyed it tremendously.If you don't mind a fun Bmovie or funny horror film I'd highly recommend See No Evil. If you are a true enthusiast of the genre I'd wait until the DVD comes out before checking it out. Everyone else should probably go watch something else.".

If that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher. But it didn't. It got laughs because it's a Bmovie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. Nonetheless I enjoyed it tremendously.If you don't mind a fun Bmovie or funny horror film I'd highly recommend See No Evil. If you are a true enthusiast of the genre I'd wait until the DVD comes out before checking it out. Everyone else should probably go watch something else.";

I for myself couldn't care less who would survive or not. Kane's character was a completely uninteresting killer. I mean come on even in a Bmovie you should be able to put some sense to his actions.

The death scenes were kind of okay with the right amount of painful experiences for our heroes. One of them gets a particularly funny death no I'm not gonna spoil that one. But in a horror movie I do expect some tension and some scares too. And that's what See No Evil lacks.Conclusion if you expect a decent horror flick don't watch this movie. And even if you like Bfilms because you're amused by bad acting and illogical plots don't watch this one either. See No Evil is not scary not funny not interesting and not worth your time.

Yet somehow I found myself watching it several months later on DVD. I'm a huge horror movie fan and I guess I just thought it would be at least entertaining.How wrong I was. It's not the bad acting or dialogue that does this movie in. It's just the complete lack of originality that makes this a task to sit through. The plot is so routine that it's laughable. A group of youth offenders are sent to clean up an old dirty hotel for community service. This just happens to be the same hotel where a vicious deranged serial killer is holed up. And then as per usual in these films they get killed off one by one. I know this is the standard slasher movie plot but would it have killed them to add just one twist or interesting element to the story? Even the characters are the typical clichs. A backstory about the killer's childhood abuse is touched upon but never fully explained.You can usually count on the gore in these types of movies to at least provide some sort of visceral thrill but with the exception of a few moments it is all dull. Kane pretty much kills everyone with his hook on a chain and then gouges their eyes out which gets repetitive by the second time he does it.Knowing that he has virtually no story Gregory Dark a famed porn director overdoses us with every cool camera trick he can think of. Instead of jolting the picture to life it just further numbs us to the film.The only thing See No Evil has going for it is Kane. Say what you will about him but if I saw his character in real life I would run away as fast as I could. He doesn't even need to act I think he says a total of three words throughout the entire film but he just oozes brutality. Too bad the writers couldn't give him a better vehicle.All in all this is just a complete waste of time. Even if you're a diehard slasherflick fan it will still manage to bore you. A couple more of these and the slasher film genre will be completely dead.Grade D".

	schema:reviewBody "This film by Gregory Dark is about a group of juvenile delinquents who clean an abandoned hotel harboring a gigantic murderous psychopath who enjoys killing people and taking out their eyeballs. Sound fun? It isn't.I feel like it has a pretty interesting premise. It takes the whole clich of homicidal religious fanatics and teams it up with a group of kids getting into trouble. It's an all right idea but it has disappointing execution. The actors are terrible. Not only the young actors but the older ones as well. I wasn't expecting much out of this film when I saw it was a WWE production though to be honest. I can't think of anyone who I think did a good job acting. Seriously no one comes to mind. That's terrible. The dialogue was stupid. It was just really lame C movie material. It was pretty predictable. It was gory yeah but I was pretty bored. I wasn't ever scared however I was clenching my fists in frustration often. It's one of those movies where the characters are completely oblivious to everything that's going on and just make stupid mistakes. It's annoying.There's one thing I liked about this movie and it is the cinematography. Things were well lit there were nice angles beautiful shots. It's a nice looking movie. Too bad it didn't have any substance.I watched this movie a couple years ago and hated it. I thought maybe I just had no taste back then and I might like it now but no. It's still awful. I definitely don't recommend it. I certainly will not be buying it ever or watching it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting a mind blowing horror film after I heard this movie was produced by a wresting company but hey I gave it a try and it wasn't a complete disappointment. The plot is fairly simple  a cop now working at a detention facility for troubled youths had his arm severed in a horrible accident while facing a brutal serial killer with religious motives  Jacob Goodnight. Now four years later he is sent to a huge dilapidated hotel where the delinquents are to clean up the place. But little do they know Jacob Goodnight is hiding away in the rotting hotel somewhere and he begins to emerge and kill off the teenagers and seeks vengeance on the cop who shot him years ago. As night falls the group becomes lost in the maze of the decomposing hotel and Jacob Goodnight is close behind.See No Evil is a fairly methodical formulaic horror film. It contains some typical clichs although I was happy to see a character actually grab the gun from a dead police officer rather than run off screaming and leaving the weapon behind and features very archetypal characters  the tough guy the normal guy the bubbly girl the punk chick the tough girl and others. While these characters are somewhat clichd it really doesn't matter much because the majority of them are placed in the film merely for body count. This movie is a popcorn flick all the way. I liked the film's idea  a serial killer with religious motives which makes it a little more sinister and I definitely loved the setting although I think it could've been a little bit better. The CGI shots of the hotel weren't highly convincing but that may have just been me.The performances in the film are mixed  some of them are alright but most of them are passable and pretty wooden. Christina Vidal the lead heroine is probably the best of them with Samantha Noble being in second. Glen Jacobs The WWE wrestler Kane plays the villain well  he's got a scary look to him naturally and his character is very demented and disturbed. The ending was predictable but for whatever reason I didn't really see it coming at all. There are some very predictable moments in the film Jacob falling out of the window but miraculously grabbing onto the ledge for one last grab at a victim and some of the murder scenes while not all of them were a little bit overthetop the cell phone scene while it was kind of morbidly funny was just too much. For the most part though the murders were really messy  this film is a pretty gory one at that.Overall See No Evil is a decent horror movie. I think it could've been a lot better but it is what it is  a methodical bythenumbers slasher movie with a little bit of a spin. Horror fans have probably seen it before but it's not a bad rental. 610.".

The movie is stupid all the way through making it one of the worst I have ever seen.The only think and this is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies.

The acting is horrible possibly from the bad director.The plot was stupid....Just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals and they get randomly killed off. The movie is stupid all the way through making it one of the worst I have ever seen.The only think and this is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies. The pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome.Overall this is a really horrible movie and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.";

The CGI is quite good and the actual brutality of the murders is a little unsettling.The real critique I have of this movie is the fact that the storyline is kind lacking it seems a little direction less at times.

	schema:reviewBody "See No Evil is the first film from WWE films. Yes WWE Word Wrestling Entertainment pro wrestling. Of course being that it's a WWE film a wrestler has to star in it the wrestler being Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. Which is not really important as if you didn't know Kane or what WWE stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is gross out horror film it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying hey look how gross we can get! Not that there is anything wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight played by Kane is sort of a Jason type character his mother tortured him as a kid with strict understatement Christian beliefs and has warped his mind. Now he's a big scary chopping killing machine. 90 of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where Jacob stalks six teenagers surprised? and a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh who cares? Despite it's lack of originality See No Evil is well made for what it's supposed to be. Kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary. One flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive I really looking forward to having them being horribly killed but alas does not happen. I wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it although like I said the film has nothing to with wrestling people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because given of course if they are a wrestling hater. Then again the movie may also make money because Wrestling fans will want to see it. Either way See No Evil has top notch effects and little CGI and like I said it's quite brutal so like I say it's good stuff....if you like that sort of thing.".

The acting was terrible as well with Kane showing throughout the entire movie at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart.

There is definitely an ample amount of blood gore  action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's  early 80s. Think Madman meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick. While SNE is thin on plot most horror films are it kind of makes up for it in the violencemethods of killing the gore suspense  the fact that Kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers  stores them in big jars. Why?? You'll just have to watch it  see pun intended. There are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably Psycho TCM  Madman but they're not blatant. Finally SNE really doesn't go into territory we long timers haven't seen before  granted SNE is no Pyscho or TCM 74 but it certainly merits a look imo.

An eerie filthy hotel with a deadsick psycho running around stabbing people and pulling them around by a meat hook... Definitely not one for the squeamish.I didn't very much like the seemingly unnaturally beautiful women in sandals and tight tops who were supposed to clean up the dump they were in.

This DVD is their first concert in Rio Brazil. Although the people don't speak English they try to memorize the words to the most famous Rush songs and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends.From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio this concert DVD will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you've listened to when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour started in 1974. I went to their Scranton PA concert and this was just as good although in PA they didn't play Freewill so I was upset.They have Freewill they have The Trees they have YYZ The Pass Driven Dreamline Red Sector A Limelight Roll the Bones 2112 and much more. 10 out of 10 because nothing else compares. If you never go to a Rush concert then at least buy this DVD.".

Once you see the pains and heartache they went through in order to deliver this video to the general public you will have a better appreciation of what they've done.Through rain bad weather mechanical malfunctions and thousands of screaming fans Rush was able to record and edit their first concert DVD ever!  There's no sense commenting about the quality of the editing once you actually watch the documentary and realize what they were up against in filming this just sit back and enjoy the show!The show goes on for several hours spanning just about every album of their 30 year career.  There are songs for every type of Rush fan from every generation.  They play some old rarely heard classics ByTor and the Snowdog to some of their 80's hits Tom Sawyer and songs off their latest release Vapor Trails'.  There's something for everyone as far as their music goes.The documentary is one of the only video documentaries Rush has ever recorded.  You get to see everything and everyone from Neil warming up Alex goofing off and Geddy stressing about his hair  This is one of the only times the boys' have provided this indepth look into the band and is worth the price of the DVD set alone in my opinion.I will admit the screaming fans get a bit much at times but hey when was the last time you've heard of Rush performing to an audience equivalent to the type the Beetles did in the mid 60's?  It's truly awe inspiring.".

This concert is one of the peak moments of the history of Rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever.I was lucky enough to actually be in this concert and not only that I was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage!! It's the first and only time I've seen a Rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me. I have no words to accurately describe this experience but I can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life.Some people complain about the sound of this DVD saying it is not very clear and polished but the sound you listen is real true to how it was in the concert. It is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time I watch it I go back and relive that beautiful moment. Many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was. Sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing. This is not the case with Rush in Rio this is the real deal!! I admit that I enjoy those fancy sounding concert DVD's I love music and the sound is a very important aspect but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest. You listen to Rush just the way they sound in a live performance no tricks no tweaks. This is a real live concert DVD.I highly recommend Rush in Rio the setlist is fantastic and the performances by Geddy Alex and Neil are mindblowing. Not to mention the crowd you can see how much they love Rush and sing along to every tune even YYZ which is an instrumental!! I actually appear singing twice in Tom Sawyer I sing always hopeful yet discontent and in Earthshine I sing only reflect. It's just a few seconds but I simply couldn't believe my eyes when I saw myself in a rush DVD!! Awesome!! I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on Earth.".

For any nonRush fan this DVD is an enjoyable concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians.  We have rather firmly stood by them for years.  I've shown this DVD or portions of it anyway to those who have never heard of Rush or those who think Rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock i.e. sex drugs and a drunken frenzy.

After 30 years of honing their unique sound it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever.The concert features over two dozen songs a documentary and three songs that feature multiangle viewing.  Packaged in a bifold holder with sleeve and a small insert it's priced very well for the amount of material it contains.I'm a Rush fan of the late seventies to early eighties period and this DVD comes through big with half of the show highlighting songs from that era. I won't list the songs in case you want to be surprised.  If you attended the Vapor Trails tour then you'll know what they'll be playing.Playing in Rio to their biggest crowd ever Rush is a huge crowd pleaser here.  In fact that was one of the first things I noticed that was peculiar about this show.  Throughout most of this two hour concert you hear and see the crowd actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music.  At first it's heartening to see the fans give Rush a well deserved response.  But after several songs I was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd.  This is in no way a slam of the crowd of Rio.  More power to them!  It's a critique of the final editing of the DVD.Which brings me to my second and main reason I hate it.  The video editing is terrible in my opinion.  Save for the multiangle view bonus cuts the entire show is a frenzy of visual chaos.  It's like the director wanted to see how spastic he could make it.  I count changing camera angles on average between every one and four seconds constantly!  After about three or four songs my head and eyes were ready for a break.  Which is too bad because I would have liked to have sat through the whole show like I was able to at the concert last year.  Maybe this fastcut editing is the latest craze for concert DVD's but I really think it's an annoyance and detraction from the overall experience.  As stated before I wouldn't mind it for a song or two but the whole visual aspect of this disc is hurried or RUSHed. It's really ironic because all the previous concert clips I've seen of Rush mainly from Moving Pictures are strictly straightfilmed with little switching back and forth.  It's almost boring visually speaking.  This DVD has taken it to the other extreme.  I know a lot of dyedinthewool Rush fans will vehemently disagree with my statements but that's just my impression of it.The bottom line  If you're a Rush fan you'll buy this DVD regardless of my review or any other.  I still would have bought it after I had read my review.  Just don't get expect a normal concert.  Who knows the things mentioned above might not bother you.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you so that you absorb it as it is and thus experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding remote possibly dangerous beware of what lies within! The haunting chords of the music seen over the 20thFox logo usher us into titles of otherworldly turquoise lettering.Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we are descending into some vault of antiquity wherein might be great treasures mixed with uncertain hazards. One might imagine Darryl Zanuck commanding 'Make it ancient!' Then what a darkly dramatic story unfolds all within the same tone set at the start.Of Hollywood's mid50s 'Egyptian Trilogy' 'The Ten Commandments' portrayed the civilization's sternness the phenomenal 'Land of the Pharaohs' its nuts and bolts while 'The Egyptian' shows it all from glamour to tragedy for us to wonder at.No need to say much about the players here but I think that with the passage of time Bella Darvi is being redeemed. What a perfect face for the role right out of a Symbolist painting. If her acting does not please some it might be argued that in her role as a 'courtesan' she is obviously better in bed than yakking to some poor helpless admirer. I think that Curtiz captured the kinkiness of her sadomasochistic relationship with Edmund Purdom's character with aplomb censorship being what it was at the time. Sir Peter Ustinov in his memoirs was pretty kind to 'The Egyptian' writing that it was 'like being lost in a huge set for 'Aida'. His pronunciation of the word 'beer' I have adopted myself ever after.One of the film's historically accurate references the Egyptian's invented beer! Henry Daniell egads what a perfect performance. Gene Tierney what a screen treasure. Bless DFZ for giving her this 'late' role. C'mon folks don't be so hard on Victor Mature! He's a cheesemaker's son! Who rose to be pharaoh! Sounds like a peculiarly American opportunity. One of the best moments John Carradine's existential observations on the sands of time. And Purdom's utterance about dwelling beyond the sunset of the world. If that isn't Grade 'A' epicness what is?Of course along with everything else the music is sublime. It is frequently noted that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created one of the screen's most compelling scores perfectly harmonious yet each theme is well developed with a life of its own. Newman pressed for time by DFZ called in Herrmann someone he could trust implicitly to take up half the burden.Benny not the easiest guy to work with obviously respected Newman enough to really deliver inspiring music. They alternated cues an ingenious approach. No spoilers as to who did what here but Benny brings an edge with him mysterious awesome sounds. Alfred brings fulsomeness longing poignancy. Both are consummately epic. Even when seen on a squeezed TV print the effect of seeing the two composers' names side by side in the main credits which the ultrawide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate is spinetingling.Leon Shamroy the Dean of CinemaScope does not let us down here. The lurid greens and moody shadows probably distortions in all the terrible TV prints I've seen through the years perfectly accompany the multidimensional script by the great Philip Dunne and WB vet Casey Robinson whom Curtiz must've brought with him to 20th. How remarkable it is that Shamroy who was as much of an institution of cinematography at Fox as Newman was with music would lens 'Cleopatra' a few years later but in the brighter sharper images of '60s Todd AO. These old studio guys are really heroes of mine.To me who wants to fret about all the imperfections and criticism opportunities in a picture like this? I'd rather yield entirely to its spell and dive off into its sea of lavishness to emerge after the inspiring climax of 'The End' refreshed moved and hungry for more.And yes we should cry out to 20thFox for a DVD release worthy of DFZ's legacy.".

	schema:headline " And starring Bella Darvi!";
	schema:reviewBody "Few people realize it but there was world literature in the ancient world before the Greeks came on the scene. Besides the literary remains that are in the Old Testament of the Jews there were considerable works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The summit of the former were the religious poetry and The Epic Of Gilgamesh. The Egyptians produced many poems but there main addition was a tale of adventure of a traveler and physician called The Story Of Sinuhe. It is from this work actually a fragment that we don't know the ending of that the novel The Egyptian came from.The story is unique as is the movie. The Egyptian was a best seller in the early 1950s and Darryl Zanuck decided to take a chance making it yes he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer as well as the rest of the cast Victor Mature Edmund Purdom Peter Ustinov Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney but he was aware that these films rarely made large box office. One can chalk up this as an example of Zanuck trying something different.The number of movies that deal with ancient Egypt are very small. Land Of The Pharoahs The Egyptian The Ten Commandments both De Mille versions Moses Holy Moses! Cleopatra The Mummy all versions The Scorpion King. If there are 20 films about ancient Egypt it's is tremendous. But The Egyptian is unique. While the second Ten Commandments discusses Ramses the Great Pharoah Ramses II  Yul Brynner and his father Seti I Cedric Hardwicke and the films on Cleopatra deal with her few other names of ancient Egypt crop up in film. Egypt's greatest Pharoah was Thutmose III who conquered most of the known middle east of the era of 1470 B.C.E. or so. No film about him has appeared nor of his usurping predecessor history's first great female ruler Hatschepsut. But the only known Pharoah who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the Jews and later the Christians attempted  a type of monotheism  is the subject of The Egyptian. This is Pharoah Akhnaton.In reality Akhnaton was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not meant for public consumption. But it angered the priestly class who worshiped Amon rather than Aton. Due to our uncertain historic records although Akhnaton's official records  the TelelAmana letters  are quite complete as far as they survive we do not know if the Pharoah was killed in a palace coup or not. However he died he was succeeded by a young brother or son of his whose name is better recalled than any other Pharoah except Ramses Tutankhamon.This film is actually quite good as far as it goes. Wilding makes a good natured Akhnaton who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer is supposed to be. Mature is good as the ambitious and  outside the film  ultimately successful future Pharoah Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom do well in their lead parts and Ustinov is good as Purdom's friend. Also good is Ms Darvi in a large supporting part. In a wonderful cameo is John Carridine as a philosophical grave robber. The film is certainly worthy of viewing as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of Ancient Egypt.".

No film about him has appeared nor of his usurping predecessor history's first great female ruler Hatschepsut. But the only known Pharoah who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the Jews and later the Christians attempted  a type of monotheism  is the subject of The Egyptian. This is Pharoah Akhnaton.In reality Akhnaton was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not meant for public consumption. But it angered the priestly class who worshiped Amon rather than Aton. Due to our uncertain historic records although Akhnaton's official records  the TelelAmana letters  are quite complete as far as they survive we do not know if the Pharoah was killed in a palace coup or not. However he died he was succeeded by a young brother or son of his whose name is better recalled than any other Pharoah except Ramses Tutankhamon.This film is actually quite good as far as it goes. Wilding makes a good natured Akhnaton who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer is supposed to be. Mature is good as the ambitious and  outside the film  ultimately successful future Pharoah Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom do well in their lead parts and Ustinov is good as Purdom's friend. Also good is Ms Darvi in a large supporting part. In a wonderful cameo is John Carridine as a philosophical grave robber. The film is certainly worthy of viewing as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of Ancient Egypt.";

	schema:headline " When the power of sword clashed with the power of thought...";
	schema:reviewBody "Film historians have said much about ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors from the beginning of cinema. The pioneers of such epics particularly biblical ones were D.W Griffith with his mother of all epics INTOLERANCE 1916 and Cecil B DeMille with his flair for magnificent spectacles costumes and lavish scenes. Who can forget his TEN COMMANDMENTS 1923 1956 or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS 1932? Nevertheless here comes another epic made in the 1950s directed by Michael Curtiz and based on the novel by Mika Waltari The Egyptian. Michael Curtiz already famous for his great classic CASABLANCA 1941 wonderfully manages to adjust his film to the audiences of that time to entail the most important ideas and facts from the thick novel and to recreate the lifestyle of the Egyptians who lived in one of the most amazing periods in the reign of Akhnaton.The first and most important fact for me in this movie is the psychological development of the main character that Edmund Purdom plays. Sinuhe having been brought up in a simple family by his step parents becomes a physician. All his life he never stops asking a question why? and searching for the answer. Alluring love that he finds in a courtesan Nefer Bella Darvi leads him to financial and spiritual disaster. He has to repair the mistakes by hard work in the House of Death and starting to build up his reputation from nothing. First he thinks that the only cure is revenge. However in the long run he realizes that eye for eye is no solution. Finally what stands before him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh. Nevertheless there is one moment he finds the answer for his questions that touched him throughout his life... The story of the main character though based on the book is so interesting psychologically that every open minded person should consider this aspect in the film. The main character's psychological struggle is intensified by the times he lived in the times when probably for the first time to that extend the power of sword clashed with the power of thought.Curtiz's movie also retains one rule that all films of his era kept to great cast and lavish sets. There are mostly British actors and actresses who give very nice performances. How is it possible not to mention the mainstay of ancient epic Victor Mature. This time he is not Demetrius Hannibal or Samson but Horemheb  a fighter a lover at last a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role of Merit a woman who loved Sinuhe all her life but it was too late when he realized that. Peter Ustinov probably most famous for his gorgeous performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? three years earlier does a great job as Kaptah Sinuhe's friend. The royalty of the film is also played by two great cast Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as cold desirous of power Baketamon the sister of pharaoh. Wilding gives a marvelous performance as insane Akhnaton. When I was in Louvre in Paris and saw Akhnaton's original face carved in stone he looked very much the same as the actor in the film. Bella Darvi an actress born in Poland is quite memorable as a wicked courtesan Nefer. And there is one more actress who appears only in one scene but whom it is hard to forget Judith Evelyn as Taia pharaoh's mother. This voice these eyes!The sets are magnificent. The director recreated the most probable image of the outdoor temple of Aaton the god that the Egyptians worshiped to in the reign of Amenhotep IV. I also loved the scene of pharaoh's first entrance. What a glorious picture that forever lasts in one's memory!!! However there is also one aspect that I would like to draw the attention of all people interested to see the film. The Egyptian is similar to other epics in many respects but it also stands out as a unique film. There are very few films which make such a wonderful use of different curiosities as for ancient times. There is a mention of iron used first by the Hetites. It's also the only film about ancient Egypt which talks openly of Egyptians' magnificent curing abilities. It memorably shows the contrasts of lifestyles particularly the moment of a slave's death for whom no one cares followed by the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after the death of pharaoh. Finally The Egyptian shows one historical fact there were other nations except for Jews before Christ where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. Yet the only difference was that it did not survive that long as at Jews' because it did not have a strong fundament. The scene of Akhnaton's death supplies you with so many biblical and Christian values that you may think you watch a religious movie.All things considered I highly recommend Michael Curtiz' film. It is a great production at multiple levels an entertainment for epic fans an admiration of marvelous performances for cinema fans a soul feast for spiritual people. Finally it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things which happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.".

The production values  are great regarding color and cinematography and it appears some  effort went into historical authenticity much of it from the novel  I'm sure. Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role but one  can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character. Victor Mature is well  Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is a delight to watch in this type of  role which he always did so well and so wittily. Bella Darvi's  performance as Nefer is classically camp and I find even Michael  Wilding's rather dry portrayal of Akenaten to have its own appeal.  The historical oddity of Akenaten's monotheism a brief detour in  ancient Egypt's theological history is interesting as is Akenaten  himself and well worth reading about the religious wars portrayed  here have a basis in fact.  An interesting footnote regarding Darvi whose birth name was Bayla  Wegier she was a Polish migr who producer Darryl Zanuck and his wife  Virginia took under their wing I believe they may even have adopted  her. Her screen name Darvi is formed from Zannuck's and his wife's  first names. She continued her acting career in France but never  achieved great success and after a rather unhappy life died at her  own hand in 1971.  Altogether this is an interesting film and enjoyable to watch for the  visual values alone. American Movie Classics shows this occasionally in  letterbox which is essential to capturing the scope and sweep of the  story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Egyptian has several pluses that make up for a rather slow pace. There is plenty to the story which involves a lot of action as well as some interesting themes and there is a lot of good scenery and cinematography. Most of the cast is pretty good and there is an assortment of interesting characters.The setting in ancient Egypt works well and is used to good effect.  It makes for many interesting sights which are filmed nicely and used well in the story.  The plot does a good job of weaving the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten who tried to bring monotheism to Egypt into the lives of the main characters.  As the central character Edmund Purdom is all right but some of the other characters often command more attention.  Victor Mature is particularly convincing as the nononsense Horemheb and Peter Ustinov steals more than one scene as Purdom's assistant.The only real flaw is the length.  While there is plenty to the story there are times when it moves quite slowly and it doesn't seem as if it would have been all that hard to shorten some of the scenes.  In particular some of the speeches that summarize the conflict of ideas among the characters would have been more effective if they had not been quite so wordy.But overall this is a good movie and it works pretty well both as a period piece and as a story.".

I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming but over all this is the best film to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's The Egyptian in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows. The late Edmond Purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years. He states that he keeps to himselfhas the best education available and lets' face it is a rather emotionally distant person given his upbringing and high intellect.Jean Simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid honest loving and sincere. Bella Darvi people complained about her accent well she is a Babylonian. It is not that apparent in the film as to why Sinhue is so insanely obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer. Her correct name. In the book Sinhue is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving Nefer Nefer Nefer's drugged body with the House of the Dead's  workers.Gene Tierney as Baketaten is brilliant! When she tells Sinhue that he is pharoah she looks like she could devour him in his weakness. She is intense brilliant and coldly beautiful.Michael Wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one God. I believe that we are viewing Ankhnaten thru the lens of Egyptologist A. Weigall. A view at the time that had a premessiah feeling about Ankhnaten's vocation. Did his monotheism influence the Jewish people? Note Psalm 104. and other Egyption imagery in the psalms?Mr. Peter Ustinov provided the alter ego to Sinhue. He is street wise and cunning a survivor. Excellent acting as always.Mature never thought much of his acting personally His Horemheb is fine as an ambitious super patriot who ultimately has Sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power Walteri's book.I felt that the ending to The Egyptian was confusing as Sinhue's personality changes too easily. He has a living son Toth dies in the novel power is handed to him through is half sister Baketaten he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs. So he became enlightened? He could have modified the Amon Priesthood as he was capable.But NO! Sinhue gives everything up everything including his son's future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love?This change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script!Again the look of the filmcolour most of the costumesNefer Nefer Nefer's gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family music is beautiful.I will watch this film again easily.P.S. I know that you porbably know that Horemheb did not directly succceed Ankhnaten but I could not resist stating this fact.".

She falls under his spell and under the spell of the belief in one god.Victor Mature overacts perfectly as Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere as Sinhue the lost physician does he find redemption? Stay tuned. Even Bela Darvi the woman who steals Sinhue's heart isn't as bad as everyone has said. The fact that she was Daryl F. Zanuck's mistress had nothing to do with the casting  right? Yeah right...still she wasn't that bad  I've seen worse. I think she did better in The Egyptian than many of today's young actresses have done in anything.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie tries to depict itself as a historical movie based on ancient Egyptian literature. The props are quite bad they use Roman style dresses late ones but it was typical for 50ies. They also depict history in a completely wrong way it is so bad on so many levels! Basically it is Biblical story based on pure fantasy very vaguely based on ancient Egypt. In fact it is hardcore rape of both ancient Egyptian history and the ancient Egyptian literature.First story of Sinuhet is from The Old Kingdom. The movie takes place in The New Kingdom during the ruling of Achnaton who was kinda crazy man who almost destroyed the country because of his forced approach to introduce new religion and abolishing of the old one. In the reality he did not care about the consequences and used terror to achieve his ends. In the movie however he is pictured almost as Moses he is very wise mild and kind. On the other hand the general Haremheb who in reality managed to salvage the country from the ruins of the Achnaton's experiment is depicted as murderer and cruel dictator.The country was not invaded by Hittites at the time of Achnaton as the movie depicts. The decay was based solely on the new religion that is not only admired because it was the first monotheist religion but at the very end of the movie the reality is even more twisted to the incredible conclusion that the Amon was actually the God of the Christians! This is actually very wrong even by Biblical standards because Aton was the face of the Sun. The ankh is compared to the cross which is completely wrong because ankh is very ancient symbol of life whereas the cross is the symbol of death  sacrifice. The fact the pharaoh decides to sacrifice himself for some reason is displayed almost like Christstyle. It is blatant and deliberate lie. It is twist of reality comparable to making movie where Hitler is depicted as nice animal loving extrovert who is forced to fight the world in attempt to defend the freedom of people of Europe. It is THAT huge bunch of lies really! The pictures are nice. The message is sick. I really do not know what is worse there The incredible preaching style lies or the fact the movie completely abused and destroyed interesting book of ancient literature. There is almost no similarity to the Story of Sinuhet including the ending that is absolutely wrong even in the style of the ending  the ending of original story is positive Sinuhet is pardoned by pharaoh and he is even given a tomb which was very high honor. In this pseudo evangelic movie it ends positively also Sinuhet is pushed into the exile dies poor and alone yet almost screams the Christian preachings from his lips. There is zero respect to the Egyptian history. It is completely twisted just to create another pseudo Christian movie. This is so so wrong. So wrong!".

I enjoyed the film the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a family saga rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time 1955. The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. In this film he was portrayed as being Jesus like in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites even through they were invading Egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power. Initially one makes a connection between Sinuhe who was cast adrift in the river Nile in a reed basket and the Old Testament Moses. But this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a Moses like character carries Akhenaton's monotheistic religion out to the wider world if such a film will ever be politically possible to make. It is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit the character played by Jean Simmons is hard to accept. And that Sinuhe an educated physician would be so smitten by Nefer the Babylonian femme fatal to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and Tomb is not really believable neither that his parents would even have a tomb. In real life Nefer Nefertitti was the wife of Akhenaton. And although Horemheb did become Pharaoh it was after a few others including Tutankhamen  who was the son of Akhenaton.But of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. Maybe following The De Vinci Code book and film this film be remade with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism! I wait in great anticipation of such a film there are already numerous books on the subject.".

Around the heroall the characters appeardisappearappear againbut when they reappear they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill.Besidesas such is often the case in modern  melodramas the story is a long flashbackframed by two short sequences showing Sinouh an old man who's remembering.This is a wonderful sword and sandalsthat had a strong influencenot only in America but also in Europanotably in Poland where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a spellbinding faraon 1966 which owed a lot to Curtiz.".

Around the heroall the characters appeardisappearappear againbut when they reappear they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill.Besidesas such is often the case in modern  melodramas the story is a long flashbackframed by two short sequences showing Sinouh an old man who's remembering.This is a wonderful sword and sandalsthat had a strong influencenot only in America but also in Europanotably in Poland where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a spellbinding faraon 1966 which owed a lot to Curtiz.";

Yes the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination eh? In high school I read the book and made a promise to myself to one day take that dream trip. Now true this film was made in the old school style meaning that Egyptians were portrayed by pink skinned and blueeyed Brits. However has anyone seen the current HBO series ROME? Everything old is olde again. One can't imagine why in this day and age we are still casting actors mincing around as Mayfair aristocrats in Roman drag. Not one actor on ROME could pass for an ancient Italian. That being said the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. This film is immensely appealing  to borrow a word from NEFER for its historical information BEER! BRAIN SURGERY! IRON! and its gorgeous cinematography and score. I have a dreadful Taiwan DVD version which I watch over and over again praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available. For anyone else interested in this subject I highly recommend the historical novel A God Against The Gods by the author of Advise and Consent. If anyone of you film buffs out there knows how to contact Fox to urge them on please let me know!".

The film is very LOOSELY based upon Mika Waltari's well researched novel which centers around the Egyptian physician Sinhue's adventures at the court of Akhnaton as well as his travels throughout Canaan Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately due to the moral strictures of the time much of Sinhue's story which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits remains on the cutting room floor and instead the audience is treated to reels and reels of Victor Mature's wooden acting. Even Gene Tierney  a leading lady staple of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs. polytheism but Michael Wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel. My advice buy the book from EBay rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and then call it a night!".

ANTM lets you live out this dream and see what it really takes to be a supermodel. The crazy fashion industry people long photo shoot days hair  makeup to the extreme a lot of mirror  runway practice and the continual criticism. It kind of puts it into perspective and makes you realise that modelling is a tough job.As the seasons have progressed we have experienced many changes in the judging panel as well as celebrity guests. None has been as controversial though as the loss of Nigel Barker Mr. Jay Manual and Miss Jay. Initially when it happened I was shocked and bitterly disappointed. I thought the new panel were hacks and thought the show would never be as good. Turns out the success really has nothing to do with the panel but has everything to do with the drama created by the contestants and the amazing photo shoots they do. Even Kelly Cutrone has grown on me after first thinking she was one of the most disgusting people on the planet. I do still think that she is bitter that she never was able to be a model.America's Next Top Model is my guilty pleasure show that I refuse to feel guilty for. I will continue to watch it until the day it goes off the air just like many other people around the world. It may not be an intellectually superior show but it does entertain you.".

It really is too bad a lot of them are in denial. Anyway let's go through a typical season or cycle I should say because Tyra has to be menstrual.I stole that from someone funny. The first episode generally starts a clip show with a Tyralogue about modeling. How far she made me how she struggled how she isor was depending on who you favor 1. Then we go through 30something young girls who get flown in to some city for an inperson interview of sorts so Tyra can get a glimpse of their TV personalities and hear sob stories. The Tyra makes a series of cuts to get down to the top 10 12 13 or 14 contestants.Almost all the episodes after that generally go like this we open with the btches I mean aspiring models in Tyra's egohouse. There's fighting there's laughing there's the focususually on the girl who is going to be ceremoniously sacked by the end of the episode.The girl's are then sent to a few things sometimes in a different order. The first is usually some sort of contest to depict who can do the best at something stupid. Blah blah blah. Then comes the photo shoot. The photo shoots are generally the second best thing in the show second only to the pictures that are shown during panel.Of course there are usually some episodes throughout the seasoncycle that break the robotedness. The first is always the makeover episode generally 3 or 4 episodes in. Everyone gets a dramatically awesome hair makeoveror not in a lot of cases and there's always some menstrual case whiningexcept for cycle 8 where when no one whined enough they had to take out Jael's cute extensions just to really irritate.And then there's the episode where the girls do an acting session and star in a commercial or something of the like. And sometimes we get a clip show where no one is eliminated and nothing is all that interesting. And of course there's always the episode where the girls get sent to a foreign fashion capitoland apparently any big city in the world is a fashion capitol to TyTy and someone gets sent home without being there for 24 hours.Then the final episode shakes it up a bit. Because there are only 3 contestants left we must suffer two eliminations where Tyra reminds us what the winner gets. And it's always the same thing. A modeling contract and a magazine spreadIt was with Elle Magazine the first few cycles but I think when they realized this show didn't turn out any actual TOP models TyTy's winner's got dropped to Seventeen Magazine. So yeah they usually do a CoverGirl shoot to pick the final two and then do a fashion show... before evaluating both finalists and usually picking in my opinion except for Cycles 1 and 7 the worst of the duo.In all honesty this show doesn't really turn out what you could call Big Winners but it's entertaining when you need a guilty pleasure amount of trash in your week. Enjoy.".

That was tasteless forced and also for ratings. What is your motto? Make them go further than they want till they cry? WTH?So very disgusted with that aspect not to mention the nudity. They made all the models pose nude on television. I imagine if one didn't want to do it they would have been sent home so they're under a lot of pressure to comply.I won't ever watch this stupid show again. How many girls on that show are under 21 and photographed naked? That can ruin a person for life. I don't care what your stupid excuses are. It's for ratings  the almighty DOLLAR. It's not art. It's a disgusting display for your ratings and it should be stopped. Gratuitous nudity is UNCALLED for. Poor girls I feel bad for them being FORCED to be photographed naked. Bad call. Never watch again.".

It has a great hostess has great guests a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model but yes the America's Next Pop Model. The show gets together a bunch of models without any experience with different personalities and big personal professional and financial problems giving them a chance for bringing to life a dream or to make their lives something worthy. It's obvious that Tyra Banks uses all that for her advantage she gives the dream but in exchange for that she gains audience and more popularity. Anyway she deserves it because she is intelligent and if I might say that a pioneer to this kind of show. Tyra also is a great observer and knows how to give based opinions differing herself of other models and hostess of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil as an example Fernanda Motta is its hostess and onceuponatimeTop Model. She doesn't have even 110 of Tyra's professional skills which keeps Tyra Banks on the top. Tyra have professional and personal knowledge about what she says and she's a great mentor because she not only criticizes but she points the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom.The show doesn't suffer from big problems it does and fulfills what it promises during the cycles. The models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models of entire country because Tyra Banks bets with the difference and she is right because she and also good part of her audience believes that it's time for the modeling world to change some straight parameters. During the cycles she and her team really makes fair deliberations where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new chances to prove their capacities but must be fast to do that otherwise they lose it.Other very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows to decide who should or shouldn't win even when she's against people's opinion. She knows that whoever wins will be famous but has a very few possibilities to truly be a worldwide recognized top model. At the same way she knows that some times the second place is more valuable than the first because 1st place wins the title but second doesn't gets the title stigma. Hardly she makes mistakes when she decides the future of any model during the show.After 9 cycles the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines because it's getting boring and comparing to the firsts cycles we can see that she's getting bored too so she needs to do that if she wants the show to live a little longer.Anyway the show explores the fashion and modeling world but it's also entertaining for those ones that live outside all of that. It gives the opportunity for some girls and also the market and also gives great tips for those ones from the audience who shares the same dream.".

All of this slides smoothly with just the right beat. There are no lenghts.Of course there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we don't see in the shows The panel is made up of capricious divas extroverted and quick on the bitching woe to those who offends them!

Like in many other realitybased shows each week one contestant is voted off and must pack her bags and immediately leave a thing that they are reminded by Tyra at every turn. Of course there is the bitchy tension between several of the more typeA females female bonding tears dramatic swells of music in key moments and some truly breathtaking pictures that transform erstwhile ordinary pretty girls into unattainable goddesses.I'll have to admit the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's the state of mind I'm in but I kept wondering where the vomitorium was in cases when the already thin girls would need to hurl to make the cut and look the way the judges and photographers and many fickle designers would feel was correct for the moment. Even so it's drawn me in despite my previous paragraph possibly because I've always had an interest in the fashion world and have always loved watching stunning women being made even more unworldly with make up and perfect lighting. But I wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's as if they were competing with Fear Factor. Shoots that look like reenactments of fight scenes in CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON shoots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations What's next posing while tied to train tracks as an oncoming Amtrak roars upon them at 70 miles an hour? Or a shoot where they are underwater chained trying to set themselves free in record time while at the same time looking smashing in chiffon and never ever forgetting to smile their pearly whites at that camera? How about a Pit and the Pendulum version of a photo shoot?In one thing the show has to be given some kudos and it's in a way akin to American Idol. With this I'm probably going to justify the harshness of both shows and its abrasive judges  and essentially go against my initial paragraph. America's Next Top Model is a show that is an extended audition like American Idol and in it the girls will get the sort of test treatment they will receive in the real world where prospective designers and photographers as monstrously fickle as they can be will crush them to bits at the drop of a hat if they can't sell themselves the way they're expected to and where one is asked to leave another will supplant her with the necessary requirements. Which makes it a wonder that any girl would want to get into such a difficult media but that's what dreams are made of.Going into its Fifth season it's been a major disappointment with the departure of Janice Dickinson during her run she was a pretty tough barometer as to how the girls should walk talk emote express themselves and ultimately present themselves as a walking living product that sells. With the cold addition of Twiggy I wonder where it will go from here  Twiggy just can't replace the overthetop temperament of Dickinson. So with Janice's absence the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow demise but in the meantime it's still a catchy pleasure to watch mindless entertainment on weeknights if at all for the gorgeous visuals. If at all it's the show that launched Adrienne Curry into the spotlight. Curry has made a name for herself due to facts that have less to do with modeling as much as her theatric loveaffair with one time child actor Christopher Knight in their very own reality soap opera.".

No other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject.Many women try out for slots to compete for Americas Next Top Model. They live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim You will see me again. Heck I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win actually.This is the dream of some girls and good for them. In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way  like to college.I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group. That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. The full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose  so of course that would make them look even fatter  a ploy fashionatas use all the time. Bad bad Tyra and crew.But to be fair Americas Next Top Model is not about full figured models it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty  and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations. Hence Tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get. But then again that IS the one thing I like about this show  the exmodel giving others who wouldn't have the chance  a chance to enter the doors. But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.".

And Tyra Banks will still be hosting the shows even though she has retired from modeling she is stll a hugh part of the show. Being the creatorexecutive producer she will still go on. I really want this show to go on. This show is really great and hopefully there will be at least be 5 more seasons till the show ends because I don't think that this show should end any time soon !!!!!!!

This show is really great and hopefully there will be at least be 5 more seasons till the show ends because I don't think that this show should end any time soon !!!!!!!

People come in all shapes  sizes  they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36 inseam is tall  slender  a size 5 I am more average at a size 12. We would like to see both I can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me. I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. Thank you.".

It looks like American Idol gone sexy but I'm a guy and I only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis! The show can be quite boring when it comes to judging Tyra tends to go on and on and it's really offputting. Anyway would I recommend it?

Each week one girl will leave based on the opinion of the panel of judges and the results of their most recent modelling assignment. Of course there is also the ongoing risk of some bitchy infighting but really we're all here to try and learn how the fashion industry works.You may have detected a hint of sarcasm in my last sentence and you would be correct in that observation because personally I find the professional fashion industry to be a vacuous waste of space whose only purpose to me seems to be to provide laughs at the clichs they embrace. And so it is with this show because really I don't know anyone who watches it in order to see the girls embrace their natural talent for modelling no we're pretty much all here to see and partake in just one series long bitching session. As a formula the series doesn't do much to discourage this view because it doesn't have a lot going on other than this. The modelling shoots are fairly boring affairs on their own terms and it is hard to care about a look that nobody can really define.Of course this is part of the problem. Because so much of it is indefinable it pretty much makes whatever the judges say right or wrong depending on how much you buy into them as experts. So they say things like they hate that look or they love that look but really it is hard to see what they are seeing and none of them bother to really explain their reasons. Of course this plays into their hands because generally the judges are fairly worthless fashion divas who are there to stir things up a bit and don't have much of value to say. The girls themselves are fairly interesting but not in a good way  they are mainly basket cases swarming to an industry that eats up young girls and spits them out. Some of them are nice and don't last long others are bitchy and last longer  presumably because the judges know that they need the ratings more than they need to actually produce a top model. They are mostly all good looking in various different ways but there are few I would want to spend much in the way of time with.Overall then this is a fairly pointless and vacuous show but then I suppose that is the point. With a talent that is so less tangible than singing or dancing the comments of the judges and the individual performances of the contestants become less important than the bitchy histrionics between the contestants and with the tutors  judges. On this level it is amusing and distracting but never good television although it is worth a look if you are looking to veg in front of reality television and have no demands for anything that could be considered good on a tradition scale.".

But let's go back to 2004 early 2008The best thing about this show is the girls. These girls shared the same dream with an amount of the female population. Each one comes from a different background. Each one has a different set of assets and tastes. All are put together in a beautiful mansion some cycles. Girls' age ranges from 18 to 26 going through an emotional experience no matter if they've wanted it since they were 8 or just a few months before they participated. Because it's a weird competition the 6week period is going to have a big impact whether they like it or not. And us folks from outside get to catch a glimpse of it.It's a careerbased reality TV which demands a lot of tension. It started off very promising though does not deliver. We'd see passionate young women who aren't in it just for the sake for one in a lifetime experience or Tyra Banks or because they're homeless at the moment or a TV personality kind of fame or a 10000dollarcheck although that couldn't hurt or for a man. We get to see what they are about. They are by far seem more realistic than ones from other shows. Sad thing is if the girl is against Tyra's will in some way such as the weight factor and the Tyrawilldosomethingwithyourhairevenifitisfortheworse factor and the future career factor she'll in eliminated for contrived reasons by Miss Banks. And it's frustrating to watch. Miss Tyra exaggerated modeling industry added in a bunch of weird unrealistic stuff when she's not even a real good supermodel herself. Nevertheless it's still watchable. The show featured superstar athletes musicians bartenders waitresses rich kids young mothers painters college students high schoolers in senior year shopkeepers strippers former models Jesus freaks and more. Some aren't doing what they really want to do. Some are doing just fine but want to model as well. The contestants get to find out more about everything through fellow contestants. Some of them become and stay best friends for life they've become bridesmaids and godmothers. Some of them find out more about one another and leave. Some girls had a lesbian crush on fellow contestants. They are excluded from the outside world. They only have phones and packages from people at home and rare occasional visits in case they win reward challenges. Though they'll be judged individually they have to have friends in the house. It creates a very interesting dynamic. In some cycles there'd be one girl whom all the other contestants root for in case they don't win or one girl that nobody could stand. A lot of them are hilarious. A lot of them are deep and cultured. Some have blemished history. Some are very adorable. Some are affected and annoying. Some of them are very strange and dull to the point we think they're fake. Some are mentally limited bitches. Some are crazy and wacky. The editing absolutely tweaks how these girls really are but if we look closely and pay attention from the beginning that they get little air times we won't be surprised by their people from home's comments and social networks' pages. They're inspiring and memorable and very cool despite the fact that they could disguise as pretty 16yearold mall rats. These are the only people from reality shows that I become real fans of. Can't deny that it has a lot to offer to the audience and a couch potato like me.It kinda gets girls who usually wouldn't audition for reality shows that have a lot to do with personalities such as Survivor or to be a subordinate such as Hell's Kitchen and The Apprentice end up showing their personalities. The antics that they make the little games they play the night outs that they go so they can chill and take their minds of the competition are real.".

	schema:reviewBody "ANTM has proved to be one of the most interesting and enjoyable programs that TV currently has to offer. After already 6 seasons you'd expect that this show is going to be headed for a nasty end and I'm sorry to say this but you are right. After Janice left the show hasn't been what made it what it is today.Cycle 1 was my favorite cycle because the models were fresh the concept of the show was fresh and the models were actually expecting to become rich and famous now the models end up as 15 minute celebrities doing cameo appearances on E.This show is a reality series but because of the editing and voiceovers etc. it seems staged and 'fake'. Has anyone ever noticed how they seem to fit more into each episode in cycles 123 and 4 but not in the last 2 seasons? The last 2 seasons have been overedited and almost cartoonish because of the silly computerized sound effects. It just seems that they leave so much out and replace it with catchy background music and flashy scenery.Race has also been a bit of trouble on the show. Their are complaints over some of the winners because they are white or black and the previous winner was this or was that. I HONESTLY think that race might have a little to do with it but it also depends on talent and skill.Don't get me wrong I love the show BUT if they showed us what truly happens in the model house and what the judges truly think i would think that they would attract more viewers. I hope this show doesn't end soon because it is entertaining and i guess informative in a way too. This show is now a phenomenon around the world so it should live up to its expectations".

After already 6 seasons you'd expect that this show is going to be headed for a nasty end and I'm sorry to say this but you are right. After Janice left the show hasn't been what made it what it is today.Cycle 1 was my favorite cycle because the models were fresh the concept of the show was fresh and the models were actually expecting to become rich and famous now the models end up as 15 minute celebrities doing cameo appearances on E.This show is a reality series but because of the editing and voiceovers etc. it seems staged and 'fake'. Has anyone ever noticed how they seem to fit more into each episode in cycles 123 and 4 but not in the last 2 seasons? The last 2 seasons have been overedited and almost cartoonish because of the silly computerized sound effects. It just seems that they leave so much out and replace it with catchy background music and flashy scenery.Race has also been a bit of trouble on the show.

So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision. Alberta Watson also did a fantastic job as the role of Tamara's diseasestricken mother and I must also add that I was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of Megan Park as Tamara's friend Brenda. The film was wonderfully directed by Gail Harvey and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50's way that leaves you feeling warm and happy even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting. I also thought that the film was wellshot many beautiful images of a 1950's countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come. This film as a whole was quirky and great. I found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat openended way I was still left satisfied. Whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful comingofage story or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950's I guarantee this film is for you. Even if you have no expectations it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed. Give this one a shot!".

However The Pursuit of Happiness gave me a better sense of connection with the characters better than this movie did. It's not so much that this was a short movie which it was but it did have a lot to handle in that time period.The characters were portrayed very well considering the how amateur the filmmaking must have been and I enjoyed but most importantly believed how they were all presented. So I do give this movie that note. Though I must admit that the character Rusty was nothing more than just a horny teenager which is real but kind of out of place.I DO NOT regret watching this movie nor am I ashamed. This movie has a lot going for it and I truly understand why people would love this movie and I truly understand why people don't like this movie.

The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave the story of the documentary and the story of the documentarymaker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama. Although the stuff of Hollywood lurks in the details Doug Block treats the story as he would everyday life. For those of us who have always speculated about our parents' life before we came on the scene or after we arrived but while we were too self absorbed to notice they had a life independent of ourselves 51 Birch Street gives fair warning There are wondrous things back there in fatherland but beware if you choose to enter there.But that caution is for the audience to go slow wandering about in the details of their parents' past. It is not a warning for those offered a glimpse into the life of Block's parents. The film is a marvel at making the mother come alive as a vibrant and passionate yet introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions during the 50's. The filmmaker's particular success is to make the viewers actually see the young woman behind the elderly parent and grandparent. We all know our parents were once young and vigorous but in 51 Birch Street the mother is. The father who has been distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing up ultimately remains distant in the film but that is due more to his own elusive nature than to his portrayal. This biography turned autobiography is dramatic intense and unforgettable sure to send viewers scurrying for a closer look at their own family albums but more hesitant about looking at the backs of those photographs.".

All I knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 7.8 Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! If anything they UNDERRATED this little gem.Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother Mina and less than forthcoming dad Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker Mike  Mina's son Doug was going to take us. As a matter of fact I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this!Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a mustsee even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. 51 Birch Street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. BRAVO!!!!!!!!".

We all like to think that our parents lived happy lives that their marriages were full of fulfilment love and happy memories. Sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother. The son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years for as he states posterity. Three months after the death of his mother his father remarries his long time secretary. The suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father. What he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to make do. A wife who found herself at times bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work. She and intellectual at heart he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work. They are obviously wrong for each other this much is clear. Yet they stick it out for what? Well that's part of the mystery they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love. You won't find any truly shocking disclosures here aside from infidelity on both sides which in good part is what makes this such a gem. You really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents.".

	schema:headline " A Total Waste of Time";
	schema:reviewBody "Last fall of 2001 I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie Mark Hoeger.  His vast knowledge of filmmaking his ability to dissect any scene of a film and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director.  When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called Full Ride and was in the postproduction stages my interest was piqued.  However that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project.  Until last week...Last week I saw in a TV listing that Full Ride was going to be showing on the WB network.  This immediately raised a red flag as I can't help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson's Creek Charmed etc.  PLUS the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn't too flattering in itself.  But nevertheless I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation.After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll I thought long and hard about what I had just seen.  What I had just seen was a typical WBquality show stretched out to the length of two hours.  In fact it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network.  Critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical WB show.Where to begin?  The characters are shallow the story is cliche in every sense of the word the scenes are completely contrived and the character development is forced and unbelievable.  This movie just screams unoriginal.'The main character Matt Sabo is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks literally who plays solid high school football as a fullback but then fizzles off into a life of crime.  He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail.  Obviously without much of a choice he agrees to play football with an allstar football team but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.Then comes the love interest.  Of course!  Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest?  She comes in the form of Amy Lear played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe.  She is actually a likable character as opposed to the eversoabrasive Matt Sabo so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first.  But of course the inevitable comes to pass.  She falls for him changes his attitude towards everything and all seems good and happy.  But now it's time for conflict!Earlier in the movie Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn't want to score with him because it would be shameful' to her and her mother.  This is much to Matt's dismay and his football buddies yes they eventually warm up to him who bet him he wouldn't get any.  But of course Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie.  Here's where the exciting plot thickens.  If you don't want me to ruin this surprise then skip ahead.BEGIN SPOILERMatt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the AllStar team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria which is baffling in the first place and make it to the big city.  Suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the big game.'  Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time but he's too hotheaded to buy it.  So what will Matt do?   Will he take her back?  Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an allround jerk?  I won't ruin the superultrasurprising ending for you.END SPOILERSo if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm.  This movie is an uninspired version of Varsity Blues' or Summer Catch.'  And that's not saying much. There's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about.  So what do you have left?  Not a whole lot.What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film.  It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow.  The characters' high hopes for making in the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight but I think he ended up with a very shameful product.  If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne.  While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider.  If Hoeger actually lived here you'd think he'd know better than that.All in all I am completely disappointed in Hoeger's first big film and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thoughtprovoking.".

However that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project.  Until last week...Last week I saw in a TV listing that Full Ride was going to be showing on the WB network.  This immediately raised a red flag as I can't help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson's Creek Charmed etc.  PLUS the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn't too flattering in itself.  But nevertheless I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation.After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll I thought long and hard about what I had just seen.  What I had just seen was a typical WBquality show stretched out to the length of two hours.  In fact it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network.  Critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical WB show.Where to begin?  The characters are shallow the story is cliche in every sense of the word the scenes are completely contrived and the character development is forced and unbelievable.  This movie just screams unoriginal.'The main character Matt Sabo is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks literally who plays solid high school football as a fullback but then fizzles off into a life of crime.  He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail.  Obviously without much of a choice he agrees to play football with an allstar football team but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.Then comes the love interest.  Of course!  Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest?  She comes in the form of Amy Lear played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe.  She is actually a likable character as opposed to the eversoabrasive Matt Sabo so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first.  But of course the inevitable comes to pass.  She falls for him changes his attitude towards everything and all seems good and happy.  But now it's time for conflict!Earlier in the movie Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn't want to score with him because it would be shameful' to her and her mother.  This is much to Matt's dismay and his football buddies yes they eventually warm up to him who bet him he wouldn't get any.  But of course Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie.  Here's where the exciting plot thickens.  If you don't want me to ruin this surprise then skip ahead.BEGIN SPOILERMatt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the AllStar team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria which is baffling in the first place and make it to the big city.  Suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the big game.'  Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time but he's too hotheaded to buy it.  So what will Matt do?   Will he take her back?  Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an allround jerk?  I won't ruin the superultrasurprising ending for you.END SPOILERSo if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm.  This movie is an uninspired version of Varsity Blues' or Summer Catch.'  And that's not saying much. There's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about.  So what do you have left?  Not a whole lot.What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film.  It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow.  The characters' high hopes for making in the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight but I think he ended up with a very shameful product.  If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne.  While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider.  If Hoeger actually lived here you'd think he'd know better than that.All in all I am completely disappointed in Hoeger's first big film and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thoughtprovoking.";

	schema:headline " Desperately Seeking Even Marginally Talented Actors";
	schema:reviewBody "Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of Full Ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story I was too busy during first and only viewing alternating between laughter and nausea.Fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.Unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroe's staggering lack of talent. On the positive side they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age.

	onyx:emotionText "Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of Full Ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story I was too busy during first and only viewing alternating between laughter and nausea.Fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.Unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroe's staggering lack of talent. On the positive side they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age. The basic story is not particularly original just another variation on An Officer and a Gentleman but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of teenage actors.Then again what do I know?

I was so mad with how they ended it...it sort of leaves you hanging and I suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequel...but at the same time I'm almost hesitant to see that since sequels are almost never as good as the first.I totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over!

	schema:reviewBody "First love.  Teenage love.  We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. Friends could be considered an adaptation of the classic The Blue Lagoon originally from 1949 and its remakes from 1980 the most popular one with Brooke Shields and 1999 with a young Milla Jovovich. While The Blue Lagoon puts the two young lovers in a desert island with no contact with civilization Friends goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences. Paul and Michelle who for different reasons turn their backs on family and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in Southern France.  Having only each other and their childhood innocence their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to sustain themselves in this sweet coming of age story. This film even to this day is controversial since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look the ages that are stated in the movie 15 and 14 12.  The movie does contains a hint of child molesting nudity depictions of teenage sex and teenage pregnancy.  But the real controversy is not the subject matter but the fact that Paul and Michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship.  While this worked fine for stranded lovers in another time and in a desert island having them in a modern setting presents some very difficult moral issues.  Laws prohibiting consenting sex between minors are in effect in almost all countries and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy regarding a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development but that are needed to prevent child abuse?  Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth?  These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem.  The script progresses with extreme simplicity albeit some sappiness but never pulling any punches to state its message although by today standards it is somewhat slow.  The photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty.  The acting of the two protagonists varies from really awful in some scenes to marvelously innocent and credible in others.  Pop music unlike most productions nowadays is used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists.  Overall this is a delightful piece even if the moral values are not in concordance with your own.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 I was 14 and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. No DVD's yet. Boy....was I surprised!! Poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty love God idealist pursuits stay with you forever. Since they occur mostly at the heart's level no intellect yet! they define your soul's contours like a sculptor would do with a stone. If sometimes we didn't tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute of every decision of every turning point of our lives. So I confess I feel nostalgia. But the fascinating part of this is watching the film again and through this trip back in time enriching that understanding of why we people from the 60's grew up as we did. The spirit of those times is all here a Genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success make love not war the beautiful pop ballads the poetry of the lyrics a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into adults. I showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as nave and foolish. Guys be serious!! Cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments. And this is exactly what Friends does in a masterly way. It reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were 15. I'm now a musician and I feel some of us artists for that matter still dream about it!! How else could we live? That's Friends that's Brother Sun Sister Moon that's Hair. Those were the times still alien to AIDS alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody to pornography presented as sexuality to this barbaric new world order growing after September 11th. What a heart warming experience to see Paul and Michelle again timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a trip back to the very core of our hearts to Paris to Elton John at his best to that urban scenario surrounded by 2 CV Citrons and the VW Beetles. What a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in Camargue surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. They made us who we are as did Serrat in Spain Brel in France Peter Paul and Mary Joan Baez Luther King the Beatles the early Bee Gees Belafonte's Spirituals Gandhi the Gospel of Elvis. People still hoping get this picture. Start with innocence and grow from there. You'll find out what it's all about. And from there you'll have a solid and more truthful foundation some ideals to look for in life a way to handle personal and world affairs. We need so much of this today! Give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end. I have an extra VHS copySantiago Zuleta. Bogot Colombia.".

There is nothing shocking about this film for love can blossom completely between two teenagers of 14 and 15 and while the law might state otherwise emotions develop naturally. Two listless teenagers unhappy with their home lives meet by chance in Paris and develop a casual friendship.  One is an English boy Sean Bury studying in France and from a rich family.  The other is a young girl Anice Alvina whose parents are both dead and has been taken in by her cousin.  On a sudden impulse the boy and girl run off to Arles where the girl's father owned a small house nearby.  With just each other the beautiful scenery of the Carmargue and a growing love between them they make a new life for themselves.  Their simulated marriage ceremony achieved by following an actual wedding in the local church shows their acceptance of some of the rules of society.  It is just the unencumbered innocence of youth that puts them apart from the adults.  Soon a baby is born to them with the boy acting as midwife without any outside help.  Everything is idyllic until the police finally locate the boy's whereabouts.....".

	schema:reviewBody "Michelle Anice Alvina was so nice and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The seasons reprise of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please if you know where i could find a VHS of the film mail me!! My husband of 26 years  I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out. I think possibly we were drawn to the movie by the Elton John music in it but were then swept away by the teenage angst of it all. Paul and Michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie so very easy to identify with!! It is wonderful to hear that Sean is doing well I am also in the helping professions an RN. I thought his performance was good and very believable. Michelle came across as very sweet fragile and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the real world then they could be happy and continue to be in love. How many times have all of us wanted to just have a Calgon moment. If we all had no outside worries and could just deal with our basic needs it could be somewhat easier. I have a 15 yr old daughter and wouldn't have a problem with her seeing this movie.. Kids see so much worse these days that this is very tame. For those of you who are trying to locate the CD my husband a huge Elton John fan was able to get a 2CD set which came out in 1992. It is called Elton Johnrare masters Polygram studios. This has all the friends songs as well as many others. As far as we know this is the only CD with the Friends music. We also had the LP years ago and were thrilled to find the CD. Good luck. I recommend this movie for anyone who loves the young love theme. I only wish it was on DVD now!!".

Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called Seasons then I found the Elton John song Friends thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway the flood of the emotions of Friends came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love. I have more recall of the way the movie hit me than I do of the actual details of the production plot etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. I remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and tearyeyed at the end as I was. I'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies which seemed so important to me back then i.e. The Graduate Easy Rider now just seem silly and I don't want this to fall into the same category. But I will find it and if it turns out silly then at least I'll be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. When we met we went through this with Last Tango in Paris. The youngsters I work with I'm 56 respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little aged now. I just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. Friends is a very special sensitive and wonderful movie. It will bring back a lot of special feelings I'm sure. By all means rent or buy a copy... Indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film.  It was when I was a teenager I think I'm 37 now. I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s and so much of it has stayed with me ever since.  Seeing other comments I had NO idea it was shown at theatres or that anyone else even new it existed.  I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago. I think the innocence of the charactors their situation their mutual affection over a long period of time left a long term imprint for reasons I don't quite understand.  Maybe it is because I was a teenager at the time I saw it and it touched me somehow..... I really don't know! I also REALLY wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened.  Oh the agony!!I've not seen it before or since but I would love to. I keep a casual look out for it but I now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion.  But I'd proberbly miss it in the TV guide even if it DID show up. Pssttt!!!Reading the reviews here has renewed my interest.  If anyone knows of its availability in Australia by all means email me and let me know.Oh and Sean Bury... nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here.  I've had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond film.  What are you up to these day?  Oh and do YOU have a copy of the film?   CHEERS!!!".

	schema:headline " A look at two misplaced teens who survive and thrive because of each others strengths.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is more than a coming of age film it is a study of two teenagers and their realization that they really know little about life but struggle through it to nearly find happiness. I say more than a coming of age film because it looks at the entire subject without apology.  Paul played by Sean Bury plays a mischievous youth fed up with his fathers wealth and his complete lack of attention to him.  He steals cars and tries in every way possible to have his father notice him.  This fails and he meets up with Michelle Anicee Alvina who plays a sweet and naive young girl who is sent to her Aunt's home after her parents die.  At her Aunt's home the Aunt's boyfriend tries to molests her and she flees.Both teenagers head out to a summer cottage that Michelle's Mom owned and setup house.  Paul braves the world trying to find a job to feed them while Michelle plays house.  Reality bites as they make their way through many troubles and finally realize they are very ontheirown.This unlikely pair become friends and lovers eventually.  They growup onscreen and probably fair better than most out of necessity.A film like friends with a rich backdrop of the French countryside and sound track supplied by Elton John could not be made today.  Sean Paul is 15 and AniceeMichelle is 6 months younger and they make love resulting in her getting pregnant.  This is not kiddie porn but a serious look at the reality of teen sexuality and what really happens.  The subject is treated tenderly and factually.  Instead of the movie focusing on sex  sex becomes a natural extension of their friendship.  Both are shy and cautious of 'making a mistake' but their mutual support sees them through. SPOILER ALERT The child is born and Paul finally has a fairly good job and these two teens are taking life as it comes and enjoying each others support friendship and tenderness.While several other endings would have been preferred the movie ends with Paul's father finding them and taking them both back to the City.The film is not choppy and the actors have great and lousy scenes but the message is in the context of the movie.  When looked upon in total it touches your soul.  You feel and root for these two and wish them the very best.".

It's hard to imagine now that this would have been a hugely controversial movie when it was released about two underage runaways who set up house in a remote area and learn about love and life. It just shows that love and a strong bond between two people can conquer all. Or at least it could back then before tax and electricity bills blah blah. So if you're prepared to suspend reality for a few hours and just feel hopeful for these two young lovers then you will enjoy this sweet simple and beautiful film as much as I did. Incidentally I went to the Camargue about 5 years ago and it remains unchanged in it's charm so for me this was a nice reminder too that there are places that exist on this earth which are unruined and rustic.".

Anyway the movie was appropriate for the times and I was pleasantly surprised how it just seemed to feel right at the time. Have not seen it since but can remember it like it was yesterday...that was more than 41 years ago!! Hopefully it will show up on the tube on some oldies station late a night and make me feel young again. A great lowbudget movie that was right for the time.

	schema:headline " Beautiful though contrived.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film grabbed me right from its start where a sweetlooking teenaged girl is shown visiting a grave alone then Elton John's powerful song Friends starts playing while she's shown walking alone through the streets of Paris carrying a suitcase naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her. The entire film is a beautiful dreamy romantic collection of scenes of young love holding hands living in the country wild horses running around freely fields of wildflowers sunsets toasts of wine evenings by the fireside having fun and general innocence all set to romantic music by Elton John. It's magical.Somehow I missed seeing this film when I was growing up. I'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then. I remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971 talking about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John and with the chorus of the theme song Friends playing in the ad Makin' friends for the world to see... but I never heard anything else about it in those days and never got to see it until I rented it 35 years later from a video store. By then it had been edited censored and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? The world has gone insane since then.The story is that a 14yearold girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die. It was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene. One day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15yearold boy they hit it off and agree to meet the next day. The next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident. It was his father's car he can't bear to go back home to face his father's wrath so the two teenagers begin living in the French countryside together with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home. They settle into an unoccupied cottage the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves their supposed friendship turns into romance the girl becomes pregnant and they successfully have a baby at home. All the while the boy's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son. On the 1year anniversary of the couple's flight together the police finally locate the boy's employer by an inperson inquiry and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriendwife and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye. At least that's how the video version I saw ends. It's an unexpected though welltimed ending presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered.As beautiful as the story and images are the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived. I think it's better just to enjoy the movie as a young person's dreamcometrue fantasy and to go no further in analysis because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth. Why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year? What did they plan to do when the owners returned? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him? Didn't they think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food? How could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around? Where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free? How is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo? The Elton John song lyrics just don't fit. Why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it's about to get cold? And so on. The scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls as is the unrealistic theme of friendship before romance and all the backwashing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes the running through flower fields towards each other the haze filters the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground the baby ducks and so on. It works but it's definitely contrived.Still this is a movie about youth and freedom and that ideal hasn't changed since the 1970s. Young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom. Therefore the message is universal. It's clear why a sequel wouldn't work this story is about a magical yearlong reprieve from the real world. Such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely assuming that it could even happen in the first place and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt. But I hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the '70s learned something from it and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more attainable reality for others instead of perpetuating society's various hatreds and repressions especially on their own children.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film grabbed me right from its start where a sweetlooking teenaged girl is shown visiting a grave alone then Elton John's powerful song Friends starts playing while she's shown walking alone through the streets of Paris carrying a suitcase naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her. The entire film is a beautiful dreamy romantic collection of scenes of young love holding hands living in the country wild horses running around freely fields of wildflowers sunsets toasts of wine evenings by the fireside having fun and general innocence all set to romantic music by Elton John. It's magical.Somehow I missed seeing this film when I was growing up. I'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then. I remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971 talking about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John and with the chorus of the theme song Friends playing in the ad Makin' friends for the world to see... but I never heard anything else about it in those days and never got to see it until I rented it 35 years later from a video store. By then it had been edited censored and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? The world has gone insane since then.The story is that a 14yearold girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die. It was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene. One day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15yearold boy they hit it off and agree to meet the next day. The next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident. It was his father's car he can't bear to go back home to face his father's wrath so the two teenagers begin living in the French countryside together with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home. They settle into an unoccupied cottage the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves their supposed friendship turns into romance the girl becomes pregnant and they successfully have a baby at home. All the while the boy's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son. On the 1year anniversary of the couple's flight together the police finally locate the boy's employer by an inperson inquiry and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriendwife and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye. At least that's how the video version I saw ends. It's an unexpected though welltimed ending presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered.As beautiful as the story and images are the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived.

How did Celli get to know the Professor? What did the Professor pass around? What problem did Harry have with the Professor plan? Who was riding in the boat? Who did Celli walk in on? Who was shooting at Celli and why? MY THOUGHTS I thought this movie was boring for the simple fact that it was filmed in Italy. There was no action or drama in this movie the kind that kept your interest through the entire movie. That was the bad part of this movie. Now the reason why to watch this movie. Raquel Welch! She was gorgeous in this movie There were four particular scenes in this movie involving Raquel that you can't miss. The first was when she was dancing around the patio in here pink pantsuit. The second scene is when she comes running out of the ocean in her orange bikini. The third scene is when she dancing on the beach in her orange bikini and the fourth is when she shows up to Celli wearing a blue nightgown. Because of the lack of action and drama I would give this movie 5 weasel stars. However because of Raquel Welch and her talent and her gorgeous body I give this movie 10 weasel stars. You can get this movie at Amazon.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I wonder if the screenwriter for this film had somebody in mind as a model for the criminal Humphrey Bogart plays. In the 1920s and 1930s there was a major war between Joe Masseria and Salvator Marranzano for control of New York's criminal underworld. Marranzano on the surface seemed more modern to the younger crowd of gangsters like Luciano Costello Siegel Lansky and Lepke and they helped him get rid of the Mustache Petes or old style gangsters supporting Masseria and eventually Masseria himself. But they found that rather than restructuring the criminal world into a model corporate structure Marranzano had delusions of grandeur. He was intoxicated by the image and memory of Gaius Julius Caesar and intended to make himself the Caesar of the New York Underworld. Eventually Caesar Marranzano was bumped off by the disgruntled young Turks who did not plan for him to be a Capo di Capo.Interestingly enough he was stabbed to death in his office  one wonders if Luciano and the others purposely copied Caesar's demise in the forum. In this remake of an early Paul Muni film DR. SOCRATES Kay Francis is a female doctor who discovers that her late husband was tied to a powerful mobster Bogart and got killed helping him with some medical attention for one of his gang. The police and A.D.A. Pierre Watkins arrest and try Francis on really weak grounds as an accomplice but the jury is deadlocked and she is released while the A.D.A. decides whether or not to retry her. Francis is determined to prove her innocence by catching Bogart.Humphrey Bogart played many gangsters in the 1930s and most of them were quite dangerous types like Duke Mantee in THE PETRIFIED FOREST or Baby Face Martin in DEAD END. But his gangster boss here is ridiculous. The reason is that the screenwriter created a personality point about this gangster that is never pursued properly in the film. Bogart is enamored by the career of Napoleon Bonaparte and keeps mentioning this. Never once in the course of the film outside an occasional reference to say Waterloo or some incident like that do we see Bogie trying to use Napoleons aphorisms and strategies in his crimes! For example Bonaparte once dismissed military brilliance and said something to the effect that he preferred lucky generals to brilliant ones. He realized that a brilliant general could get so hung up about his own brilliant schemes that he could blow a major battle whereas a lucky general looks quickly at a situation and grabs the initiative. Bogart does not show any inclination to follow that particular piece of wisdom and does not even mention it.Bogart also is never shown using any of the strategies that made Marengo or Austerlitz or Jena victories that rang down through the last two centuries in his robbery schemes or crimes. For a man who supposedly admires a great figure he doesn't seem willing to learn from him!In the plot Francis hides in a small town and Bogart shows up there to rescue two of his men from the local police actually similar to an incident involving gangster John Dillinger. Bogart has also picked up a traveling writer James Stephenson who he realizes can ghost write Bogies criminal memoirs. Stephenson is arrested in the incident but he is released into Francis' custody she is now a doctor in the town and subsequently kidnapped by Bogie not quite like the unfortunate Duc de Enghien. Soon Francis is in pursuit and notes Bogies health as a potential key to undermining his control of her fate and Stephenson's. It involves giving him a peculiar drug that has to be also given to all his men at the same time to disable them all. This part of the script is absolutely unbelievable as Bogie's gangster does not accept the simple solution of selecting one of his men as a guinea pig to test the drug on Francis manages to browbeat him into taking the drug!.There are elements of other better films in KING OF THE UNDERWORLD. Most notable is James Stephenson's writerhobo who resembles Leslie Howard's in THE PETRIFIED FOREST. The acting is pretty good best are the scenes involving the local bigwig doctor who resents the arrival of Francis in the small town and starts making problems for her. Stephenson was a fine young actor whose best role the troubled barrister defending Bette Davis' Leslie Crosby in THE LETTER was yet to come and his death in the early 1940s was a true loss to movies. Francis does nicely in her role even if her victory over Bogie is asinine. Bogie is good  wish I could say the same for his character or the script.".

In fact this film was one hollow crown.King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film Dr. Socrates but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson.Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge 500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income. But when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It's no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety.Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least.Bogart's character was ridiculous no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's Kay Francis completely outsmart him hard to believe he was king of anything.Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a very limp remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film DR. SOCRATES. While this original film was pretty good the changes made in the script did NOT improve the story at all and there were so many logical errors that the film is pretty skipable unless you are a huge fan of Humphrey Bogart and gangster films like me.For some odd reason instead of the original story idea of a doctor being forced to do medical treatment for the mob and being thought by outsiders to be a member of the gang this time it's been altered a bit. Instead the man who chooses to be a mob doctor is soon killed and his wife Kay Franciswho was totally innocent but also a doctor is unfairly blamed for helping the gang. Although there is no evidence at all that she was involved the licensing board threatens to take away her license unless she can prove her innocence! This just doesn't make any logical senseand using a flawed and illogical situation as the basis for the film is a serious problem! Plus what idiots would suggest that she needs to prove her innocence and resort to risking her life!? Now the logical errors don't stop here. For example when the same gang later comes to Francis and forces her to help them she doesn't immediately run to the police or FBI but plans on proving her innocence all alone and at a very leisurely pace! Duh! It is only after working with them for some time does she consider telling the authorities and she comes up with a COMPLETELY FARFETCHED plan to capture the gang and hand them over to the law! She convinces Bogart that infection in his arm has spread to his eyes which it had and he would be blind unless he allowed her to give him a miracle eye medication. This is tough to believe but plausible. But when she also says she needs to give it to all the gang members AND they must all keep their eyes tightly shut during the process this is just stupid. Of course she gave them something that temporarily blinded them all and they were soon apprehended but believing these guys all did what she told them was just pushing credibility into the toilet though I must admit it was kind of funny to watch.Now apart from the bad script problems the film was still pretty watchable for fans of old Warner Brothers gangster films. In particular Bogart was funny as the dumb gang leader who fancied himself to be the next Napoleon. Plus he thought he was A LOT smarter than he really was and he thought when the doctor called him moronic that it was a complement! Sure realism was not the trademark of this performance but it was enjoyable and made me laugh a few times. Also the very end of the film had a cute ending after the blindness bit and was a good wrapup to the movie. So from a comedic point of view this was a pretty good drama!".

It's also an excellent example of skillful B feature filmmaking. The script even managed to work in some Warner's social comment on the District Attorney's office. The script alleges that although the D.A. hasn't a hope of winning the case he puts the Kay Francis character on trial anyway to appease an actiondemanding public. The ethics of the medical profession are also criticized. Lewis Seiler directs at a crackerjack pace. The film has plenty of action and even some occasional glimpses of style e.g. the Bogart springing his boys from prison sequence with its rapid tracking shots of feet. As we might expect Bogart has tremendous presence and delivers his usual noteworthy performance. Some attempts to inject a bit of comedy relief with Eddie Foy one of Bogie's henchmen ring a little false but Bogart manages to shortchange any shortcomings. On the other hand Miss Francis is not quite right. She seems to often play with less stamina than the role demands. On the other hand James Stephenson as usual is very able while John Eldredge is appropriately and intentionally weak.".

	schema:reviewBody "King Of The Underworld is without exaggeration the worst Bogart film I have seen. He plays an impossiblydim impossiblyevil gangster with no motivation whatsoever. The screenplay calls for his character to torture Kay Francis and take interest in a hobowriter he discovers at the side of the road so that's what he does. Little is explained and even less makes sense. Was the character of Carole's mother there only for PURE exposition? Warner Bros. made legendary crime films in the 30's and 40's so there is no excuse for this graceless disaster. I love Bogie but he must have been incredibly discouraged by the script he gives the worst performance of his career and often looks like he just wants the damn film to END. You will too.Bogart's kingpin character Joe Gurney should logically want to murder Dr. Carole Nelson. She's a potential witness who might turn him over to the police in order to clear her name and save her medical practice. And although Bogie had no problem shooting a potential snitch in the back in cold blood in the film's opening minutes the thought of harming Carole apparently never enters his mind even when he's got her alone with his cronies. Caution Open PlotHoles Ahead. Next we have the barelyliterate Joe obsessed with Napoleon kinda. He sees himself as some Napoleonlike figure and drops vague Napoleonisms that sound like they were made up on the spot. Since all we know about Joe Gurney is in relation to Carole Nelson's case this Napoleon subplot is incomplete and out of place. Would the film be any different if he identified instead with Spiderman? When Carole tells Bogie he's the moronic type Bogart brags to his goons straightfaced Did you hear that fellas? I'm the moronic type! That's about the level of wit this film has to offer.The finale in which Dr. Nelson blinds Bogie and the boys with magic eye drops would be more at home in a Three Stooges short. If you want great Bogart go see High Sierra The Big Sleep Casablanca Treasure of the Sierra Madre Key Largo or The Maltese Falcon. This King is a crab.GRADE C".

SOCRATES has Kay Francis playing a doctor trying to clear her name after her husband got connected to a gangster Humphrey Bogart. I watched this film for the first time many years ago and found it to be campy fun but this was my first viewing since seeing the original 1935. My opinion on this film here has certainly changed but in the end I think this is still worth seeing if you're a fan of Bogart. That original film was an incredibly smart and tense little gem that should be better known to film fans but this remake clearly meant to be the second film on a doublefeature leaves out the brains and instead goes with action. The movie runs a fastpaced 67minutes and for the most part we get to see Bogart chew up one scene after another and this here is clearly fun if you're a fan of his. He's constantly shouting at his men giving orders or just going around like a madman and we even get to hear him quote a few things from Napoleon. Bogart's maniacstyle performance is clearly the stand out here and the reason people should tune in. Francis seems to be rather upset at having to appear in something like this as she pretty much sleepwalks through here role and she certainly brings the film down some. She was certainly a capable actress but you really can't tell that by watching her here. James Stephenson adds nice support in his small role. The ending to the original film worked wonderfully well because they went for suspense but that's not the case here. The ending is pretty wacky and over the top and sure to draw a few laughs. It does lead up to some violent gun play which is never a bad thing in a Warner movie.".

All is good and well until the Doc gets gunned down in a police raid as he was treating one of Gurney's hoods. That leaves his totally Innocent wife who's also a doctor Carole Kay Francis not only wearing the paths in the Nelson family but suspected by the police as being a doctor for the mob and in danger of losing her license to practice medicine.Setting up a practice in the little town of Wayne Center Carole feels that Gurney and his boys will be paying her or Wayne Center a visit with one of his gang members being in the town jail. Carole doesn't have to wait too long with the Gurney gang rolling into town the very next day and springing their man from prison. During the violent shootout a man in one of Gurney's attack cars is seen fleeing from the scene and shot. The man is later found out not to be a member of Gurney's gang but down and out English writer Bill Stevens James Stephenson. It turns out that Stevens hitched or was taken for a ride with him having no say in the matter with the Gurney Gang not at first knowing that Gurney was the notorious fugitive from the law that he is.Treated by Carole in his prison cell Stevens is later kidnapped by the Gurney Gang in not that he knows that much about their boss' whereabouts but that he was in the process of writing Gurney's autobiography as the man who made it to the top of the heap in the world of US crime.During the prison breakout Gurney was also hit suffering a nasty bullet wound on his right arm and had two of his hoods kidnap Carole bringing her to their hideout outside town to treat it. Carole does an excellent job dressing and disinfecting Gurney's bullet wound yet the I don't take orders from a dame Gurney doesn't take care of himself. This has him get very ill with a high fever from the wound getting reinfected that Gurney has Carole rekidnapped and taken back again to his hideout in order to treat it.Seeing her chance to help the police and prove that she isn't a member of Gurney's gang Carole has Gurney think that he contacted a serious case of Streptococci on top of all that he also infected his entire gang. Telling the now scared shtless Gurney that she'll have to go back to her doctors office and get this ointment to save him and his gang from going blind due to the Streptococci infection. Carole then secretly tips off the police to not only where Gurney's hideout is but that by midnight when the ointment that she's to give him and his boys will take effect they'll all be as blind as a bat and ripe to take into custody without any problem. Carole was only half right with Gurney  Co. going blind but at the same time not going easy but down in a hail of bullets.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's the end of the road for Kay Francis at Warner Brothers where after 7 years of being their highest paid leading lady was reduced to B pictures and here is basically secondary to rising star Humphrey Bogart still playing the gangster and holding her against her will after being responsible for her husband's death. It's not a pretty picture either for Kay's career or for the movie audiences for this is pretty thin stuff. Bogart played many gangsters over the years and Joe Gurney is probably his least interesting. This was a remake of a film called Dr. Socrates where Paul Muni played a physician forced to help out gangsters and now Kay's in the same boat having watched the ruthless criminals murder her husband in cold blood. There's plenty of action and shootouts with the law to keep the audience awake but the results are rather mediocre. It's a shame that Warners couldn't have come up with a better story for Ms. Francis and Bogart to work together with. They'd have been great in a romantic drama as a socialite and gritty antihero who try against the odds to be together. The B ramifications of this script are obvious the production pretty much rushed through to get another Bogart film out to the craving public and get Francis's dressing room free for the new leading lady of the lot Bette Davis.".

To achieve this the event was split between arenas in 3 cities The Nassau Coliseum New York The Rosemont Horizon Chicago and the Los Angeles Sports Arena.  Each arena held 4 matches and the arenas could link up with live satellite feeds.NEW YORKWe have Vince McMahon and Susan St. James who? on commentary so off we go.The Magnificent Muraco vs Paul Mr Wonderful OrndorffTwo big fellas in here.  This match should be better than it is.  Muraco works through a few power routines Orndorff displays some of his technical work but it doesn't seem to gel right.  Crap finish as well.  I expect more from the opening of WrestlemaniaIntercontinental Title Match The Macho Man Randy Savage Champion with Miss Elizabeth vs George The Animal SteeleAll fing right the Wrestlemania debut of one of my favourite wrestlers of all time.  Savage in my opinion is pure wrestling class heel or face doesn't matter to me the man always puts on a show.  Comes to the WWF very quickly becomes IC champion.  Anyway back to the match.  The styles of these two men don't gel too well although Savage tries to carry Animal. Not a bad match but I am shocked and deeply annoyed that Steele felt he had the right to kick out of the elbow.  Watch it you'll see what I mean.Jake The Snake Roberts vs George WellsHmmm brand new heel with a killer gimmick vs some random jobber picked up on the corner of jabroni drive and know your role boulevard.  Can't think how this will turn out.  Holy crap the jobber is controlling the whole match oh no DDT all over.  Next...10 Round Boxing Match Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Mr TTwo of the main eventers from the previous years Wrestlemania now slug it out to close the New York segment.  This is a hard match to rate as it is so atypical.  A lot of people don't like this match but I find Piper hilarious especially in heel mode so I quite like this one.  Pipers flagrant cheating is very funny and T's efforts to play it straight is damn admirable.CHICAGONow on commentary we have Gorilla Monsoon Mean Gene Okerlund and Cathy Lee CrosbyWomen's Title Match The Fabulous Moolah Champion vs Velvet McIntyreOld Moolah old old old Moolah.  This is awful.  Velvet who was actually a pretty damn good wrestler gets squashed by the old lard ass herself.  Very quick very poor.  Next...Flag Match Corporal Kirschner vs Nikolai VolkoffOkay good all american albeit Sgt Slaughter ripoff Corporal Kirshner vs evil russian Nikolai.  The WWF's answer to the cold war a flag match.  The idea being that each man enters with his country's flag and the winner leaves with both.  Sounds pointless?  Yes it is.  Another daft and pointless match.  This Chicago segment doesn't appear to be shaping up to much.  Oh hang on the next two matches whup ass.20Man WWFNFL Battle RoyalGuest Referees Dick Butkus  Ed Too Tall JonesGuest Timekeeper Claire KellerThis battle royal contained WWF superstars as well players and legends from the NFL.  The participants are as followsNFL Jimbo Covert Ted Arcidi Harvey Martin Ernie Holmes Bill Fralic Russ Francis Refridgerator William PerryWWF Pedro Morales Tony Atlas Dan Spivey Hillbilly Jim King Tonga The Iron Sheik The Killer Bees Big John Studd The Hart Foundation Bruno Sammartino Andre the GiantWell this is pretty good fun most battle royals are.  You get a chance to see the future of wrestling in Bret Hitman Hart involved as quite a major player here.  If you take a look at the participants you can pretty much guess who's going to win this.  Good fun none the less.Tag Team Title Match The Dream Team Champions with Johnny Valiant vs The British Bulldogs with Captain Lou Albano and Ozzy OsbourneOh yes the Bulldogs are here.  In my honest opinion one of the greatest tag teams ever and no not just because they're british.  Seriously Davey Boy Smith and The Dynamite Kid were ahead of their time pulling out moves you only previously saw in Mexico or Japan.  This match is absolutely brilliant I never thought I'd say that about a match with Beefcake and Valentine in yet here it works.  Best match of the night bar none fabulous performance great story to the match superb shock ending.  They don't get any better than this.LOS ANGELESOkay now on commentary we have Jesse The Body Ventura yay Lord Alfred Hayes boo and Elvira god how I used to lust after this woman still do.Ricky The Dragon Steamboat vs Hercules HernandezI like both these guys but this match just didn't do it for me.  I don't think their styles complimented each other particularly well.  Not bad not great just decidedly average.  Anyway I think I'll skip on now.Uncle Elmer vs Adorable Adrian Adonis with Jimmy HartYuk yuk yuk yuk yuk.  Two fat men one dressed as a hillbilly and one in a dress gutbarging each other.  In my opinion worst match on the card. Next...Tito Santana  The Junkyard Dog vs The Funk BrothersThis is more like it.  Tito flying about all over the place JYD smashing Funks through tables the funks taking some superb bumps.  This one is great fun.  I love watching Terry Funk because you know the guy's going to do some crazy shit to his body in this case a big back drop on to the cement floor.  This match is fast paced the styles compliment each other quite well and this is the most entertained I've ever been by the JYD.  All in all top stuff.Steel Cage WWF Title Match Hulk Hogan Champion vs King Kong Bundy with Bobby The Brain HeenanGuest Ring Announcer Tommy LasordaGuest Referee Robert ConradGuest Timekeeper Ricky SchroederOkay main event time.  Hogan in a cage that's pretty unusual.  Here we see the start of the trend of having Hogan face guys even bigger than he is other examples being Andre and Earthquake.  This isn't a bad match not great as cage matches aren't really suited for massive guys.  Still some good action a damn good story bit of blood Heenan receives a slap which is always good fun.  Problem is there's never a question of who's going to win.  Ah well can't have everything.And so ends Wrestlemania 2 not as good as the first but still worth a look.  Especially for the introduction of Savage and Jake and that damn fine Bulldogs Match.  Anyway signing off for now be back with a write up of Wrestlemania 3 sometime soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the first Wrestlemania to be shown on PPV as the first in 1985 was shown on Closed Circuit Television. The Gimmick here is that we're coming to you from three different cities New York Chicago and Los Angeles in a coast to coast spectacular! This seemed like a great show at the time it happened and is still good fun now.The action starts off in New York with Paul Orndorff and Don Maruco fighting to a double count out draw. They do some nice stuff and the match ends after about 4 minutes. The second match on the card features the first Wrestlemania appearance for Macho Man Randy Savage one of the great wrestlers of the late 80s and 90s. He's here putting the Intercontinental Title on the line against George The Animal Steele. Steele has his chances but for most of the fight is too busy ogling over Savage's sidekick Miss Elizabeth. Savage rolls up Steele and puts his feet on the ropes to get the pin. Dastardly.Next up is he short match between Jake Roberts and George Wells. Roberts wins in short order with the DDT and gets his pet snake damien to slither all over the unfortunate Mr Wells. The main event for the New York section of the show is a boxing match between Mr T and Roddy Piper. This one ends in the fourth round with Piper disqualified for body slamming Mr T. I pity that fool.Things now move to Chicago where we kick things off with the Fabulous Moolah defeating Velvet McIntyre to retain the WWE Women's Championship. McIntyre looked a good thing to win the fight for most of the going but the veteran Moolah pulled out the win with some nice evasion and a quick pinning combination. Next up was a flag match between Corporal Kirschner and Nikolai Volkoff who was accompanied by Freddy Blassie. Blassie tries to throw his cane to Volkoff but Kirschner intercepts it knocking out Volkoff and winning the match.The next match was the NFL Superstars vs WWE Superstars. I'll be honest as an Australian and say I have no idea who any of the NFL guys were. It doesn't matter anyway as the 20 man battle Royal comes down to Andre the Giant vs the Hart Foundation. Andre wins after eliminating first Neidhart than Bret Hart. The main event for the Chicago part of the show is the British Bulldogs Davey Boy Smith and the Dynamite Kid defeating the Dream Team Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine to win the Tag Team Championships. Plenty of shenanigans here with head butts and ref bumps. From a technical standpoint this was the match of the night.Wrestlemania 2 now switches scenery to beautiful Los Angeles and we kick things off with Ricky Steamboat getting an upset win over Hercules. Steamboat jumps around a bit Hercules beats on him goes for a splash misses Steamboat pulls out the win. Next up we had Adrian Adonis accompanied by Jimmy Hart defeating Uncle Elmer. Short match don't know what the story was going in. Crowd seemed to like it. This is followed by Hoss and Terry Funk defeating the Junk Yard Dog and Tito Santana with help from Jimmy Hart's microphone.The main event in Los Angeles and for the show is Hulk Hogan defeating King Kong Bundy in a steel cage match to retain the WWE Title. Some people rate this the worst match ever but they really need to get over it. Fun match crowd was into it. Good triumphs over evil. The only thing I will say bad about it is the awful female commentary throughout the event.An interesting experiment which didn't quite work for the WWE and was never tried again.".

Roberts wins in short order with the DDT and gets his pet snake damien to slither all over the unfortunate Mr Wells. The main event for the New York section of the show is a boxing match between Mr T and Roddy Piper. This one ends in the fourth round with Piper disqualified for body slamming Mr T. I pity that fool.Things now move to Chicago where we kick things off with the Fabulous Moolah defeating Velvet McIntyre to retain the WWE Women's Championship. McIntyre looked a good thing to win the fight for most of the going but the veteran Moolah pulled out the win with some nice evasion and a quick pinning combination. Next up was a flag match between Corporal Kirschner and Nikolai Volkoff who was accompanied by Freddy Blassie. Blassie tries to throw his cane to Volkoff but Kirschner intercepts it knocking out Volkoff and winning the match.The next match was the NFL Superstars vs WWE Superstars. I'll be honest as an Australian and say I have no idea who any of the NFL guys were. It doesn't matter anyway as the 20 man battle Royal comes down to Andre the Giant vs the Hart Foundation. Andre wins after eliminating first Neidhart than Bret Hart. The main event for the Chicago part of the show is the British Bulldogs Davey Boy Smith and the Dynamite Kid defeating the Dream Team Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine to win the Tag Team Championships. Plenty of shenanigans here with head butts and ref bumps. From a technical standpoint this was the match of the night.Wrestlemania 2 now switches scenery to beautiful Los Angeles and we kick things off with Ricky Steamboat getting an upset win over Hercules. Steamboat jumps around a bit Hercules beats on him goes for a splash misses Steamboat pulls out the win. Next up we had Adrian Adonis accompanied by Jimmy Hart defeating Uncle Elmer. Short match don't know what the story was going in. Crowd seemed to like it. This is followed by Hoss and Terry Funk defeating the Junk Yard Dog and Tito Santana with help from Jimmy Hart's microphone.The main event in Los Angeles and for the show is Hulk Hogan defeating King Kong Bundy in a steel cage match to retain the WWE Title. Some people rate this the worst match ever but they really need to get over it. Fun match crowd was into it. Good triumphs over evil. The only thing I will say bad about it is the awful female commentary throughout the event.An interesting experiment which didn't quite work for the WWE and was never tried again.";

	schema:reviewBody "Here are the matches...Nassau Colloseum Paul Orndorff v Don Muraco A relatively fastpaced match which features a tasteless slanted eye gesture made by Orndorff against Mr Fuji that ends with an unsatisfying double countout. A shame because this could have been the sleeper of the night. I am sure I could hear the fans shout 'bullsht' after the match... 310 George 'The Animal' Steele v 'Machoman' Randy Savage for the Intercontinental title This was an oddity and mainly a match of entertainment and hijinks than wrestling in itself. On a rare occasion 'Machoman' messes up a flying bodycross and Steele actually kicks out of the flying elbow. It ended with 'Machoman' getting the cheap pin with feet on the ropes manoeuvre. 410 George Wells v Jake 'The Snake' Roberts Jake gets dominated by 'jobber to the stars' Wells until he lands the DDT. Jake drops the snake over Wells rather unconvincingly but Wells sells the idea well by frothing at the mouth. 210 How many times does Susan Saint James say 'C'maaaan George' during the night? Lol.Mr T v 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper boxing match This boxing match didn't go anywhere near the distance. Both combatants knocked each other out during rounds 2 and 3 and Piper got disqualified in round 4 for executing a bodyslam. A waste of time really and the only real factor of this match was it started a face turn for Piper as the crowd realised he was more interesting than Mr T. 310 Rosemont Horizon Velvet McEntyre v Fabulous Moolah for the women's title A blink and you'll miss it squash match which devalues the women's title. Moolah pinned McEntyre after a failed bodypress within 2 minutes. I've read recently that McEntyre's match was cut short because she had a wardrobe malfunction. You can see McEntyre doing her best to protect her modesty during and after the match. 110Corporal Kirschner v Nikolai Volkoff  flag match A mercifully short two minute spectacle giving enough time for Kirschner to catch Blassie's cane in the air meant for Volkoff and whack him with it to gain the pin. Kirschner still manages to bust his head open in the process. I can only guess this was the WWF's way of dealing with 'The Cold War'. 210 WWFNFL battle royal A decent 20 man event but not much time was devoted to it. If you notice hard enough you will find Bruno Sammartino barely does anything in the ring but wander around and 'Hillbilly' Jim tries too hard to get himself eliminated while John Studd falls for a rookie mistake. Andre the Giant won the match defeating both members of the Hart Foundation sporting blue tights. 610 British Bulldogs v Dream Team for the WWF tag titles This is definitely match of the night. Well fought though the majority of it sees Greg Valentine getting a beating. Ozzie Osbourne joins The Bulldogs probably WWF still attempting the Rock 'n' Wrestling connection and Gene Okerlund refers to Osbourne coming from Manchester when he actually comes from Birmingham. Anyhow that aside a good match which finishes when a dazed Hammer clashes with the Dynamite Kid and gets pinned. 610 Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena Ricky Steamboat v Hercules Hernandez A match notable for Hercules's ring costume at the start portraying a Greek soldier and looking like the late 'Bruiser' Brody. Steamboat carries Hercules to a reasonable match Hercules actually attempts the toprope at one point but the conclusion was never left in any doubt when Steamboat flying bodypresses for the pin. 510 Uncle Elmer v Adrian Adonis Adonis comes to the ring in a dress and wearing gaudy makeup. Before Wrestlemania 2 Adonis 'came out' as a homosexual even though he was a happily married man in real life so I can only presume the WWF equated homosexuality with transvestitism. I laughed at Elmer falling over after delivering a blow to Adonis and Adonis entertained with his bumping before he got the quick pin over Elmer after a flying headbutt. A favourite of mine but not a good match by any means. 310 JYD and Tito Santana v Terry and Dory 'Hoss' Funk Jnr It's nice to see Terry Funk looking more healthier than he does these days. A pretty good match with Terry doing some nice bumping he gets slammed on to a table at one point. The action was marred by a cheap foreign object ending as Terry pinned JYD after hitting him with Jimmy Hart's megaphone. 610 Hulk Hogan v King Kong Bundy steel cage match for the WWF world title One of those rare cage matches that featured during the 80s where blue steel replaced the usual meshed cage. The match was predictable in it's outcome but a pretty tough outing for the two. At one stage Bundy removes the bandage from Hogan's injured ribs and proceeds to choke him with it and Bundy leaves the match with blood on his face. Hogan goes over the top of the cage to win the match. 610A lot of people really dislike this Wrestlemania and often rate it as their worst but it does have a few decent matches. I guess most of the criticism levelled at Wrestlemania II was the PPV structure set in 3 arenas and how much the show has dated because of it's comparatively limited production values and minor celebrity overload. Advert moguls Wendy's 'Where's the beef?' Clara Peller yells into the air while Burger King's Herb dances like a pillock when they get introduced. The pecularities in certain matches George 'The Animal' Steele vs 'Machoman' Randy Savage and Uncle Elmer vs 'Adorable' Adonis are interesting too showing the idiosyncrasies and attitudes in wrestling haven't really changed much over the years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three cities! Television personalities! Fast Food mascots! Football players! Awful matches! Yup WrestleMania 2 has all of that. For some reason or another Vince McMahon decided to broadcast this event from three different arenas in three different time zones. I'm not sure where the event would have originated from had he chosen just one venue probably Nassau if I were to guess. So we start off from the New York segment at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale NY. Vince broadcasts with scratchy voiced actress Susan St. James who just happens to be married to Vince's buddy Dick Ebersol. I didn't count how many times she said Uh Oh! during these 4 matches but it was at least 22. We start off with Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff vs The Magnificent Don Muraco. This ends in a lame double count out not a strong kick off to what is supposed to be your mecca event granted it was only the second incarnation of it. Next we get the Intercontinental Title match between Macho Man Randy Savage and George The Animal Steele. About what you'd expect from an Animal Steele match entertaining to a point but it doesn't give Savage the chance to show off his true in ring talent that would have to wait til WrestleMania III. Next is an encounter between Jake The Snake Roberts and former football player George Wells. Wells is wearing football pants that he either kept from his CFL days or stole from the Houston Oilers. Jake wins the match with a DDT that flips Wells completely over and then smothers and chokes him with Damian the snake. The final match in NY is a boxing match between Roddy Piper and actor Mr. T. This is not a good match by any means but you DO get to see Burger King's Herb do a dance prior to the bell. Piper loses by DQ for shoving the ref and body slamming Mr. T. The real life dislike for each other was evident by this point I wonder if a regular wrestling match would have sufficed better. Oh well at least Cab Calloway was in attendance right?Now we're shipped to Chicago's portion of the event emulating from The Rosemont Horizon which Gorilla Monsoon calls a beautiful arena trust me it's not. He's joined on commentary by actress Cathy Lee Crosby and Mean Gene Okerlund and Big Cat Ernie Ladd during the battle royal only. We start with a women's championship match that lasts about a minute when The Fabulous Moolah pinned Velvet McIntyre in about a minute. Then Corporal Kirchner beats Nikolia Volkoff in a flag match in two minutes. Wow these matches just keep getting longer. Now we get to the 20 man battle royal which has a mixture of WWF wrestlers as well as NFL football players. Mean Gene announces former Wendy's commercial actress Clara Peller and she has to ask Now? twice for her cue. Yes lady NOW! She then waves her microphone like a magic wand and says Where's the Beef but no one hears her. The Horizon comes unglued for hometown player and recent champion William Refrigerator Perry. The match also featured a trio of former world champions in Bruno Sammartino The Iron Shiek and Pedro Morales. Andre the Giant and Golden Boy Danny Spivey dress the same here as they both don yellow Hulk Hogan tights and boots. Andre gets the win after last eliminating The Hart Foundation. The final match is for the WWF tag team titles in which The British Bulldogs win the gold from Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake. With Ozzy Osbourne and Captain Lou in your corner how could you lose? So far I'd say the battle royal and tag title match are the best of the night giving the edge to Chicago over New York. Let's go to L.A.In L.A. Jesse The Body Ventura Lord Alfred Hayes and Elvira are your broadcast team. Elvira wasn't the quickest thinker when asked questions but she's Elvira and she's sexy so it's ok. Sometimes the audio volume level goes up and down here 1986 technology was only so good when you're running one show from three cities. First bout here Ricky Steamboat pins Hercules in a decent match a clash of styles bogs it down a bit. Like Randy Savage Steambout would have to wait a year to truly show off his talents. Next Adorable Adrian Adonis defeats Uncle Elmer in an awful match with just a few bumps and flips by Adonis saving it from being completely bottom of the barrel. In a tag match the Funk Brothers beat Junkyard Dog and Tito Santana in a decent match saved by some bumps by Terry Funk. Now the main event. Wait no WrestleMania main event is complete without celebrities. Bring out Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda who spits literally as he's announcing Ricky Schroeder and Robert Conrad. WWF title on the line in a steel cage Hulk Hogan vs King Kong Bundy. This is a better main event than the first WrestleMania. Some fans rated this match as mediocre but I found it to be pretty good. Despite some audio trouble I'd give the edge to L.A. as the best segment of this lackluster event. In conclusion between celebrity broadcasting city hopping bad matches and low production values turn this one into a bottom 5 WrestleMania.".

	schema:reviewBody "04.07.86Wrestlemania 2 was held in three places! We start off in Uniondale NYYour hosts are Vince McMahon  Susan Saint JamesMr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco WMr. FujiThe match ends in a double countout after both men brawl on the floor. This was a match that was meaningless and directionless. I like both wrestlers as individuals but it's hard not to be disinterested with how poorly it was thrown together. The crowd chanting bullshi over the finish says it all.Intercontinental ChampionshipRandy Macho Man Savage C WElizabeth Vs George The Animal SteeleSavage retains the title by using the ropes to pin Steele. This was a very poor comedy match. Steele spends most of the match chasing Savage around and I didn't find Steele's OTT antics to be entertaining at all. Steele kicking out of the elbow drop irked me as well. Jake The Snake Roberts Vs George WellsJake wins with a DDT. This is a glorified squash match. Wells got in some convincing offense but the result is never in doubt. The most memorable thing about this match is Wells drooling from the snake being draped over him. 14Boxing MatchRowdy Roddy Piper Vs Mr. TT wins by DQ in the fourth round after Piper bodyslams T. This was an OK spectacle. It's pretty boring for today's standards but back then it was pretty huge. Part 2 emanates from Chicago IL at the Rosemont Horizon.Your hosts are Gorilla Monsoon Gene Okerlund  Cathy Lee CrosbyWomen's TitleThe Fabulous Moolah C Vs Velvet McIntyreMoolah pins McIntyre after McIntyre misses a splash even though McIntyre's foot was on the ropes... This was a very quick match and way too short for me to really comment any further on it.DUDFlag MatchNikolai Volkoff WFreddie Blassie Vs Corporal KirchnerThe winner gets to raise the flag. Kirchner wins after using Blassie's cane. At least this match was short! Short and painless is what I like when it comes to stuff like this. 1420 Man Battle RoyalThis one has stars from the NFL as well. The participants are Jimbo Covert Pedro Morales Tony Atlas Ted Arcidi Harvey Martin Danny Spivey Hillbilly Jim King Tonga The Iron Sheik Ernie Holmes The Killer Bees Big John Studd Bill Fralic Bret Hart Jim Neidhart Russ Francis Bruno Sammartino William refrigerator Perry and Andre The Giant. It comes down to Andre The Giant and The Hart Foundation. Needless to say Andre dumps them both out to win the battle royal. This was OK for a battle royal. The NFL players didn't embarrass themselves. Perry and Big John Studd going at it was pretty cool and the crowd was electric for it. In one of the rare cases the big man actually IS the favorite. Andre winning was a good choice even if the fans desperately wanted William Perry to win it. I don't rate battle royalsTag Team ChampionshipThe Dream Team C Greg Valentine  Brutus Beefcake WJohnny Valiant Vs The British Bulldogs WCapt. Lou Albano  Ozzy OsbourneThe Bulldogs win the title after Valentine collides with The Dynamite Kid head first. This is a textbook example of what tag team wrestling should be all about. Rarely will you ever see a tag team match go this smoothly. I can honestly say this match is awesome and completely stole the show. out of 5 starsWe go to the Los Angeles CA portion of the show!Your hosts are Jessie The Body Ventura Lord Alfred Hayes and ElviraRicky The Dragon Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez WFreddie BlassieSteamboat wins with flying crossbody from the top. This match was alright I suppose. It didn't have enough excitement to really get it over the hump though. As amazing as Steamboat is in the ring he can't work miracles. 34The Adorable Adrian Adonis WJimmy Hart Vs Uncle ElmerAdonis wins with a fistdrop of sorts from the top. The match was pure crap of course. But watching Adonis bump around like crazy to try to get the match over is kinda fun.Terry Funk  Dory Funk Jr. WJimmy Hart Vs The Junkyard Dog  Tito SantanaThe Funks win when Terry Funk drills JYD with the Megaphone. This match was all sorts of fun! The match was rather wild and chaotic throughout with Terry Funk shining the most out of anyone in this match. Good stuff overall!14WWF Championship Steel Cage MatchHulk Hogan C Vs King Kong Bundy WBobby HeenanHogan retains the title by escaping the cage. This match gets by on solid drama and storytelling. Praise aside this is still one of the weakest main events in Wrestlemania history. There is nothing outstanding about it or anything that should warrant a place on any Best of Steel Cage match DVD's. It's not the greatest by any means but after repeated viewings it's not as bad as I originally thought. Having Wrestlemania in three different cities was an audacious idea that didn't quite pan out for Vince. I actually thought it hindered the show a bit. With all the hype Hogan Vs Bundy got The Dream Team Vs The British Bulldogs stole a bit of their thunder and easily stole the show. Overall this is one of the worst Wrestlemania's but there are worse Wrestlemania's such as Wrestlemania 9 and 11.".

	onyx:emotionText "04.07.86Wrestlemania 2 was held in three places! We start off in Uniondale NYYour hosts are Vince McMahon  Susan Saint JamesMr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco WMr. FujiThe match ends in a double countout after both men brawl on the floor. This was a match that was meaningless and directionless. I like both wrestlers as individuals but it's hard not to be disinterested with how poorly it was thrown together. The crowd chanting bullshi over the finish says it all.Intercontinental ChampionshipRandy Macho Man Savage C WElizabeth Vs George The Animal SteeleSavage retains the title by using the ropes to pin Steele. This was a very poor comedy match. Steele spends most of the match chasing Savage around and I didn't find Steele's OTT antics to be entertaining at all. Steele kicking out of the elbow drop irked me as well. Jake The Snake Roberts Vs George WellsJake wins with a DDT. This is a glorified squash match. Wells got in some convincing offense but the result is never in doubt. The most memorable thing about this match is Wells drooling from the snake being draped over him. 14Boxing MatchRowdy Roddy Piper Vs Mr. TT wins by DQ in the fourth round after Piper bodyslams T. This was an OK spectacle. It's pretty boring for today's standards but back then it was pretty huge. Part 2 emanates from Chicago IL at the Rosemont Horizon.Your hosts are Gorilla Monsoon Gene Okerlund  Cathy Lee CrosbyWomen's TitleThe Fabulous Moolah C Vs Velvet McIntyreMoolah pins McIntyre after McIntyre misses a splash even though McIntyre's foot was on the ropes... This was a very quick match and way too short for me to really comment any further on it.DUDFlag MatchNikolai Volkoff WFreddie Blassie Vs Corporal KirchnerThe winner gets to raise the flag. Kirchner wins after using Blassie's cane. At least this match was short! Short and painless is what I like when it comes to stuff like this. 1420 Man Battle RoyalThis one has stars from the NFL as well. The participants are Jimbo Covert Pedro Morales Tony Atlas Ted Arcidi Harvey Martin Danny Spivey Hillbilly Jim King Tonga The Iron Sheik Ernie Holmes The Killer Bees Big John Studd Bill Fralic Bret Hart Jim Neidhart Russ Francis Bruno Sammartino William refrigerator Perry and Andre The Giant. It comes down to Andre The Giant and The Hart Foundation. Needless to say Andre dumps them both out to win the battle royal. This was OK for a battle royal. The NFL players didn't embarrass themselves. Perry and Big John Studd going at it was pretty cool and the crowd was electric for it. In one of the rare cases the big man actually IS the favorite. Andre winning was a good choice even if the fans desperately wanted William Perry to win it. I don't rate battle royalsTag Team ChampionshipThe Dream Team C Greg Valentine  Brutus Beefcake WJohnny Valiant Vs The British Bulldogs WCapt. Lou Albano  Ozzy OsbourneThe Bulldogs win the title after Valentine collides with The Dynamite Kid head first. This is a textbook example of what tag team wrestling should be all about. Rarely will you ever see a tag team match go this smoothly. I can honestly say this match is awesome and completely stole the show. out of 5 starsWe go to the Los Angeles CA portion of the show!Your hosts are Jessie The Body Ventura Lord Alfred Hayes and ElviraRicky The Dragon Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez WFreddie BlassieSteamboat wins with flying crossbody from the top.

	schema:text "    Catharine Deane is a psychotherapist who is part of a revolutionary new treatment which allows her mind to literally enter the mind of her patients. Her experience in this method takes an unexpected turn when an F.B.I. Agent comes to ask for a desperate favor. They had just tracked down a notorious serial killer Carl Stargher whose method of operation is to abduct women one at a time and place them in a secret area where they are kept for about forty hours until they are slowly drowned. Unfortunately the killer has fallen into an irreversible coma which means he cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim before she dies. Now Catherine Deane must race against time to explore the twisted mind of the killer to get the information she needs but Stargher's damaged personality poses dangers that threaten to overwhelm her.";

	schema:reviewBody "The last time I reviewed a film helmed by a music video director I was very angry at what I'd seen Mystery Men' but Tarsem Singh spares us the fisheye lenses and commercial overindulgences and decides to concentrate on presenting an astonishing visual and audible journey into the mind of a serial killer in The Cell'.Carl Stargher Vincent D'Onofrio kills women by drowning them in glass cells all the while videotaping the event.  Afterwards he disfigures the bodies to resemble dolls and then tosses the finished products' off highways into ditches and streams.  Nice guy.  He also likes to suspend himself on chains attached to hooks inserted directly into his back. Lovely.Meanwhile FBI agent Peter Novak Vince Vaughn is hot on the killer's trail and although Carl's started to get sloppy he's just kidnapped another girl and she has 40 hours before her cell fills with water.  Carl is soon apprehended but only because he enters into a schizophrenic seizure and falls into a coma on his kitchen floor.  A coma?  But how are they going to find out where the last victim is?  Oh if only they could TRAVEL INSIDE HIS MIND.  Hey what a coincidence!  Catherine Deane Jennifer Lopez is a child psychologist involved in an experimental project that allows her to TRAVEL INSIDE THE MIND of coma victims.And so begins a strange array of visuals and sounds blended together so unusually that you honestly feel like you're experiencing a dream a not so pleasant dream.  Not only is Carl's mind slightly twisted it's violent disturbingly sexual and very graphic.  But it's also like a train wreck you can't help but look.  Oddly enough Mr. Singh clearly had the resources to make his special effects scream out at you with bright color and absurd lavishness but he chose instead to simplify placing the terror in the scale and content of the visuals.  I can't even use an example.  All I can say is think about a dream you've had that you couldn't describe to someone and that's what watching this movie is like.  The photography is so stunning that it virtually eliminates the need for dialogue only about half the film has discourse and coupled with the horrifically spooky and scathing soundtrack the film literally takes on a life of its own.My only objection is that when all is said and done the only character we really understand is the serial killer.  Several clues about the other characters' pasts led me to believe that their lives would come into play and that their own memories would be tested and confronted.  To me this would have taken this story to yet another psychological level but perhaps it would have been too much for viewers.Despite this shortcoming The Cell' stills provides a myriad of images that will make you want to watch a lot of cute cartoons before turning in for the night.  Still I don't know what was more disturbing the movie or the parents in the next row over who brought their two small kids to watch it.".

This movie is something you could and can be only imagined. And if you then told someone about it they'd have you locked up for a very long time. It could be categorized as a Scifi thriller and then as a serial killer film. Like Seven and Silence of the Lambs this is not the ordinary serial killer film. It stands on it's own as a new kind of thriller.Jennifer Lopez stars as Catherine Deane the best psychotherapist in the business. She works for a company who has developed the latest technology in therapy. She has the ability to go inside the mind of anyone and find out the reasoning to his or her distress. Enter Peter Novak Vince Vaughn a FBI agent tracking down a very sick serial killer Carl Stargher Vincent D'Onofrio who drowns his victims then dresses them up like dolls. On a FBI raid of his home Stargher goes into a coma and the whereabouts of his next victim are unknown. So Deane takes the job of going into his mind to find out where the victim is being held. And that's when this film gets intense seriously intense.The director Tarsem Singh known for the award winning R.E.M. video Losing my Religion' blows away everything you could have imagined. The dream sequences are beautifully shot with many camera tricks creepy color distribution graphic images and a tense score. They are extremely trippy and surreal. They actually have a dream feel because anything goes and there are no rules. Lopez performance is as good as she looks. She nails the psychotherapist dead on and does a great job in showing the different aspects of her character. Vince is Vince very cool very low key and very real. D'Onofrio will scare you. His Carl Stargher would make even Hannibal Lecter scream for mommy. This guy is more disturbed than ever imagined. He has to be seen to believe it.Tarsem with this film has become one of my favorite directors and I will go see any film with his name on it. The Cell can only be described as a Scifi serial killer thriller that's visually disturbing creepy and one of the wildest films ever. It runs along the line with Seven for a good serial killer film and Event Horizon for a graphically sick and twisted film. This is best summer movie and the best film I've seen all year.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey about the world it shows during this journey the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane Jennifer Lopez in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West Dylan Baker and Miriam Kent Marianne JeanBaptiste believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.The real story then. A serial killer named Carl Vincent D'Onofrio just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey Jake Weber and Novak Vince Vaughn are on this case. Another girl Tara Subkoff disappears and at that time after forensic research on the dumped body Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl just went into a coma he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short Carl is unknown territory schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours makes sure Catherine will try to get the location out of Carl's mind.It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh who did music videos before this in a way goes back to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new the way 'Three Kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself without the great fantasy world is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded of course events are not yet possible in our real world. Still a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.".

This movie is a perfect mix of an arthouse type of movie and a typical Hollywoodthriller that is accessible to both fans of the genre.The story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. Because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like I mentioned before the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serialkiller with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I'm not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. He didn't fit the role well enough and no I'm not saying that because I'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.The musical score by Howard Shore was also surprising good and was sort of Se7en like at times. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.It's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still The Cell is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see due to its style originality and creativity.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy and the things that Catherine Deane Jennifer Lopez sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher Vincent D'Onofrio are amazingly imaginative and fascinating most of this stuff has never been seen in film before.The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. In fact it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim while in The Cell you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However despite the unfortunately weak story The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. None that have ever been made even come close to it. Also the film had good direction and was extremely well acted. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 remake of Psycho and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career the other being the great Out of Sight. Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history. The Cell is an incredibly wellmade film and it deserves to be recognized.".

Unfortunately the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane JLo goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim. Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production. Each dream sequence is like a nightmareish painting in motion from the landscapes to the costumes. But the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about. Without him you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary. Lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway though she's as gorgeous as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he overacts to boot. He tried too hard to become his character and it showed. Stick to comedy Vince! Even so this movie is so visually frightening I still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations.  This is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent.  This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting.  To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point.  This movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow.  The Cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination.  So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more?  Personally I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him.We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes I do agree that the genre is a bit overworked.  The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed.  But The Cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another.  Instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. The Cell wants to let you see what it's all about and not how it's all about and I guess that's what some people don't like.  True I do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another.  Nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing.  I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like.  If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself.  Not because there's nothing else to say but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought The Cell was.  If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eyepopping feast then you are assured a good time.  I guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy.  I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley.  Leaving the theater I heard one audience member say Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.  If so I want what he was smoking. out of 4".

The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting . If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher then sets up a different film entirely This wouldn't be enough to make THE CELL a different class of thriller but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller . The cinematography by Paul Laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but Singh doesn't let it end there  things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative . We see a third character  a FBI man enter Stargher's domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing momentsIt should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable  then involving . One scene where a FBI agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button .

It isn't pretty inside Stargher's mind  with time running out the pressure is on to find the answers...This American German coproduction was the feature film directorial debut of Tarsem Singh  while one cannot deny The Cell is a striking visual experience it's less impressive on other counts. If we forget about the lush  extravagant visuals for a moment there's not that much of a film here to be honest the serial killer angle is laid bare within the opening sequence  as such there are no twists or surprises in that regard. We know Stargher is the killer from the getgo  the film plays to expectations in this aspect. The character's are fairly poor the ever awful Jennifer Lopez's character in particular has no sort of story at all we never find anything out about her  apart from walking around some fancy sets wearing some bizarre clothes she doesn't really have anything to do. Other character are similarly short changed in the development stakes. At about 100 odd minutes the pace is alright but I did like the film better while it was a straight serial killer thriller  I sort of lost interest once Lopez went into Stargher's mind with some surreal  bizarre moments that aren't exactly bad but I didn't really know what to make of them. The actually process in which Lopez enters Stargher's mind is never really explained  it looks more like virtual reality than a computer programme with those suits that they wear. I didn't hate The Cell but I didn't love it either it looks fantastic but it's also rather shallow  somewhat empty on the inside.As already mentioned by just about everyone else who has ever seen The Cell some of the visuals are stunning from the sets to the special effects  the costumes which are lavish extravagant  a joy to see. The Cell is a great looking very arty  frankly gorgeously photographed film. The camera is free flowing it travels everywhere from high shots to wide shots to tracking shots there's always something to look at  appreciate in The Cell but is that enough? Not really. There's a bit of nastiness with D'Onofrio hanging himself from the ceiling by metal hooks  masturbating over his dead victim  there's also an unpleasant scene in which someones guts are pulled out of their body on a spit roast thing. While it looks great  it's inspiration lies in surreal paintings  other works it's not scary  there's surprisingly little tension as it's fairly predictable with no real twists or surprises.With a supposed budget of about 33000000 The Cell looks great  has lavish production values  decent CGI effects filmed in California  Namibia. The acting is OK I personally hate Jennifer Lopez as I don't think she can act I don't think shes that good looking  she definitely can't sing so whats the point of her existence?The Cell is a visually striking serial killer thriller that is very easy on the eye  features some truly memorable imagery but it doesn't really cut the mustard on any other count. Followed by a DTV sequel The Cell 2 2009 which by all accounts is awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Weak script. Bad acting except for D'Onofrio who has done memorable work. Even big Latin butts don't do it for me. Watch Musetta Vander as Mrs Baines who outclasses Lopez. Science fiction with absolutely no science. Every plot device is stolen.What is interesting is the art  I suppose it is a matter of taste how effective it is. I really like this sort of thing when done well. Done poorly is What Dreams May Come.' Done well is Prospero's Books.'In between are all manner of mixes of brilliant imagination and pretense. I'm willing to tolerate a lot of pretense because I think the world needs lots of risktaking so far as cinematic vision. Titus' failed to hit a home run with me but I celebrate the attempt. Not so sure here.The problem I have is a matter of coherent vision. Some scenes impress. Some effects work. But it is all a jumble as if many people generated many different notions using whatever was available. If an attempt had some power it was kept regardless of whether it fit an overall concept. So what we have is a dozen different 3 minute episodes that use roughly the same characters. Some are effective most not. Few are original.Ridley Scott and Peter Greenaway have the ability to build a vision that is sustained through a film that because it sustains can be elaborated and enfold depth. Their visions can serve as a structure into which other components fit. With less novelty all good directors do. DePalma comes to mind.

Watch Musetta Vander as Mrs Baines who outclasses Lopez. Science fiction with absolutely no science. Every plot device is stolen.What is interesting is the art  I suppose it is a matter of taste how effective it is. I really like this sort of thing when done well. Done poorly is What Dreams May Come.' Done well is Prospero's Books.'In between are all manner of mixes of brilliant imagination and pretense. I'm willing to tolerate a lot of pretense because I think the world needs lots of risktaking so far as cinematic vision. Titus' failed to hit a home run with me but I celebrate the attempt. Not so sure here.The problem I have is a matter of coherent vision. Some scenes impress. Some effects work. But it is all a jumble as if many people generated many different notions using whatever was available. If an attempt had some power it was kept regardless of whether it fit an overall concept.

	schema:reviewBody "Tarsem Singh is certainly a photographer at heart and the surreal imagery of this movie is definitely gallery worthy.This is a suspense thriller that delves into the mind of a serial killer that seemingly euthanized his victims not out of spite but out of pity. This is illustrated when as a child he drowns a small bird before his abusive father can defile it. It was more humane to kill the bird than to let it live in such an ugly world filled with pain and this was emphasized with Carl the killer even at a young age.Much of the movie is shot from the perspective of Carl as a child no doubt to gain sympathy from the viewer while he sets in an animated reversion of sorts while communicating synaptically with Lopez's psychotherapist character. It was interesting to see him speaking of his first messy inexperienced endeavor with misty reminiscence and also to view the symbolism of the white dog or of how he hung himself from the chains. Better than the story though was the cinematography. It was stunning.I was taken back to this film when I viewed the Bodies display at the Tropicana which I believe is now showing at the Luxor in Las Vegas. For those of you haven't been these are actual humans preserved in silicone on display actively posed for easy viewing of vascularization musculature organ systems etc In the film it was a horse with transverse cross sections between plated glass. The attention to detail with regard to the succinct slices showing the yet operational organs made my twisted little heart soar.It's interesting to me that Singh hasn't released much since The Cell but he does have Immortals and The Brothers Grim Snow White in the works. If you haven't seen this movie see it especially if you dug Se7en or Red Dragon. It has a similar cop hot on the trail feel to it and much like the others the villain is a shining enigma with a troubled past and a demented message of sorts. While Se7en gets kudos for creativity and Red Dragon has Fiennes The Cell still has the unmatched scenery that makes me consider it to be ever so slightly better than the aforementioned.If you love gore such as an excruciating spooling of Vince Vaughn's intestines slowly onto a wheel and you want to be visually dazzled this is your flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has some of the wildest visuals I'd seen up to the time of my first viewing of this in April of 2001. The visuals were easily the highlight of the film. It isn't the story because that's too much on the sordid side. Sometimes it's just plain too uncomfortable.It's another demented serial killer story this one as sick an individual as I've seen although thankfully there are not a lot of scenes with him. The switch is that he is captured early on but is in a catatoniclike state and unable to talk. His latest victim must be found quickly or she will die as the others did. The only way to find where this woman is stashed is by going inside his brain and try to solve the puzzle. That's Jennifer Lopez's role here as Catherine Deane. When she enters the visuals are perhaps like someone on LSD and they are very interesting along with good sound effects. It's a bizarre story that keeps your attention although gruesome at times. I haven't seen this film since 2002 and since then became a fan of Vincent D'Onofrio's detective character in Law and Order Criminal Intent. I'm not sure I want to go back and see him as this sick killer now that I am used to seeing him as a good guy. However I am curious about that.The bad points of the film to me were 1 a definite antiChristian cheap shot in which it is shown that the killer was first tortured when he was baptized through immersion and held too long under water by his sadistic father. In addition to the obvious bias it also shows you how theologically ignorant Hollywood is thinking the parent does the baptizing. Wrong. Anway in conjunction with that the killer is shown ore as a young boy than any other period and then is seen to be a sympathetic figure! Only with Liberals is there sympathy for the sadistic killer more than his victims!! At least there is one cop in here who states that a horrible childhood doesn't have to turn someone into a sick killer.So th question for me wound up being are the visuals worth putting up with the unpleasant story. The answer wound up being no.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cell is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the subconscious minds that is stunning with lavish visuals and incredible mindtripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. And there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona. The movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. While I feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience I find it to be completely fascinating.Right from the opening credits with Lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress you will know that you are in for a visual treat. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her patients they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. The camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. If you don't enjoy anything else about The Cell you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.The casting is top notch also. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here utilizing her natural compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the romcom world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is fairly convincing as an FBI agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. It's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted at his actions yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful within his realm yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. It's a great performance from an underrated actor.While The Cell doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts some of the actions of the characters are not believable and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic it is an occasionally shocking visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.".

Things start getting hectic when she enters the mind of a psychotic killer named Carl Stargher Vincent D'onofrio in order to find out where he has hidden his latest victim.There were plenty of interesting scenes from a cinematic perspective but the dialogue and story itself did little to make this movie very good. The idea of going into another realm to accomplish something in reality is nothing new even if it is going into someone's mind. When you strip back all of the visual stimuli you are left with sophomoric psychology and a weaker version of Silence of the Lambs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Catherine Deane is a psychotherapist who has become involved in an innovative project to treat a catatonic boy who has not responded to normal treatment. The technique involves entering the boy's mind space and working with his subconscious to treat him. Progress has been slow though and the project is close to being wrapped up. Meanwhile the FBI are close to catching a serial killer who drowns women as a form of torture before making them look like dolls and dumping their bodies. Clues lead them to find Carl but only as he falls into a coma of his own. With a girl still missing and no clue as to where she is slowly being drowned the FBI turn to Deane and her team to go inside Carl's mind and try and find out where the girl is before it is too late.I'm not sure if the plot is harder to swallow than Lopez's casting but certainly both these things take a certain amount of swallowing to get into this film. The plot takes elements from other films including all manner of serial killer movies to produce a setup that is hardly that inspiring a narrative on paper. However it works reasonably well enough as a frame for imaginative visual development. Naturally filling a film with style risks the substance falling down but here the former just about covers up for the weaknesses in the latter. Of course it never gets above the level of derivative serial killer movie and a load of obvious psychoanalysis stop it becoming very dark but in this area music video director Singh comes into his own.His visions are impressive and he directs really well with his expensive range of effects. True the material limits the meaning within the visual but it is hard to find the scenes dull! The cast are more part of these visuals than characters. Lopez is unconvincing and just simpers her way across the film unable to really get any depth out of the story. Vaughn makes for a solid if unspectacular leading man while D'Onofrio hams it up the main villain. Support from Weber JeanBaptiste and a few others add a bit of interest and credit to Subkoff who produces a convincing turn despite being isolated from the majority of the story.Overall this is an average serial killer movie that is only really worth seeing because of the visuals. The story could have been much stronger but it works as a frame for the visual effects  which is pretty much the same for the cast who are just part of the look of the film rather than well developed characters.".

The island is inhabited exclusively by blacks. He quickly learns that his students who have never left the island lack not only a basic understanding of academic items such as the alphabet and simple arithmetic but also of other basic necessities of life such as personal hygiene. They can't even pronounce his name they who call him Conrack. The teachers before him including the school principal Mrs. Scott have always treated the students as being slow and basically unteachable of academics. Conrack a free thinking man decides to expose his students not only to the academic subjects but also to the gamut of life skills from brushing one's teeth to human anatomy and some of the fun things in life like ...";

Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedoracist leanings of the Superintendent Mr. Skeffington.  That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change and more specifically cultural change.  Often at the expense of children.  When these battles finally come to a boil Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphant. Or does it?  The children that he has to leave are better off for knowing him more exposed to the real world and to classical music.  The other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned much about himself.  A great film with a heartbreaking ending.  I recomend that anyone who enjoyed the film to read the book The Water is Wide by Pat Conroy. It will stay with you!".

Watch for it on Fox Movie Channel as they often show the letterbox version.";

I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema.  A true polished diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight lead character Conrack as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children all in one school.  At first the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home.  The heart of the movie is Conrack finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them.  The students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that only a short time before had been foreign to them.  Conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be oh a little fun!  God forbid.  Learning AND fun?  Together?  Can't be or so says the ones in charge.  To avoid a spoiler I shall just say that Conrack finds resistance with the boss man....and the ending is truly bittersweet.I am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience so I should identify with the lead character Pat Conroy aka Conrack Mr. Petroy. But I don't I identify with the black kids.  As a kid I was bussed to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade circa 1979. These kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then.  Luckily in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old one doesn't understand racism.  I just remember we were all being kids playing 4square kickball hideandseek and running relays.This movie is very moving.  There are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end nonstop.  I found myself many times with tears in my eyes then suddenly laughing out loud.  It's a funny movie.Git away from that winda!!.... Sir if you're prepared to accept crap I should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap...... So you the white schoolteacher Mr. Conrack.  My grands LOVE Mr. Conrack. You a good looking teacher you a good looking white man...... wind 15 mph from the east.  Small boat warning.  Small boats beware. Big boats OK don't gotta worry 'bout nothing..... not a fry cook but Eleanor Roosevelt not a sharecropper but something Latin...that's Latin..hey wait!.... Conrack sing like a frog....I sing good whatcha talkin' 'bout?!.It still mystifies me that I still hear nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following.  I intend to seek out more reviews comments background and making of tidbits if they are out there. What amazes me is the acting given from the untrained kids.  One of the kids Mary I understand was an actress and you can tell.  However the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions.  I wonder how they did it! I'm guessing that Conrack and Mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or adlibbed.Conrack is a special movie.  In my opinion it is one of the very few movies that are so good AND so unknown.  Others in that category are King Rat '65 Dark Passage '47 with Bogie and Bacall Gods Must Be Crazy '80 and Bad Day at Black Rock '55.  I recommend them all.  But first take a seat in the class of Mr. Conrack.".

But he evidently grew up in the South military family attended the Citadel and then finally found his head different from most of the others in his community.  Social friction in the South is nothing to mess with.  No sir.  He's writing good novels and letters to the editor.  I admire him tremendously.  The movie reminds me of a lesson in an introductory philosophy class about the fallacy of arguing by analogy.  Time is like a river you see and you can travel back in time because you can paddle upstream in a river.  Conrack gives us a little trip into the past when things were even worse than they are now.  The AfricanAmerican kids he's teaching don't know what country they live in or the name of the ocean lapping at the shores of their little island. Perhaps now overgrown with expensive condos.  He paints himself as an inspiring teacher.  He can't help it.  He was callow and anyway autobiographies don't have much choice  they're either hagiographic or honest and in the second case the author always comes out looking like a Schmuck.  Anyhow in the end he admits failure though through no fault of his own.  John Voight known for his involvement in sociopolitical issues is the perfect choice for Conroy's surrogate and Martin Ritt perhaps the best possible director given his having lived in the South and coped with it though his hand slips from time to time and we get black kids answering Conrack's questions in plainsong.  The musical score sucks so when the kids are out on a Halloween spree we have music that belongs in Robin Hood.  The photography is good. The film hit a nerve.  I was subbing as a teacher in elementary school in the South at one point.  My wife at the time was a professor at UNC Wilmington and told me matter of factly how she was having lunch with her colleagues and some guy's daughter met him in the cafeteria and told him so enthusiastically about the new substitute teacher they had that day and it was only after several minutes of conversation that she realized the girl was talking about me.  I can't remember many moments in my life when I felt more pleased.  Nothing is as exalting as seeing somebody's face light up when they learn something new and extraordinary.  I've seen it in kindergarten kids and in Marines at Camp Lejeune people wincing with pleasure at the dawning of a new realization. As Mel Brooks might say It's good to be da teacher.  Conrack gets that idea across most effectively.".

	schema:headline " Concrack Truly In A Class By Itself ";
	schema:reviewBody "Superb story of a dedicated young teacher who sets out teaching minority children in an area off South Carolina.Jon Voight is just tremendous as the headstrong dedicated idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal who believes in stern discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques as well as a crusty old school superintendent played with relish by the late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her babies.As I'm a retired teacher I could in some ways relate to this excellent film.

Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her babies.As I'm a retired teacher I could in some ways relate to this excellent film.

It helps that this is a true story or as true as a film adapted from a book adapted from real life can be.Martin Ritt was a very good director known mainly for Hud which he did about ten years prior. Jon Voight has never been more charismatic than this he's like a shining beacon of inspiration throughout the film. You really believe that he believes every word he is saying and that adds a ton of weight to his character. I really enjoyed Hume Cronyn here he's somehow mischievous without being friendly serious and a little bit mean. It's a great characterization.The passion in Voight's sparkling eyes seems to be more than what carries the film. It's a great story and a fantastic reflection of Pat Conroy's writing. The story is powerful convincing and exceptionally inspiring.".

The academian we speak of is the main character Pat Conroy who is the one and only lone teacher hired to take on the responsibility of a sort of old time one room school house on an island off the coast of South Carolina.CONRACK Jon Voight the name that the youngsters dub him finds conditions in the school terribly backward. In addition to the physical properties of this Little Red Schoolhouse any systematic and progressively graduated educational system was totally absent.OH yeah by the way did we mention that further complications to any successful educational venture were manifested in two incontrovertible facts. Those were that Pat Conroy was both an outsider and he was white with almost the entire population of this offshore cay was black and very poor.PERPETUATING these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local board of education being the school's Principal Mrs. Scott Madge Sinclair and the Superintendent Mr. Skeffington Mr. Hume Cronyn. Between the two we are made to understand that the teacher being the low man on the totem pole is powerless in most respects to affect any sort of meaningful longlasting improvements.BUT don't you tell a 'Young Turk' such as Pat Conroy that he can't. Can't anything that is. Conrack spends a year of unorthodox classroom performances and is making real progress but alas the strongheaded teacher won't give in and recognize the authority of his superiors. While he is by law and unbeknownst to him serving at thee super's pleasure he disobeys Mr. Skeffington's specific order and prohibition to take his class kids to the mainland of South Carolina on Halloween for some TrickorTreating even going to the brazen act of stopping with them at the Skeffington residence.NEXT we see a Western Union Telegram messenger happily singing as he crosses from the Carolina mainland to the island where he delivers the telegram to Conroy that bore the news of his dismissal from his position with that school and district.NOT BEING one to take his being fired lying down Pat files suit against Mr. Skeffington Principal Mrs. Scott and the Board of Education protesting his dismissal as being unlawful. Impartially reviewing both the offense and the law the Judge asks Skeffington if there are any lesser punishments that could be substituted for Conroy's being separated from the school system to which he receives a negative response. Fittingly the Judge dismisses the suit with his gavel pounding down while saying It's very simple! THE story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion as the 'Conrack'students see him off to the mainland bound launch while a phonograph record provides us with BEETHOVEN'S 5th SYMPHONY which had played an important part in the Conroy educational agenda as well as our story.IN THE HUMBLE opinion of this writer the story which we believe was at least semiautobiographical even giving the main character the name of its author was much more than a tale of a localized happening. To both me pal Schultz and meself this is a sort of depiction of a microcosm that represents the overall deplorable conditions that permeate the Government Schools throughout the entire nation. Just an opinion AS FOR THIS film it was just one of many movies portraying the stores of common folk leading their lives of quiet desperation in the great hinterlands of the country which lie outside the D.C. Beltway and the urban centers of enterprise and communications situated on either the Atlantic or Pacific Coasts.IN ITS OWN small way this is a fine film which would soon be joined in the film vaults of 20th CenturyFox by such great works as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. both being from TCF in 1979.SEE it if you ain't yet.

	schema:reviewBody "I have very mixed feelings about this film.As a retired teacher and school administrator I'm appalled at the scattershot curriculum that Conrack is teaching the children in the film. He seems like a very appealing teaching and yet it's been my experience that some of the most appealing teachers actually teach the least to their students. I kept thinking ahead 5 10 20 years. How would his curriculum help those children? We'll never know. How nice it would be to somehow be able to follow some them into adulthood.On the other hand there are performances here that are almost stunning starting with Jon Voight. I first saw Voight in Midnight Cowboy a film I hated although I can admire his performance. Then in Deliverance I film I rather enjoyed and recently rewatched and I thought his performance was quite good. I enjoyed him very much in The Odessa File Coming Home The Champ and Table For Five. And then for me he sort of fell off my radar. But it was actually this film I most enjoyed for his performance. It just felt free and easy and thinking back to my younger years as a teacher I could identify with him as the character if not his methods which seemed to be well meaning. And appropriately for the film he had to be about the whitestskinned actor in Hollywood get some tan man! This was the first film in which I saw Madge Sinclair here as the principal. Excellent performance.But most of all I remember the performance of Hume Cronyn as the school superintendent. With such a long and distinguished career I know I must have seen Cronyn previously but it was this film where I really noticed him. He was a favorite character actor of mine ever after. Here though his character is unlikable his performance shines.So I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not impressed how the film portrays teaching but I'm impressed with the film as a story.".

Then in Deliverance I film I rather enjoyed and recently rewatched and I thought his performance was quite good. I enjoyed him very much in The Odessa File Coming Home The Champ and Table For Five. And then for me he sort of fell off my radar. But it was actually this film I most enjoyed for his performance. It just felt free and easy and thinking back to my younger years as a teacher I could identify with him as the character if not his methods which seemed to be well meaning. And appropriately for the film he had to be about the whitestskinned actor in Hollywood get some tan man! This was the first film in which I saw Madge Sinclair here as the principal. Excellent performance.But most of all I remember the performance of Hume Cronyn as the school superintendent. With such a long and distinguished career I know I must have seen Cronyn previously but it was this film where I really noticed him. He was a favorite character actor of mine ever after. Here though his character is unlikable his performance shines.So I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not impressed how the film portrays teaching but I'm impressed with the film as a story.";

Now don't get me wrong I'm a 'B' Western fan from way back but if you get a chance to view any of these you'll have to take them with a good ole boy grain of nostalgia and an appreciation for simpler times.Actually Rider of Destiny might have been the better title since it's Wayne's show all the way. He portrays Singin' Sandy Saunders and has a reputation as the most notorious gunman since Billy the Kid. That's somewhat ironic though since it's later revealed that he's a special Secret Service agent sent from Washington to investigate a land swindle scheme under the direction of town boss James Kincaid Forrest Taylor. How would he have earned that nickname having just arrived? Some other bits don't quite jive as well like Saunders' finesse with a six gun. In the only actual one on one showdown with a villain that I can recall in a Lone Star Saunders neatly places a bullet in each wrist of Slip Morgan Earl Dwire thereby making him a threat no more to righteous folks. One wonders how he might have learned to shoot like that.But you know what? It doesn't make too much of a difference because if you're a fan of these oaters you'll have a blast with this one as much as all the rest. You've got your crazy horse spills wild stage coach rides and villainous intrigue to pull it all together. You also have your obligatory romantic leading lady here portrayed by Cecilia Parker. Her character is Fay Denton daughter of George preGabby Hayes and she signals her interest in Saunders right from the get go. He helps things along by serenading her with a few songs with Daddy present and boy they just can't get enough even if his singing voice is nothing at all like his speaking voice.Yakima Canutt is on hand as an unnamed Kincaid henchman and of course it's Yak that's responsible for all the daring stunt work including that trademark 'jump on the horse team and go under the stagecoach' trick simply remarkable if you consider the timing and logistics involved. His fellow baddies include a comedic pair of stage drivers also working for Kincaid Bert and Elmer Al St. John and Heinie Conklin. It would be a few years before Al becomes 'Fuzzy'.Modern day viewers might be left scratching their head over a line spoken by Wayne's character early in the film. When he discovers sheriff Bill Baxter wandering in the desert with a bullet wound he tends him while adding  I'll have you in Starbucks before night.A lot has been debated over who the singer was who dubbed Wayne's voice in this movie and The Man From Utah. A couple reviewers on this board credit old time band leader and crooner Smith Ballew although Ballew himself denied it consistently until he passed away. The odds on favorite seems to be Bill Bradbury son of director Robert North Bradbury and twin brother of another era cowboy star Bob Steele. Bill had a fine baritone voice and used his talent to make some extra money while going to medical school. For anyone who cares to learn more about the controversy check out the following page  httpwww.bwesterns.comjwayne1.htm.You'll have to scroll down to the bottom part of the page and it's a good read.Anyway for old time Western fans Riders of Destiny is as good a place as any to see how John Wayne learned his craft. Hard to believe that by the time he made his breakout film Stagecoach to become an overnight success he already had fifty one movies to his credit! Only one question remains though while watching 'Riders'  where were all those geese hanging out when there wasn't any water around?".

Intended only as supporting features these long forgotten studios turned out these 'B' movies by the shed load. Badly formed scripts with badly shaped characters must have poured though these fledgling studios like water through a hoop and with a stock company of actors who's style was still formed in the pantomime silent era they were bound to be a bit cheesy.

The line itself is worthy of side stitching surgery but the look of peace and serenity on his face was just too much for the old chuckle muscles which then went on to explode.I can honestly say that a truly inspired and well written comedy has never made me laugh as much as this film did.However the story is a good one with the corrupt businessman holding the town's ranchers to ransom over his monopoly in the water market with a view of buying up all the farms etc.It survives today as nothing more than a nostalgic glimpse into the past not only at a bygone era in cinema making but as a chance to see a real Hollywood legend finding his feet.

	schema:reviewBody "Had the good folks at Lone Star Productions only decided not to dub John Wayne's voice with some forgettable cowboy ballads this would have been a far better western than it turned out to be.Of course Wayne in later years would cringe at the mention of these films. If you want a good idea of how he really sounded listen to him in McLintock singing a favorite ballad of his The Moon Shines Tonight on Pretty Redwing. The Lone Star people might have even looked for a young band singer working day to day in clubs in New Jersey around this time named Frank Sinatra who over 30 years later actually had his voice come out of Wayne's mouth during a Dean Martin show.If they could have cut out the singing gimmick Riders of Destiny is not a bad film in fact a cut above some of the westerns the Duke was doing at the time. Ranchers in the valley are being squeezed out by a greedy villain played by Forrest Taylor. He's built a dam and controls all the water and it's either sell to him outright or pay his exorbitant prices for water. Gabby Hayes and his daughter Cecelia Parker happen to have the only other water around because they dug a well.

	onyx:emotionText "Had the good folks at Lone Star Productions only decided not to dub John Wayne's voice with some forgettable cowboy ballads this would have been a far better western than it turned out to be.Of course Wayne in later years would cringe at the mention of these films. If you want a good idea of how he really sounded listen to him in McLintock singing a favorite ballad of his The Moon Shines Tonight on Pretty Redwing. The Lone Star people might have even looked for a young band singer working day to day in clubs in New Jersey around this time named Frank Sinatra who over 30 years later actually had his voice come out of Wayne's mouth during a Dean Martin show.If they could have cut out the singing gimmick Riders of Destiny is not a bad film in fact a cut above some of the westerns the Duke was doing at the time. Ranchers in the valley are being squeezed out by a greedy villain played by Forrest Taylor. He's built a dam and controls all the water and it's either sell to him outright or pay his exorbitant prices for water. Gabby Hayes and his daughter Cecelia Parker happen to have the only other water around because they dug a well. Taylor especially wants their land.The citizens have written to the federal government in Washington for intervention and they get it in the form of John Wayne.

	schema:reviewBody "At the risk of sounding like a complete anorak I have to confess to a deep affection for John Wayne's Lone Star westerns. Every one has a mighty fine title usually nothing much to do with the story being told. They have that addictive quality that other people find in today's soap operas. In both types the plots are familiar and preposterous the characters are offthepeg the acting is poor the heroines are pretty and the leading man looks good especially on a horse in J.W.'s case.Of all J.W.'s Lone Star films this one is my favourite. It has all the virtues listed above maybe not as developed as in some of the later films but there nevertheless. I particularly enjoy the way a character is introduced in the first reel made to disappear for most of the film and reintroduced at the end. The heroine is delightful in jodhpurs and the bad guy simply looks dastardly in them. Then there are the pistols that seemingly are deadly at several hundred yards. And an important prop is what I take to be a genuine stagecoach.But this film has notable extras interesting singing some truly exciting stunt work and a remarkably lyrical climax that I don't think Robert N Banbury ever came close to emulating again. It's so good that you'd almost believe that Ingmar Bergman had seen this film and been inspired by it as he started on Virgin Spring.Note to students of film it's probably a bad idea to try that suggestion on your teacher!".

Yakima Cannutt should have stayed with the stunt work as he was certainly no actor! John Wayne as Singing Sandy is ridiculous. The songs are just silly and don't belong in the movie.

The actual singer is the director's son Bill Bradley who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff. The film features Cecilia Parker also seen in The Lost Jungle serial Tombstone Canyon and as older sister Marian in the Andy Hardy movies doing her best Katherine Hepburn Really they mustn't really I'm not Al St. John before he literally became Fuzzy filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping head and chin scratching grimacing and gawky physical gestures and movements George preGabby Hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father and Forrest Taylor minor vet of 395 movies and TV shows playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar. Fun or odd moments Yakima Canutt's great 'under the stagecoach' trick the 'gay' scene when Singin' Sandy ties Bert and Elmer together face to face drags them roped to his horse and dumps them at Kincaid's office where Kincaid says You're a fine pair of lovebirds! Denton's rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by 'Sandy'  Ummm. I could listen to that all night! Kincaid's reply We won't go into that after being told by a rancher You've got the soul of a snake! and of course he utters the immortal I've made Denton an offer he can't refuse. The plot of the movie is saved by Sandy's tricking Kincaid and later saying the three magic words in many of these films I'm from Washington. FDR has saved us from the Depression! Is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate? The shootout sequence is taken from the earlier Bradbury film Man from Hell's Edges 1932. All of the Lone Star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters the troupe of actors and stunt people and the spin on the clichs and repetitive back stories and situations. This one ranks a little low marred by the inappropriate and misused Singing Cowboy gimmick. I'll give it a 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the 1930s John Wayne was NOT the huge star many would have thought but just one of many minor stars playing in Bwesterns to eke out a living. His westerns were made for many socalled 'poverty row' studios in that they had minuscule budgets and limited resourcesand very modest pretenses. If you are the critical sort you can find a ton of problems with these films though if you are a more charitable sort you'll see that they are entertaining...provided you understand they are just Bmovies...and not particularly distinguished ones at that.Here in 1933 Wayne was in some of his earliest Bs so his persona wasn't yet established. Some knuckleheads thought he'd be great as Singin' Sandya singing cowboy much in the mold of Gene Autry. The only problem was that Wayne sang about as well as Andy Devineso they had to dub this singingand it's painfully obvious it ain't Wayne doing any of this! Seen today it's laughable as the movie begins and Wayne is crooning a very maudlin tuneespecially as he begins to sing each time he's about to have a shootout! You just HAVE to see and hear these scenes to believe them!! In addition to Wayne the film has a few other familiar faces. Gabby Hayes is herelike he would be in most of Wayne's Bs. Al St. John is also here for comic relief along with Heinie Conklin. It's not surprising the pair would be included as comics as both had extensive silent comedy experience. St. John was Fatty Arbuckle's nephew and nemesis in many of his films...and later a very familiar western sidekick in the 1940s. Conklin had worked for Mack Sennett as one of the Keystone Kops. Unfortunately too often the pair just seemed way way too dumb to be bad guysno gang leader is THAT desperate for henchmen!! Plus they never are nearly as funny as Sandy's singing!! Like just about all of Wayne's films here he is a lawman investigating an evil gang leader. In this case the gang's fighting over water rights. Their scumbag leader owns the water for the valley and now that his contract is about to expire with the nearby ranchers he's planning on charging ridiculous prices for the use of the water in order to destroy them. However he is willing to buy them outfor only 1 and acre! Nice guy huh? Can Wayne sort all this out before the ranchers either give up or an allout range war take place? While this film is diverting I have to say that compared to the westerns made for this same pennyante studio in the next couple years Lone Star this one is clearly inferior. Most of this is due to the stupid singing gimmick though St. John and Conklin didn't help matters any.".

Wayne comes into the mix by helping a girl who robs a stage coach in order to get back the money taken from her father. It's a rambling mess where 20 minutes pass with a minimal amount of plot transpiring while the two stage coach drivers wander about being silly in an attempt to capture the robber. The film then kind of settles down at that pint with Wayne romancing the girl and taking on the bad guys. Its twenty minutes of plot stretched to 55 minutes and for me its intolerable. Things just ramble onward in such away that you can't believe its taking as long as it is. I wanted to scream. Actually I reached for the remote and began scanning through the romance and horse riding bits. Sure Wayne is clearly a star but the film he's in is a crashing bore. I'd avoid it unless you like this sort of thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "To state the obvious  no one absolutely no one is ever going to mistake this for a great movie. I wasn't even really sure what the title was trying to get at. Riders Of Destiny? What does that mean? It is however an interesting movie. It's a short 53 minutes BWestern probably a secondary feature that would have introduced the main feature at a theatre. Most interestingly is that it's a very early example of John Wayne's work he became such a legend that many probably didn't know that he started in low budget Bmovies. As far as I know this is actually the earliest John Wayne movie I've ever seen my previous exposure to his earliest work would have been 1934's Blue Steel. He was 26 years old when this was made and  not exactly in keeping with his later persona that everyone is more accustomed to  he plays Singin' Sandy Saunders you have to promise not to laugh who sets out to help local ranchers whose water is being cut off by a greedy businessman in town who owns all the water rights. Now in fairness the story isn't actually all that bad. As befits a movie less than an hour long it moves along crisply and it's pretty easy to follow. You kind of know how it's going to turn out but there is a brief period of time when Singin' Sandy's identity becomes a bit of a mystery.Singin' Sandy sings usually very maudlin and even depressing songs  except that it was apparently not John Wayne's voice but someone else never definitely identified apparently  probably by their own choice dubbed over. The big question would be why  if they were going to dub  didn't they find someone who could actually sing? The singing was truly terrible. There's one scene in the Denton's ranch where Singin' Sandy kind of serenades young Fay played by Cecelia Parker while her dad Gabby Hayes watches. It is truly hard to believe that Fay wouldn't have burst out giggling at the awful sound emanating from Singin' Sandy's mouth and in fact Parker did seem at one point to grin at whatever sounds if any Wayne was making as he mouthed the words and the viewer has to laugh a bit as Singin' Sandy finishes the song and Denton Hayes looks at him apparently in awe and says I could listen to that all night. I'm sure there wasn't a lot to do for entertainment in the Old West  but seriously I don't think so.The singing aside I'll concede that it isn't awful. It tries to incorporate some slapstick humour every now and then usually featuring Al St. John and Heinie Conklin two veterans of the silent movie scene whose slapstick in this looked like silent movie stuff as Bert and Elmer  the henchmen of the evil business man Kincaid played by Forrest Taylor.Watch it as a curiosity with a decent story but lots of problems. 410".

I have seen quite a few of Duke's movies from this period and still my mouth hung open in shock. The plot is about government agent Singin' Sandy Saunders audible groan from me just typing that trying to put a stop to a bad guy withholding water from ranchers. Sandy also catches the attention of Andy Hardy's sister Cecilia Parker who's the daughter of Gabby Hayes.Now as shocking as John Wayne doing the Gene Autry routine is the bigger shock is that this actually isn't a bad movie! For a B western of the time it's better than average. Wayne is personable and believable as the hero of course. Parker is pretty and likable one of Duke's better love interests in these cheapies. Some highlights are Gabby Hayes' enthusiasm for biscuits Yakima Canutt's stunts and all of the laughable scenes where Duke lipsyncs. But the single best scene is when Sandy is called out for a shootout and the townsfolk suddenly realize who he is. Why that's Singin' Sandy someone says with a straight face. Unreal.".

Ellington he's not.His eyes were blazing with flames of hate And his guns were loaded with poison bait As they hung and swung at his side.That's Wayne as Singin Saunders known around the Old West as the most notorious gunman since Billy the Kid apparently for his ability to mow down hombres acapella. As an offstage singer tunelessly mutters lyrics while caressing a guitar with an oven mitt Wayne lipsynchs his way into battle.It's the first of three Lone Star singingcowboy roles for Wayne and the one that jumps out at you for the way it is doggedly incorporated into the plot with five separate scenes where Wayne's character breaks into song.When Wayne isn't singing his quiet strength and easy charm make him a good fit for a lowkey oater about a rough boss named Kincaid Forrest Taylor using his water rights to starve out a lawabiding town. Cecilia Parker makes for a lovely love interest and Wayne is partnered for the first time ever by George not yet Gabby Hayes as Parker's pa. They make a fine trio.Unfortunately this film has other issues. Everyone in it operates as if no one has a memory lasting more than five minutes. For example after Parker's character is saved by Saunders she comes to believe he is working for Kincaid and confronts him. Saunders shoots Kincaid's chief muscle and then gets offered the vacated job because Kincaid doesn't hold grudges.One sequence involves Saunders' plan to bypass Kincaid's water rights chokehold by having a stooge ride a water wagon to the town wait for Kincaid's goons to ride up and shoot said stooge in middrive then ride up behind the goons and board the runaway wagon before it goes off a cliff. It's a good plan because BRIEF SPOILER Saunders works for the government and clinging onto the bottom of a runaway wagon restricts his ability to burst into song.The film suffers from a strange decision to save on comic relief by having clowns Al St. John and Heinie Conklin double as Kincaid's main henchmen. They stumble around in pursuit of Sandy in a serious of contrived encounters one of which winds up with them lassoed together. You make a fine pair of lovebirds Kincaid sneers.But the real black mark on this lemon is the singing. Wayne didn't like having to do it and it shows in a performance suggesting director Robert N. Bradbury had Wayne's family and dog tied up somewhere. It's an uncomfortable start to Wayne's Lone Star era which did produce some decent results once Wayne left his guitar with Gene and Roy.".

Some gags are derivative from their earlier work but when you consider this film was their first for five years after their last Hollywood produced film The Bullfighters the routines are executed confidently as you'd expect from these professionals. Some scenes are not up to much but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny and as such absolutely priceless. I particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene.I felt sad at the end of the film. Our heros are left on their own desert island. It's such a metaphor for the real life truth. Hollywood and audiences of the time had consigned the stars to a desert island of memories and that was to become last image they portrayed in film. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan turned down an offer to appear in It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World in 1963. What a shame that was  a colour film only two years before he passed. However his health probably wasn't up to much.These boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time and although the movie is far from their true potential it's still an honour to watch them appear in film for the last time and touching on the echos of their towering talent.".

Sure Stan does look ill in some shots but the boys are still funny and the story is engaging enough. I love the fact that the film was shot in Europe. It gives it a fresh look that is absent from their older studiobound films. Some gags are better than othersthe loading of the boat is quite funny and the whole premise of the boys creating a country without taxes and laws works quite well. In a very funny moment Ollie declares himself president and names the other 3 original inhabitants to key posts relegating poor Stan to the status of the people. The supporting cast are all dubbed but this does not hinder the film. What doesn't quite work is the whole subplot about the sexy French singer and her fianc. They could have cut that down a bit. Overall not bad at all. If you're a LH fan do yourself a favour and give this film a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS FOR THE SPOILED'Utopia' AKA 'Atoll K' is widely reviled by Laurel  Hardy fans. Being a fan of the Boys myself I had to find this stinker and see what was wrong with it. For the most part very little is wrong except for atrocious overdubbing and Stan's appearance. He filmed this movie while in the throes of illness and it really shows. He looks horribly drawn  actually he looks drawn and quartered  but he soldiers on playing the manchild character we know him best as. Similarly while Babe Hardy is definitely aging and carrying more weight than in the team's glory days his characterization is just as wonderful as ever.There are plenty of instances in this film where classic LH humor takes over such as the dinner scene in the cabin of the boat or the cargoloading sequence. The Boys are consistently incharacter and deliver their lines with their usual spark.Knowing the story of the production of Utopia it's amazing to me that they managed to grind out a movie at all let alone one that stayed true to Laurel  Hardy's longestablished characters. As bad is it is Utopia captures for the last time on film the essential sweetness of the Boys and while I wouldn't recommend it as a 'great' Laurel  Hardy film I wouldn't warn people away from it.My only real problem is with the ending. I'm one who does get tired of the stereotypical happy ending but this is a COMEDY. The bad guys should get their comeuppance and the good guys should win in the end. That's the way of comedy. Even the Great Stone Face Buster Keaton played to this rule. Though his characters sometimes wound up losing the game you got the sense that they weren't daunted or hurt by it. In Utopia our sweet girl winds up marrying the smarmy jackass she was running from our stowaway stone mason winds up with his dreams crushed building fences the man who only wanted a country to call his own winds up killed and eaten and the Boys themselves are stranded on an island with all their food and supplies stolen. It's just too sad for a comedy.This film is usually found in the bargain bin and it's worth that kind of price to see the Boys' last film together. Don't expect miracles but I found quite a few laughs in it.".

The original movie was 90 minutes long but when rereleased it was shortened to a more tolerable 60 minutes. Most of the footage taken out was from the subplot so taking out the extra half hour improved the movie.While The Boys had more freedom to write gags and dialogue nobody else on the crew had any idea what to expect in a LH picture.

Stan and Ollie will definitely live on in the annals of comedy forever.".

As the movie's director is credited Lo Joannon but much of the work was done by the blacklisted director John Berry.This movie was painful to make for Laurel and Hardy.They both had some major health issues.Stan even required hospitalization.But the boys still got their job done and what a great job they did.The onscreen chemistry is still there and the capability to make 'em laugh.The leading lady of the movie is played by French singeractress Suzy Delair b.1917.She does a wonderful job as Chrie Lamour.The rest of the casting is also good.Max Elloy plays Antoine the cook.Adriano Rimoldi is Giovanni Copini the stowaway and a bricklayer from Italy.Luigi Tosi is Lt. Jack Frazer.The movie has pretty much of good stuff and great gags.It's funny when the boys are enjoying a meal and Stan's food keeps disappearing from his plate.The stowaway keeps reaching down and taking it.Stan blames Ollie and that means an argument.The storm sequence is amazing to watch.Stanley struggles with the life raft crying and screaming for help.And he shrieks when those bats arrive.The ending is pretty much a perfect ending for a Laurel and Hardy movie.Boys have arrived to the right island when their land and supplies are impounded for failure to pay back taxes.Ollie says to Stan That's another fine mess you've gotten me into.And what does Stan do? He starts to cry of course.This movie is better than most people give it credit for.Of course the boys came up with better than this in their earlier years.One of those nine stars is for the life and work of Laurel and Hardy.There will never be a comedy team like Laurel and Hardy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stan and Ollie's farewell falls far short of the boys in their prime it's true but the film is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. From what I'd heard about it I almost didn't want to watch this film  in much the same way as you want to remember a loved one hale and hearty rather than eaten away by cancer  but I braved it anyway. The print is atrocious with blurry visuals and poor sound but even the poor picture doesn't disguise how ill and gaunt poor Stan Laurel looks. Apparently he had dysentery and prostate problems during filming which accounts for his appearance. Ironically Oliver Hardy who would be the first of the duo to pass away looks the better of the two although it's plain to see that he'd piled on a few pounds since their heyday.The film's storyline is fairly ordinary fluff about the boys travelling to a deserted island Stan has inherited and establishing a utopian society that works perfectly until the population count increases beyond single figures. There are a few glimpses of the old style from the boys but any enjoyment is tempered by the knowledge that you're watching ageing men trying to recapture something that they no longer possess. The rest of the cast are French and the dialogue they speak is dubbed into English which makes it visibly difficult for Laurel and Hardy to play off them they way they used to with familiar faces of old.This film probably isn't one you'd want in your collection if you're a Laurel  Hardy fan but neither is it one that should necessarily be avoided at all costs.".

Their last film together Utopia to my mind was a sad send off for the boys who were so brilliant in films like Way Out West where they were not only funny but broke out into song and dance in creative fashion. There are glimpses of their trademark humor here but by and large the film failed to satisfy this viewer whose memories of Stan and Ollie recall an earlier vintage.Perhaps part of the problem here is saddling the duo with cast members who share close to equal billing and screen time. Max Elloy as the cookmechanic Adriano Rimoldi as the man without a country and Suzy Delair as the nominal love interest for all of them don't have enough personality among them to complement the story in a fulfilling way. Delair's Cherie in particular can't make up her mind about old boyfriend Frazer Luigi Tosi and by the end of the movie winds up flip flopping yet again.Most of the film's humor takes place in the first third of the story as Stan and Ollie learn of their inheritance from Stan's uncle who has passed on. The obligatory dismantling of the fortune by way of government fees and taxes leaves them only a derelict yacht in Marseille and an island in the South Pacific. That set up at least allows them to fashion their own government on the island that doesn't rely on laws or taxes of it's own. The inevitable onslaught by the outside world following the discovery of uranium is enough to spell doom for the island's Utopian ideal which it lost as soon as it became Crusoeland.There are redemptive moments few and far between like the bit with the life raft and Stan's friendship with a pet lobster. Yet even as far back as 1951 crass commercialism reared it's ugly head with an extreme close up of a bottle of Welch's Grape Juice. You'll have to search long and hard for such a blatant product endorsement in another film of the era. Of course today virtually every film displays a branded name.I'd like to be more positive about Atoll K as my admiration for Laurel and Hardy's body of work is very much one of appreciation. They provided loads of laughs while I was growing up and still do today. At least with their earlier films one didn't have to see an optimist.".

Production on the film was chaotic with language barriers Laurel and Hardy were among the few on the set that spoke English illnesses Stan's being the worse and a somewhat incompetent director Lo Joannon spent three days filming a lake that he thought looked nice.The basic premise is that the Boys have inherited a yacht and an island from Stan's late uncle. The duo journey to their island but get caught in a storm along the way eventually landing on an atoll. Joining them are stateless man Antione Max Elloy Italian immigrant Giovanni Adriano Rimoldi and Chrie Suzy Delair a nightclub singer running from her workaholic fianc. Pretty soon the rest of the world takes interest in the atoll leading the castaways to form their own government  with no laws! This film can be enjoyed if one gets beyond its obvious flaws 1. Healthwise neither Laurel nor Hardy was particularly well during most of production and it shows. But one adjusts to their appearance after awhile. Besides their performances are still topnotch. 2. The dubbing in the Englishlanguage print is atrocious. Tons of studio 'noise' can be heard in the background. Incidentally the great Paul Frees did the English dubbing for Max Elloy's character.3. The plot gets a bit dark during the film's second half with the comedy taking second place to the story. However the first half of the film is quite enjoyable. Unlike some of their previous efforts for 20th Century Fox and MGM Stan and Ollie are entirely in character here. And there is enough fresh material to keep one invested. And the second half does have some memorable bits sprinkled in.Check the film out for yourself and form your own opinion. One word of advice try to get the uncut 100 minute version of the film. The plot makes more sense in that print than in UTOPIA the American edit.".

	schema:headline " Atoll Kor Utopiawas an interesting if uneven final Laurel and Hardy movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Atoll KLaurel and Hardy's last movie together and known here in the states as Utopiaon Internet Archive expecting to see some extra footage since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. Turns out that it's basically the same version I previously watched on the bargain basement VHS tape from Goodtimes Home Video that ran an hour and 23 minutes with the exception of no product placement of the Welch's Grape Juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space. While Stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon he still performs fine physical comedy with Ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so. Then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboardnot to mention a charming female French singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up ontakes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of Ollie saying for the last time to Stan Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into! before Stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out. In other words if you're a diehard Laurel and Hardy fan this movie is recommended for you to see at least once. Anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for Hal Roach from the '20s up through 1940 when they completed their final Roach film Saps at Sea. Come to think of it even some of the L  H Fox flicks have yet to see the two they made for MGM from the '40s are better than this one...Update82909 Just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the Captain. In another that Captain's wife pulls a gun on Cherie. In one more Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is dubbed in high pitch here!".

Laurel and Hardy's last film from the crudely crankedup Cuckoo theme with erroneous credit to Hal Roach to the closing Nice messI couldn't help it schtick this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. In between their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting asinine dialogue and halfhearted slapstick. People slate King of New York but Chaplin's final bowout was nowhere near as undignified as this.What really hurts to someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. The video cover I'm holding shows them at their prime all boyish smiles and glowing skin with a blurb on the back that reads The photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film. Necessarily? It doesn't even come close. The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve with Ollie distressingly overweight. This is not humorously or comically fat as he would normally appear but ill looking and on the verge of obesity. He would be dead seven years after this film was made after a series of strokes. Stan meanwhile suffering a prostrate problem and dysentery looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically. Every time something bad happens to him such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table you fear for his life. Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed. He would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965. It's upsetting to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths. And it's distressing watching their deterioration both in health and in performance on screen. When I and I'm sure almost everyone else likes to think of Laurel and Hardy I think of Way Out West Busy Bodies or Our Relations. Seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dogend of their career is a blight on my happy memories of them.The warning signs are clear right from the opening credits which list not only four writers but also someone to come up with the concept and a credit for gags. So if Monty Collins was writing the gags then what were the other four writing? And in that case why was Monty Collins paid a fee given that there's no evidence of a single gag in the whole film? Over 40 of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in. When I saw the bat scene I wanted to curl up and die so great was its childish ineptitude. Yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed unable to speak English. Not only does this make the film disjointed but also it severely depletes Stan and Ollie's reactions to their costars. Flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing this totally belies the rumoured 2 million that was spent on it. Frankly it looks terrible and while a DVD release might clean up the picture the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their Hal Roach work.Stan and Ollie's friends Giovani and Antoine are charismafree bores who stand out greatly against Laurel and Hardy's outdated repertoire. This is another major problem with the film in that none of the supporting characters are funny or keyed in to the boys' innocent mentality. The dubbed harshness shown to L  H you  the fat one makes them stand out as isolated social misfits rather than loveable subanarchists. There is evidence of some darker political satire  though Duck Soup this ain't  and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant now than it ever was a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the American constitution suddenly becomes most topical in 2003. Sadly however beyond an amusing scene where Stan is elected the people this doesn't really go anywhere. And this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges  or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly implied and Stan threatens a man with a bottle only to accidentally glass someone in the face your idea of a good time? After all the years of Stan and Ollie sharing a bed we also get a definite reference with Stan accidentally kissing him  Ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust. Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend Antoine ends his life being eaten by a lion. Mind you I never thought I'd see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they were due to be hanged either. The need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is with the American release the same version available on video hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it.Almost completely unwatchable this horrifically made relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of Stan and Ollie  avoid at all costs.".

I saw it again on video recently. The sound track was poor and the picture grainy but it is one of two films that I saw again the next day the other being Gladiator. The music theme is intensely tragic and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death. Certainly one of George Sanders best performances as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war but nemesis waits Patricia Roc plays a refugee from Eastern Europe eaten with despair. He is attracted to her selflessly wants to help her and then falls in love with her but she is too proud and hurt to accept help. Their love destroys him and inevetably the girl and the doctor Herbert Marshall who brought the nemesis. The storyline is of complex intertwining destinies where subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be. This is as a film which diappointed the critics and struggled at the box office but for the adolescent who saw it and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films taking into account its agewhose story is more akin to an opera.".

The film has a disconcerting habit of cutting in the middle of a scene then showing the same characters in an entirely different setting dressed in different clothes and an obvious gap in time the Patricia Roc character segues from cold indifference to passionate love with no discernible explanation etc. What finally emerges is a cross between To Have And Have Not  smuggling refugees by boat  and The Third Man  blackmarket drugs in postwar Europe. I can only assume that on paper it looked good enough to attract Duvivier and Spaak but what gets on the screen wouldn't attract flies. It seems there were almost insurmountable problems in production so I'm prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that Duvivier was incapable of making a bad movie but it remains a major disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare but Fata Morgana is a good case.  You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth but Herzog does an amazingly good job.  The movie's point is to show human beings and even the world from a nonhuman point of view.The movie is in three parts  Creation Paradise and The Golden Age.  The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voiceover.  Although the text of The Creation' from the Popol Vuh a Mayan myth refers to the primordial wasteland the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.  It dwells on the waste and on various specimens of destruction fire smoke wrecked vehicles.  The images from Paradise' are anything but that and The Golden Age' is darkly comic  the highest culture is the strange roadside musical act.The Popol Vuh suggests that mankind is the central object of creation but the movie does everything it can to undo this notion.  Its mythological framework has no referent in human historical time.  There are no human characters to speak of.  When a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot the initial suggestion is of the boy's point of view by the end it is much more the dog's.  Likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it and the turtle's partner barely looks human with his big flippers.Animal stories and nature documentaries always anthropomorphize but Fata Morgana has none of that.  Certainly the dunes look like a female body but the simile cuts both ways.  Presumably only humans can distinguish easily between their creation and nature and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains lakes and waterfalls.  People and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape.In 1979 Herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.".

For example in one sequence a man wearing goggles gives us a minitutorial on lizards. And in what for me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence a small inset room contains a man with dark goggles who sings in a voice that is totally distorted by the microphone he's using accompanied by an old lady who plays a punchy tune on an old piano.

But that concept is so subtle so opaque that you'll never figure it out without help. From this subtle theme the film does indeed make sense. Without that point of reference however the film can seem tedious and unending a pointless parade of random earthy images and esoteric narrative gibberish.Unapologetically redundant thematically baffling and cinematically heretical Fata Morgana will likely either make you swoon with delight or cause you to throw up.

	schema:reviewBody "Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film but to live it. No other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the filmmaking process and the subsequent lore from such productions as Fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend.Today I sat down to Fata Morgana a 1969 Herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard. Without researching the actual locations I'm assuming it was shot somewhere in Africa both coastal and desert a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man infant civilization infant life on earth. It is these origins the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse that Herzog is concerned with as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minute run time.Watching FM I couldn't help but feel I was a passenger on a profound journey. In the opening sequence the title is translated as Mirage and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip. These images are perverted their 3dimensionality crushed flat by a long lens piling layers of exhaust heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another. The effect left me to conclude things are not as they seem.FM is divided into 3 very distinct chapters 1 Creation 2 Paradise and 3 The Golden Age. Chapter One opens with countless languid images where bleak barren landscapes scroll by dead animals rot broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. The people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert. The narration talks of a time before life a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens. While the narration hearkens to a simpler purer era a portrait of a young boy holding a foxlike animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature.In the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality. We listen to a goggled biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment. As he holds the squirming monitor its tongue flicking at flies he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the searing 140 degree heat. The parallel is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm. He also pushes forward the theme that if not in control man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways.The last chapter takes us out of the desert's blast furnace and into the more familiar Herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior. No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than Herzog  possibly this is where he feels most at home. Much like Errol Morris Herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll. The subsequent flirtation Herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut. As Morris does this extended roll pushes past the on moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime their facade gives way to something real. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd polkalike song that Herzog recycles throughout this chapter. The drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist as does another guy doing a magic trick begging the question what's with the goggles? They definitely add some levity to the film but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance or is this just another example of Herzog's playfullness.The narration aside Herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack. Leonard Cohen grabs the most screen time two of his beautifully melancholic songs So Long Marianne and Suzanne. perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride. By the end of the journey Herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon. Despite the overall bleakness of FM the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit belief that against all odds life will persevere and possibly even flourish.Having finished writing this post I referenced FM to discover that Herzog shot it in Saharan Cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup. True to his legend Herzog and his crew were arrested beaten and imprisoned. While imprisoned Herzog fell ill with Schistosomiasis a blood parasite. It's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as Fata Morgana knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more.httpeattheblinds.blogspot.com".

In the DVD commentary of this film Crispin Glover is invited along to give his thoughts also.I am very partial to Herzog's films. That said I find this one toward the top of his heap. There is a certain 'rawness' to the structure and sequences of this film. I believe that most of it was shot during other projects and pieced from footage that was taken in the Sahara. The early parts of the film are the strongest images the equivalent of moving paintings showing care in subtle differences in the landscape. There is an erie science fiction quality to the early part of the film that might even be reminiscent of 'Dune' mostly for the desert images.The later part of the film is more about a human interaction with the landscape. These people are not actors but ordinary people that Herzog i'm sure told them to stand around acting weird or maybe genuinely acting foreign to what we know many of the people were being filmed for the first time he loves sophisticating the natives tricking them with his modern equipment one bit of advice don't attempt to watch this if you have distractions around you have to be in a quiet mood to sustain watching it even I have a hard time sitting through ithence my recommend of watching it with the commentary".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw FATA MORGANA at its US premiere in 1972 and again in 1975. The film remained in my inexact memory as possible model or prototype of the surreal documentary and I think I had recollections of Herzog's long pans and tracking shots in a back chamber of my mind while filming material in the Dolomites that I later combined with manipulated WWI footage in my own audiovisual work GEBIRGSKRIEGSPROJEKT. Having lived in Austria for 17 years and now being fluent in the language of FATA MORGANA's narration I was eagerly looking forward to reencountering the film on DVD.Unfortunately I have to admit that I was rather disappointed. The terms of my reaction are largely defined by Werner Herzog's own commentary on the German DVD. That he wanted to make a documentary as if from the point of view of visitors from another galaxy is a good idea and a commendable ambition but I think the hypothetical visitors from Andromeda would have arrived with a far more anthropologically organized structure of viewing than what Herzog here presents. It would however be unfair to call the film pretentious it's just not that well thought out. There are indeed some strong images not only those of the desert mirages ... that could have been used effectively as expanding material in a more narratively oriented film or served as basis for a more experimental work such as those of Stan Brakhage who Herzog professes to admire but these images are too often weakened by sloppy camera movement or flaccid editing.I found the use of heterogeneous music Blind Faith Leonard Cohen the Kyrie from one of Mozart's masses arbitrary and unconvincing. Chancederived juxtapositions are stimulating now and then but this is no wellthoughtout dialectically surreal counterpoint of image and sound that could really cut into the eye and ear.Some sequences in the later part of the film a foreign aid worker having African children recite der Blitzkrieg ist Wahnsinn or a scene where German tourists hop up and down in little volcanic craters on Lanzarote lapse into the ridiculous and unfortunately retrospectively lower the level of what came before.BUT Werner Herzog is a great filmmaker who has in other works made immense contributions to his art. FATA MORGANA may be one of his weaker films but I suspect it was essential to his development. I'ts a pleasure and a challenge to view and to think about this film.".

Or maybe it isn't Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely without a story bound only to certain aspects of written poetry as his camera shooting on supposedly discarded film stock wanders like in a pure travelogue. One might even jump to that easy conclusion as he puts up these immense landscapes then moving to more rough civilized culture though not the actual 'normal' culture itself and to a point levels too abstract to be able to convey properly here. Sometimes it takes a while to get along close to a purity through the creation section but a purity in how parts are manipulated either by nature or by brokendown machines. Soon the narration readings from the Popol Vuh who by the way does the music for most of his films with the gradual procession of actually highly stylized shots adds a whole different level to it. It's a hybrid film and it's not easy but the rewards are what best comes closest to Herzog's idea of ecstatic truth images he's been out for his whole career.One wonders if the images end up by the time the second section Paradise leading along the words spoken or if it's the other way around. You're eyes are moving along with the stills and pans and the wording is close to being religious writing but there's also the music choices how the bizarrely spare singing and lowkey classical music goes together with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think each side ends up complimenting the other and it's something that still seems like it shouldn't work. Perhaps that's the draw to it the chances taken in going through desolate wastelands and the smallest run sections of any kind of civilized life in this case the shacks of the desert that make it so fascinating. If only for the cinematographic sense it's a marvel too indescribable for the casual photography fan because of molds of technique and some of the strangest images of any Herzog film. There's pans there's longshots there's handheld while driving by the towns there's a bus dozens of miles away that via mirage seems only a couple there's fullon closeups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about its radar truly classic gonzo comedy there's people holding still in fake poses and a man and woman playing inane music. But most importantly it ends up feeling at least for me natural for the personal nature of the approach.I'm sure only Herzog would know for certain why he made this film as opposed to the simple 'how' he was already filming Even Dwarfs Started Small and he ended up going through many perils to finish it. Yet this is what makes Fata Morgana such an amazing feat it will appeal to one depending on what someone brings to it in actually watching it. It's definitely unsettling but there's the temptation to want to see it again very soon after just to experience all of the ideas and realities turned abstracted strange vibes yes the word 'vibes' applies here.

	schema:headline " One of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "Fata Morgana is by far one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because while is does have elements of documentation of it's images the images themselves are so unusual so hallucinogenic so unclear that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider be it alien or something otherwise indescribable all taking place in the Sahara desert. The title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images both real and hallucinated that people in the desert often witness. These are also known as mirages.The film opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again. With each plane landing shot the actual architecture of both the location it is landing at and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve into one another and grow less and less real and more and more reflective imagery. The imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues. The narration of the film tells of the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera. The shots go further and further into the desert and Herzog films whatever he sees and finds. The strangest reflections of the world are on display in the distance while Herzog meets some of the most pure and photogenic collections of outsiders that you are ever likely to see. When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack kicks in you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universe.I cannot say too much more about this film without ruining anything but I will say that it is a sobering experience and there's really nothing like it. I love seeing films that are just in classes of their own. This film certainly is a good example of how Herzog loves to intermingle narrative storytelling and documentary filmmaking into an interchangeable form. Fata Morgana unfortunately does overstay it's welcome just a bit but by the time it nears it's end the images will most likely be burned into your mind forever. Definitely a mustsee for those who are obsessed with the nature and the origin of the universe.".

I hesitate to call it a documentary because while is does have elements of documentation of it's images the images themselves are so unusual so hallucinogenic so unclear that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider be it alien or something otherwise indescribable all taking place in the Sahara desert. The title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images both real and hallucinated that people in the desert often witness. These are also known as mirages.The film opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again. With each plane landing shot the actual architecture of both the location it is landing at and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve into one another and grow less and less real and more and more reflective imagery. The imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues. The narration of the film tells of the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera. The shots go further and further into the desert and Herzog films whatever he sees and finds. The strangest reflections of the world are on display in the distance while Herzog meets some of the most pure and photogenic collections of outsiders that you are ever likely to see. When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack kicks in you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universe.I cannot say too much more about this film without ruining anything but I will say that it is a sobering experience and there's really nothing like it. I love seeing films that are just in classes of their own. This film certainly is a good example of how Herzog loves to intermingle narrative storytelling and documentary filmmaking into an interchangeable form. Fata Morgana unfortunately does overstay it's welcome just a bit but by the time it nears it's end the images will most likely be burned into your mind forever. Definitely a mustsee for those who are obsessed with the nature and the origin of the universe.";

Fusing together a montage of footage from the Sahara including villages villagers and various other places for a somewhat surrealist ending music of various genres and an almost mythical narration Fata Morgana is severely slow paced but ultimately hugely rewarding. Opening with a montage of various filmed shots of planes landing for nigh on five minutes you already arrival at the introduction of the film immensely confused and the sense that this will not be like anything you have seen before echoes clear in your mind. Divided into three sections creation paradise and the golden age Fata Morgana attempts and succeeds in being able to juxtapose images of the natural beauty of the desert with the man made instruments that taint it. Its three segments are narrated by different persons each pertaining specifically to the particular section they are voicing and provide extra emphasis on the long soliloquy's and desert montages.Fata Morgana is a film dealing with the existence of man on our Earth. It looks at the natural beauty the Earth was designed for and concurrently looking at the potential beauty we have within us more notably shows us our negative contributions to the world in which we live. Each shot has been purposefully constructed using what can only be described within the context of this film as 'The Holy Trinity Of Filming' in pictures words and music. Each part of these three pieces provides something notably to each shot but when brought together they create something greater than the whole of their parts they create unbridled beauty and deep thought within our minds. I will not be able to do this film the justice it deserves with mere words alone perhaps if I had pictures and a score and I do know this will not be appreciated by the masses but this a profound and I will not use the term art film because this is simply just art. This is moving art which moves the mind and stirs the soul. Whether or not creationism is your want is irrelevant because this film is about intelligent design.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sense a structure inside my heart but it's not the same as yours  Director Werner Herzog on Fata MorganaOne should not enter into the world presented by Fata Morgana without some sense of what to expect. However beyond stating that this is a film by Werner Herzog it is almost impossible to discuss the film using categories that are typically applied in discussions of film. Some say that this is the masterpiece of Herzog's early films. I can agree with this but only for two implicitly connected reasons. The first reason is my love for Herzog and his art. The second is that this is easily the most HERZOG film of his early films. Herzog himself has said that the film makes sense and has coherence only if you forget about logic and anything academic that you may have learned about film. So let's discuss the narratives. There is no real story unless you interpret the film as an impressionistic telling of the Popul Vuh one of the few surviving Mayan origin myths which is updated into the modern age in three parts. The narrative starts with numerous very beautiful and entrancing images of barren alienlooking landscapes and extremely illusory and vivid mirages. It then becomes increasingly concerned with people and built environments as we move from the amorphous sensual and primordial world of the creation into the allegedly civilized and clearly ridiculous Golden Age presumably something like what we have today. Some people see this transition as irony cynicism darkness etc. While it is important that each viewer intepret the film in their own way i can see nothing in Herzog that is not pure celebrative and eyeopening exuberance concerning a full range of experience  death love myth beauty and all of the illusions that drive so much of human life. There are numerous other narratives that can be found upon repeated examinations of the film especially if you review the Herzog collection's version with Herzog's deeply personal journalistic commentary.Now on to the film itself. Like many of Herzog's film Fata Morgana is breathtakingly beautiful. Like almost all of Herzog's films Fata Morgana expresses something about Herzog's view of life of people and of the earth  all of which are subjects that Herzog loves very deeply. Herzog shot the film in some of the most extraterrestrial landscapes on earth with his very unique sense of the surreality of everyday life and as usual no special effects whatsoever. The film utilizes illusion and mesmerizing images and sound to loosen the viewer's interest in narrative itself and then proceeds to deconstruct narratives explicitly while showing the utter lunacy of more familiar imagery. The film's soundtrack also defies even Herzog's own tendencies and the trope of avant garde cinema juxtaposing opera Asian folk music and of all things Leonard Cohen. This film is a mustsee for Herzog fans and those interested in history of film as a pure art form all its own. The film is much more subtle than Koyaanisqatsi and its sequels but these later films clearly owe Fata Morgana an enormous debt.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fata Morgana may arguably be maverick German director Werner Herzog's most leftfield work. This is saying quite a lot considering some of the oddities in his filmography. With this film he has outright made an experimental film and not I hasten to add a documentary. While this often has the feel of a documentary and some sequences evoke one this resolutely is not intended to inform the viewer of facts in any traditional sense. In fairness many of Herzog's fiction and factual films have crossed over with one another and his cinematic style often falls into the netherworld where these two distinct forms of film overlap. Herzog himself has stated that he makes no distinction between the two formats himself. In any case Fata Morgana is possibly the most opaque and hard to classify of his films on account of its lack of any plot or obvious message.Set in the Sahara desert of North Africa this is seemingly an attempt to evoke a perception of the Earth from the point of view of an alien although you'll be doing very well indeed if you pick up on this yourself without being told about it. It's a very rhythmic film where images and music work alongside each other. There are a few long tracking shots which capture both the natural beauty and the ugliness humans create. The focus often moves onto other inert objects of the desert such as dead animals nature a wrecked aircraft humankind. Later on there are appearances from an assortment of eccentric characters all of whom reside in this harsh land. The most memorable of these is a pianist and drummer who play a very strange form of music in a fully committed fashion. Herzog said that this middleaged couple were the owners of a brothel although tidbits like this can only be garnered from the commentary track in fact this is one of the very few films that might actually be better with the commentary track playing as the ever fascinating Herzog himself offers much interesting info on this bizarre cinematic adventure.The term Fata Morgana itself means mirages and these are returned to several times. The film opens with a succession of edits of airplanes landing all shot from exactly the same angle and each time the planes appear to land into the midst of a mirage. Later on we witness a different mirage of a mysterious vehicle many miles away driving in what appears to be senseless circles in the middle of the desert. Divided into three parts  'Creation' 'Paradise' and 'The Golden Age'  there is intermittent narration that recites excerpts from an ancient creation myth. There is also  unusually for Herzog  a selection of contemporary music accompanying the imagery with a couple of tracks from Leonard Cohen amongst others. In truth it's all very baffling from a logical pointofview and is very hard to interpret the meaning. But it has a certain hypnotic effect and if you can somehow get into its very specific rhythm it's a film that can be appreciated. It's certainly not a film for everyone though and will even pose problems for some hardened Herzog fans. It's one I get more out of the more I watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a 75minute movie by director Werner Herzog from almost 45 years ago back when he wasn't even 30. The film is mostly narrated by Lotte Eisner one of Herzog's closest collaborators check out the story about Herzog's long walk to keep her from dying who has a pretty interesting life story as well. She did a very fine job narrating here her voice is nice to listen to. It is as soothing as the entire movie and if that wasn't already enough they also included music by Leonard Cohen one of my absolute favorites. It is certainly not a film for everybody. Haters will say we are doing nothing but watch the desert for over an hour. Nonetheless I enjoyed it a lot. The poetry is interesting the music is good from start to finish. The only part I did not like that much was near the end when these two made music. It looked like it was out of a different film and did not fit the Sahara mentality at all in my opinion. But everything else was very nicely done. The images and sound is perfect to just lean back and relax. You find out a bit about the area also outside the Sahara landscapes the people and animals. I highly recommend watching this. And don't forget Blitzkrieg is insanity.".

	schema:headline " Where aliens report on the insanity of humanity....";
	schema:reviewBody "Long before the lyrical Koyannisqatsi 1982 hit the screens and hit the big time with global audiences Werner Herzog went out his way  literally to the Sahara desert and Cameroon in Africa  to make his visual statement about humanity's insanity upon this planet.With tireless persistence and great personal danger to himself and his crew Herzog amassed a bucketload of exposed film at numerous locations in the above two areas throughout 1968 and 1969. Then he went back to his office somewhere and concocted a scifi 'story' about aliens who visit the planet to make a visual report about the state of our tired ravaged space ship earth. Then he edited and cut all the film to match his story. All of this information is present in the Extras section of the DVD I obtained. Thematically FM is definitely kindred to K but more visceral and unsettling.With consummate pervasive irony Herzog ignites our eyes with the beauty and serenity of the earth rivers mountains deserts etc but counterpoints  even destroys  our appreciation with the detritus destruction and devastation wrought by contemporary humanity in the 20th century. Pretty it is not. Implicitly Herzog is damning humanity for its stupid repetitive behavior that is progressively destroying the planet with our wellknown technological trappings  and traps. It's a selfevident story beautifully crafted and presented. And yes there is a visual story. Though to help viewers along Herzog divides the film into three acts Creation Paradise and The Golden Age and none of it showing  with exquisite dramatic or comedic satire  humanity as worthy of any of those sublime conditions. Much of the accompanying dialog is actually quoted from the Popul Vuh which means 'community book' according to my Mayan expert myth of the ancient Quiche Maya about the Mayan story of creation.Little wonder Herzog upset a lot of people when this delicious docudrama was released. There have been earlier films  Wild River 1960 comes to mind  that explored the social and environmental repercussions of untrammeled progress more recently Gasland 2010 has exposed the continuing folly of frenetic fracking in USA and other countries.Will humanity ever learn? Over forty years ago Herzog issued a dire warning with this film. Too bad nobody took much notice except to denigrate it. See this story while you can  and let your ears rejoice in the music also. Nine out of ten. January 4 2015".

	schema:reviewBody "I find Herzog's documentary work to be very uneven. Fata Morgana a companion piece of sorts to Lessons of Darkness lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author. It is by comparison amateur looking aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any German tourist equipped with a handycam the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images wire fences derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order intercut with shots of sand dunes. At one point Herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand yet the image is presented much like you and me would perhaps worse the camera peering handheld from one cattle to the next. For a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast a hypnotic surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author. It's all over the place halfhearted and tedious Mayan creation myths recited in voiceover then some other text Herzog fancied for literature. It's not until near the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic both of them apathetic in their task. A man holding up a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Other than that this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.".

Now I certainly see why some might love this movie and call it a masterpiece but at the same time to me this is just a movie that's art for the sake of being art. There's really an interesting movie to discuss here but it's just not an entertaining one and no matter what type of art you're trying to create the importance of being entertaining can never be overlooked. There's really no way to fully describe or give a plot detail of this film but it's pretty much Herzog's documentary on why images are so important. Shot in Africa we get all sorts of images of the desert as well as various other tracking shots which are shown with narration as well as a soundtrack by Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I'm really not sure what to say about this film except that it didn't work for me and Herzog's attempt to show the visuals as aliens looking around just didn't work. This is something Herzog would attempt later in his career and to me these type of thoughts have always been a miss. I'm sure Herzog has something to say with the film but I don't see it being said in the film itself. I've read his comments and listened to parts of the commentary where he explains things but if it weren't for this the movie itself wouldn't have said anything. There are certainly some surreal moments and there's no question that a brilliant mind is behind all the images but in the end the film left me cold and bored which is something I can't say about too many of Herzog's films as he's one of my favorites.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fata Morgana the 1971 documentarylike film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog filmed over several years in the late 1960s is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African mostly Saharan imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirtyfive years ago. The soundtrack to the film including German classical music Mozart and Handel and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen also lends its timeless quality. The narration by three different German narrators German film historian Lotte Eisner Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von UngernSternberg is solid and Herzog goes on and on of Eisner's import to this project himself and film history but the English speaker of the translation James William Gledhill has a voice that seems downright deific which lends itself far more perfectly to this project even though much of the text in either language is rather superfluous. Yes the faux Biblical sounds of the Popul Vuh Mayan creation myth in the film's first part Creation is interesting but the text Herzog wrote for the remaining two parts Paradise and The Golden Age along with quotes from a German poet Herzog names as Manfred Eigendorf almost seems a satire of the first part's somber tone. The film it seems was pieced together during the shooting of several other Herzog projects concurrently the fictive Even Dwarfs Started Small and the documentaries The Land Of Silence And Darkness and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa but these projects' rejected material only add to the beauty of this film such as aerial scenes of a flamingo mating lake from afar that give one an eerie unearthly sense one which Herzog crows about in his commentary. This unearthly feel is present right from the film's start of several airplanes landing on a desert runway with their images getting successively blurrier as the heat from the ground rises and increases the distorting waves that mar the images. That this film was influential in the Quatsi films of Godfrey Reggio is an understatement. But whereas Reggio is content to just toss images at you Herzog has an ability that only American filmmaker Terrence Malick also has to make a wholly selfcontained vocabulary out of the juxtaposition of images and words and one dependent upon an emotionfirst thrust. Analysis can fail when brought to such endeavors. Herzog often does not understand even why his art is great. The best he does often is wholly unconscious and mesmeric. This is why his contempt for the Lowest Common Denominator pap of Hollywood is openly stated on the commentary.Perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that on the commentary Herzog tells us followed a severe drought in Cameroon. It shows the jerkied carcasses of cattle and Herzog describes the unbearable stench. Yet the viewer can sense this all from the images the blackness of the sun dried portions of animals and the blanched bones. Yet even in that commentary Herzog focuses on the stench not any deeper meaning. He is content to let you imbue and interpret what you will into and of his work such as the almost erotically feminized shapes of sand dunes which recalls a scene from Ingmar Bergman's Hour Of The Wolf where Max Von Sydow runs his hand over Ingrid Thulin's beautiful nude body's curves. But the archetypal image in this film which symbolizes much of Herzog's career is of a mirage of a faraway car driving back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake. It is deep hypnotic illusive elusive supernatural yet real just as Herzog the believer who came from a family of militant atheists is. But then like everything else it ends.".
