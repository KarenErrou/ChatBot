	schema:reviewBody "'The Killing' has been overshadowed by Stanley Kubrick's subsequent better known and better made movie masterpieces. Films like 'Dr. Strangelove' '2001' and 'A Clockwork Orange' are much more flamboyant and intellectually exciting than this early hard boiled crime thriller but for my money it is still one of his most entertaining movies and in its own modest way just as brilliant as his more talked about films. 'The Killing' is still one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made and one which influenced many film makers working in this genre not the least of which Quentin Tarantino who obviously worships this picture and used its innovative structure as major inspiration for 'Pulp Fiction'.  Kubrick wrote 'The Killing's script as well as directing but made the smart move of asking the Dime Store Dostoevski Jim Thompson author of pulp classics like 'The Killer Inside Me' and 'The Getaway' to supply the fresh and memorable dialogue. Sterling Hayden who later achieved screen immmortality as General Jack D. Ripper in 'Dr Strangelove' is perfect as ambitious small time crook Johnny Clay. He is surrounded by an almost flawless supporting cast. I qualified that because I wasn't totally convinced by Coleen Gray who plays Johnny's girlfriend. However she only really has one scene and the rest of the cast more than makes up for her. Especially memorable are the mismatched husband and wife played by Elisha Cook Jr 'The House On Haunted Hill' and the sultry Marie Windsor noir classic 'Narrow Margin'. Their scenes together are simply terrific. Also noteworthy are the two scenes featuring legendary crazy Timothy Carey 'The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie'. Carey was one of the most extraordinary performers to set foot in front of a movie character and is unforgettable. Kubrick obviously thought highly of him as he subsequently cast him in his antiwar classic 'Paths Of Glory' a move which antagonised the movie's star Kirk Douglas. Even if 'The Killing' didn't feature such a strong performance from Sterling Hayden it would be worth watching just to catch Cook Windsor and Carey. On top of that you have some other great actors such as Vince Edwards an innovative script hip dialogue and some brilliant directorial touches. This exciting heist movie can't be recommended highly enough it's a real treat for film buffs. A brilliant film that still packs a punch after almost fifty years something I doubt you will be saying about many movies currently showing in today's theatres. 'The Killing' is a super cool suspense movie and not to be missed!".

He wasn't as rough a character as he was in Asphalt Jungle but his role reminded me of that film.What made this movie so appealing to me were four very interesting character actors Elisha Cook Jr. Marie Windsor Kola Kwariani and Ted de Corsia. Few people had those losertype film noir characters down pat as well as the toughtalking Windsor and the meek and wimpy Cook. They played a husbandandwife team here that's film noir heaven!Kwariani plays a burley chessplaying wrestler who fights six cops at one time and Carey is a longdistance racist rifleman who talks through clenchedteeth and shoots a racehorse! As I said some very interesting characters here. And oh yeah.....for you over55 readers there's Vince Edwards alias Dr. Ben Casey of TV fame as a Windsor's young adulterer boyfriend trying to horn in on the money from the robbery.This film is full of surprises and always fun to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the age of 27 Stanley Kubrick's third film The Killing took Lionel White's hardboiled nonlinear story of one man Johnny Clay with quicktalking straightforward ease by Sterling Hayden and his crew planning and tasking a racetrack robbery. It's almost fifty years old but by this time Kubrick intently defined his style and somehow the film seems to have themes and characters that are identifiable and recognizable with any period. The supporting characters are as sharply drawn and psychologically involving if not more so than Johnny Clay. Driving us into this world of schemers shouldn't be dense and as Kubrick passes by any pretense  and keeps the compositions and material entertaining and absorbing  and it allows a viewer a lot of promise on repeat viewings.While the story elements are similar to the sort of Kubrickmovie psychology mostly dealing with men who are head deep in a rather existential crisis of what's against society what's unique is how the craft is intuitive. On a low budget and even with a cast that's very good if not excellent everything is always assured in the style and turns grinding in the plot. I could watch this movie another two times after three in the past two years or so and still see shots so detailed yet with the tone that of the most inspired filmnoirs. It's questionable as to where Kubrick got influence for some of the compositions with usage of shadows and the dark and light shades too but whether or not it was some famous expressionist or from the 40's filmnoirs the mark of Kubrick uncurling as an artist is evident. One remark by some is that the narration is sometimes irritating that the kind of Bmovie police drama expository tone and the information is too much. The voice is not my favorite part of the film but the narration itself the information is an interesting mold in the film's structure. It adds on a layer to that existentialist subtext as every description makes it sounds like the narrator's a reporter looking back on the past events with a detached objectivity. For me this did make it a little much to concentrate on in the first viewing however this is a film that demands unthwarted attention for it's 83 minutes. If you turn away for too long a piece of the puzzle will be out of sight. It's a great film and it's gone on to inspire a flock of homagers and imitators in the last half century. A".

But we are talking about of a movie with a director of the prodigious talents of Stanley Kubrick.Sometimes you wonder which genre Kubrick could not have handled brilliantly. He seems to know exactly what to do in such a wide variety of movies...Crime Drama War Surreal Historical Epic Science Fiction and Black Comedy.  My only wish would have been if Kubrick could have made MORE movies.  When he died that left only Woody Allen as the only major director who is working as a pure artist in the film medium.  THE KILLING is filled with crimenoir touches that form an absorbing whole that is hard to beat.  The acting is topnotch the scenes are set in gold taking from every crime movie and creating a whole that could not have been done so well by just any director  perhaps only Hitchcock could have pulled this off.  Then there's the jazzy score that underlines the action which punch and atmosphere that just curdles off the screen.Even if you're not a Kubrick fan which might surprise many people when they find out he was the director you will enjoy this movie.Right to the end...which I won't reveal...but has an inevitability written with classical balance and a submission to fate that leaves a wry smile on your face.Sterling Hayden is great in this role and he populates this character with just the right sort of mystery to keep you guessing until the end.Recommended without reservation.".

The acting is topnotch the scenes are set in gold taking from every crime movie and creating a whole that could not have been done so well by just any director  perhaps only Hitchcock could have pulled this off.  Then there's the jazzy score that underlines the action which punch and atmosphere that just curdles off the screen.Even if you're not a Kubrick fan which might surprise many people when they find out he was the director you will enjoy this movie.Right to the end...which I won't reveal...but has an inevitability written with classical balance and a submission to fate that leaves a wry smile on your face.Sterling Hayden is great in this role and he populates this character with just the right sort of mystery to keep you guessing until the end.Recommended without reservation.";

It definitely put a modern touch to the somewhat outoffashion film noir in 1956 but still greatly relied on its basic rules.A fine new note was the neat distinction between the gang's members' motives ranging from repaying underworld debts De Corsia and hope of offering a better life for his ill wife Sawyer to the vain ambition of pleasing his vamp wife by doing something special Cook.Despite the film's qualities Kubrick's treatment of the women's rles seems more than oldfashioned today. Women here are either the homely and sweet type Coleen Gray or the BetteDaviseyed and cherchezlafemme type Marie Windsor. Both are accordingly taller or smaller than their respective partners by a head.I should like to mention one of my favourite pans that's when the bald philosophercatcher walks up to Joe Sawyer's bar. Lucien Ballard's camera follows him all across the crowded tote hall a take which must have been very difficult to organize and shoot. Later the scene is repeated with Sterling Hayden.This motion picture is also a monument for the great histrionic art of Elisha Cook Jr. in a standout performance as the born loser. German dubbing gives him the apt voice of Stan Laurel's speaker Walter Bluhm. This little man never just did his job in unnumerable supporting rles but has rendered effective homage to the tragic figure on the silver screen more than any other noncomical character actor I can think of. Regardless of his versatility in lots of different films his impersonations of a likeable man who is doomed to fail make him unforgettable take his lethal parts in Phantom Lady 1944 Shane 1953 or the likes the audience's sympathy was always with this fine actor.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Killing is a welcome improvement upon the disappointingly flat Killer's Kiss. Some have gone as far to say that The Killing is the best film out of Stanley's entire filmography! Whilst I'm inclined to strongly disagree with that statement I still enjoyed The Killing what's with Stanners and all this killing and killers? for what it was. A stylish little crime thriller with a narrative which goes back and forth in time which is reminiscent of Quentin's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.A lot of noirs from the 50's can be extremely slow and to be frank boring! The Killing however didn't bore me for a second of its tight running time. In Stanley's later films he tends to pad out the narrative but here he keeps it economical and to the point. We begin at the beginning of the heist and then flip back to the group of men planning the robbery. It's a fairly unconventional storytelling method for the 50's although Citizen Kane did attempt it first a decade or so earlier.Unlike Citizen Kane though The Killing isn't boring. I enjoyed it's nice array of characters particularly George and his acidtongued wife. A large amount of the film was dedicated to this odd couple and the dialogue between them is especially witty and entertaining. It's a shame that some of the other guys didn't get as much screentime so I cared slightly less for them. It doesn't matter too much though because The Killing is all about building up to the grand racetrack heist and it does a cracking job.Once we reach the heist we see it multiple times from everyone's different point of view. It's very engaging and clever to see how it all pans out and you're almost rooting for them to complete it cleanly. Some of it was also very well directed. I enjoyed the fight at the bar which was done in a realistic way and only in a few shots. I also liked the tense robbery itself where a character sports a clown mask not too dissimilar to the ones in the opening of The Dark Knight.In a fairly yet satisfyingly contrived way the film obviously pushes its moral that robbing is bad! Suffice to say that the characters meet a sticky way one way or another. I did find the ending a little too sudden and rushed but overall The Killing is a pretty fine film. I loved its use of narrative and some of the characters were quite memorable too. It's far from Stanley Kubrick's best film but it's a welcome leap forward from Killer's Kiss. I shall look forward to Paths of Glory.".

	schema:headline " Good Ol' Kubrick";
	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time. He's made some of the greatest thought provoking controversial films of all time and his style is out of this world. But before The Shining before A Clockwork Orange before 2001 before Dr. Strangelove even before Spartacus there was The Killing. It's a very good movie but it's not one of Kubrick's best and I was sort of expecting that. Rarely is a director's first movie his best and even though it has some flaws it's still a great movie. One problem I have with this movie is the unnecessary narration. I know that wasn't Kubrick's idea but it's bad and it's noticeable. It's actually pretty insulting to the audience's intelligence. I think Kubrick trusted his audience to be smart enough to follow the film and I wish they would just remove it from the film. Another thing is that the movie feels very lopsided. The first half isn't bad but the second half is definitely stronger. We get a lot of dialogue for the first half and then we see the action in the second half. It's very well written and it does keep my interest but the scale is totally tipped. It's similar to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. The first movie is nonstop action and wildly entertaining and the second movie has very minimal action and is mostly talking. Like I said I love dialogue especially when it's well written but I wish it was more balanced with the action. So what's good about this movie? Well the characters are great. You can tell Tarantino took a lot of inspiration from this movie when he made Reservoir Dogs. It's one of the first instances where the main characters are bad guys they're very mean spirited but you cheer for them anyway. Also the ending is unique for the time. Just like I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang the ending is just very haunting and leaves you with a dark feeling. I think the best thing about this movie is the cinematography. Kubrick is known for his incredible cinematography and it's really cool to see where it all started. You can just see the future genius that lies within. The Killing isn't a perfect movie but it's still really good. For a low budget crime drama from the 1950s it's amazing. And even though it's so low budget you can still see that Kubrick style slowly growing. It may not be one of his best and it does have its flaws but it's still an engaging dark intelligent movie.".

Johnny Clay recently paroled must have thought of nothing else in prison except this heist. The precision with which this scheme comes together is exquisite and absolutely flawless. There is one minor loose end during the heist itself when Marvin Unger shows up at the track drunk contrary to instructions but this is a red herring. The heist is brilliantly executed. It goes literally like clockwork and that is the best maybe the only metaphor to describe it. It reminded me of a road rally where drivers had to be in certain positions at certain times. Clay recruits accomplices on the inside track employees who must play small but critical parts for the heist to work. Everyone does his job beautifully the heist comes off with hardly a hitch. One accomplice is killed by police but no one else  conspirator or bystander  gets hurt and Clay gets away clean. No military operation was ever planned so minutely or executed so precisely. But once Clay has the money things come acropper. We know of course that the plan cannot succeed. Nefarious plans never succeed in film noir. It's a rule. How this particular scheme came undone and was foiled seemed contrived and forced to me. Here is this exquisitely planned operation flawlessly executed with military precision. And yet this scrupulously planned perfectly timed attention to detail is tossed aside once Clay has the money. It's almost like he expected to fail or never counted on succeeding like he thought Okay I've got two mil in small bills. Now what do I do?But that would be telling. How the perfect crime is foiled is the film's climax and its only weak moment. Sterling Hayden is brilliant as Johnny Clay. His precise clipped monotone delivery almost like a newsman is perfect here. The liner notes for my DVD said that the studio wanted Jack Palance or Victor Mature for the role but Kubrick held firm. Either would have been good but Hayden was brilliant. Marie Windsor is not one we would think of as a femme fatale but she is also very good as the selfish vain scheming and very attractive wife of one of the coconspirators played by Elisha Cooke Jr. He married out of his league and in film noir that's a guarantee for disaster. One of Kubrick's best and one of the best film noir's ever done. A solid 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Kubrick directed 15 odd movies in half a century let's exclude Spartacus. His skills as an auteur may not have been recognized till Strangelove but they were on display in films like Lolita Paths of Glory and of course The Killing his first certified classic.The Killing is about an intricate racetrack heist involving a group of nonprofessionals with clean records. The mastermind Sterling Hayden has however spent some time in prison. The unique thing for the time is the nonlinear structure of the film  particularly the heist sequence. This was probably Hayden's finest role  yes better than Jack D. Ripper of Strangelove or Altman's The Long Goodbye  as the doomed hero Johnny Clay. He is very tall and physical and quite brilliant in this role. He is wellsupported by an old favorite of mine from The Maltese Falcon Elisha Cook Jr. whose venomous wife Marie Windsor plays a femme fatale of sorts. There is also the cult favorite Timothy Carey as the person assigned to shoot Red Lightning. Reservoir Dogs a cult film inspired by The Killing is dedicated to Carey.While The Killing is certainly noirish it does not have the pure noir look  well pretty much most of it is filmed in the daytime. In fact if Kubrick was inspired it would have been more by Hitchcock's tight pacing than by Chandler or Cain's hardboiled dialog. The camerawork and editing are brilliant  for me even better than later Kubrick classics. Kubrick was forced to add a voiceover by the studio  something he really wasn't inclined towards. His ingenious solution was to have the VO not directly comment on the movie but to add another layer to the films structure. It works! This film is not dated although the Marie Windsor character is a bit onedimensional and what is visible in the short length of the movie is the tight pacing.".

His good job was obvious in the whole duration of this movie and if you watch this movie you will understand what I mean by this. About the interpretations I have to say that Sterling Hayden who played as Johnny Clay was simply outstanding and one more interpretation that I liked was Elisha Cook Jr's who played as George Peatty and he was equally good.Finally I have to say that The Killing is not a simple crime movie is a movie which shows us what money can bring to people but also what things can take with them.

It's a shame The Killing isn't seen more because viewers are treated to an excellent and suspenseful crime noir.Here is a heist with a straightforward plot and nonlinear storytelling. In an hour and a half the first half is set up and the second half is all payoff. First we neatly learn about the characters and some of their reasons for the job are exposed. The second half is pure awesome the slick simple heist is played out from several perspectives.Huge success comes from the characters they're great. Instead of a couple of stiffs the conspirators are old corrupt meek foreign there is one stiff. Maurice and Nicky in particular stand out great characters. Sherry as well but for quite the opposite reasons. The script is stellar. Most noirs are nonsensical The Killing is correct to the minute. Dialogue comes fast and furiously and scenes are repeated from other characters perspectives but they don't feel redundant we learn more each time.There are a couple of things that have occurred in Kubrick's first three films narration and great music. The trumpet blaring during the heist really raises the tension. On another note it's apparent that Kubrick could now realize his projects however he wanted. A neat tidbit I liked the chess club scenes because Kubrick was an avid chess player.Technically The Killing is great as well the horse following the tracking shot echoed by Goodfellas 35 years later... the lighting is great like when Clay leans back into darkness as he goes over some details.My 50's heist knowledge is quite thin so this was very original to me. I also noted some very influential aspects notably the entire concept of Reservoir Dogs as well as things found in say The Dark Knight? Anyway The Killing is an excellent film that hasn't been seen as much as it should. A very well woven tale. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about a group of men pulling off the ultimate heist at a horse race track...one that has never yet been pulled off. The actual robbery wasn't as impressive as the storyline. Right from the beginning the film focuses on each character involved in the heist. It takes a look at each of their home lives and tells us about their characters before the actual plot begins. I love this sentimental and intimate subjective view that is rarely seen in old movies like this. You really get a feeling of sympathy for a character like George when you find out that his wife is unfaithful and think...maybe he is a good guy after all and maybe his wife is the villain. The plot is more or less a typical 50's film noire piece but it's early retrospective viewpointsTarantinoesquireand overall suspense make this movie much more than your typical black and white crime flick. This movie had an absolutely perfect ending. It definitely gives viewers a good look at Kubric's cinematic craftsmanship at an early stage.".

He simply did his job to provide a well made film with strong theme and meaning.  The Killing is definitely not Kubrick's best work.  It seems to me that Stan wasn't famous enough and too little known to make The Killing the way that he wanted to.  It was though still pretty entertaining.  It has one of my favorite attributes that most movies don't even steer close to a nonlinear plot.  A nonlinear plot is when scenes are put in nonchronilogical order i.e. Pulp Fiction Out of Sight Fight Club etc.  It makes the audience pay more attention and makes the plot seem more interesting and intricate.  In this movie the plot wasn't way out of order but it was enough to be conidered nonlinear.     Another cool part of the movie was the heist itself.  It was very well planned and executed and obviously took time to think up.  The depressing climax and ending lean a lot towards the work of Hitchcock.  In fact if this film had been in some parts been by Hitchcock it would not have been too much of a surprise.     If you're in to classic black and white crime dramas then this movie is for you.".

Instead of a straightforward narrative Kubrick keeps throwing in this corny narration forty minutes before that... Two weeks earlier... to cover up inexplicable jumps in the time line.  The story's been scrambled for no apparent reason and it just seems like inept storytelling like listening to someone who keeps forgetting key details.Kubrick also used the narration to cover up holes in the exposition like he didn't want to go back and redo scenes for clarity for example that bit about how they were supposed to split up was mentioned just in time by the narrator like it was an afterthought.  Oh yeah they split up because it was part of the plan.  Sorry we didn't mention it earlier.And there's some major plot elements that aren't explained either.  Why did they have to kill the horse?  None of the race fans who were distracted by it would have seen the robbery anyway.  And why was Timothy Carey's character shot when he tried to drive out of the parking lot?  How did Sterling Hayden's character get away with slugging a cop in the middle of a crowd?  How did a shotgun blast kill everyone except the person it was aimed at?  Why didn't Johnny and his girlfriend take the train when the airline wouldn't let them carry on the suitcase?  And that bit with having it fly open in the middle of the runway I could see that coming a mile off.  I thought all the money was bundled up when he put it in the duffel bag what happened there?Overall it was sloppy contrived and poorly executed.  This is a first effort in every sense of the word and belongs more properly to the canon of second rate cop shows of the fifties.  Fortunately Kubrick seemed to have learned from the experience but that's about all you can say for it.".

I think it's better than 2001 a space odyssey Paths of glory and Clockwork orange.  Plus he had everything right for the movie especially the actors.  Stirling Hayden couldn't have done a better job and no other actor could have been more convincing.  As usual Kubrick's name is all over the credits.  He directed produced and wrote the movie and did a great job in those three categories.  Of course the script is original and helps the movie be great.  Johnny Clay Stirling Hayden an excon decides to round up a few men to do a robbery.  It takes place in a racetrack and the murder of a horse is included that's where the title came from.  Johnny finds all the men he needs and explains them how the robbery will go down.  So he has one man to shoot the horse from a parking lot.  He has another man to pick up the money once it was robbed one man to create a diversion in the racetrack one man to open him the door to the money and finally himself to rob the money and the man upstairs to hope everything goes the way it was planned.  But does the man upstairs really like them?  Hayden delivers a strong performance as well as the supporting cast does.  But it is Kubrick who with his strong writing and directing makes the movie a classic.  Once again there are a few scenes where you can see how Kubrick was an avantgarde director and once again the movie was overlooked at the Oscars getting absolutely no nominations. It's a shame great movies like this one were often disregarded at the Oscars because if you ask me if The killing had been nominated at the Oscars that year it would have robbed every award including the best picture Oscar which was awarded to Around the world in 80 days.

The movies being made today usually ain't worth mentionin'.";

Over two million dollars in hard currency yet Johnny cant be bothered securing the suitcase!. Right Oh!. From the moment Kubricks camera focused on those faulty locks the viewer knows instinctively that the whole shabang is going to be blown wide open. Two million dollars Johnny!.

	schema:reviewBody "The Killing is a film whose legacy can still be seen in many films today. This film is not only Stanley Kubrick's first acclaimed film but it is also credited with inventing the concept of nonlinear story telling for the film industry. Some recent films that have used this technique are Reservior Dogs Pulp Fiction Go Wonderland and The Usual Suspects.The story deals with a motley crew of assorted criminals inside men and average joes just looking to get their hands on a large sum of money by stealing it from a racetrack. Sterling Hayden plays Johnny Clay a hardened criminal who just finished serving a fiveyear prison sentence. He is the ringleader of the bunch who is determined to only go for the big heists from now on. He figures they can put you away for stealing ten dollars as easily as ten million so what have you got to lose? The rest of the crew are mostly average people with average problems as Clay explains early on. Some of them work at the track. One is a crooked cop. Two are hardened criminals added at the last minute to cause diversions. Everything has been timed and planned out to the letter. Of course in a film like this things never go as planned. It wouldn't be entertaining if they did.The killing was made on a budget of well below half a million dollars and it shows. The film looks cheap at times but the story is more than enough to make you forgive its financial shortcomings. The acting is nothing too special. Hayden is strong and resourceful as Johnny Clay but he's pretty wooden. Elisha Cook Jr. is pretty good as a henpecked husband who is taking part in the scheme to impress his highmaintenance wife. If this film were recast today you'd have to think of William H. Macy to play this character. Timothy Carey is always memorable even with such a small part like the one he has here. Such a strangelooking guy! He gets the most interesting assignment of all the people in on the heist.You can really tell this was made fifty years ago. Even though there are hardened criminals and lowlifes in nearly every scene nobody ever says the Fword! There is however a fairly gory shootout in one scene which you normally didn't find in films back then. The killing was ahead of its time in more ways than one I guess. Please be sure to check this one out! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't help but like Klaus Kinski. Sure that's easy for me to say having only encountered him on film but despite or probably because of the madness the anger and the raving there's something magnetic about the man. He's like no other actor out there. No one else was so crazy so passionate and so captivating. He was certainly one of a kind.However despite my regard for him as an actor I can't say that I envy those who had to work with him. Raving fits shootings and murder plots aren't par for the course when it comes to the majority of movie shoots. Hell they're not normal by any standards. But then again Klaus Kinski and Werner Herzog are far from ordinary people. Both had their madness  one explicit and one masked  and both went to extraordinary lengths to get what they wanted.I think the piece in the film that best illustrated their shared madness was the story behind Kinski's 'autobiography'. Now to have biography that is largely fictional is nothing new as people always rewrite their lives but to have the person that you're insulting have you help insult them is rather extraordinary. It suggests a sadomasochism and a perversity in their relationship. But it also suggests a twisted affection. They hated each other and yet loved each other. No matter how hard they tried they couldn't stop gravitating towards one another.And it seems that this strange attraction was there from the beginning. After the amazing 'Jesus' footage the film opens with Herzog reliving his early childhood experiences with Kinski. Just listening to the stuff is amazing. Apparently before he moved into the halfway house that Herzog used to live in Kinski used to live naked in an apartment that was filled with leaves. But then once he did move he proceeded to ruin bathrooms knock doors down assault theatre critics I was not excellent! I was not extraordinary! I was monumental! I was epochal! and my favourite thing of all rave at the woman who gave him free board free food and who did his laundry for not ironing his shirts neatly enough. The man was a maniac. Yet I can imagine the young Herzog watching these displays in awe. If only someone could harness this energy.Well as Herzog's films prove he certainly harnessed it. But as you'd expect it was never smooth sailing. Kinski continually caused havoc on set and the bizarre incidents piled up higher and higher. But although listening to Herzog recount these incidents is fascinating enough the footage itself is amazing. We only get to see snippets of the 'Fitzcarraldo' documentary but the 'mild' raving fit that is shown illustrates what Herzog was dealing with every day. Sheer madness! In the footage that is shown it's an argument over food but it really could be anything. Indeed Herzog often says that Kinski would erupt for the smallest of reasons. But to see Kinski in action is amazing. He's like an animal.Yet despite the madness the film also manages to convey Kinski's warmth. There's some wonderful footage at a film festival in America where Herzog and Kinski embrace and joke with one another. In light of what comes before it's really surprising as it seems impossible to imagine such moments between the two. But when you see it you can't help but come to the conclusion that the two men really did have a deep affection for one another. As well as the hate there was a lot of love between the two. I also loved the Pongo footage from the 'Fitzcarraldo' documentary. Again you get to see the kindness that Kinski possessed as he bandages the camerman's hand.But although the film reveals a lot about Kinski Herzog still remains something of an enigma. It's clear that he loved and hated Kinski  there's one scene where Herzog is talking to a photographer and he suddenly looks overwhelmingly sad almost like a widower  but we're never really allowed to get into his head. In fact there's one bit where he says that Kinski thought that he was mad but he assures us that he's 'clinically sane'. But as he stands there holding onto a tree he does look quite mad. And for all we know he may well be or may well have had his madness as what sane person could tolerate Kinski's pestilence? But mad or not it doesn't matter. The films that Herzog and Kinski made together are amongst the best in the world and Herzog's documentary is a captivating amusing disturbing and ultimately moving tribute to his colleague and friend. The final minutes in particular I loved.".

But to see Kinski in action is amazing. He's like an animal.Yet despite the madness the film also manages to convey Kinski's warmth. There's some wonderful footage at a film festival in America where Herzog and Kinski embrace and joke with one another. In light of what comes before it's really surprising as it seems impossible to imagine such moments between the two. But when you see it you can't help but come to the conclusion that the two men really did have a deep affection for one another. As well as the hate there was a lot of love between the two. I also loved the Pongo footage from the 'Fitzcarraldo' documentary. Again you get to see the kindness that Kinski possessed as he bandages the camerman's hand.But although the film reveals a lot about Kinski Herzog still remains something of an enigma. It's clear that he loved and hated Kinski  there's one scene where Herzog is talking to a photographer and he suddenly looks overwhelmingly sad almost like a widower  but we're never really allowed to get into his head. In fact there's one bit where he says that Kinski thought that he was mad but he assures us that he's 'clinically sane'. But as he stands there holding onto a tree he does look quite mad. And for all we know he may well be or may well have had his madness as what sane person could tolerate Kinski's pestilence? But mad or not it doesn't matter. The films that Herzog and Kinski made together are amongst the best in the world and Herzog's documentary is a captivating amusing disturbing and ultimately moving tribute to his colleague and friend. The final minutes in particular I loved.";

	schema:reviewBody "The documentary made by Werner Herzog tells about the legendary lovehate relationship between the director who was ready to climb to Hell for his every movie and borderline insane genius actor Klaus Kinski who might have been one of the creatures from Hell that Herzog had to face. It is hard to imagine two people more different than Herzog and Kinski ...stone and waves the coldest ice and hottest flames have more in common differ less but they both were driven and obsessed artists. Famous for his wild and ferocious talent and temperament to match Kinski was incredibly difficult to work with. He wrote about himself I am a wild animal born in captivity in a zoo but where beast would have claws I have talent. Kinski's talent was fully realized in five films that he made with Werner Herzog over a fifteenyear working period starting with astounding Aguirre the Wrath of God 1973 and then following with Fitzcarraldo Nosferatu 1979 inspired by Murnau's silent vampire classic Woyzeck 1979 about a 19th century army private who seems mad to others because he looks and acts so differently from them and Cobra Verde 1988. It is impossible to imagine any other actor starring in these films and they are without doubt the best Kinski ever made and he made hundreds of films. Thanks to the Herzog's documentary we are able to learn what exactly went on behind the stunning images and unforgettable performances. According to Herzog people like Marlon Brando are just kindergarden comparing to Kinski. He is mad and unpredictable. They liked each other they hated each other and they respected each other at the same time making plans to murder each other. Kinski who respected Herzog and valued his friendship confessed to the director that in his autobiography he would describe their relationship in not very flattering terms  otherwise the crowd would not read it. Herzog recalls how they both would sit together at the bench after the shooting and discuss what Kinski would write in his book. I am curious if they discussed and agreed upon the following passage and if Herzog helped Kinski with some of the colorful metaphors I absolutely despise this murderous Herzog! Huge red ants should ps into his lying eyes gobble up his balls penetrate his ahole and eat his guts. Even after watching the fascinating documentary it is difficult to fully understand the relationship between two giants but as Herzog admits the only thing that counts is what we see on the screen and what we see is amazing.".

	schema:headline " Utterly fascinating documentary about the extraordinary Klaus Kinski. Absolutely essential viewing for all Kinski buffs!";
	schema:reviewBody "'My Best Friend' is one of the most fascinating documentaries I've ever seen about movies and acting. Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski only made five movies together but what extraordinary movies they are! Kinski made many many movies many of them absolutely awful though all worth watching even if only for him. In fact it's difficult to think of any other actor of his undoubted talent who slummed it quite as much as he did. Herzog is regarded as one of Germany's greatest ever directors and made many fine movies without Kinski but the two together were really something special. Just watch the astonishing 'Aguirre The Wrath Of God' if you want to be floored by total genius! Much of this documentary deals with the trials and tribulations of that movie's troubled shoot but their other four collaborations are also discussed. Their relationship was a complex one and really hard to get your head around. At times they literally tried to kill each other but then there's footage included that shows their obvious warmth and affection for each other. You could say that this documentary provokes more questions than answers and if you are looking for a straightforward explanation of Kinski's behaviour and what Herzog REALLY thought about him then maybe you could regard this as a failure. Anyway I was enthralled and I think any fan of Kinski must regard this as essential viewing. From the opening footage of a raving Kinski on stage proclaiming he was Christ to the final moments of a butterfly flitting around his face this is mesmerizing stuff and not to be missed by anyone with every a remote interest in this unique actor. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "This fascinating documentary is not really about a madman. It's about two madmen. While it's quite obvious from the outset that Klaus Kinski is a nutcase it becomes more and more apparent that Werner Herzog himself is a pretty crazed character as well. For anyone who has seen Aguirre the Wrath of God or Fitzcarraldo this will come as no surprise seeing as those two movies were pretty crazy undertakings to begin with. Travelling down the Amazon on primitive rafts and dragging steamboats over hills are not the sort of activities carried out by normal film makers. Repeatedly making films with Kinski was perhaps an even less sane idea but Herzog made five features with this most demented actor. The films themselves are completely engrossing and unique. This documentary is likewise.Having read Kinski's autobiography 'Kinski Uncut' I was under no illusions of what I was going to encounter here. The book is a quite extraordinary account. Surely there has never been a star autobiography quite like this one? Full of aggression madness and pornographic detail of his sexual exploits this was the work of a deranged individual. Kinski didn't really focus on his film career he concentrated much more on his sexual liaisons and was not shy at hurling insults around at famous people. For instance he declined a role offered to him from Federico Fellini because the money was not good enough he dismissed Fellini with the words 'Go and have yourself fed in the ass!'. I couldn't imagine Tom Hanks saying this to Steven Spielberg to be perfectly honest. In the book too Kinski continually makes clear his severe dislike for Herzog. In My Best Fiend Herzog suggests that both men worked on the insults together in order to make the book more sensational. I do have to wonder to the legitimacy of this claim as it does seem strange. From what I have seen Kinski needed no assistance in coming up with insults to hurl at anyone least of all Werner Herzog.So similar to Kinski's book the account given by Herzog in this documentary is a highly subjective one. You really can never be sure the true extent of the truth and you never will be. But My Best Fiend is a terrific film whatever the case. Herzog is incapable of being boring and he does capture the essence of the relationship between these two striking individuals very well. There are a number of other people interviewed too who worked with these men on these films and this adds a great deal to the story. While there is some fantastic footage of Kinski to appreciate from the pure unhinged insanity of his Jesus Christ Savior performance to his intense ranting over a minor foodbased complaint on the set of Fitzcarraldo to the extraordinary gentleness of his interaction with a butterfly.This film is a rarity in that it is one that can just as easily be enjoyed even if you have no knowledge of the films made by the two principal characters. Both men are just too unorthodox and the relationship so fraught that the story of their relationship is enough in itself. For fans of the movies themselves this is of course an absolute must.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Best Fiend a take on the working relationship and history between filmmaker Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinski by Herzog himself puts on the facade of a documentary as Herzog interviews some of the participants actors and at least one crew member in the productions of the films Aguirre Woyzek Nosferatu Fitzcarraldo and Cobra Verde only the first and third seen by me. But it's less that than a kind of confessional from Herzog a collection of anecdotes horror stories and in general psychologically breaking through the general perceptions regarding their collaborations as actor and director. Part of that perception of course is totally correct. Herzog always a filmmaker wanting the utmost control of his stories about madmen obsessed with goals that seemed impossible or in subject matter that was marked as dark and disturbing as possible without being too graphic had to contend with his own kind of 'character' in the form of Kinski who could be a little frightened being scared of a wasp one moment and the next acting like someone killed his child when in reality the coffee was lukewarm.Kinski in most of the footage that is put forth in this film even the footage that is basically taken right out of the Herzog works themselves add to the profile of what this man might be. It's alternately funny and unnerving to see the one big outburst of his anger at a production manager on the set of one of the films when as Herzog says 'compared to his other outbursts this was mild'. Equally jarring is seeing him doing some kind of Jesusplay or a weird sermon at the start of My Best Fiend where he comes off like he's half a rockstar and half certifiable. But at the same time a little of the footage along with some of the anecdotes also give him the light of something of a schizophrenic who on the one hand could be extremely demanding and ultimately egomaniacal if not at the center of attention and on the other could be the most professional actor this side of a Howard Hawkes picture. Interesting too is seeing the two interviewees who have the best things to say about Kinski his female costars from Woczek and Fitzcarraldo. Maybe there's something of Kinski being the prototypical male as opposed to just being an escaped anger management patient. He's described as being sweet and kind and very polite to his costars of the opposite sex. But with the male ones who knows.The testimonials from Herzog build to something quite fascinating not just as a subjective profile of an actor and a quasifriend err fiend it's also a movie about Herzog too about how he sort of found out more about himself from having to tame the beast so to speak. The near legendary story of Herzog threatening murder and suicide if Kinski walked off Aguirre for example perhaps showed to his star not exactly that his own director was as nuts as him but that he took what he was doing just as seriously if not more so than he on a professional level. There's even an easygoing scene the only one with both of the men speaking in English where they seem most down to earth about why they work together so often. If there is anything that might be lacking from all of this it's that we get to see so much of certain sides of a few of their productions while Nosferatu and Cobra Verde are either left out altogether or just mentioned in brief towards the end. There's also an unnecessary scene where Herzog is reminiscing over a gallery of photos of Kinski and himself. And the balance between telling one side or the other of the actor's persona seems to not always be shifted totally in proportion by the end we almost want to see more and find out more than has been presented.But what is in My Best Fiend is pretty close to priceless for diehard fans of the director and actor and as one who's getting more into the filmmaker's career and finding Kinski to be Germany's much more crazy answer to Al Pacino an actor with the intensity and passion and skill of twenty actors all in the eyes and mannerisms it's a very good work to also be seen by people who have not even seen one of the five films by the director and star. It's a very bizarre very onedge but ultimately fruitful collaboration that now has made for a kind of mix of expose memorial and elongated denouement. And it also is very funny as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not a long time since I watched for the very first a Werner Herzog film. Actually that happened during this same month when I watched Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht. Right now I have seen four of the five films that Herzog and Klaus Kinski made as together as director and actor Cobra Verde is the only one still to watch but I have it already on DVD so it was time to finally watch My Best Fiend. Is obvious that now I'm totally into the work of Herzog this documentary is a must see for any fan of the work of Herzog and of the acting of Kinski. It is not a masterwork however the subject is more than interesting. I remember that the first time I watched a performance of Kinski was in the film Les Fruits de la Passion. By then I didn't know who was Kinski and I haven't watched that film again I have it on VHS and right now I don't have a video tape recorder available but I do remember it a little. I have it as part of a box of erotic classics and it does have many sex scenes quite explicit. Later I saw Kinski in For A Few Dollars More a film that I loved and Kinski is great in it however it was until this month when as I said finally I watched a Herzog film and with that I quickly remember Les Fruits de la Passion. Basically I never forgot that Sergio Leone film but with Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht and Aguirre der Zorn Gottes I began my true admiration for Kinski.The films of the team HerzogKinski are more than great extremely interesting and all of the ones I have seen with a magnificent Kinski. My Best Fiend is a documentary indicated just for persons who loved those films for obvious reasons. And it doesn't shows who was Kinski apart of what Herzog lived with him but he lived a lot of things interesting things. We watch Herzog visiting those places where Kinski made that another grey hair appeared in Herzog's head. And Herzog begins in Munich where he shared house with Kinski I didn't know that Kinski was 16 years older than Herzog where he knew Kinski his temperament. The footage of the making of the films is really interesting. Kinski was crazy simply. I remember that recently when I talked with my cousin about the HerzogKinski films I said I read that Kinski was crazy and he said but why? I said something like well he shot someone of the crew well for sure that's a type of madness said my cousin. I'm mentioning this because I read many stuff of Kinski mainly in the Internet before watching this film and most of the quotes of Herzog come from this film. Of course Herzog not only visited the places but also meet with some of the cast and crew who worked with him and Kinski. Is unique because we watch Herzog speaking Spanish of course German and narrating in English. We also see two actresses the one of Woyzeck they visited the place where they filmed Woyzeck and the one of Fitzcarraldo. Eva Mattes won in Cannes but Kinski doesn't and is very funny to hear Herzog saying that Kinski said something like I don't need awards I know I'm a genius it is true. It is interesting enough to easily say that it was absolutely worth watching. Of course Herzog was the sane and Kinski the madman when they were together but Herzog was also crazy he has other type of craziness. Many unforgettable images but one of my favourites is when they meet again after some years I think in Colorado. Is all happiness and with that I guess many of the ones who knew both could think something like who can understand these two?  There's also footage of a fight between Kinski and a producer I think and is a fight apparently for food. Watch how Kinski respected Herzog. I respect both for those four films that I loved and I hope soon I can say I love the five films of the HerzogKinski team. This was just the second documentary of Herzog that I watched the other was Grizzly Man and for me that film is a masterwork. This one should be watched once you have watched some of those mentioned five films.".

And the final scene with the butterfly  something Kinski the actor could do but Aguirre could not. It seems as if Herzog having showed only one side of Kinski all these years tries to explain it was all for the movies. Even if he still portrays him as a mad genius and coward at that his selective memory tries only to remember the good times a few rare footage of Kinski and himself having a good laugh.What the documentary also stresses out is that the director and the actor could have been switched during the filming of Fitzcaraldo  Herzog explains how he was alone against everybody believing the impossible like the character in the movie. At this point only Herzog seems to aknowledge the fact that he also was completely mad.I recommend watching the documentary and then watching Cobra Verde Fitzcaraldo and Aguirre again.".

Their relationship is one of hate and love respect and tolerance. The movies they made were acts of attrition physically emotionally and occasionally financially.Through Herzog's delicate tracings of their career together it was clear that behind the death threats the yelling the arguing and the disdain both men had an amazing affinity for one another.Kinski was the catalyst for such a partnership as his mad style of acting and living seemed to make life dangerous and interesting all at the same time.I am amazed Kinski was never honored with a nomination for an Oscar. He must be one of the best character actors in history. Though I'm sure he believed himself to be the best and would naturally scoff at any awards thrown his way.Great study on a pair of friends whose lovehate created some of cinema's finest works.".

Manic. Possessed. His approach to filmmaking requires physical and psychic danger. He engages in broad sweeps of risk.One of those is his collaboration with another madman Kinski a more flamboyant man but probably a more honest one. That's because Herzog sees his job as collecting various touchstones in life amplified by these risks refined into broad metaphors and woven into a story.

He's taken some experiences and traits and archived footage and woven a mostly fictitious story with his trademark metaphors and crisp contrasts. No matter that the truth is bent  indeed that's the job of the artist. No matter that Herzog claims sanity while depicting Kinski and actually all his players as mad  in fact convincing us of the rightness of his vision is also seen by Herzog as his job. But some of the slips are pretty funny. I'm not crazy well maybe except for the time I tried to firebomb him.

I cannot recall which project Wrath' or Fitzcarraldo' but he was holed up in a tent in the real wilderness for weeks alone. During that time he was in an altered state and wrote several journals in miniscule script. He shows us one of these and reports he has never read them. That to me is the sweetest metaphor.

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog's 1999 documentary Klaus Kinski My Best Fiend is yet another in the dazzling array of Herzog documentary or documentarylike films. This one follows his turbulent friendship and creative partnership with the legendary German actor Klaus Kinski. Herzog also serves as narrator in German with English subtitles or dubbed into English. In the 1970s and 1980s the pair collaborated to make five indelibly memorable great films Aguirre The Wrath Of God 1972 Nosferatu Phantom Of The Night 1979 Woyzek 1979 Fitzcarraldo 1982 and Cobra Verde 1988.In a sense this film is pure hagiography only in wink and a nod reverse as Herzog proudly cements Kinski's reputation as the madman of 20th Century film but in the hands of any other director that's all this film would be schmaltzy hagiography. In the capable hands of Herzog this film is a memorable experience in its own right. The film also has other unexpected moments of fun and pleasure including bizarre outtakes from a supposed earlier version of Fitzcarraldo starring Jason Robards as Fitzcarraldo with a goofy Mick Jagger as his even odder sidekick. Whether or not this is true footage or was merely done as a gag is left to the viewer's imagination but it's hard to imagine that Herzog would have ever wanted to make such a film.Kinski died in 1991 in Marin County California at the age of sixtyfive just three years after his last collaboration with Herzog on Cobra Verde yet Herzog seems to never have gotten over it for the better or the worse. The whole film despite its mockery and offbeat tone is a most loving tribute of one artist to another even as Herzog claims ''Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski.' Yet the two men and artists seemed to bring out the best in each other for Kinski's career long predated Herzog's and included small roles in epics like Doctor Zhivago but no one today recalls a single role of Kinski's outside the Herzog milieu. That alone sums up why this documentary is a must see for Herzog fans and fans of cinema.".

The documentary at hand might only show Kinskis crazy side and with Kinski gone when this was made he had no chance to comment but to work with such a mad man one had to be mad himself.

The two had a very troubled lovehate relationship that might have caused plenty of drama on the sets but fans of the two were treated with some remarkable movies. AGUIRRE THE WRATH OF GOD FITZCARRALDO NOSFERATU WOYZECK and COBRA VERDE were the films and it could be argued that three of them are masterpieces. There are countless documents or interviews out there with many directors talking about how horrid of a person Kinski was to work with but it's interesting to see Herzog mention that while he was awful the two of them really needed one another. MY BEST FIEND tells a great many stories about the trouble that happened behind the scenes and ever so often we're greeted to some actual video footage of Kinski having one of his rants. There's an audio example too as well as getting to see Kinski on stage where he was playing Jesus and going off on one of these crazy rants. This documentary is so strange because it really is a touching hand out from Herzog to Kinski but at the same time most of what's being talked about is bad stuff. Kinski certainly isn't shown in a good light but at the same time you can't help but smile at his madness and in reality start to like him even as the bad stories pile up. MY BEST FIEND is far from a great film. I think one problem is that more good stories about the two probably would have helped. I think the film also lacks so much footage be it on the set of these films or other stuff that you can't help but also wonder how many of the stories are true. With that said MY BEST FIEND is an interesting document to say the least and a fitting tribute to the madness of both Kinski and Herzog.".

	schema:reviewBody "As mentioned in other reviews and as already communicated by the film title this documentary offers a very subjective view on Kinskis personality Kinski as seen and as utilized by the director Werner Herzog. The film describes Herzogs artistic vision of filmmaking and the rough personality Kinski contributed to this mission. By doing this it is at least a fascinating documentary about filmmaking itself.It's obvious that Kinski with his impulsive uncut and nearly superhuman presence that nearly blows up the screen is the prototype actor for the typical Herzog protagonist a man whose overindividuality tears him apart from the human society and whose untamed passion only finds a metaphoric equivalent in the wild and uncivilized nature  in which he will finally collapse well at least in most cases. The documentary gives impressive evident for Kinski being this ideal candidate by comparing alternate scenes from Fitzcarraldo one with Kinski as Fitzcarraldo and one with Mick Jagger. Jagger a charismatic wildman on stage ends up as a harmless milksop when compared with Kinskis furious insanity.However it seems that Herzog still wants to watch Kinski through the eyes of the director not allowing too much deviation from the intended role. This becomes obvious in a short dialog with actress Eva Mattes who describes Kinski as a polite shy and 100 professional person. Herzogs reaction can be paraphrased as But wasn't he also a madman? Biographical research or psychological analysis are not the matter of this film. The reason is simple and becomes obvious during the movie while showing some kind of bestofKinski moments the documentary focuses more and more on Herzog himself and his mission and in one scene Herzog will happily tell that he is a little bit insane too.So his approach to this documentary is rather comparable to the great films he made with Kinski Kinski is the headliner and catalyst for Herzogs artistic vision to accomplish the 'impossible' gesamtkunstwerk realizing filmmaking in a hostile environment revealing the unseen and pushing everyone involved to his individual limits.With many unreleased flicks from film shootings and Kinski stage shows interviews with involved actors and staff and some very intense shots butterfly scene this film is nevertheless highly recommendable to all Herzog  Kinski followers.".

The reason is simple and becomes obvious during the movie while showing some kind of bestofKinski moments the documentary focuses more and more on Herzog himself and his mission and in one scene Herzog will happily tell that he is a little bit insane too.So his approach to this documentary is rather comparable to the great films he made with Kinski Kinski is the headliner and catalyst for Herzogs artistic vision to accomplish the 'impossible' gesamtkunstwerk realizing filmmaking in a hostile environment revealing the unseen and pushing everyone involved to his individual limits.With many unreleased flicks from film shootings and Kinski stage shows interviews with involved actors and staff and some very intense shots butterfly scene this film is nevertheless highly recommendable to all Herzog  Kinski followers.";

But it's not the Exorcist  there's no horror no gore just intricate unsettling emotions and impossibletoanswer questions.Two brothers Hojin and Daejin are close but with the kind of tolerance and exasperation that comes from a lifetime of living with someone who is your polar opposite. Hojin is a carpenter who is about to have an exhibition of his carefully crafted furniture. Daejin is a bit of a lout races cars for a living and doesn't really pull his weight around the house.They share a home with Hojin's wife Eunsu. Hojin and Eunsu enjoy a special relationship writing letters to one another daily and treasuring their good fortune at having found one another. On the day that Daejin is to race in a rally Hojin running very late catches a cab to the speedway. Then disaster strikes both brothers are simultaneously the victims of shocking car accidents. Both end up in the hospital in deep comas.A year later we see one of them awake. Daejin opens his eyes staggers out of bed and catches sight of himself in the mirror. The significance of this is not overdone but the shot is held long enough to let the viewer know that it's important. He is released from the hospital and goes home to pick up his life. It's slow going  he is often confused and distracted frequently falling into very long sleeps and physically shaky. He begins to adopt habits watering the garden making elaborate dinners building furniture putting toothpaste on Eunsu's toothbrush in the early morning. This freaks Eunsu out  these are all things that Hojin used to do.It becomes clear that Daejin believes himself to be Hojin inside Daejin's body. The tension comes from the fact that as he tries to convince Eunsu of this by revealing facts about her that only Hojin would know the viewer is also likewise convinced. The question  is soul possession possible and if so is Hojin really living within Daejin  which outside the confines of this movie may strike you as rather silly is treated in all seriousness and therefore works a treat. The ending which I will not reveal is highly ambiguous and therefore fitting. The lead actors Lee Byeongheon as Daejin and Lee Miyeon as Eunsu are a perfect balance. Lee Byeongheon in particular is quite amazing. His voice his body language his facial expressions are all noticeably different when the transformation from Daejin to Hojin takes place. Lee Miyeon has an ethereal quality to her that makes Eunsu's struggle to believe all the more poignant.At 114 minutes this is well worth your time.".

After witnessing the death of his father in a car accident he becomes sullen and withdrawn. This leads to him being put under house arrest after he punches out an unsympathetic teacher. Imprisoned in his own house and unable to go beyond 100 yards he finds himself turning into a peeping tom and spying on all the neighbors. One of them is the attractive new girl in town named Ashley Sarah Roemer and another may be a killer named Mr. Turner David Morse. With the help of the new girl Ashley his friend Ronnie a great comedic turn by Aaron Yoo Kale goes about investigating Mr. Turner to see if he is the killer or not. The three teenagers use cell phones and the internet as well as video cameras in the investigation and DJ Caruso shows some of his sly wit by using these same devices in the film to not only investigate the spooky neighbor but also to create some humor to go along with everything else.The plot is a familiar one. That would be because the great Alfred Hitchcock used it first with his famous suspense thriller Rear Window. Yes Disturbia is a blatant ripoff of that movie but it is done with skill and the acting by all including Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mother was very good. All the characters are likable and David Morse's turn as the creepy Mr. Turner was well done as well.Disturbia may not be a great movie but it is definitely one of the best PG13 thrillers in years. It outshines such horror thrillers as Cursed and Pulse as well as the recent horror thriller The Messengers. Disturbia also once again proves that you don't need a bunch of gore to make an effective horror thriller. Horror directors take note.".

	schema:reviewBody "Disturbia star Shia LaBeouf appears to have a great future ahead of him. In the past few years amidst forgettable roles in I Robot and Constantine he contributed strong performances in films like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints and now in the thriller Disturbia. Although it is basically a remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window Disturbia is unique in that it mixes elements of teen comedy romance drama and gripping suspense in an entertaining way. Not to say the film is perfect as it definitely isn't but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and then some. All of the acting is decent and believable with standout performances by the aforementioned LaBeouf as Kale and David Morse as the suspected villain Mr. Turner. Serving as great comic relief is Kale's friend Ronnie Aaron Yoo while the new girl next door Ashley Sarah Roemer provides a romantic interest. Also notable is The Matrix's CarrieAnne Moss as Kale's mother who is great as always yet underused.Kale gets put on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher in class. It's his third run in with the law since his father died in a car accident a year earlier. Under house arrest he begins to learn the secrets of everyone surrounding him through the use of binoculars and video cameras. His most important realization in his voyeurism is that his somewhat reclusive neighbor shares many suspicious similarities to a wanted serial killer whom the police have not yet identified.It's generally difficult to create such suspense under the restrictions of a PG13 rating do not watch this at the theater between 79 PM to avoid the loud middle school crowd but instead of just trying to shock the film conveys paranoia and fright through the use of mood and mere suggestions of menace. The script could have used another rewrite to further develop the cast of characters as the only one who is fleshed out at all is LaBeouf's. LaBeouf who turns twentyone in June is looking to join Joseph GordonLevitt and Ryan Gosling as one of the few great actors under the age of thirty if he keeps turning in strong performances in interesting projects. His star is certainly rising with Transformers due this summer and the fourth Indiana Jones film in the summer of 2008. We have to realize that even though there is so much that makes Disturbia unique at heart it is a very commercial effort. The twists are quite obvious many characters are underdeveloped and there's product placement everywhere which is realistic nonetheless. However at a brisk 104 minutes it would be a lie to say the movie wasn't extremely satisfying and an undeniably entertaining film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Disturbia tells the story of a teenage boy named Kale who is sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father. When his mother takes away his TV and his computer he resorts to spying on the houses surrounding him. Things begin to get frightening when he begins to suspect one of his neighbours is a serial killer. He gets his friends involved with his impromptu investigation and soon the neighbour realizes he's being watched...And he's not too happy about it. Disturbia is loosely based off the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window but it is still a film all in itself and it is the best thriller I've seen in a while.What makes this movie better than most horror movies that are released today is that is doesn't rely on excessive gore and gross out tactics to frighten you. It relies on mood and suspense and that works so much better. As the film went on the tension got so high that I was literally on the edge of my seat rubbing my hands together because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next. I actually felt the adrenaline rush that the characters in the film must have been feeling when they were snooping around in the neighbour's garage. The movie has a realistic feel of how creepy it would be to have a serial killer living across the street from you and you had no way to prove it. Everything in this movie is done well. The writing the directing the way it all pans out. I was actually shocked when I left the theatre over how good this movie really was.The acting was very good from everybody involved. Shia LaBeouf has come a long way from Even Stevens. Something tells me that he has a nice career ahead of him. David Morse is perfectly sinister as the neighbour. He's just one of those actors that you might not know who he is to hear his name but he pops up here and there and you always say Cool it's that guy. Overall this was an amazing thriller and I'm glad I went to see it because I really wasn't expecting that much. It leads me to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump out absolute garbage like the Saw trilogy Hostel and Dead Silence when they could be making movies like this instead.810".

But my boyfriend and I had nothing better to do last week and decided to see it I have to say that actually it wasn't as bad as I expected I have to admit that it was a pretty good reintroduction to one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window it still was pretty clever.Kale has had a rough year while driving his father back from their fatherson fishing trip they get into a horrible fatal car accident the Father dies but Kale is alive trying to deal with the guilt of what happened. But a teacher pushes him too far in his high school Spanish class and he hits the teacher putting him on house arrest he cannot leave outside his property. But he's in luck when a hot young girl moves next door they quickly develop a peeping tom type of relationship they spy on the neighbors but when they see the neighbor across the street on a date but the date never leaves the house and they want to prove him as a cold hearted murderer but is he? You'll have to see this movie to find out.So Distubia was a pretty good movie I would recommend it although before you see it I would highly recommend seeing Rear Window but this was a good updated version that I'm sure you'll enjoy. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and will make you ask questions over and over again those are always the thrillers that are worth seeing.710".

However once you get past the impressive first five minutes the film falls completely flat! Without giving anything away the movie has absolutely no surprises. In fact Disturbia is so formulaic that anyone over the age of 10 should be able to predict exactly how the movie ends including what happens to every single character. The dialogue is cheesy and ridiculous every character besides the main kid Kale is completely one dimensional. By the time anything that is supposed to pass for scary happened I was so bored I didn't care who lived or died. This movie had absolutely no emotional resonance. I watched it alone late at night in the dark and was not scared once! I have worked in video retail for almost six years. Maybe I've just seen so many great movies that this one just seems especially bad. It is a mediocre film at best. There are good performances but the actors really had nothing to work with. David Morse's suspected killer is a complete waste of his talent. I am happy I have a job where I can directly influence what people are renting at least in one neighborhood of Seattle. I am going to make it my personal mission to keep Disturbia out of as many hands and homes as I possibly can!!!".

The result is a very boring movie without any surprises. It's just another teen movie packed with hightech trendy stuff ads such as the XBox360 or the PSP  everything that a modern teenager needs but beneath the glossy surface there is nothing.What is wrong with the movie? Well a lot of things. First of all it is boring the prelude is too long when literally nothing happens. The acting is bad. There is no suspense or surprise in the movie everything is what it seems to be.I definitely do not recommend this movie for anyone who is older than 14 years old.".

The other absurdity in this flick is that you have a fellow who is killing women right and left and yet...he allows the curtains in his house to be wide open so anyone from outside can look in!

	schema:reviewBody "I understand that the new movie Disturbia is about a person who is unable to leave his room and must look out the window for entertainment. During his peeping sessions he finds that his neighbor might be a killer and by doing so tries to get everyone around him to help find out the truth. That premise and that premise alone is the ONLY thing that likens this movie to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of tension and technical genius Rear Window. Director D.J. Caruso has taken this script no credit listed to the writers of that classic and created a contemporary world around which he can create a cat and mouse chase from the small radius that our protagonist is allowed to travel within having a house arrest anklet affixed to his leg. If the critics are to be believed that this is a ripoffremake then every romantic comedy coming down the pipeline is one as well. Boy meets girl boy must win girl conflict causes relationship to stay strained boy ultimately wins girl. Actually since every romcom follows that exact plot sketch they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a premise updates it and makes it his own.Worried that this might end up as another lame duck attempt from the director I didn't have too lofty of expectations. I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf ever since his Even Stevens days and knew he could give it credibility. Fortunately after the highly disappointing Taking Lives and the hohum Two for the Money it seems Caruso has come back to the form he had with his brilliant debut Salton Sea. Maybe it was the recent work on The Shield but we have some nice grit closeup composition and stylish camerawork. The realism from Sea is back and Disturbia brings it all to make one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year. We have fantastic humorLaBeouf's delivery and everyman rapport lends to this wellas well as effective scares and edge of your seat suspense. This is a PG13 movie that knows what it is and rather than titillate with coming as close to the line as possible stays in check and deals out a healthy dose of mood and emotion rather than blood and sex. I'd even go as far as saying Sarah Roemer's girlnextdoor is the most sensual role this year. It is all about her confidence and eyes her body language makes it work and you fall for her just as LaBeouf does whereas the usual Rrated nudity and over the top craziness has been going so far as to numb audiences by doing what every film now does. Credit Caruso for showing restraint for everything and leading us along by uncovering pieces of the story only when we need to know them.Besides LaBeouf Roemer and a funny turn from Aaron Yoo the main driving force here is David Morse. This gem of a character actor is at the top of his game as the villainous did he or didn't he neighborhood serial killer. He is good as the conflicted heavy who does wrong only when the world around him has forced him to like in Dancer in the Dark and Down in the Valley but he is perfect as the all out creepy slysmiling force being accused of kidnapping and killing numerous women. Morse was allowed to run free and he took the opportunity and went even further with it. Where many suspense films like this would become laughable eventually the realism brought out through LaBeouf and Morse keep the audience enthralled and interested in how everything will play out. I was never bored and at times actually wondering what would happen next because I was so caught up. When the climax comes I actually was surprised thinking it was crazy that they would get us there so early but I was just so into it that I didn't realize how much time had past.Disturbia is a genre film and won't be winning any awards any time soon. What it may lack in total originality it more than makes up for in mood and effective thrills. It had everything you could want from a movie without making you have to think too much. Sit down go for the ride and walk out of the theatre with the knowledge that your time was well spent. D.J. Caruso thank you for redeeming yourself.".

Later I found that it is somewhat similar to Rear Window  the Hitchcock movie and is on the same lines that made me go and see this movie.It is the story of a young boy Kale Shia LaBeouf who is sentenced to 3 months of house arrest and finds ways to peep through his windows in neighbors' lives  one the recently moved neighbor girl Ashley Sarah Roemer and another middle aged guy Mr.Turner David Morse who our young boy and his friend Ronnie Aaron Yo suspects as a killer. Is Mr.Turner a killer? Or this is just paranoia of our young gang? The Director D.J.Caruso  who has specialized in crime thrillers in past 45 movies does a very decent job in keeping the audience engrossed in the narrative and unfolds the story slowly and nicely. The movie presents many aspects of drama and takes us through a ride of varied subplots with good interest. There are a couple of minor annoying scenes  like the love aspect quite unnecessary I thought but may be required for today's young audiences and the usual clich of thriller movies. But overall the movie is entertaining.Shia LaBeouf is not a great actor but does a decent job so does the Sarah Roemer Aaron Yo and David Morse.The camera work is excellent because it shows only that much which would make you eager to peep beyond the camera frame to see what is there  and that keeps you engaged. The music is okay.Yes the movie is not close to the classic Rear Window but I should say that I liked the movie.Stars 6.75 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I hate to rate this movie as high as a 1 but I guess that's as low as it goes. I'll begin with what was good about the movie. The acting was fine the premise was good and the production was fine. The writing in this film is simply lazy. For example the police respond within a minute every time the main character goes past the boundary that his ankle bracelet allows until it would be beneficial for them to arrive quickly. In this case the officer accepts the call even though he is off duty but then decides he'll respond when he's good and ready. Let's be realistic he would either accept the call and respond with some haste or he would let someone else get the call. Also we have no idea why a minor would get house arrest for hitting a teacher who made a completely unprofessional and insensitive comment this again is lazy writing. There are also dozens of times when the main characters could have called the police on the neighbor e.g. when he goes into the girls' car but they don't because they are idiots. If they were really sure of the neighbor's guilt they could have simply got the girl to call the cops and say that he touched her inappropriately. The ensuing investigation would reveal the dead bodies in his house the connections to the past murders etc. But then again this would make too much sense. When the writers should have gotten creative they coped out and made the characters act as though they were mentally challenged. My final complaint is about the pacing a bunch of useless slow story in the beginning followed by pointless fastpaced action scenes. Even in these action scenes lazy writing prevailed. When the main character is continuously grabbing for the transmitter on the counter he has it in his hands several times but just ends up dropping it as though it were covered in oil. This was the worst movie I have seen this year!".

And where else could I see this not other than... The Simpsons. Season 6 Episode 1 Bart of Darkness. Look it up here on IMDb.COM. This episode of The Simpsons features Bart getting his leg broken leg in a cast getting a telescope from his sister starting watching people from Springfield using the gift. Sees no other than Ned Flanders  the next door neighbor doing suspicious things... murder is in the air... This episode was inspired by Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock 1954 later remade by Pei Chan in Hou chuang 1955 and yet another time on TV under the very same title Rear Window 1998 TV starring Christopher Reeve. Are there no new ideas in the writers heads? Has everything been already written? Why can't I see Alfred Hitchcocks' name when I type Disturbia in IMDb?? When I first saw Disturbia I regretted spending money on the ticket. Now that I discovered it was a cheap ripoff I think it was just another moneymaker by people who do not care about the art of film making and what is even worse they don't care about the viewer... they only think about their pocket.".

The killer really doesn't even come into play until the last 20 minutes of the movie where he just goes on a mle rampage with a baseball bat out of the blue totally pointless.. It's cheesy it's jokes are stupid and the killer's house is apparently designed by James Bond.

C'mon a secret room in a secret room in a secret room that's stupid! I couldn't care less whether or not the kid died and to be frank had the neighbor gone on his rampage in the beginning of the movie it still would've made the exact same sense which is Hey let's put a lot of teenagers in a house and have a crazed psycho try to kill them! This is a very original idea and I think this movie is very Oscar worthy. I would have rather watched a two hour documentary on the odor of dog crap. This movie sucked.".

I would rather swim with sharks with steaks tied to my legs. This piece of cinema dog crap is not even a scary movie. The killer really doesn't even come into play until the last 20 minutes of the movie where he just goes on a mle rampage with a baseball bat out of the blue totally pointless.. It's cheesy it's jokes are stupid and the killer's house is apparently designed by James Bond.

	schema:headline " Keeps Dirty Harry Alive and Well";
	schema:reviewBody "In this third chapter from the Book of Dirty Harry Callahan there's plenty of action as Harry breaks in a new partner and goes after a ruthless bunch some selfproclaimed revolutionaries who are nothing more than common criminals in The Enforcer' directed by James Fargo and starring Clint Eastwood and Tyne Daly.  And beyond the action it's a film that manages to make a valid statement about bureaucratic nonsense as well as the lack of common sense employed by those ensconced in the budding agenda of political correctness' who put an emphasis on image over purpose and results. Mostly though it gives the audience a chance to share vicariously in the triumph of good over evil as Harry once again metes out justice in his own inimitable way.After taking charge and cleaning up a hostage situation in a way that only Dirty Harry' can Harry Eastwood is assigned to a desk job in personnel. But when his partner Frank DiGiorgio John Mitchum goes down on the job during the robbery of a munitions warehouse Harry is back on the street but with a new partner Kate Moore Daly one of the first female inspectors in the country.  And Harry puts her through her paces as they attempt to track down this particularly volatile gang who seemingly put little value on human life as they cut their swath through the city of San Francisco and pursue their own for the people' agenda which in reality means they want to get their hands on as much cash as possible and plan to hold the city hostage to do it.  But they had better think again because when they took down Frank they inadvertently provoked the ire of Inspector Callahan himself who does not take kindly to their sort to begin with. James Fargo is in the director's chair for this one and he comports himself well recapturing all of the attitudes and elements that made the first two Dirty Harry' films so successful.  Fargo sets a good pace and keeps the story on at least an equal footing with the action which keeps this one involving.  Giving Harry a female partner puts some added interest into the mix as well in light of the fact that this film was made in an era in which women were just beginning to emerge in such positions on the screen or otherwise.  Cagney and Lacey' for instance was still some five or six years away and Kathleen Turner's V.I. Warshawski' wouldn't make an appearance until 1991.  Initially  the film takes something of a patronizing attitude toward her but Harry treats her as an equal from the beginning and in the end Inspector Moore emerges as a strong character gender aside.  Most importantly that is not the focus of the filmmakers here and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history Moore is just another character in the Dirty Harry' saga and she's a good one especially when compared to Harry's partner Al Quan played by Evan C. Kim in The Dead Pool'.  And credit Fargo with insuring that it all blends together naturally within the context of the story as well as the fact that he keeps the relationship between Callahan and Moore on task and allows it to develop quite credibly.  All in all it's a good collaborative effort from all concerned.What really gives this one that ring of authenticity however is that Clint Eastwood is in top form and even in his third outing as Harry seems more immersed in the character than ever.  And in the final analysis story aside it's the Dirty Harry' character that makes these films so popular and successful.  Creating a cinematic icon is no easy task and that's precisely what Eastwood has done with Harry and it's gratifying to see that he is willing to give that 110 at this stage of the game in order to maintain the credibility of the character and the films as well.  A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.  It demonstrates what a pro Eastwood is and why he commands the kind of respect afforded him within the industry.Taking on the role of Kate Moore had to be a challenge for Tyne Daly and happily she succeeds quite well with it.  She makes her character convincing by allowing her to develop in a real time' manner she doesn't just jump in there full blown and ready to take on hardened criminals. Initially she displays some intimidation in Harry's presence which gives their relationship some realism from the beginning.  After all Harry IS an intimidating guy add to that the fact that this is a new job for Moore which in reality would create a level of discomfort for anyone anywhere. And Daly has tapped into all of that with her portrayal of Moore making her a very believable character and one of the most memorable from among the five Dirty Harry' films.The supporting cast includes Harry Guardino Lt. Bressler Bradford Dillman Capt. McKay DeVeren Bookwalter Bobby Maxwell John Crawford The Mayor Samantha Doane Wanda and Albert Popwell as Big' Ed Mustapha look for Popwell in the original Dirty Harry' as the Bank Robber in Magnum Force' as pimp J.J. Wilson and again in Sudden Impact' as one of Harry's partners Horace.  A well made and entertaining film The Enforcer' keeps the Dirty Harry' series alive well and on solid ground in retrospect it seems a shame now that Eastwood waited seven years to make the next installment Sudden Impact' as with the dreadful The Dead Pool' in 1988 it all ended with barely a whimper.  The first four however more than make up for it and that's the magic of the movies.  810.".

Initially  the film takes something of a patronizing attitude toward her but Harry treats her as an equal from the beginning and in the end Inspector Moore emerges as a strong character gender aside.  Most importantly that is not the focus of the filmmakers here and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history Moore is just another character in the Dirty Harry' saga and she's a good one especially when compared to Harry's partner Al Quan played by Evan C. Kim in The Dead Pool'.  And credit Fargo with insuring that it all blends together naturally within the context of the story as well as the fact that he keeps the relationship between Callahan and Moore on task and allows it to develop quite credibly.  All in all it's a good collaborative effort from all concerned.What really gives this one that ring of authenticity however is that Clint Eastwood is in top form and even in his third outing as Harry seems more immersed in the character than ever.  And in the final analysis story aside it's the Dirty Harry' character that makes these films so popular and successful.  Creating a cinematic icon is no easy task and that's precisely what Eastwood has done with Harry and it's gratifying to see that he is willing to give that 110 at this stage of the game in order to maintain the credibility of the character and the films as well.  A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.  It demonstrates what a pro Eastwood is and why he commands the kind of respect afforded him within the industry.Taking on the role of Kate Moore had to be a challenge for Tyne Daly and happily she succeeds quite well with it.  She makes her character convincing by allowing her to develop in a real time' manner she doesn't just jump in there full blown and ready to take on hardened criminals. Initially she displays some intimidation in Harry's presence which gives their relationship some realism from the beginning.  After all Harry IS an intimidating guy add to that the fact that this is a new job for Moore which in reality would create a level of discomfort for anyone anywhere. And Daly has tapped into all of that with her portrayal of Moore making her a very believable character and one of the most memorable from among the five Dirty Harry' films.The supporting cast includes Harry Guardino Lt. Bressler Bradford Dillman Capt. McKay DeVeren Bookwalter Bobby Maxwell John Crawford The Mayor Samantha Doane Wanda and Albert Popwell as Big' Ed Mustapha look for Popwell in the original Dirty Harry' as the Bank Robber in Magnum Force' as pimp J.J. Wilson and again in Sudden Impact' as one of Harry's partners Horace.  A well made and entertaining film The Enforcer' keeps the Dirty Harry' series alive well and on solid ground in retrospect it seems a shame now that Eastwood waited seven years to make the next installment Sudden Impact' as with the dreadful The Dead Pool' in 1988 it all ended with barely a whimper.  The first four however more than make up for it and that's the magic of the movies.  810.";

	schema:reviewBody "For me the sequels to Dirty Harry never came close topping the original but I thoroughly enjoyed and think highly of them anyway... well maybe with the exception of The Dead Pool. Each one seemed to add its own distinguishable touch to the typical formula. The third film and probably the cheapest as it looks like it of the series 'The Enforcer' seemed to have that swinging and carefree vibe of the times with the biting reality and stark realisations heavily implemented in the first two taking a backseat for forceful if crass humour. However the violence is still gritty mean explosive and openly displayed. Director James Fargo 'Forced Vengeance' 'Every Which Way But Loose' 'Caravans' and 'A Game for Vultures' has appeared in some of Eastwood's early films as assistant director and here he paces it wellenough and let's the foundation play out more like an expansive lowkey action fling filled with the constant buddy routines as Harry is paired up with a young greenhorn female detective fidgety played by Tyne Daly. Who does bring an authentic and potent side to her role that are credibly developed longwinded buildups finishing off with brute force and the quickwitted response. Harry also has got a catchphrase just 'marvellous'.Eastwood laconically pulls it off with dominant ease and certain authority of truly delving into this character as now there's more to that monomaniacal search for one's own justice as his hands out punishment against a bunch of terrorists who call themselves 'The People's Revolutionary' and has time to let fly what he really thinks. Copping the cynical barbs are amusing support performances by Harry Guardino John Crawford and Bradford Dillman. The bad guys here aren't overly memorable but the DeVeren Bookwalter bestows a steely glance and has a quietly dangerous psychotic air to him. Showing up again but in another different character is the wonderful Albert Popwell.I never tire of the San Francisco locations where most of the films are shot and the camera superbly details the onscreen action and striking background features. What I like about the ending of these earlier 'Dirty Harry' films was how they weren't afraid to end on such an powerful note involving something represented visually to express the mindset as the camera slowly zooms out and the harrowing score cues in. On the point about the music. I would say I was a little put off by the racy and bouncy jazz score arrangement of composer Jerry Fielding who bytheway has done some magnificent scores for films of Sam Peckinpah Michael Winner and Clint Eastwood just didn't have the stinging sombre and selfreflecting quality of Lalo Schifrin's efforts. That's not to say it was bad or felt out of place because it didn't with the feel that this one opted for. But a darker or more subtle take could've done it wonders since Fielding has chalked up some jarringly bold pieces in other films.The script has some political context homegrown terrorism political correctness and equalgender opportunity but always stays true to the story than trying to undermine or overdo it. While it should be predictable it does keep one step ahead and offers a surprise or two.An uptopar sequel.".

A number of sharp oneliners and the outrageous methods employed by Detective Inspector Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood provide a lot of laughs but additionally his interactions with his new female partner and his incompetent superiors create a whole series of other situations which are also great fun to watch.Harry of course is a walking anachronism and a male chauvinist and these qualities often get him into trouble. He does however have a recognised talent for dealing with some very challenging cases in a particularly forceful way and it's this ability that frequently enables him to extricate himself from the difficulties that his behaviour leads him into.When Callahan and his partner Detective Inspector Frank DiGiorgio John Mitchum arrive at a liquor store robbery where the gunmen have taken hostages and demanded a car Callahan simply gets into his police vehicle and drives it at great speed through the storefront windows before shooting and killing all the robbers. His quick simple and effective way of dealing with this dangerous situation isn't appreciated by his superiors who promptly transfer him from the homicide division to the personnel department.In his new role Callahan takes part in a series of interviews with candidates who are being considered for promotion to inspector and openly shows his disgust at the imposition of quotas to ensure that a requisite number of women are appointed to these posts. In one interview with a candidate called Kate Moore Tyne Daly his questions reveal that she's spent all her career doing office work and has no experience in the field and has never even made an arrest. Callahan's scepticism about promoting people with no proof of their competence in the field leads to him being branded a Neanderthal and his concern about their safety on the streets is also summarily dismissed.After DiGiorgio is killed attempting to arrest a group of terrorists who are in the process of stealing rocket launchers explosives and a variety of other weapons from a munitions warehouse Callahan is reassigned to homicide with a new partner Detective Inspector Kate Moore. The way in which this unlikely partnership tracks down the terrorists who try to hold the city of San Francisco to ransom surprisingly leads to them becoming friends before their mission reaches its actionpacked climax at Alcatraz Island.It's interesting that in Magnum Force Callahan's attitude to vigilantism changed because of what happened in that story and similarly in The Enforcer his experience of working with a woman who showed her competence and bravery leads to a certain softening of his attitude to the idea of women working in the homicide division. With his eyes narrowed and his teeth clenched Clint Eastwood again does a good job of showing Callahan's disdain for various types of people but it's in his scenes with Tyne Daly that he shows greater subtlety as Callahan's new partner gradually starts to win his respect and friendship.".

There's no mystique surrounding their identity and their performances are particularly flat and nondescript even to the point where their plot points may wash over you and you momentarily lose your place.The script begins very promisingly with Harry being assigned a female partner.

The chase scene in which Harry ends up in the Church builds up some tension and only serves thereby to remind the viewer of a hitherto absence of the moody jazz that was so prevalent in the original. The original Dirty Harry's success was not due to any specific formula but rather was the result of a film full of subtleties. These subtleties included a perfect music score a balanced tension between Harry and his partners Harry's contempt for the red tape of police bureaucracy and the sinister nature of the villains. Together these dynamics made the original two movies stronger than the sum of their parts THE ENFORCER is simply not as magical. This is a great pity.

The formula does work fairly well but I'd like to see some more creativity employed. Harry does something wild to get his guy. Harry gets into trouble. Harry is called back because only he can save the day. Harry saves day but with a cost. The villains don't help by being unmemorable clichs espousing the usual diatribe about being for the people.

It's part of the new look the SFPD is being given. She's quite the inexperienced klutz at first something Clint doesn't really need. In the end she really does redeem herself.

It is easy to compare this film with the two previous Dirty Harry movies because there some things have still not changed. First of all Harry obviously kept his cheeky mouth which again provides the viewer with the necessary laughs and his boss with the necessary headaches. This is not the only thing that has stayed the same though. Again some of the scenes could have been shorter thus theoretically making The Enforcer a much tighter package. A perfect example of that is the scene in which Harry chases a bad guy to the rooftop of a building. Not only could this scene have been shorter but it could also have been much more exciting had there been adequate use of music and cinematography. There is however one upside to this installment in the Dirty Harry series which is that it is far more stable than it's predecessors. It is not a decent or good film film but it gets very close mainly because of the good acting and the fact that the film remained interesting for the despite it's downsides. Best Dirty Harry film until then. If you want to know if it is the best in the series check my comment for Sudden Impact".

	schema:headline " The best sequel of the Dirty Harry series!";
	schema:reviewBody "The original Dirty Harry film is a masterpiece of filmmaking a bleak spare morality tale and social commentary on the flawed justice system that introduced the iconic San Francisco detective to the ranks of the best cops portrayed on film and essentially redefined the trajectory of Clint Eastwood's career. Yeah Eastwood had already nailed the antiheroic Western loner in the 60s BUT in the 70s thanks to the role of Dirty Harry he was able to tweak his cool macho persona just enough to create a new invigorating character.Harry Callahan may actually be similar on the surface to Eastwood's Man With No Name Western hero but there are definite subtleties that make Harry a more relatable type of hero. For example in the first film we find out that Harry is a widower in a very brief yet immensely wellplayed scene when he is being treated by a longtime doctor friend for his wounds obtained in the film's early legendary Do you feel lucky? shootout. Anyone in Harry's situation could relate to such loss however long ago it happened. It's nice little scenes like this that make Harry one of us and not just some otherworldly tough guy. Then there's Harry's legendary speech to the Mayor on how he feels about criminals. I imagine that's how a LOT of people actually feel but Harry is that rare breed that's got the stones to voice his opinion! Harry speaks for the majority. The ending to Dirty Harry is still one of the most powerful ever put to celluloid. It was the real Best Picture of 1971 anyway you slice it! Interestingly most people actually like virtually all of the sequels except perhaps for The Dead Pool but you can't win them all! Still for 3 out of 4 sequels to be good that's something. In actuality I think the majority opinion is that each sequel declines in quality from the prior film. I disagree. While I still think Dirty Harry is the best of all obviously I don't think the immediate sequel Magnum Force is the best sequel. I believe that honor actually goes to this film THE ENFORCER 1976. Magnum Force while somewhat watchable is a bit too cold and detached and really the least relatable of the group of films next to The Dead Pool. Definitely not my favorite. As a sequel I feel as if The Enforcer comes closest of all of them of deftly relaying the message of the Dirty Harry films while being able to tell a different yet compelling story.The Enforcer starts out with a scene of a sexy hitchhiker 70s blonde bombshell Jocelyn Jones sporting the Daisy Duke look even before the term was coined! goading two gullible and horny gas company employees to a private location where lay in wait is Bobby Maxwell played with bugeyed intensity by DeVeren Bookwalter a disgruntled Vietnam vet and leader of the People's Revolutionary Strike Force. Maxwell kills the 2 men so he can confiscate their van to infiltrate a secure warehouse to steal advanced weapons so they can wreak havoc in the city all the while leading up to a grander plan that involves kidnapping the Mayor to make a bold statement.During the warehouse melee Harry's partner DiGiorgio commendably played by John Mitchum is killed trying to stop the terrorist gang but not before he is able to fatally injure one of them. Maxwell takes no chances and finishes off the injured party in a disturbing moment. So Harry is assigned a new partner Officer Kate Moore winningly played by a very young Tyne Daly in a breakthrough role who is immediately promoted to detective after having just passed an oral screening exam of which Harry was one of the testers. The exam scene was my favorite of the film! Harry being somewhat of a misogynist reluctantly partners with Moore and their uneasy alliance is fun to watch throughout as Eastwood and Daly display appealing yinyang chemistry.During their investigation into the war on the city Harry's superiors in particular the vain mediaschmoozing Captain McKay convincingly played by Bradford Dillman try to compel him to harass an infamous local group of black militants let by Mustapha persuasively played by Albert Popwell a stalwart supporting player in the Dirty Harry franchise. The scenes between Harry and Mustapha are very compelling as the two men while they have similar viewpoints on the MAN and the corrupt illoperated justice system Harry hasn't completely given up on it while Mustapha is a total rebel.But as the film progresses and Harry sees that his superiors are targeting the wrong group even after he and Moore have gathered some feasible circumstantial evidence he gets himself suspended. Soon after the real terrorists kidnap the Mayor and McKay reinstates Harry as Harry and Moore pursue the terrorists in a pulsepounding climax at the infamous Alcatraz prison shot on location. The ending scene to this sequel for me really resonates and I have it as easily the second best one in all the films. I'm sure you can guess which ending I rank as Number 1! Eastwood easily fits into his iconic role here carries the show with cool calm precision. And Daly in a groundbreaking role plays my favorite partner to Harry Callahan. This role probably set the stage for her to become the Lacey half of Cagney and Lacey for which she would go onto to win FOUR Lead Actress in a Drama Series Emmys! Directed by James Fargo I find The Enforcer to be a very provocative and fluid film that never stalls and tells a compelling story. Easily the best sequel to Dirty Harry for me!".

The plot here is as simple as simple can be Harry goes up against a religious cult bent on destruction with lots of shootouts action and typical '70s hardknuckle violence along the way. Eastwood once again makes the film his own as the iconic laconic cop who takes no prisoners and accepts no rubbish from anybody and he is given some particularly good comic interplay in the sequences with his new female partner whom he initially hates before growing to respect. He also gets lots of great oneliners  the seven point suppository line being my favourite. Tyne Daly CAGNEY  LACEY is also surprisingly excellent as the rookie cop.The bad guys are typical hippystyle psychos the chiefs of staff including Bradford Dillman's hardheaded Captain McKay are idiots and everyone else just stands around watching the carnage unfold. Scenes to watch out for are the hostage negotiation moment Harry drives a car through the building and the tense shootout at the end. This is edgy '70s fare very violent and shocking in places with lots of unexpected plot twists and cold sudden death. A great movie and a must for crime fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Enforcer 1976  out of 4 The third film in the series finds Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood going up against a group of crazed Vietnam vets who take the Mayor hostage and demanding money for him before they not only kill him but blow up the city. With a new partner Tyne Daly at his side Harry must try and find out who the group is.This here is quite as good as the previous film but it's certainly still a winner as everything that makes the series so memorable is on display here and considering it's the third film in the series it's still rather impressive how fresh the lead character is as well as the story. I think it's fair to say that the story is B movie material but it's still very effective and it's certainly good enough to hold your attention from start to finish and of course there are a few twists thrown in as well.This third film gives Harry a female partner which allows for various sexist scenes that could only work in a film from this era. The different sex really adds quite a bit to the movie since it does get the laughs that you'd expect in certain scenes but it's also a refreshing take on the genre. By this time the Dirty Harry character was already iconic so the toughness of that character mixed well with the female officer here. It certainly doesn't hurt that Eastwood and Daly have so much chemistry together. The two of them are very effective in their roles with Eastwood clearly at ease playing this toughasnails cop who doesn't everything his way. The supporting cast also offers up good performances from Bradford Dillman John Mitchum Albert Popwell and Harry Guardino.THE ENFORCER contains all the elements that made the first two films great entertainment. Of course you get a pretty simple story of good versus evil but what makes it so well here is how it's set up. The opening sequence is downright violent and the coldblooded nature of this group just makes you hate them to the point where you can't wait to see Harry get revenge. The film also offers up some pretty exciting action sequences including one of the great foot chases ever captured. Add in the topnotch cinematography and the great jazz score and THE ENFORCER is another success.".

If there was a criticism is that the heavy of this film isn't as memorable as in the previous two entries Bobby Maxwell essentially a sadistic heel nothing more or less.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason or reasons I found this Harry episode a little more entertaining than the others. Maybe it's the Tyne Daly interview scene with the woman's rights liaison sanctimoniously commenting on equality while Harry lambasts her with a what would you do in this situation? scenario. Maybe it's the rich kid who metamorphosed into the smarmy old man quasiliberal mayor with his Jimmy sycophantic aide at his side resembling a blathering French poodle. These mayoral scenes take a really sarcastic swipe at socalled liberal politicking done by mostly all the brass bigwigs. Another maybe is Clint's brief but amusing fictional characterization of Larry Dickman at Wanda's love emporium I still get a kick out of that name and his reference to a fictional brother as if he needed references!Also enjoyable is the opening scene at the restaurant where Harry bumrushes Freddie the Fainter the foodpoisonee faker who fools everybody but Harry. How about the Tyne DalyHarry partnership which develops nicely as we segue from the soulbrother barbershop scene great oneliners here! to the foot chase segment with the accompanying jazzyfunky score and with Ms. Daly at his back well sort of!? She finally does really cover his back later on but I won't say how or when no spoiling!. Speaking of Ms. Daly this is my favorite of all her roles...she really looks like she enjoyed her part here and play it well she did.But Ms. Daly's entrance into the foray would not have occurred were it not for the tragic demise of DiGiorgio John Mitchum Harry's partnerfellow inspector and confidant throughout the three main Harry films. His character exuded an oldschool nononsense approach to the job as well as a compassionate yet tough love demeanor. He was not one for flash and dash hyperbole ridden rambling diatribe just cut to the chase state the facts tersely but factually and get the job done. He was basically a throwback to the 50's60's whose wife still went to Novenas a practice less common as the 70's rolled in. Truly he was never a forefront character but his presence was subtle yet effective. You could tangibly feel Harry's grief stricken emotions at the passing of his partner and friend. All the above plus a well written and nicely paced story line a gorgeous cinematic backdrop of 'Frisco and the adjoining Bay area and a more understated and laid back execution of this film makes it a little different from the other Harrys. It's not necessarily better than the other Dirty Harrys but I just enjoyed this one more especially the unique ending and the pivotal sequences of events that preceded it.".

DiGiorgio dies in hospital the next day  his partner 'Dirty' Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood is annoyed very annoyed  together with his trusty Magnum sets out to bring the People's Revolutionary Strike Force down single handedly if necessary. Things get complicated though when he gets a new rookie female partner Inspector Kate Moore Tyne Daly  the People's Revolutionary Strike Force decide to kidnap the mayor John Crawford  hold him to ransom...Directed by James Fargo this was the third entry in the popular Dirty Harry series of action flicks to star Clint Eastwood as the title character  I must admit The Enforcer didn't do a great deal for me. The fairly routine script by Stirling Silliphant  Dean Riesner which was apparently originally called 'Moving Target' takes itself pretty seriously  just isn't that good I'm afraid it's well short on action  setpieces the story is dull  turns out to be nothing more than a simple kidnapping  as a whole it never got me going. The bad guy's are also underused here they barely feature at all  after the first few minutes they completely disappear until near the end the main bad guy Bobby Maxwell has to be one of the weakest on screen baddies ever he doesn't get any decent lines he doesn't get much of an opportunity to be evil  he puts up virtually no resistance at the end as Harry blows him away. The one aspect of the film I did like was Harry's partner I did think The Enforcer was going to turn into a mismatched cop buddy buddy type flick as he is paired up with a woman but it doesn't quite work out that way  while there's mutual respect by the end it never falls into the established clichs. In a way The Enforcer could be described as the very first mismatched partner action flick but it doesn't follow the same path many other's would take after 48 Hrs. 1982 which is more suited to the accolade.Director Fargo does alright but the film is pretty bland a bit lifeless  the action scenes are low key to say the least. There's no car chases very few shot outs one fight  little in the way of anything spectacular or particularly memorable including a rushed ending. The Enforcer has a somewhat sedate pace  I just found myself losing interest at various points the whole film just feels lacklustre  like noone had any enthusiasm apart from Tyne Daly who is pretty good in this a full 6 years before her stint as New York cop Lacey in Cagney  Lacey 1982  1988.Technically the film is alright there's nothing here that stands out as being particularly good or bad although I really hated some of the 70's style jazz music that played in the background especially during the scene when Harry chases the black dude. Actually shot in San Francisco  on Alcatraz this definitely has a somewhat gritty 70's feel to it. The acting is OK but nothing special.The Enforcer is an average 70's cop thriller it doesn't really have enough action for modern audiences tastes  the story itself isn't anything to shout about either. It's OK but nothing special. The Enforcer was the third Dirty Harry film coming after Dirty Harry 1971  Magnum Force 1973  was itself followed by two sequels Sudden Impact 1983  The Dead Pool 1989.".

The plot of this story is quite weak but the sheer presence of Clint on the scene makes this movie worth watching.A group of extortionists kidnap the mayor of San Francisco and bribe the city to give them money to release the mayor.  The bad guys aren't that scary and the story is pretty unoriginal but I don't know what it is but it is still enjoyable to watch.

The bad guys aren't that scary and the story is pretty unoriginal but I don't know what it is but it is still enjoyable to watch.

This purpose becomes even more complicated when Dvir has to deal the contrast between the Kibbutz's equality values and his mother's liberty and freedom to live as mentallyill person at the normative society and is about to change his adolescence and life.This flick was mastered and crafted by an accurate and sensitive direction powerful performances trembling soundtrack and phenomenal cinematography and it's well driven by its refined storyline.Dror Shaul portrayed a personal yet very resolute story of life in the Kibbutz before privatization alongside a strict emotionallyprecise comingofage tale for independence and dignity.Young actor Tomer Steinhof is the basis of this film. His performance is so minimalistic so moving and so convincing that he just tears apart the viewers hearts. This kid HAS to win worldwide recognition and must appear on as many films as possible. Beautiful Ronit Yudkevitz is another supportingpillar of the film with a wretched merciless portrait of a lapsed and helpless woman. Her physical and mental deterioration is absolutely heartrending. The chemistry between these two marvelous actors and the characters they hand over to the screen is very convincing and leads to many emotional refractions.The supporting actors do wonderful job as well Senior Belgique actor Henri Garcin shines on a 5minutes yet very important role as the foreign aging lover of Miri Shai Avivi with a role of the comicmoderator though a very malice person Gal Zaid as the controversial secretary of the Kibbutz And many more.Mixed with mesmerizing music and amazing cinematography this movie turns to be one of the best Israeli films of all times if not the best of them.I was truly affected by this piece of culture.".

Others saw it as a complete distortion of an Edenic wellintentioned if ultimately unsuccessful experiment. One thought it should not be shown to American audiences because it reflected badly on Israel. It is frankly an emotionally draining and heartwrenching story about a youngster Tomer Steinhof and his unstable mother Ronit Yudkevitz whose instability is seriously aggravated if not caused by the unforgiving atmosphere on the kibbutz. Depending on your perspective you might hate this film because it doesn't conform to your vision of kibbutz life. You may find it excessively unpleasant and dislike it for that reason. However though it is undeniably dark the movie is powerful wellacted and beautifully directed. It provoked a long discussion among members of the audience whom I saw it with.

	schema:reviewBody "Have just seen the European Premier of this film at the Berlin Film Festival where it deservedly won 1st prize in the 'Generation14k Plus' Section.The story is set in a Kibbutz in Israel where 12 year old Dvir Tomer Steinhof in his debut movie faces many trials as he is entering his bar mitzvah year. The most difficult one is coping with his mother Miri whom he loves above all else. She lives in a very fragile mental state and Dvir knows he must protect her from herself. A romance with a newly arrived Swiss visitor briefly raises her spirits but the romance is doomed to failure and Dvir must make the most difficult decision of his young life.The photography is stunning and the young actor who plays the lead gives an astonishing performance as the boy who loves his disturbed mother so deeply. The ending is truly heartbreaking yet strangely uplifting. I urge you to see this wonderful film if it comes to your part of the world and hope that a DVD release is not too far distant.".

	onyx:emotionText "Have just seen the European Premier of this film at the Berlin Film Festival where it deservedly won 1st prize in the 'Generation14k Plus' Section.The story is set in a Kibbutz in Israel where 12 year old Dvir Tomer Steinhof in his debut movie faces many trials as he is entering his bar mitzvah year. The most difficult one is coping with his mother Miri whom he loves above all else. She lives in a very fragile mental state and Dvir knows he must protect her from herself. A romance with a newly arrived Swiss visitor briefly raises her spirits but the romance is doomed to failure and Dvir must make the most difficult decision of his young life.The photography is stunning and the young actor who plays the lead gives an astonishing performance as the boy who loves his disturbed mother so deeply. The ending is truly heartbreaking yet strangely uplifting. I urge you to see this wonderful film if it comes to your part of the world and hope that a DVD release is not too far distant.";

The film is a stark examination of the social and cultural pressures operating within the closed community of the kibbutz collective. No doubt the response to the main character's illness both from the collective and from the individuals of the community receives harsh treatment here but I fail to see this as a global condemnation of Israeli society. The main characters unraveling and her family's attempts to deal with this are very well done and the treatment is sincere and thoughtful. It's hard to believe that the story takes place as recently as 1974.Hadn't we come farther than that by then?".

The movie sold out word must have gotten around and you could tell by the audience's reactions that everyone loved it. This film gives such a detailed view of life on a commune and at the same time it showed a young boy's struggle with his depressed single mother with plenty of comedic moments. I'm not much of a reviewer but I highly recommend seeing this film... it's playing again in Philadelphia this Tuesday at the Ritz Five for those of you who live in the area!".

	schema:headline " Tainted look at kibbutz life";
	schema:reviewBody "Tainted look at kibbutz lifeThis film is less a cultural story about a boy's life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. And it's all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim. Besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellevil. The story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz. Every charactersituation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc. For example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn't seen in a long time due to his military service he orders Quote  Linda go take shower and I cum in two minutes. There is one other good character in this movie  a European foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that's supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid. She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently can't escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone wasis always free to come and go as they choose. It's a mystery how the boy's father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. That's the gist of this movie. One dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience's head  that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didn't fit in. I feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs.".

The filmmakers have done such a fantastic job of bringing these women's life stories to 'life' on the big screen in a compelling and hysterical way. I found myself laughing uncontrollably at the situations these women find and get themselves into. But I was also really impressed at how I was able to relate to their lives and saw similarities to things in my own life. It's pretty amazing that no matter what your race gender or sexual preference there are moments and things we all go through. But no matter how poignant and real the story was the most important thing for me was how funny it was. Lacie and Robin's situations and stories are just FUNNY AS HELL and the scenes with Dom DeLuise and his assistant are some of the funniest moments I've seen in a movie theater in a long while. Not to give anything away but the scene with Robin and her mom played terrifically by Mink Stole was not only real and but absolutely hilarious. I was completely captivated and really loved this movie from start to finish. I can't wait til it comes out in theaters so I can see it again.".

I was completely captivated and really loved this movie from start to finish. I can't wait til it comes out in theaters so I can see it again.";

But when their eccentric stage director played to perfection by Dom Deluise insists at rehearsals that the two women experience one electrifying and vulnerable moment after another their chemistry has no place to go but up.For all kinds of reasons these two should not fall in love and yet we all know where this story is going. But we don't know what fresh unexpected and delightful trouble it will trigger nor whether these women will actually overcome their obstacles and make it  especially given Robin's terror at the mere possibility of hurting and disappointing her livein girlfriend. The fear takes her back to the dreadfilled moments that led to her coming out to her provincial mother flawlessly played by Mink Stole. And Lacie clings to her independence after she revisits her most recent unbearably awkward horrorshowdown breakup with a demisemisteady.The story unfolds beautifully mixing narrative and directaddress narration. Because the writing acting direction and editing are so incredibly deft this hybrid means of storytelling and storyshowing works beautifully. It reminds me of High Fidelity in that seamless way of mixing narrative direct address and flashbacks.Mink Stole and Dom Deloise might have stolen the movie had Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon not given such strong and appealing performances. Forgive the reductive Hollywoodese of this analysis but Robin Greenspan's hilarious neurotic practicality is youngWoodyAllen good and Lacie Harmon's hilarious wry cynicism is youngBruceWillis sexy!

	schema:reviewBody "Whoever the independent critic was who fawned over this flick and cracked on someone who panned it they obviously had relationship issues. No relationship hon??? From a guy point of view this movie is like a chick flick on Drano. Imagine all the elements of a whiny Joy Luck Club estrogenoverdose and then add in grating abrasive and utterly uninteresting griping directly into the camera no less about one's partner. There is a gratuitous girlongirl scene or two but the leads are mannish adult tomboys trying ohsodesperately to act and sound like streetcool arty types with bodies like limp tubesocks so any appeal from a strictly hedonistic perspective is devoid of any turnon.I will give it kudos for having the guts to be a bit more realistic in it's physical portrayal of lesbians. Unlike some lesbian films which are little more than softcore porn for gawking guys where the women are supermodels or Pam Anderson types the women in this movie reflect a more accurate image of the average lesbian. With the exception of one character the women in this film are of average or belowaverage looks bluecollar body types and clothing styles like an unmade bed. Mannerisms and body language are truer to form as well mostly devoid of feminine overtones.Unless you have a burning desire to see the irritating details of a lesbian relationship on the rocks skip this movie and watch Lost and Delirious instead. Though the women in Lost and Delirious aren't as realistically lesbian looking they're waaaaay easier on the eyes the story is much more interesting and actually quite touching and the characters are people you'll actually care about.".

It was like listening to proud parents talk about their gorgeous baby the one WE know looks like a frog for 80 minutes. The leads are irritating Robin constantly pouting delivers her lines as though she's performing a high school English oral whereas Lacy seems to lead with her huge jaw and drag her knuckles on the ground. The music and flashbacks are as cheesy as they get. The tellratherthanshow narration does not translate well from the stage but more importantly the characters do NOTHING to endear themselves to the viewer. I just didn't CARE. I kept watching only because I'd paid to rent the damn film but in hindsight that's 80 minutes of my life I can't get back. In short you know how your best friend spends two hours on the phone telling you without stopping for breaths just how greatandsplendidandgorgeousandneat her new girlfriend is? That's what this movie is like. Be warned.".

	schema:reviewBody "As in ZERO chance of crossing over to anyone who wasn't in the cast or crew of this arrogant little video that is completely full of itself. Most of the video consists of one of the two 'unfunnycomedians turned untalentedactresses' standing on a stage talking to an empty audience  a sign perhaps? and smirking at their own jokes. Robin Harmon and Lacy Greenspan's performances are so terrible that the poor editor often has to cut in the middle of WORDS. How can a person standing on a stage be that hard to videotape? This is basic stuff but vision less direction and bland acting make for an endless night of awkwardly paced and over edited monologues. It mostly feels like the movie is just complaining at you. Razzie winner Dom Deluise appears in it just long enough to show us why he can't get acting gigs. His scene was so obviously shot separate from everything else. It felt like he was just there to pay off some kind of favor.The whole mess looks like it's shot on home video and mostly sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine. The script is awful. When it isn't congratulating itself with annoying in jokes it takes tired  mostly offensive  pot shots at aggressive lesbians meddling Jewish women and swishy gay men. Welcome to the 21st century where just saying 'it's a lesbian movie' isn't enough. We lesbians want our movies to be about something. This might have been a minor accomplishment 20 years ago  minus the mean spirited antisemitic and homophobic stereotypes  but amateur director Lee Freelander is simply out of her league. She tries to stage dated clichs and pretends they're revolutionary. She REALLY pats herself on the back with the longest most boring sexless sex scene ever put on video. Lesbians have needs!We have amazing funny complex and powerful lesbianthemed indie films like 'Monster' 'DEBS' 'The Politics of Fur' and hit shows like 'The L Word' and 'Six Feet Under' so thank goodness we are no longer forced to put up with garbage like 'Girl Play.' This is easily the worst 'lesbian movie' ever made and I sat through 'Cat Woman' AVOID THIS VIDEO! Stay home and argue with your girlfriend for free.".

I also think he was a little influenced by 8 12 which had come out the year before appreciating Fellini's playfulness as well as his insight into the creative process and of course all these women.

	schema:reviewBody "This comedy most notable for being Bergman's first film in color is often considered one of his worst. I went into it with very low expectations glad that it was just 80 minutes long. Thankfully it's not nearly as bad as its reputation. It's minor Bergman for sure. It's main crime is that it thinks it's much funnier than it ever is. That can be annoying but really the film isn't exactly unfunny. Personally I think Bergman only did comedy right once with Smiles of a Summer Night and even that one I don't think is amongst his best work. Simply put Bergman excels at tragedy and his comedy can feel forced. This film revolves around an art critic Jarl Kulle Bergman's most mugging actor who comes to write a biography of a famous cellist at his palatial estate. The cellist whose face never appears on screen is a philanderer surrounding himself with women of various ages including Bibi Andersson Harriet Andersson and Eva Dahlbeck. Kulle starts a fling with Bibi Andersson and soon discovers that one of the wives or mistresses is attempting to murder the cellist. The Bergman film this reminds me most of is The Devil's Eye which also stars Kulle if I recall correctly that one is slightly less comic. The color cinematography is actually quite excellent. Bergman didn't film again in color until Cries and Whispers. This is available on Hulu Plus.".

Kulle was very effective and funny in Smiles... in Women...  he plays an irritating annoying and the worst  absolutely not funny which is a crime for a comedy character. If in Smiles... the writing was a first class and sparkled I got the impression that in Women..

Unfortunately it's awkward and not funny in the slightest. The film is also rather ugly with simple sets fading color and 'bawdy' scenes shot so poorly they're unappealing.You can read allegory into the artist who gets lost amidst everything surrounding him as indeed we never see the face of the master cellist. Instead we see his mansion and all of the zaniness that takes place in it the women who surround him and fight over him and a critic who wishes to write his biography and pressures him to use his arrangements. The critic warms him that one day he will be forgotten as another will come along. That's the main point of this farce but it's too buried in silliness. I revere Bergman but have to call this for what it is awful. If you want to watch a 'lighter' Bergman movie I would recommend A Lesson in Love 1954 instead which was excellent.".

He doesn't know how to tell a story.'Chocolate' is the worst remake of 'Usual Suspects' which was a success at the boxoffice and was declared a classic. I would recommend that you rather borrow the DVD of 'Usual Suspects' instead.";

When there was a buzz about Chocolate during the build up and ever since we heard about the movie i expected something else but as it turns out it's a rehash of the 1995 Hollywood flick. I am OKAY with adaptations and inspirations but what irks me is that they don't even acknowledge the supposed adaptation. Come to think of it there's no adaptation here it's plain lifting. The end comes as no surprise to anyone who's seen the original. I was also reading Mr. Taran Adarsh's review and believe it or not even he seemed to like the idea of adapting he adapted from James Berardinelli's review of The Usual Suspects! The movie borrows from dozens of sources  Hitchcock Scorsese the Coen brothers and just about every master of the genre past or present. Check this line out in James' review of the original.I wont comment on the dialogues and screenplay since there's nothing new here. Anil Kapoor as the egoistic lawyer was over the top a few times and his voiceover kind of sounded affected  With every case i became smart smarter smartest...cheesy . Irrfan was expectedly the best among the lot and makes the movie watchable if only because of his presence.He easily overshadows Anil in their confrontation scenes. His glowering eyes and perfectly restrained performance is a treat to watch. Here's an actor i'll go miles to watch. Arshad Warsi does good in the limited scope that he has. The rest of the cast are alright.At the end of it Chocolate is not an effort worthy of appreciation.".

Anil Kapoor went overboard on some occasions and there were some funny oneliners but nothing which would make you look beyond the lying cheating and stealing The Movie Idea that is. People always complain about the lack of originality in Bollywood nowadays. there isn't a paucity of ideas but due to directors like these.

Sushma Reddy can't act that is certain. Tanushree Dutta may be the obligatory pretty face in Indian movies but she tries hard to give some twist to the story line and her relationship with Irfan Khan. Cinematography is quite refreshing for an Indian film and is homage to the original. Some of the plot lines are weak and lack credibility but the pace and continuity of the film certainly keeps you guessing.

This could have been a decent remake but the stories do not gel the acting is horrible the songs make you vomit I am a shot of tequila but don't tell my mommywhat class and the dialogue is some of the most ridiculous to come out of Bollywood. Should be called Boom Part 2. The problem here is one that Bollywood makes time and time again try to copy the new western films while trying to put Indian elements in it. Another problem is you try to show that Western ideas only equate to Taliban and and sex and that does not make a film. Bollywood should stick to the old formula of film naivet a la the 70's and late 80's films and not try to be the next RodriguezTarantinoSinger.".

	onyx:emotionText "Pure trash. That about sums it up. Essentially this is The Usual Suspects done by Bollywood while trying to do a halfbaked Tarantino dialogue. This could have been a decent remake but the stories do not gel the acting is horrible the songs make you vomit I am a shot of tequila but don't tell my mommywhat class and the dialogue is some of the most ridiculous to come out of Bollywood. Should be called Boom Part 2. The problem here is one that Bollywood makes time and time again try to copy the new western films while trying to put Indian elements in it. Another problem is you try to show that Western ideas only equate to Taliban and and sex and that does not make a film. Bollywood should stick to the old formula of film naivet a la the 70's and late 80's films and not try to be the next RodriguezTarantinoSinger.";

It's a great thriller with a heartstopping ending. Anil Kapoor stars in a different role but hams in parts. Arshad Warsi is as usual a delight. Emraan Hashmi Irfan Khan Suniel Shetty Sushma Reddy debutante put in good efforts. The only letdown is Tanushree Dutta who in the absence of acting skills allows her cleavage to do all the talking.

There are numerous sick idiotic references to woman and sex which reminds you of those regressive lines an imaginative dialog writer called Milap Zaveri pens every time for Sanjay Gupta films. Any positive factor oh yes UK is shot quite well and just the picture quality not cinematography is such that the colors sharpness everything matches to a Hollywood film visuals which is an achievement if you call so. Finally What did the slug line of film Deep dark Secrets means? Answer lies in probably a line in song of the film  Mummy ko nahi hai pata. Mummy se na kehna what a strange stuff you have seen!".

It's one of the worse things to come out of Bollywood in recent years yet it still boast a stellar cast and with what at first seemed to be a promising storyline. Tanurshee Dutta appearing in her second film with Emran Hashmi plays a prostitute named Simran Chopra and let me just tell you this the director spares not expense is objectifying her. From her skimpy clothes in freezing London weather to sleeping around with everybody under the sun to sleazy dance numbers and indoor rain scenes I'm sure guys would have not been bored watching this film. There's even a scene in which she attempts to pull a SHARON STONE A LA BASIC INSTINCT LEG UNCROSSING SCENE to reveal a tattoo on her inner thigh it was so drastic. Poor girl all the time they were making her seduce Anil Kapoor's character a man more than twice her age and Suniel Shetty I just kept wondering if that sort of nonsense would have happened to the ones in Bollywood with Filmi Backgrounds. Ms. Dutta endured a lot all in the name of fame in this film. Poor poor girl indeed.Oh! and what's with the extras with funny accents? Bollywood needs to stop this nonsense! When you're in London get extras with authentic accents not bad actors with weird inapplicable accents for instance the judge's accent was just too weird to handle there is no way that she could be a judge in the British judicial system. Oh! and let's not talk about the Mafia's accents the cops and the street beggars! The best acting I have seen by an extra in any Bollywoof film is probably Emma Bunton who plays Anna Anil Kapoor's secretary and very well. The former spice girl may just have found her calling in Bollywood films as I understand this isn't the only film she has appeared in.There was another thing that bothered me with this film and it has to do with the scene in the underground parking lot with a woman her child and their car. Is it at all believable that the woman would have entered the car started the engine shut the door and be ready to drive off while her little daughter was still playing with a ball outside of the car??? Come on Bollywood! I fell down laughing and crying when I saw that scene! And do not get me started on the songs in the film there's only one good one entitled 'Mummy Ko Nahin' and performed very well by Simran Dutta's character. The worse song in the film is by far 'Jhuki Jhuki' performed by the worst and sluttiest looking item girl I have ever seen. My four star rating of the film are split between Emma Bunton's performance in the movie and Tanushree Dutta's performance on 'Mummy Ko Nahi' I would have otherwise given the film an awful rating. Irfan Khan's talent is hopeless wasted in the movie.".

It's one of the worse things to come out of Bollywood in recent years yet it still boast a stellar cast and with what at first seemed to be a promising storyline. Tanurshee Dutta appearing in her second film with Emran Hashmi plays a prostitute named Simran Chopra and let me just tell you this the director spares not expense is objectifying her. From her skimpy clothes in freezing London weather to sleeping around with everybody under the sun to sleazy dance numbers and indoor rain scenes I'm sure guys would have not been bored watching this film. There's even a scene in which she attempts to pull a SHARON STONE A LA BASIC INSTINCT LEG UNCROSSING SCENE to reveal a tattoo on her inner thigh it was so drastic.

This movie is about 3 high school seniors who want to go to Tijuana in search of sex without their parents knowing it and things don't work out the way they want it as Dave's little brother Wendell 'Wimp' John Navin goes along for the ride and later they shoplift a grocery store and the owner's wife goes with them cause she claims that she's gonna divorce him and she finds out that they stoled some items at the grocery store but she didn't care the situations that the boys got themselves in Tijuana are hilarious and they later meet crooked cops insane marine sailors and junkyard ruffians will they get out of Tijuana alive will the three boys lose their virginity in order to find out watch this movie and it's way better than the movies of today I think that Losin' It deserves more recognition than what it gets cause it's a funny movie and if you can find this movie at your local video store rent it and have a good laugh it's a great way to spend a weekend evening.".

This movie is about 3 high school seniors who want to go to Tijuana in search of sex without their parents knowing it and things don't work out the way they want it as Dave's little brother Wendell 'Wimp' John Navin goes along for the ride and later they shoplift a grocery store and the owner's wife goes with them cause she claims that she's gonna divorce him and she finds out that they stoled some items at the grocery store but she didn't care the situations that the boys got themselves in Tijuana are hilarious and they later meet crooked cops insane marine sailors and junkyard ruffians will they get out of Tijuana alive will the three boys lose their virginity in order to find out watch this movie and it's way better than the movies of today I think that Losin' It deserves more recognition than what it gets cause it's a funny movie and if you can find this movie at your local video store rent it and have a good laugh it's a great way to spend a weekend evening.";

For the record the other three films were Ghoulies Missing in Action and Ninja III  The Domination.I would say that Losin' It is probably the best of these four films  not that that's really saying very much. It was the concluding feature of a very long night of cinematic mediocrity . It's not an awful film particularly compared with some of the other components of this multiple feature and it has the advantage of having been put together by a crew who knew what they were doing. Rather it's an assembly line teen film of the period which is given somewhat more polish than usual by the presence of Shelley Long and the upandcoming Tom Cruise in the cast.Two years previously in 1981 Porky's established a profitable template for teen films that many producers are still exploiting today. I see Losin' It as a Porky's knockoff from a similar time and aimed at a similar audience. Essentially if you were part of that target audience you would probably have enjoyed it. I was just passing out of the target demographic when I saw this so perhaps I'm more blas about it than I might have been if I had seen it a few years earlier. There's a whole genre of teen sex comedy which tries to tease the audience while dancing around the fact that they can't really show very much that loses a lot of its impact once you've actually lost it yourself.".

It didn't quite work out the way he expected at least not right away. Cruise fan or not it's worth a look. For me Jackie pretty much steals every scene he's in. Anytime I watch this movie I have to laugh at Tom Cruise because he ended up becoming one of the biggest stars in the movie world and he started out in this. If you REALLY want to see Cruise in another light check out Endless Love with Brooke Shields. It's his first movie and though he's in it for less than a minute it's worth a look just like Losin' It.

Bad enough that this turkey wastes the talents of future stars Tom Cruise and Shelley Long.  What's worse is that this was directed by Curtis Hanson you know of L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys fame  THAT Curtis Hanson.  I realize he was just an upandcoming director at the time but surely he must have taken one look at the script and realized it didn't have a chance.  Maybe he was gambling this film would be another Porky's and skyrocket him to fame.  He gambled wrong.Even if you're a diehard Cruise fan you're advised to stay away. Cruise at this time had yet to hone the persona upon which he would build his career.  In other words he isn't his usually funny cocky self this time around but instead comes across as bland dull and surprisingly lifeless. Shelley Long on the other hand is quite good in her thankless role as a runaway bride headed to Tijuana for a quickie divorce.  Too bad the script doesn't give her anything funny to do.Also since this is a teen sex comedy I should mention that there's almost no raunch and nudity at all.  Basically this film is ninety minutes of three teenaged jerks raising havoc in T.J. getting into lots of dumb bar fights and a few car chases with the usual Hollywood Mexican stereotypes.Bottom line compared to this film Top Gun which also starred Cruise and John Stockwell is deserving of ten Academy awards.".

Cruise Jackie Earle Haley and John Stockwell are three high school kids from the Eisenhower years who are looking to have a good time in Tijuana. Unfortunately they can't make the trip without John P. Navin who is Stockwell's brother because Stockwell came up short of cash.Along the way the three of them pick up Shelley Long who is a young married who runs a convenient store on the way with her husband. Our three heroes just happen on her store when she's having a knockdown dragout with her husband culminating in Long walking out on her husband to hitching a ride to Tijuana to get a quickie Mexican divorce.The rest of the film is about their adventures in Tijuana and their escape from there. I do say escape because Stockwell and Haley get into some serious trouble down there in separate incidents. They manage to get some marines on liberty down there mad at them and they fall into the hands of a crooked Tijuana cop played by Henry Darrow who really likes jamming up young Yanqui snot nose kids.Cruise has an adventure of a different sort with Shelley Long in her preCheers days. He's the only one who gets some enjoyment from Tijuana.If there's a moral here there's two of them. First there's no such thing as Spanish fly and second Tijuana is not a good place if you don't know the ropes.After this Tom Cruise did Risky Business which cemented him as a teen idol and after that All the Right Moves which proved he was not only a box office draw but a very capable actor.As for Losin' It it's an average teen sex comedy without the presence of Tom Cruise would barely be remembered.".

For an hour or so the movie plays as just a kind of bland look at jerks who want to pay for sex. There's no chemistry between Shelly Long and Tom Cruise and Jackie Earl Haley is really annoying. But then something happens at the end and the movie manages to salvage everything with a decent little ending car chase sequence that manages to tie it all up in a nice way. It can't be a raunch classic because there wasn't enough nudity or hijinks but as a historical curiosity I guess you could do worse.".

Consider Johnny Depp in Private Resort and Tom Hanks in Bachelor Party. Oh and Tim Robbins in Fraternity Vacation and Kevin Bacon in Animal House. Rarer is a director who would go onto bigger and better things which is what we have here. Curtis Hanson won hearts and minds over ten years after this film about teenagers trying to lose their virginity when he made LA Confidential and later 8 Mile. Losin' It is a lot better made than the majority of teen sex movies but that is not saying a whole lot. Most of them were clearly turned out as quickly and cheaply as possible it was not uncommon for the boom mic to make several uncredited appearances in these movies and the lack of budget showed in other ways like very few inner location shots the characters may be in high school or college but we'd rarely see the inside of a classroom. So while Losin' It has a much better director better actors and a better budget... it really doesn't have that much going for it. There's the usual fast talking utterly sex and Frank Sinatra obsessed teen played by Jackie Earle Haley and the also usual shy more sensitive teen played by Tom Cruise. There's also the sullen and aggressive Spider played by John Stockwell and Haley's mercenary younger brother who joins them on their trip to Tijuana to buy illegal firecrackers he can sell across the border.They get into the usual hijinks involving hookers cops and trying to hit on the wrong girls. There's also an older woman who comes along for the ride to get divorced  can you guess which of the guys mentioned above she falls for?I wasn't that interested in the exploits of these characters clichd and simplistic as they were past the halfway mark but at least they spent time on the inside of buildings other than the director's house and the boom mic didn't keep mugging for attention.".

But the plot line for this movie has been wore down the fact that guys in high school staged during the 1950s to 1960s want to go lose their virginities is an old story. This movie reminds me of Porky's it has the exact same story line. There is that one guy who is dying to have sex with anyone right now there is the hot headed one that starts all the fights and the nice sweet one who is a gentleman and gets the nice girl. Also I think this movie is rated wrong it could have easily been a PG13 movie because throughout the whole movie the F word was said maybe three times the only reason its was rated R is because of the nudity is what exactly like Porky's had. But its a 1980s movie its rated R its a comedy its bound to be stupidly funny all 80s are.But overall everything this is an amusing movie and after watching it if you are old enough to understand its a feel good movie. YOu laugh a lot because of all the high jinks and problems that these guys go through is more entertaining than Porky's or any other film related to the plot.".

It's amazing though not surprising how Citti can keep your attention up without ever leaving the casotto.. I'm actually surprised that people found it boring. I was planning to see the beginning of it and go out but I just could not stop until the end. You follow a few parallel stories from a fixed point of view sort of similar to Scola's La cena but kind of lighter even though I wouldn't call this a comedy. It is a bit surrealistic but in a very realistic and convincing way. It features a lot of the best actors of the time including Tognazzi Melato Proietti Stoppa. So what's wrong with you guys? Reading comments to Italian movies I sometimes have the sensation that the few Americans interested in Italian movies are just looking for the sleazy details and completely miss or misunderstand all the rest. There's a lot more to Italian movies than sleaze. If you willingly watch one and don't get it before firing up low votes and negative comments please consider the possibility that well yes maybe something was lost in translation.. and it might not just be the lines but also the tone accents gestures dressing codes cultural social and historical background... For example the attitude of the two girls hanging around with two guys and hoping they will get food for free might sound unlikely in a Sex and the city episode but looks perfectly natural in the Rome of the seventies. Most Italian directors put no effort in making their products available to foreigners and even when they do you still see a different movie if you're from here. Just don't blame it on the movie!".

My Italian is very sketchy but the tone and gestures of the players make it less of a hindrance than I expected. Also it's how we naturally learn a language by inference so with more viewings the film is better understood and is worth the extra effort.Even with the grainy picture the slightly jittery framing and colour washing in and out in some sequences the film is engaging. I became fascinated with who is next going to come into the casotto and how their lives would intersect. It's a colourful pageant of living textures. People watching on an intimate level. Since it almost all takes place within the walls we almost become the casotto. All the players arrive separately but their lives soon become variously enmeshed and some will change forever.The singsong intonation of Italian is one of the things that makes the language lyrically charming and easy on the ear plus I prefer films in their original language to read subtitles rather than hear someone in a soundbooth mangling the original script and soundtrack whilst their character's lips move outofsync. Disappointingly Jodie Foster the uptheduff granddaughter honeytrap was dubbed and with exactly the wrong kind of voice. She appeared to be speaking her lines in Italian and Foster has a gift for languages. I can't imagine her lines were so bad that they had to be dubbed.Filmmaking was different in the 1970's and this kind of Italian cinema may be hard to understand or follow for other audiences. Modern viewers should put aside their unrealistically highexpectations if they want to find this film accessible. If you like to see films that despite appearances have been thought out and want to follow the construction this is a good place to start.".

I can guarantee that there is no film out there that's even especially similar to My Winnipeg in style or content even if Maddin's current style is essentially a pastiche of a particular sort of silent film there are none that are edited in the same way or used to quite the same effect as Maddin's films are. At least none that I have seen as Maddin is not imitating anyone but making films in a style that is not used anymore and had he been making films in the 1920's he might have been considered an innovator. My Winnipeg is a film I wish I was clever enough to make about any of the cities I've lived in and fallen in love with and is original enough to captivating but is also astonishingly clever and witty and funny and entertaining.I was actually not a big fan of Maddin's last film Brand Upon the Brain! a pleasant enough film but ultimately of no real worth or substance merely a visually interesting retread of themes Maddin fans are familiar with. It was certainly a far cry from some of his better work Archangel and Careful being my favorites. Maddin is certainly one of my favorite Canadian directors and one of our few genuine auteurs whose work is actually accessible and available relatively easily but there's always been an issue with his films even his better work the issue being that his films often feel rather insubstantial. Like the bizarre and amusing experiments of an eccentric than anything of real value although obviously that is debatable. I always enjoy a Guy Maddin film but I think My Winnipeg is the first of his which struck me as truly passionate or exceptional with regard to its content.My Winnipeg tells you everything you need to know about it in the title. This is Guy Maddin's lovehate letter to his home town of Winnipeg Manitoba and it's really about HIS Winnipeg and it's the sort of personal thing that could have so easily been a bore but Guy Maddin is so interesting that his own perception of Winnipeg is enough to sustain this 80 minute film. It flies by leaving the viewer in an appreciative daze by the end appreciative of the remarkable sense of humor in the film the wit the cleverness of the narrative and a real sense of Maddin's love and passion for Winnipeg. This film has everything that is appealing about Maddin's work as well as a new richness that he'd never quite found before. It's an oddly inspiring film gorgeous to look at and rather unexpectedly the funniest film I've seen from 2008 as well.".

	schema:headline " A haunting humorous and wholly wondrous dream of a documentary.";
	schema:reviewBody "You could say that Guy Maddin makes films for the dreamers.No other filmmaker alive puts so much effort into chipping away at the audience's sense of logic and running them through a grinder of their own twisted subconscious.Beginning with his feature debut Tales from the Gimli Hospital in 1988 Maddin has remained furiously independent the closest he's ever come to mainstream success being 2003's The Saddest Music in the World which acted as a kindof holy grail for film buffs and those obsessed with the days of cinema past. My Winnipeg may be the purest distillation of his unique aesthetic vision to date almost surely because it's paradoxically the most personal and fantastical.In essence the film is a loveletter to Maddin's hometown of Winnipeg Manitoba. It's a rueful loveletter though because the film opens with the director hurriedly explaining that he needs to has to leave forever. But he can't bring himself to do it. The solution? He'll hire actors to recreate scenes from his childhood in a desperate attempt to attain some obscure kind of closure. In a fabulously inventive instance of casting Bmovie veteran Ann Savage Edward G. Ulmer's Detour plays his real mom playing herself.Maddin augments the often hilarious filmwithinafilm with bizarre facts about Winnipeg like how it has the 10 times the sleepwalking rate of any other city or that Maddin himself was born in the locker room of the local hockey arena only to return three days later as a newborn to attend his first game. These halftruths attain a kindof mythic status when combined with Maddin's haunting visuals that like most of his filmography harken back to the choppy rapidfire pace of German expressionism and the heartonsleeve emotion of '40s and '50s melodrama.It shouldn't be surprising how funny My Winnipeg is considering that Maddin might be the most unpretentious avantgarde filmmaker of alltime. His casual matteroffact narration blends perfectly with the film's stark poetic images making the many leaps of fancy that much more potent. When he describes a secret taxi company that operates only on Winnipeg's darkened back streets or ruminates on the beauty of snow fossils caused by plodding winter footsteps it's downright impossible not to be overcome with feelings of deep nostalgia and wonder.Maddin has made fauxbiographical films before 2006's Brand Upon the Brain the most notorious example but with My Winnipeg it feels like he's finally letting us in. Of course it's just as likely that he's putting us on and if he is it's one of the most staggeringly beautiful con games ever committed to celluloid.".

	onyx:emotionText "You could say that Guy Maddin makes films for the dreamers.No other filmmaker alive puts so much effort into chipping away at the audience's sense of logic and running them through a grinder of their own twisted subconscious.Beginning with his feature debut Tales from the Gimli Hospital in 1988 Maddin has remained furiously independent the closest he's ever come to mainstream success being 2003's The Saddest Music in the World which acted as a kindof holy grail for film buffs and those obsessed with the days of cinema past. My Winnipeg may be the purest distillation of his unique aesthetic vision to date almost surely because it's paradoxically the most personal and fantastical.In essence the film is a loveletter to Maddin's hometown of Winnipeg Manitoba. It's a rueful loveletter though because the film opens with the director hurriedly explaining that he needs to has to leave forever. But he can't bring himself to do it. The solution? He'll hire actors to recreate scenes from his childhood in a desperate attempt to attain some obscure kind of closure. In a fabulously inventive instance of casting Bmovie veteran Ann Savage Edward G. Ulmer's Detour plays his real mom playing herself.Maddin augments the often hilarious filmwithinafilm with bizarre facts about Winnipeg like how it has the 10 times the sleepwalking rate of any other city or that Maddin himself was born in the locker room of the local hockey arena only to return three days later as a newborn to attend his first game. These halftruths attain a kindof mythic status when combined with Maddin's haunting visuals that like most of his filmography harken back to the choppy rapidfire pace of German expressionism and the heartonsleeve emotion of '40s and '50s melodrama.It shouldn't be surprising how funny My Winnipeg is considering that Maddin might be the most unpretentious avantgarde filmmaker of alltime. His casual matteroffact narration blends perfectly with the film's stark poetic images making the many leaps of fancy that much more potent. When he describes a secret taxi company that operates only on Winnipeg's darkened back streets or ruminates on the beauty of snow fossils caused by plodding winter footsteps it's downright impossible not to be overcome with feelings of deep nostalgia and wonder.Maddin has made fauxbiographical films before 2006's Brand Upon the Brain the most notorious example but with My Winnipeg it feels like he's finally letting us in. Of course it's just as likely that he's putting us on and if he is it's one of the most staggeringly beautiful con games ever committed to celluloid.";

It reminded me of the words of a Portugese man on TV when describing the Carnation Revolution of 1974 where armed forces were conquered by ordinary people wielding carnations he called it a giant national orgasm. My Winnipeg is Guy Maddin's heart nailed to the screen as fiercely courageous a movie as you will ever see.There are blue truths in the film we're not spared his mother's genitalia or fever dreams of childhood sexuality. Here are some quotations from interviews Maddin gave for this film just so you know what you will be seeing Children are sexual beings just think of your own childhood. In my case I was far more sexual as a child than I am now Nothing bothers me more than a movie about the innocence of children! What are they innocent of? They might be innocent of murder but that's about it! Children haven't learned to repress yet or anything like that. They're just teeming with wonderful luridity from very early on! There is something universal about the film Maddin incants a litany of opprobrium and indignity that the city of Winnipeg has suffered from the demolition of an iconic department store to the closure of two underground swimming pools and the hockey stadia. Modern history is written in the rictus of the agonised city exposed to modernity. Many cities have undergone such outrages my own city lost it's old centre to Nazi bombing a fragile heart torn out. The swimming pools of Maddin's memories are lustful pits at street level families swim down one tier the girl's practice mouth to mouth resuscitation on one another and on the bottom level the boys cavort naked in the changing rooms.The film transcends documentary even fantastical documentary into mysticism. Maddin uses the imagery of horses as have many great artists from Raphael to Gericault to Marc to Parajanov. We see Golden Boy parades a Masonic town hall and the two forks under the forks the mysterious underground rivers that feed the mons veneris on which Winnipeg nestles.My personal favourite scene was Lorette Avenue where we are show a hermaphrodite street where on one side the street has houses facing front and on the other side the backs of houses. Noone talks about Lorette Avenue Previously Maddin had made distinctions between alleys where the backs of houses only can be scene and streets where we only see the fronts of houses.I won't spoil the ending for you you have yet to see the wonder of Citizen Girl! Do not waver or hesitate make ye to the cinema! Maddin has now taken the step from being a beloved cult director to being a great auteur. Vive le Cinema! Vive la Rsistance Culturelle!".

	schema:reviewBody "Guy Maddin described My Winnipeg as 'docutasia' and that's probably more accurate than any other description I could give of it. The film is a very personal lighthearted but informative look at Winnipeg through the eyes of her native son Guy Maddin. The film is shot in black and white combining stock archival footage including private home videos with some new freshly shot material. The film follows a young Guy Maddin played by Darcy Fehr on a train trying to escape from 'sleepy snowing Winnipeg' and its mystic pull. To affect his escape Maddin must through the course of the film come to terms with everything that binds him to the city family home community and history. Held together by the barest narrative thread the film is most like Berlin Symphony of a Great City though being Canadian it's much funnier and selfdeprecating. The film is narrated by Guy Maddin himself and despite the fact that he seemed to have many reservations about using his own voice he does a great job ranging from the fiery sermon of charged propagandist to the soft relaxing repetition of an experienced hypnotist. Made for the documentary channel with a TV audience in mind the film is accessible enough for anyone and funny enough to make even Winnipeg charming. While I don't know if it's feature film material definitely watch if you can catch it on the tube.".

It accentuates the winter's bitter cold the days gone by some of the images are amazing and what the city meant and means to Mr. Maddin. This film is not for everyone. It is in black and white and grainy. At first I wasn't sure if this was a mockumentary but even though the narrator laments the passing of people and places I was wondering if the whole point was to explain why people don't leave. Sure its no Toronto Montreal or Vancouver you get the idea but its a medium size city that thrives. I have seen Mr. Maddin's Saddest Music In The World so I know I was expecting something different. Maybe you have no interest in Winnipeg or can even find it on a map! but that doesn't detract from the narrative. An added bonus is Ann Savage playing the narrator's mother. Wow she is in her mid 80's and she agreed to do this role. I don't expect mass agreement here but if you were commissioned to do a film about your hometown I'm not sure how different your film would be than this especially if you life in a city thats cold in the winter. I'm waiting for My Buffalo or My Fargo. For now I'm quite content with this film that moved me and even taught me about the city. A great left of center cinematic achievement.".

	schema:headline " Love Me Love My Winnipeg";
	schema:reviewBody "Winnipeg is to Guy Maddin as Baltimore is to John Waters. It's very unfashionability is its inspiration. But where Waters dwells on hairspray and bouffant dresses and twisted vowels Maddin describes Winnipeg as a place of perpetual snow destroyed hockey rinks and sleepwalkers. Winnipeg Winnipeg Winnipeg Winnipeg.... he begins his incessant voiceover as the first of his typically distressed nostalgic black and white images in square format appear showing longago men and women walking in snowcovered streets and a man dozing in a train car whose big window is like a movie screen showing figures and the big face of his mother. Sometimes blurry phrases flicker onto the screen echoing his words like a refrain.The man Darcy Fehr is meant to be himself getting out of town. I've got to leave it I've got to leave it he chants and then speculates that maybe he can film his way out of Winnipeg putting all his past on celluloid and thereby ridding himself of its fascination so he can move elsewhere.For this poem and rant about his native city which he says he wants to leave and can't Maddin hired actors to play his mother and some of his siblings and borrowed his girlfriend's pug to stand in for the childhood chihuahua. He leased their old house and moved the old furniture or facsimiles into it distributing a runner carpet and shabby couches in the living room and an old TV. His mother is played by veteran Bpicture vixen Ann Savage. Black and white images of what purports to be his real family back in the Fifties flash on the screen alternating with their hired lookalikes as Maddin spins arcane anecdotes about his childhood and drops in the occasional fact. An old department store and a restaurant that served orange jello figure prominently as does the dynamiting of a treasured tree and a hockey arena. If there is a logic to this quirky ramble it's as sui generis as you can get.We don't come away with a sense of Maddin's actual past because all his anecdotes seem highly embroidered like his mother's grabbing some friends' 75yearold myna birdwhich ran free in the house and had a large vocabularyand smashing it to the floor because she was afraid of birds. Or the family threatening their mother with a parakeet to make her get out of bed and cook them a meatloaf. Or the team of ancient hockey stars all suited up one known to be dead his face all covered in bandages playing in a halfdestroyed arena while Maddin sings their praises and curses the establishment of the NHL which he regards as the beginning of the end. He says his father was a hockey executive and he grew up in the locker roomwas even born in the dressing room of the Winnipeg Maroons. According to him Winnipeg has a secret network of back streets that parallels the main ones and to pacify two rival taxi companies one was allowed to ride only on the main streets and the other only on the back alleys where the ride over the snow is cushiony. The city he invents has an annual If Day when the town is invaded by mock Nazis who rename it Himmlerstadt. A racetrack fire disaster caused a dozen horses to become buried in the earth with just their giant heads out of the snow in attitudes of agony. People come later to visit and picnic. In the family living room they watch a show called Ledge Man every day it's run for fifty years in every episode of which the actress playing Maddin's mother talks the actor playing Maddin out of jumping from a ledge to his death.Maddin calls this film done for the Documentary Channel a docufantasia and that's what it issort of. It's hard to pin a genre to his filmmaking and this one is also an imaginary autobiography. He depicts himself living in an insular snowglobe parallel universe sometimes fake slant lines of white snow are superimposed on sceneslike the parallel system of back streets. The voiceover is a kind of crotchety incantation Maddin has said this could be called A SelfDestructive Sulk. What entertains in its fey and offbeat way is the man's humorous detachment what appeals is the sense of a cozy faroff snowedin world whose present is so remote it's like its past a town that isn't very old but seems as if it is. For all the detail about growing up in a hairdressing establishment lying in the living room with the family watching TV being trapped in an indoor swimming pool complex on three levels among naked boys with hairless boners who refuse to swim there's no sense of personal revelation at all any more than in Dylan Thomas' A Child's Christmas in Wales. And in his interweaving of the invented and the real the contemporary and the archival in flickering dreamlike images this movie has the power to enchant.But also to numb. If Winnipeggers are sleepwalkers the viewers of 'My Winnipeg' may at moments become sleepsitters. And yet for a filmmaker so obviously withdrawn and secretive this is his most autobiographical and perhaps most accessible and appealing work so far. Amusing elegant inconsequential and it doesn't overstay its limited welcome a London critic writes. I guess that's fair.".

	onyx:emotionText "Winnipeg is to Guy Maddin as Baltimore is to John Waters. It's very unfashionability is its inspiration. But where Waters dwells on hairspray and bouffant dresses and twisted vowels Maddin describes Winnipeg as a place of perpetual snow destroyed hockey rinks and sleepwalkers. Winnipeg Winnipeg Winnipeg Winnipeg.... he begins his incessant voiceover as the first of his typically distressed nostalgic black and white images in square format appear showing longago men and women walking in snowcovered streets and a man dozing in a train car whose big window is like a movie screen showing figures and the big face of his mother. Sometimes blurry phrases flicker onto the screen echoing his words like a refrain.The man Darcy Fehr is meant to be himself getting out of town. I've got to leave it I've got to leave it he chants and then speculates that maybe he can film his way out of Winnipeg putting all his past on celluloid and thereby ridding himself of its fascination so he can move elsewhere.For this poem and rant about his native city which he says he wants to leave and can't Maddin hired actors to play his mother and some of his siblings and borrowed his girlfriend's pug to stand in for the childhood chihuahua. He leased their old house and moved the old furniture or facsimiles into it distributing a runner carpet and shabby couches in the living room and an old TV. His mother is played by veteran Bpicture vixen Ann Savage. Black and white images of what purports to be his real family back in the Fifties flash on the screen alternating with their hired lookalikes as Maddin spins arcane anecdotes about his childhood and drops in the occasional fact. An old department store and a restaurant that served orange jello figure prominently as does the dynamiting of a treasured tree and a hockey arena. If there is a logic to this quirky ramble it's as sui generis as you can get.We don't come away with a sense of Maddin's actual past because all his anecdotes seem highly embroidered like his mother's grabbing some friends' 75yearold myna birdwhich ran free in the house and had a large vocabularyand smashing it to the floor because she was afraid of birds. Or the family threatening their mother with a parakeet to make her get out of bed and cook them a meatloaf. Or the team of ancient hockey stars all suited up one known to be dead his face all covered in bandages playing in a halfdestroyed arena while Maddin sings their praises and curses the establishment of the NHL which he regards as the beginning of the end. He says his father was a hockey executive and he grew up in the locker roomwas even born in the dressing room of the Winnipeg Maroons. According to him Winnipeg has a secret network of back streets that parallels the main ones and to pacify two rival taxi companies one was allowed to ride only on the main streets and the other only on the back alleys where the ride over the snow is cushiony. The city he invents has an annual If Day when the town is invaded by mock Nazis who rename it Himmlerstadt. A racetrack fire disaster caused a dozen horses to become buried in the earth with just their giant heads out of the snow in attitudes of agony. People come later to visit and picnic. In the family living room they watch a show called Ledge Man every day it's run for fifty years in every episode of which the actress playing Maddin's mother talks the actor playing Maddin out of jumping from a ledge to his death.Maddin calls this film done for the Documentary Channel a docufantasia and that's what it issort of. It's hard to pin a genre to his filmmaking and this one is also an imaginary autobiography. He depicts himself living in an insular snowglobe parallel universe sometimes fake slant lines of white snow are superimposed on sceneslike the parallel system of back streets. The voiceover is a kind of crotchety incantation Maddin has said this could be called A SelfDestructive Sulk. What entertains in its fey and offbeat way is the man's humorous detachment what appeals is the sense of a cozy faroff snowedin world whose present is so remote it's like its past a town that isn't very old but seems as if it is. For all the detail about growing up in a hairdressing establishment lying in the living room with the family watching TV being trapped in an indoor swimming pool complex on three levels among naked boys with hairless boners who refuse to swim there's no sense of personal revelation at all any more than in Dylan Thomas' A Child's Christmas in Wales. And in his interweaving of the invented and the real the contemporary and the archival in flickering dreamlike images this movie has the power to enchant.But also to numb. If Winnipeggers are sleepwalkers the viewers of 'My Winnipeg' may at moments become sleepsitters. And yet for a filmmaker so obviously withdrawn and secretive this is his most autobiographical and perhaps most accessible and appealing work so far. Amusing elegant inconsequential and it doesn't overstay its limited welcome a London critic writes. I guess that's fair.";

It mostly focuses on his relationship with the city but it also includes reenactments of his family life and famous weird things that happened in the city's past. It's a bit of a mess but as I've said before regarding Maddin his films play out like dreams. A mess makes sense a lot of the time. I do think the film lacks the focus of his best work and is in fact my least favorite of his features. Also contributing to my relatively low opinion of it i.e. I don't think it's one of the best movies ever is Maddin's own narration. I loved his previous film The Brand Upon the Brain! but objected to the narration. It's even worse here taking a lot of the mystique out of the silent film pastiche Maddin has been perfecting since The Heart of the World I'm kind of hoping that he'll some day return to the stuff of his earlier works which felt more like the films of the '30s than those of the '20s. My favorite sequences were the occult ceremony in the Masonic temple and the hockey legends game where septuagenarians play one last game as their stadium is demolished by wrecking balls. Darcy Fehr of Cowards Bend the Knee returns as Guy Maddin who in the movie is as desperate to leave his depressing hometown as he is to stay throughout the movie Fehr appears dozing in a train car that never seems to get out of Winnipeg.

An aspect of this film that makes it so interesting is the fact that Maddin decision to not change his longtime visual style actually works out for him even while working in a new genre for him.

While at times it may be confusing why Maddin decides to set his camera on certain subjects by the end of the film everything fits into place. At its best My Winnipeg is an oddly heartfelt tribute to a city that has burdened yet inspired Maddin for his entire life.

	schema:reviewBody "This film probably had no real budget to speak of and if you are really paying attention you would notice that it's actually mostly old footage of one man's home town. What's quite magical about this film is that you really wouldn't notice if you weren't paying attention. Instead you would swept up in the amusing narration of a prodigal son returning home. And if you grew up in a small town where nothing much happened as I did you could relate to the nostalgic elusions to the monuments people and staples of the town. Note worthy scenes within the film are Winnipeg's very own sitcom Ledge Man. About a down and out man who every episode attempts to throw himself off a ledge only to be talked down by a local hero.A truly mesmerising watch and a very intimate look into one man's feelings of his home town".

	onyx:emotionText "This film probably had no real budget to speak of and if you are really paying attention you would notice that it's actually mostly old footage of one man's home town. What's quite magical about this film is that you really wouldn't notice if you weren't paying attention. Instead you would swept up in the amusing narration of a prodigal son returning home. And if you grew up in a small town where nothing much happened as I did you could relate to the nostalgic elusions to the monuments people and staples of the town. Note worthy scenes within the film are Winnipeg's very own sitcom Ledge Man. About a down and out man who every episode attempts to throw himself off a ledge only to be talked down by a local hero.A truly mesmerising watch and a very intimate look into one man's feelings of his home town";

In it director Guy Maddin mythologizes the city he's called home his whole life with surrealist talltales of Winnipeg's old hockey arena the 1919 general strike and a rivalry between two warring taxi cab companies. At the center of it is Maddin Fehr who walks like a somnambulist through his snowcovered hamlet interacting with actors who are hired to reenact halfremembered childhood traumas most of which concern his shrewish mother Savage.Somewhere between a waking dream and a Freudian melodrama the amateurish reenactments only adds to the atmosphere which conjures comparisons to early David Lynch. Always the neoconstructionist Maddin employs a sloe of oldschool effects and technical wizardry that enhances the experience. It has been said that Maddin's films always have the feeling of seeing precode talkies from another warped dimension. A dimension where people of the thirties would accept fluid sexuality incest and gore in their films. Granted while My Winnipeg sacrifices the gleefully salacious themes of Careful 1992 and the grotesqueness of Tales from the Gimli Hospital 1988 the film stands as the director's most personal work. The same themes do remain but only on the fringes subtlety weaved into a complex tapestry of nostalgia and surreal flights of fancy.Those seeing My Winnipeg for the first time may catch themselves wondering if the myriad of talltales are true. So many claims skate the edge between amusing peculiarity and improbable absurdity that it's hard to ferret out what's real and what's a product of docu fantasia. While I can sympathize asking such questions is comparable to asking how many angels you can fit on a match head. It's better to let the film wash over you and be regaled by stories of frozen horse heads treasure hunts aboriginal origin stories and other facts about the heart of the heart of the continent. That and be taken in by the crisp black and white cinematography that only adds to the city's macabre charm.Maddin states via narration that he must escape Winnipeg. I must leave it now but how to escape one's city? Many people ask themselves that same question before taking that fateful step to hopefully greener pastures and opportunity aplenty. Even if you're the type of person who yearns to leave their small town it seems at least according to director Guy Maddin that you can't really escape the smothering embrace of a world exaggerated in your own mind. Whether all is true or none of it is My Winnipeg still remains an exemplary portrait of the Canadian The Gateway to the West.".

While I might not yet put Maddin quite as high in the ranks of masters as those Kubrick mention albeit I've yet to see some of Maddin's obscurer efforts like Careful I would add Maddin to that list of those in terms of never making a film to sell out or go for commercial pursuits. He has to make films like My Winnipeg just as Allen Ginsberg would have to pick up a pen and write about the city. And every time he makes a film it's about filmmaking about himself about life and history and family and finding oneself over and over. Maddin is more accurately like Fellini in that if one were to ask are you selfindulgent they would say maybe deadpan maybe not Yeah... And? In the case of My Winnipeg he takes a character on a train as the centerpiece very loosely one at that and transposes on him going through history  of the city of Winnipeg of childhood of and of his own sort of mental state connected to both. This character of sorts if he even is one is making a film about his family because nothing says selfportrait like that casting actors in the roles of his brothers and sister even if one of them has been deceased for decades and Ann Savage as his mother who in the film within My Winnipeg is a slightly loopy actress who can't always remember her lines. But for Maddin this isn't enough of course so he puts in folklore the lineage of hockey in the city of the tragedy of the hockey arenas one being demolished the other sprouting up like a corporate weed of what the city is like in January what it's like to go to the local threetier swimming pool or the mystical power of forks  not silverware like forks in the road.As with other Maddin works like Brand Upon the Brain one cannot really see My Winnipeg as classifiable. You just have to see it for yourself. I'm not sure if this is the best place to start with My Winnipeg but it couldn't hurt. The only very slight thing not exactly a downside is that the completely and wonderfully cracked sense of humor Maddin has is not quite as in full force as in his masterpiece Brand Upon the Brain. And while the scenes with Ann Savage are rather incredible just for their 'isitorisit' sense of autobiography maybe the deer scene is based on a real thing and the 'giveusdinnerorparakeet' isn't is a juicy question they don't quite strike the same person chord as when Maddin goes into oddly enough documentarian mode with the city.In part this is through him talking as if in a mode not too unlike Michael Moore in Roger  Me on Flynt to begrudge something like the old department store being demolished into a gaudy hockey arena that barely even counts as anything in his eyes. It's moving to see him as narrator describe what happened to the hockey teams those arenas and then how one level didn't demolish since it was added on by the NHL in the 70s. Even better still is to see him insert footage of an seniorcitizen hockey team that continues to play even as demolishing is taking place in the old Winnipeg arena. It all gets capped with a reminiscing of his father who he says died a slow death shrinking in smoke until he was gone once he lost his job at the hockey arena.My Winnipeg is loaded with visual wonders that include the three symbols that seem to overlap the dreamer on the train one of these might be a woman's crotch I still can't be sure the images of Ann Savage as a superomniscient Mother of Winnipeg and that pug apparently a girlfriend of the director's wandering around in the snowy January nights. My Winnipeg is epic poetry and epic filmmaking but compact and made personal and warped like digging through a wizard's scrapbook. 9.510".

Masons ghosts spirits and sad buildings! Citizen Girl! Yes you can find these things in Winnipeg Winnipeg wonderful Winnipeg!If you've ever seen a film like My Winnipeg before it was likely only in your dreams or the dreams of the mad poet of Winnipeg Guy Maddin. Maddin's love of the silent film era has shaped his own visual style shot usually on old grainy film stock appearing as it his films were perhaps well preserved 1920s avant garde. He's built a career on making films so outrageously insane by modern filmmaking standards. His films are usually either bizarre horrors or totally unique comedies or both. My Winnipeg is a film of sinisterly off the wall humor conveyed through Guy Maddin's narration played by Darcy Fehr. One gem My father died with nothing left to do he died. I'd like to say he spontaneously combusted on the ice at the area that would have been great.The narration often doubles back on itself repeating itself in different forms or entirely contradicting itself in single sentences. All the while the images usually grainy black and white but also occasionally in color or animation are punctuated with flash cards usually in single or short phrases Tragedy! Dead Man walking! Dance of the Hairless Boners Naked! Hairless! Dance! Swollen Pride! Why?! They flash only for a fraction of a sentence making them difficult to read.I guess if My Winnipeg could be placed in a genre they would have to call it a slapstick documentary. Maddin uses archive footage mixed with Maddin's own. The central thesis of the film is Maddin's memories and the city's as well. To begin he rides a train sleeping while it rolls around the Winnipeg streets seemingly unable to ever leave town. To come to terms with his inability to ever leave the city. He rents his old home for a month to recreate his childhood memories. He recruits actors to play his siblings and takes his mother Ann Savage to the home then recreates memories and incidents from childhood. Maddin always seems to have a fascination with mothers his mother. Elsewhere he details the Masonic undercurrents of the city the occult man pageants Nazi takeovers and the rape of the city's beloved Winnipeg Jets by that corrupt National Hockey League!So the question that many ask then is it true? Being Canadian I know some things are true some things are not. Would you want to really know the answer anyway? Its law that everyone gets to keep the keys to their old homes. Why? Because the town has the highest sleepwalking rate in the world! They leave their homes and wander to their old houses in the dark in the cold in the snow! You must let them in until they wake! Is that true? I don't care to know. If I knew then I would have to have come back to reality. Unless of course Maddin's Winnipeg is reality. In which case Winnipeg! Wonderful Winnipeg!".

	schema:reviewBody "What is My Winnipeg? Sure it's easy to dismiss it as an experimental film but that's like blacklisting it to a future in some storage bin in a modern art museum which would be a shame. The film claims to be a documentary about Guy Maddin's hometown Winnipeg MB. The footage shows what appears to be reenactments of Maddin's childhood scenes from his family and a speckled history of the town. The narrative feels like it is being materialized just as Maddin thinks it juggling arresting emotion and fleeting sentimentality. The repeating stock footage circular cinematography and grizzly black and white tone make the film hypnotic to watch and add to its dreamlike state.From the beginning it's obvious that this 'reality' is pure imagination a fantasy concocted by Maddin but for what purpose? Why is he trying to escape reality and his hometown that he loves so dearly? The best way to understand is to watch it accept it as truth like Maddin has and experience the world as it becomes a much more magical place.".

Combining some of the best psychotronic personalities of the decade with awesome rock music and outlandish plots Zugsmith created essential viewing for film fans. GIRLS TOWN is one of his lesser films but still packs a hell of a punch today. Many will recognize it from MST3K but it is much better than it looks.Mamie van Doren the sexy blonde who competed with Marilyn and Jayne the whole decade is Silver a sexy juvenile delinquent accused of pushing her boyfriend over a cliff. She is committed to a reform school run by nuns where she encounters nice girl Gigi Perreau and bitchy Gloria Talbott. Meanwhile sleazy drag racer Mel Torme !!!!! tries to blackmail Silver's sister Elinor Donahue the real murderess into being his drag partner! Also figuring into the mix are Paul Anka Ray Anthony The Platters Dick Contino Maggie Hayes Jim Mitchum Charles Chaplin Jr. Harold Lloyd Jr. and Norman Grabowski!Besides having a cast to die for all have style and presence if not excellent GIRLS TOWN has fantastic music creative camerawork a drag race many musical numbers several catfights Mamie in many revealing sexy outfits a hilarious gang brawl and a judochopping Gloria Talbott! Mamie van Doren has always been a favorite of mine and like Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe is an underrated actress. Here she is at her best sexy vulnerable tough and overall very likable. If you're not a hardcore Mamie fan by the end of this movie you need to check your pulse and your pants 'cause you may be dead on both ends!GIRLS TOWN is a fabulous time capsule of a film that doesn't age that well but is unique and entertaining the whole way through. By the way MST3K cut about 15 minutes out of the movie to fit into their time slot the whole movie has many more fun scenes! Highly recommended you will not be disappointed and it will be an experience you will never forget!".

And what kind of name is Silver? Sounds like a stripper name to me! But even though this is lowbudget 50sstyle exploitation Mamie gives a surprisingly decent performance.

That's right  Paul Anka and Mel Torme in a fight! It's one of the absolute funniest things I've seen in a long time. I mean Mamie's bra is tougher than these two. Still it's a moment that made the movie for me.Realistically Girls Town isn't anywhere near as good as my rating would indicate. But as I've said before my ratings are based on the entertainment value I find in movies regardless of a lot of other factors. If I watch a movie and enjoy it and have fun with it it gets a good rating. And unlike a lot of other reviewers I had a blast with Girls Town.I watched the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of Girls Town and loved it. The riffs were deadon and hysterical. I've got no problems rating episode 601 a 45 on my MST3K rating scale. This is one any fan of the show should seek out.".

The cast of this movie is a cheesy list from Mel and Mamie to the talentless Paul Ankaall I wanted through most of this movie was for him to just STOP SINGING! and the King of Forty Year Old Teens Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot playing a humorless teen girl with more than a few chopsjudo not acting I last saw in the horrible misogynist 50's romp Leech Woman with a hairstyle so bad it looked like a dead woodchuck that had been squashed by a Mac truck.Mamie is a bad bad girlshe smokes swears runs wild hits teachers and runs around with gang leaders. She dumps her idiot Jaguar driving boyfriend Chipwho we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl before he falls off a cliffnice guy and proceeds to take up with Dick Contino instead. Whether this is a step up for her is anybody's guess. Mel shows up at a party she's at with her new beau and accuses her of pushing the nasty Chip off the cliff. While I'm sure that she would have liked to she wasn't there. A stupid fight scene between Contino and his gang and Mel and his jazz freaks ensues with some hilariously bad moves on both sides.Mamie ends up being sent to girls town a reform school..errr...loving home for erring girls..run by Sister Iron Pants and her fellow sisters of correction. She annoys the nunsand us by scatting tossing off sullen oneliners and just generally showing how bad she is. She quickly runs into Gloria Talbot playing one of the misbehaving girls who gives her a chop sockey so that she knows her place. She meets a limp noodle of a girl who's obsessed with Paul Anka's characterwhy?. This little drip becomes her 'henchman'. There's a long bit of movie where nothing much happens except St. Paul of Anka keeps showing up and proving how saintly he is. He sings way too much in this interval until you want to smack him in his huge snozz to just make him be quiet! And Mamie's little sister played by Princess of Father Know's Best fame calls her to tell her she's in trouble. Turns out it was sis who went out with the Chipster and now Mel's blackmailing her because he found out. The girls all break out to go save her with a hysterical fight scene between the girls and Mel and his boys. this is after a race between Mel and Dick that is just so stupid that it boggles the mind. The overage teenagers in this corny movie have a fabulous good time romping through what is basically a silly badly written and morally preachy film that accomplishes none if its aimsunless its aim was to make you laugh out loud.".

Could there possibly be worse casting? And then there's Paul Anka. During the film bad Mel has a fight with angelic Paul. I always wondered what that was about! Was this supposed to be some Zionist statement or did Mel object to Paul's out of tune singing of Ave Maria? Maybe Mel wanted to sing it in Yiddish or use it as a vehicle for a scat solo! But I digress. Like all the Zugsmith films this one is both intentionally and unintentionally funny. Director Haas' fast paced direction never lets the film get boring even though the acting is as horrible as usual. It's in the same class with High School Confidential The Big Operator College Confidential and the greatest of them all Sex Kttens Go to College. Thank you Mr. Zugsmith! Don't miss this camp classic.".

	schema:headline " This 1950s teen angst movie might got some fast cars but it doesn't have the James Dean spirit nor the Norma Jean beauty. It was a belowaverage film.";
	schema:reviewBody "A bad attitude is like a flat tire. You can't go anywhere without changing it. This movie is just a flat tire without a spare. I'm sorry if anybody honestly like this old school classic about teenage disillusionment and social estrangement but I kinda found it somewhat annoying. I get that girls just wanna have fun but all the troubled reckless youth in this film were just not unlikeable at all. Way too much backtalk and sass with little caring. This movie is no Rebel without a Cause because of that. Directed by Charles Haas this movie tells the story of a juvenile delinquent Silver Morgan Mamie Van Doren who is sent to a girl's school run by nuns after being mistaken for a woman that was with her exboyfriend Chip Gardner Harold Lloyd Jr at the time of his death. Unable to prove her innocent Silver must learn how to live at the rehabilitation center while also trying to solve her ex boyfriend's murder. Without spoiling the movie too much this movie is probably best known as the film that the 1990s moviemocking television series 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' lampooned in Season 6 Episode 1 September 1994 airing on Comedy Central. Nevertheless what people don't know about that airing is that about 15 minutes of the actual film was cut from this version. It get worst as some versions of the film imposed the removal of several scene in which Silver is bathing because it was considered to be offensive to decency at the time. So if you really want to see the full version you might have to find the VHS tape since as of this writing this film hasn't yet come into DVD. It's a really hard and rare movie to find a full version of this film. Despite the movie being impossible to find the movie isn't as bad as Mystery Science Theater 3000 make it out to be. It's not the worst to ever air on MST3K. However it's does have a lot of moments throughout the film that will anger you. I think one of them for me was the fact that the girls in the film hardly learn any lessons. There is no character development. I get that the movie is trying to be a straightup morality tale about religion and friendship turning around the life of an angst juvenile delinquent but the problem with that is the innocent event that got Silver sent to Girls Town overlook Silver's own crimes. Yes it's true that she found religion for a punishment she didn't do but it doesn't really show much or any change in her persona about her own past crimes. Another problem with the film is how most of the cast are much older than the teenagers they're supposed to be playing. Annoying Marilyn Monroe ripoff Mamie Van Doren was actually 28 at the time a good 11 years older than her character. While she was a fineactor. The overused of slang really made her character hard to understand. A good example of this was with the word 'henchman'. Silver probably mean henchman in a way like buddy friend or pal but it comes across as lame attempt to give new meaning to that word. Other dialogues sentences really become very funny to the modern viewers as meaning for certain words now have sexual undertones with them. A good example of this is when Silver told the villain in the film is 'that she will blow his whistle'. I can't help laughing. Despite that Mamie Van Doren was somewhat sexy at certain moments in the film. I just wish she stop looking like a Marilyn Monroe clone. She's really ruin her looks in her later years. One another character that really seem out of place is Jazz composer turn actor Mel Torm. He was 34 when he was declare to played street racergang member Fred Alger. It was really jarring to see a man known for playing smooth jazz try to act like a youthful badass when he clearly not. I really didn't like his character. Other characters that seem like they don't belong in this film is singer Jimmy Parlow Paul Anka whom oddly seem to love to hang out at Girl's Town for no reason but to torment his stalker Serafina Garcia Gigi Perreau by giving her mixed messages. Why would you want to be friends with your stalker? That would only give them more reasons to seek you out Jimmy! Despite that Paul Anka does alright in his first starting role. He remind me so much of a young Dustin Hoffman in this film but as much as I love his singing of songs Lonely Boy It's Time to Cry Girls Town Blues and Ave Maria. The whole stalking subplot really felt like a different type of a movie going on at the same time as the main plot. Another plotline that isn't followed up on enough was the whole idea of the Joe Cates Charlie Chaplin Jr. trying to incriminate Silver in Chip's murder. It's come and goes without any backstory on why. It's weird to see the children of famous goodnatured comedians Harold Lloyd Jr and Charlie Chaplin Jr. being told to play bad guys. It's so jolting to watch. Even the whole idea of attempted rape in a late 1950searly 1960s movie was a little bit too disturbing. Despite that the action in the film is alright. The Game of Chicken with the cars was surprised not that bad. It had some intense moments. Overall This teen exploitation film from MetroGoldwynMayer is a dated time capsule of a film that doesn't age well since the 1950s however it's unique and entertaining the whole way through. Worth maybe one watch but not much other than that. If anything just watch the MST3K version instead.".

It is called The Christmas Song. The song writers act well enough but the script is funny where it is supposed to be serious. Cat fights look a bit staged. We learn here that everyone leaves their keys in their cars. You should not grab the steering wheel when you are about to crash into a concrete support. Paul Anka has the best smile. Mamie was a beauty for sure. She is not given a lot to do in this movie except chew gum and look tough. The Platters song was written by Buck Ram who wrote the big Platters hits like Great Pretender and Only You. The song for this movie is not one of The Platters greats. This is a great very great movie for Bad Movie Night. Wonderful old cars and telephones and hair styles. Don't miss it. Maybe it could be a double bill with High School Confidential.".

Not long afterward a young woman named Silver Morgan Mamie Van Doren is linked to the man's death and is remanded to a Catholic school for girls pending sufficient evidence needed for a murder conviction. Although Silver protests her innocence her wild behavior and rebellious attitude prove to be a negative factor against her and soon she begins to get in even more trouble. Meanwhile her little sister Mary Lee Morgan Elinor Donahue discovers that life without Silver to protect her is quite difficult as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that although this film was more than a little corny it still wasn't too bad for the most part with the gorgeous Mamie Van Doren clearly dominating each and every scene she was in. That said even though this movie was clearly dated I still thought it was okay for the time spent and I have rated it accordingly. Average.".

A girl gets picked up as she was supposed to be having a date with said guy and she is sent to Girl's Town a place run by nuns that has all the makings of a reform school but for some reason they act as if it is not one. You also have subplots about a girl who goes gaga for a singer and a race between rival gangs. Just one of those films that is just to all over the place and you are required to listen to the occasional song sung by either Paul Anka or The Platters. Girl's Town seems like a strange place where the girls can harass the newbies all they want and the nuns rarely intervene. They do role up their sleeves and help with washing the floor however.".

So she pretty much put her life on hold.Seemingly her best friend in the small Kansas town is Forest Whitaker as the somewhat kooky Joey who has visions of angels. He goes off the deep end occasionally often uses poor judgment in certain situations but jokingly calls himself Jane's body guard. He in fact does help her out at times.One day Joey finds an unopened letter in Jane's house it is from her now 10yrold son living in Baton Rouge inviting her to his communion in July. Joey doesn't tell her about the letter instead puts it in his pocket and sets about to get Jane to take a road trip he wants her to see her son. The road trip does have its share of pitfalls the first being their car burns up. Literally. At a motel along comes Elias Koteas as Dean who sells them a car for 500 and it works fine but the next morning they awake to find it gone. Dean has cheated them.Then comes young Madeline Zima as Billie whose young husband just seemed to take off so she joins them in the road trip. At one stopping point they need a place to crash hear music and go to find Nick Nolte as Caldwell playing a guitar. He joins in for the road trip.Describing it in my feeble manner in no way does justice to the movie. It is very different often touching and very well acted.".

The journey that the 2 main characters embark on is not only a physical journey but also an emotionally and psychologically healing journey. Both characters have lost more than they can bear and they help each other to recognize that life goes on. Jane learns that she can be emotionally engaged in life  that even though she has lost so much there are still elements in her life that can be reclaimed if she is willing to feel again. Joey has experience loss so great that it has shifted him psychologically and he comes to realize that he needs to express only those things that he can share with others in their realities while keeping his unique reality for his benefit only. The characters they meet along the way all add to their journey of healing. The healing that occurs is subtle and inferred by the thinking person. I view this movie as a masterpiece to be enjoyed by those who are not dependent on typical cookiecutter tactics.".

The Forrest Whitaker character Joey bothered me the most. The slowwitted crazy man with a heart of gold who takes care of the paraplegic singer played by Renee Zellweger. The character is a movie clich straight out of Of Mice And Men and Whitaker didn't bring anything new to it. Is he schizophrenic and off his meds? Is he bipolar and off his meds? Whatever he only shows up in movies not in real life. At one point late in the story there is a diversion into the legend of Robert Johnson losing his soul at the Crossroads in exchange for a supernatural ability on the guitar. Then on to something else. It goes nowhere. What was the point? Is our little band of characters somehow like Robert Johnson? Apparently not because the next sequence is a highspeed car chase down highway 61. There were some nice moments but they were poorly strung together.".

With the exception of Zellweger's Jane the characters are either clichs or onedimensional. Moreover the film is overly sentimental at times. While I enjoy road movies very much 'My Own Love Song' does capture the beauty of the American landscape. The camerawork is very good. I enjoyed the animated bird sequence but otherwise it was completely out of place. Renee Zellwegger does an excellent job in portraying Jane Wyatt a wheelchairridden former rockstar who's estranged from her son. In addition Zellweger proves once again that she can sing beautifully. Forest Whitaker tries the best he could with a poorly written Joey but the actor is unable to do anything new with this character. Yet I enjoyed most of his scenes with Zellweger. Madeline Zima's Bilie lacks development. Nick Nolte stands out in a small role. Overall 'My Own Love Song' isn't a bad watch by any means it just doesn't have anything new to offer.".

Zellwegger's paralyzed from a car accident seven years ago when she met Whitaker in the hospital. He was there for mental problems. He still thinks he hears the voices of angels. They go off in an old Seventies car which is later stolen to see the author of a bestselling books on angels and Whittiker's character wants to take Zellwegger to the birthday party of her little boy who was adopted by a rich family when her injuries and poverty made her unable to raise him. On the way they meet a rundown singer Nick Nolte something like Jeff Bridges' character in CRAZY HEART except that he only plays the guitar and has sunk so low he can only get gigs at an old hotel and that only if he brings a singer. So he persuades an unwilling Zellweger to come along and perform. There and at her son's birthday Zellwegger gives surprisingly powerful earnest performances of two songs  both written by Bob Dylan for this film. The colorful southern atmosphere and the Dylan compositions which include his own very TomWaitsesquire performances on the soundtrack may be the main reason for watching this otherwise weak effort. It would work better if Whitaker didn't give one of his most mannered performances and if the two principals were not written in as such hopeless losers. Poor critical rating in France Allocin 1.2 26. An error of taste however wellmeaning the director is out of his element. Some will enjoy the music and the settings but this is at best an interesting failure despite the name cast.".

Frustrating because it can't be as easily dismissed as one would assume.The plot summary the title the poster and DVD cover art all suggest that it will be boring. I can't fault the marketers it is boring. And that is its ultimate problem.

Fate's Plaything 1920 Laughter and Tears and The Black Tulip both 1921 and Circus Jim 1922 certainly all survive and there may yet be more to come..... This film although it has a starry adult Dutch cast inc Annis Bos Lola Cornero and Adelqui Migliar is really all built around the child star Renee Spiljer and has the air of being made to play well in the US market the writer Eleanor Morse Savi was from Massachusetts and appeared also to have written the scenario for the film. It is a similar story in many ways to Little Lord Fauntleroy first filmed in the UK in 1914. The wife Annie Bos of the younger son Migliar is unacceptable to the aristocratic family because she is an actress and as he is a feckless goodfornothing he ends up abandoning everybody and going off to become a make a man of himself by becoming a mountie in Canada so thankfully we don't see too much of him. The family decides to adopt the child and the mother not a successful actress at this stage hsa no choice but to agree for the good of the child. The cutesy child along with cutesy dog which looks a bit like something that's fallen off the end of a chimneysweeps' brush  the pair eat sleep and pray together! then proceeds to charm the family easily wining the heart of the father and the elder son but having a bit more of an effort to win over the elder son's wife a good performance by Cornero. There is no real tension or conflict anywhere in sight just little Renee spreading sweetness and light wherever she goes  and the eventual happy end is in view from very early on  Bos has meanwhile become a star and Migliar a man  but it is a pleasant enough film and Spiljar does a good job. Although the child is described as artless several times in the film she is absolutely no such thing and one point of interest is actually the way she is shown to have inherited her mother's acting instincts and uses her histrionic skills as the key to winning over the family. A nice little twist on the otherwise very familiar antitheatre prejudice theme.Spiljat although she and sister Marie appeared in a handful of other films never made it as a star and as for the dog it was probably reclaimed by the chimneysweep.".

	schema:reviewBody "DEPORTED  1950A ship docks in Naples and starts offloading cargo and one man Victor Mario Sparducci. Sparducci is played by Jeff Chandler who is a mobster going by the name Vic Smith. Chandler has just finished a 5 year prison bit for a 100000 robbery. The cash was never recovered by the Police. Chandler after he finished his term was escorted to the docks and deported back to the old country. This is before he can grab the 100000.Chandler is barely off the docks in Naples when he runs into the pretty Marina Berti. Berti invites Chandler to her rooms for a drink and a cuddle which our man Jeff is all too happy to accept. This of course does not go as Chandler had expected. Waiting for him at Berti's place is fellow mobster Richard Rober. Rober has followed Chandler from the States. He is not amused that he never got his cut of the 100000 holdup the two had arranged. Some less than friendly words and punches are exchanged over the financial situation with Rober being laid out. Chandler informs Rober that he intends to keep the whole take. I did five years for that money so as far as I'm concerned it is mine. Chandler then tells Rober to stay away or Chandler will kill him. Chandler then heads for the small village his family had left when he was a child. He hides out with his uncle Silvio Mincioti while he plans a way to get his cash over to him from the States. Chandler soon hooks up with the village's black market boss Carlo Rizzo. He figures he will need Rizzo's help once he comes up with a plan to retrieve his cash. While all this is going on Chandler finds time to romance local beauty Marta Toren. Toren is a wealthy widow who spends her time doing charity work for the local poor. Toren soon falls for the rather rough around the edges Chandler.This all happens in the first 20 minutes. The film then loses steam and becomes a travelogue for the next 30 40 minutes. There really is no on screen sparks between Chandler and Toren. Their scenes together are more or less dead time. The film however does catch fire again in the last 1015 minutes. Chandler has found the perfect way to get his cash from the States. He cables the person in the States holding his money to buy 100 grand worth of food and medical supplies. These he has shipped to Italy to be given to the village. The trick here is that Chandler intends to hijack the items then sell them on the black market for 5 times the cost.Chandler ends up changing his mind over the deal and tries to cancel the hijacking. Needless to say this leads to a major falling out among the crooks with the added complication for Chandler that Rober is back in play. Rober has been keeping track of Chandler and has been waiting for Chandler to make a play. He then muscled his way in with the black market mob. Once the theft of the Medical supplies etc.is done he plans on killing Chandler.The mandatory guns are produced and violence ensues. Particularly well done is the gun battle and chase between Chandler and Rober in the darkened food warehouse. Rober is killed and Chandler is gobbled up by the Italian Police. He does of course end up with Toren at the end. She offers to help in his defence over the whole black market deal. Also in the film is Claude Dauphin as an Italian Police detective. Look close and you will spot bit players Tito Vuolo and Vito Scotti. The director of photography is Oscar winner William H. Daniels. His noir work includes BRUTE FORCE LURED THE NAKED CITY ILLEGAL ENTRY ABANDONED WINCHESTER 73 WOMAN IN HIDING and FORBIDDEN. The screenplay was by one time Oscar nominated Robert Buckner. Buckner also produced the film. Considering all the talent involved is this film it does not hit the mark. There are parts here that are quite well handled but the start and the finish are not quite enough to save the film from just being average. It suffers from a tad too much dead time. For a Siodmak film I found it rather disappointing. INFO All three of the leads died before their time with Toren going at 31 Rober at 42 and Chandler at 43. bw".

	schema:headline " Charming Nostalgia of Movie History for 1950's Audiences";
	schema:reviewBody "THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY was producerdirector Robert Youngson's first compilation feature film consisting of clips from silent era comedy shorts. The movie was a surprise hit in 1957 and led to six more films of this nature spanning into 1970 as well as 1964's THE BIG PARADE OF COMEDY with clipped MGM feature films. This obviously isn't the best way to see silent comedies but it's very good and was a very rare chance for the general public in the 1950's and 1960's to see silent movie footage particularly on a theater screen and certainly Youngson's films were an invaluable contribution to the burgeoning popularity of these vintage films which had begun to find their way onto the home movie market via Super 8 8mm and 16mm.A number of the reviewers here have panned or given limited praise to this film because of the conspicuously missing silent era legends like Chaplin Keaton and Lloyd however the movie never suggests it is an definitive look at silent comedies just a memory book of what the era was like and the type of wild humor audiences enjoyed some thirty earlier. The clips all come from either Hal Roach or Mack Sennett films and are actually limited to 1920's films nothing from the 1910's that I can tell. Laurel and Hardy enjoy the most footage with an extended abbreviation from TWO TARS an interesting look at 1920's road rage which we are told is one of the acknowledged classic shorts but actually seems one of the less funny of the segments given it's fairly repetitive and predictable. I think the boys are better served by footage as ingenious prisoners who paint their way to an escape a short but funny bit about the perils of reading street signs in the dark or walking city streets with open manholes. There's also footage from the classic DOUBLE WHOOPEE thanks to Jean Harlow's legendary appearance in the short in her shorts.Harry Langdon called one of the great four comedians of the screen the other three are not mentioned by name but we know who they are in a segment that is cute but underwhelming. At least it's better than the seldom funny Ben Turpin or Will Rogers' surprisingly not too successful attempts at burlesquing movie heroes from the short UNCENSORED MOVIES. Lovely teenaged Carole Lombard is shown in footage from RUN GIRL RUN where most of the comic gags are played by pintsized coach Daphne Pollard or fat girl Madelyne Field. One of my favorite comedians Charley Chase is seen in an amusing segment with a brat kid and a circus lion. Surprisingly much of the funniest footage comes from unheralded and often uncredited here comics in various early bits as well as a checkersplaying cat and pokercheating dog. There is an extended quite funny pie fight riot as well as pantspulling kneekicking street war led by Laurel and Hardy as well as such stock silent comedy staples as the horsedriven fire engines train tunnels criminals on the loose on a train houses falling apart like paper et al. Do try to see these comics in unedited form in their original films but if you get a chance don't miss checking out Youngson's historic films that introduced silent comedy to a whole new audience a halfcentury ago.".

The biggest names in this film are Laurel and Hardy and the section of the film that concentrates on their film appearances consists of an edited version of their classic silent film Two Tars. Two Tars consists of a giant traffic jam that deteriorates into a battle between drivers where everyone begins to wreck everyone else's cars. It's a very funny film that has been very craftily cut down to about one third of its running time. It's a good film but possibly the weakest of Youngsons films that I've seen. That said it still supplies a good many laughs and is worth your time".

When I read that sentence I realize there's virtually no one left today who was born that long ago and still with us. The clips in this picture were put together in 1957 by Robert Youngson and if you don't mind the exclusion of Chaplin Keaton and Lloyd it's a nice little foray into the movie world of directors Mack Sennett and Hal Roach.The lion's share of the film is devoted to Laurel and Hardy although a real life lion shows up in various bits for some amusing visuals. All the clips are silent of course haling from the 1920's and presenting many of the celebrities of the era. Clips featuring Will Rogers Douglas Fairbanks Tom Mix Carole Lombard and Jean Harlow come and go rather quickly. A bit more time is spent on comics like Ben Turpin and Harry Langdon considered by the narrator as one of the four greatest comedians of all time. Well that was back in 1957 we've had a lot of time since then to produce a whole lot more. Langdon seems to be all but unknown today compared to his unnamed contemporaries I mentioned earlier.There are some amusing bits here one of the better ones comes from Laurel and Hardy's Double Whoopee featuring the Harlow skirt pull scene. If one's tastes run to the old pie toss routine the all time extravaganza involving an entire neighborhood is presented courtesy of our pals Stan and Ollie once more. They're also at the center of a massive street brawl where just about everyone loses their pants. Get your mind out of the gutter it wasn't like that this one ended with the boys leaving the scene in a single pair of slacks almost like a bicycle built for two.For animal lovers there's even a handful of scenes featuring some furry friends with a checkers playing cat outwitting his human opponent and a wily canine adept at cheating in a poker game. The animals seemed pretty talented for what was required of them leading me to wonder why we don't see more clever critters in movies today. Then again who wants to be upstaged by a cute kitty.".

Stan Laurel  Oliver Hardy were given a Lion's share of the screen time Mr. Youngson obviously being a buff.WE REMEMBER SEEING the coming attractions at a Saturday Matine and the kids all enthusiastically cheered for Laurel  Hardy when they were mentioned. Once again they were familiarized to us through the miracle of the Television Tube.WE DID PAY our two bits to see it and very much enjoyed the samplings of clips from so many movies with so many unknown names. The narration was very informative the music was both appropriate and acted as a very fine instrument for amplifying the visuals before us.UPON FURTHER CONSIDERATION all these decades later we now have noticed something about THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY that very well may not be readily observed before. Although what we saw was great in its own right where were the big stars? THERE IS OBVIOUSLY omissions of what has been called the Big Three of the Silent Screen Clowns those being Charlie Chaplin Bjuster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.ALTHOUGH THIS WAS most likely done deliberately we believe that there was no malice involved.FIRST OF ALL availability of films would be the prime moving force here. If they ain't out there no one can get them. The accessible films must also have a price tag on their licensing that is within budget.That makes two reasons.THIRD WE BELIEVE that time constraints would not allow the proper attention to be given to the major Stars. A compilation such as this is after all an anthology as well as being a sort of overview or survey if you will.LASTLY THIS MID to late fifties was only a few short years removed from that era of hearings by the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities and the staunch AntiCommunist sentiments of the day. It was in 1952 that the now very prosperous Mr. Charles Chaplin refused to fill out a declaration for American Officials opting to stay in Europe rather than returning to the U.S.MOST OF THESE shortcomings were remedied in the very next Youngson production WHEN COMEDY WAS KING which prominently displayed works by Keaton and Chaplin. Harold Lloyd was still absent tough. Owning the rights to most of his major films he opted for a compilation of his own HAROLD LLOYD'S WLORLD OF COMEDY 1962.".

The accessible films must also have a price tag on their licensing that is within budget.That makes two reasons.THIRD WE BELIEVE that time constraints would not allow the proper attention to be given to the major Stars. A compilation such as this is after all an anthology as well as being a sort of overview or survey if you will.LASTLY THIS MID to late fifties was only a few short years removed from that era of hearings by the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities and the staunch AntiCommunist sentiments of the day. It was in 1952 that the now very prosperous Mr. Charles Chaplin refused to fill out a declaration for American Officials opting to stay in Europe rather than returning to the U.S.MOST OF THESE shortcomings were remedied in the very next Youngson production WHEN COMEDY WAS KING which prominently displayed works by Keaton and Chaplin. Harold Lloyd was still absent tough. Owning the rights to most of his major films he opted for a compilation of his own HAROLD LLOYD'S WLORLD OF COMEDY 1962.";

Against a landscape of mountains and farmland from driving snow to rain to sun the children gather in Lopez's warm and colorful classroom to read write dictation cook and sort things out. At home the older ones do homework with parents after their chores. At year's end they look ahead to the next visiting the middle school and meeting the little ones coming in the fall. As they learn sums and adjectives with Lopez's help they also learn to live side by side.";

So many thoughts rush through the viewer's head as we watch this incredibly patient man battle through the daily challenges of teaching kids ages 4 to 12. Young Jojo will win your heart as the eager to play boy who would undoubtedly be subjected to doses of Ridlin in the U.S.  Jojo's charm and openness are in stark contrast to the older children who seem to keep their emotions pent up to play along with the expectations of maturity. Personalities are obvious by age 4 or 5 and we have no trouble looking forward to see the type of teens and adults they will become.  This environment offers so many advantages to the pack 30 in a classroom and demand robotic behavior that has become the norm in our education system. Teachers have become disciplinarians by force rather than life educators like Mr. Lopez.  Yes I laughed many times during this one but only as my heart was breaking while dreaming of what could be for kids.  The scenes with the families are torturous to watch and should provide insight into how many parents undermine even the best teachers.  Should be required viewing for all parents and teachers.  We should all ask ourselves what is the point of taking the eagerness and desire learn away from kids?".

	schema:reviewBody "tre et avoir To Be and To Have is like Something's Gotta Give a title I don't get. But unlike the latter a poorly written romantic comedy and star vehicle deserving to be soon forgotten the French documentary leaves a deep impression. It's an incredibly touching and absorbing portrait of a teacher named Georges Lopez in rural Issoire in the center of France who works alone in what is called a oneroom' school. His students the blurb says are 4 to 11. You don't really know their ages and since they're all together you see them as individuals rather than representatives of particular age or class levels. The focus of To Be and To Have is with minutest detail upon what happens in the classroom. It stops just short of a complete portrait of the man assuming he has some tre' some being outside the classroom. At a moment where he speaks of himself to the camera he reveals that he wanted to teach and loved the classroom even as a young child. Does he really have a life outside class? Has he married? It seems not. Is he gay? Asexual? Wonderful as he is as a teacher  and surely his patient firmness makes him superb with children in a peculiarly French way  the insistence on manners and civility on his being called monsieur' a bit old fashioned one might think even pre1968 preSeventies  and that apparent absence of a life outside the classroom all suggest a certain human limitation in Georges Lopez. Or you can see him as a monk teaching as his sacred calling and the classroom as his chapel. This limitation comes through in his insistence on guidance rather than listening a gap that shows in two extended private sessions with students in need of counseling  one with two boys who got in a fight the other with a girl who is withdrawn amid her peers  where in each case the kids barely speak up at all. The teacher's manner seems to overwhelm them even though it's gentle and caring. But the documentary isn't just about the teacher or his firm dominant infinitely patient style fascinating though those in themselves are. It's about the children too of course and they emerge with radiant clarity and life. Probably the one we'll best remember is JoJo Johan not to be confused with Johann of the beautiful eyes sphinxlike calm and occasional moments of cruelty. JoJo is so fascinating because he eludes classification and yet in a way he's a childhood everyman. He's eager and gawky. Lopez is always focusing on him but without great effect he eludes molding too. He seems unfocused unable to finish coloring or photocopying a book illustration properly or to wash his hands to remove the mess of ink he's gotten on them or to finish the teacher's interrogation about how high numbers go. But while JoJo seems frail and a bit confused at times quick to become distracted dissolving into tears when knocked down by Johann the teacher handles these conflicts with magnificent calm evenhandedness during the second later numbers drill which comes up spontaneously on a class outing JoJo is making a quantum leap. Where earlier in the year he could barely write the number seven' suddenly he is talking about thousands and billions. You realize he's just a boy  full of possibilities. And there's no telling where he'll go. Those are right who've called this film a meditation on the mysteries of childhood. It's a meditation all right. Its slow microscopic observation makes it that. It makes you ponder a lot of things childhood teaching retirement the nature of the documentary process. You realize there are no rules about how minute or how comprehensive a documentary must be that the best ones  and this is one of the best  are certainly both. Throughout tre et avoir there are moments that are tremendously moving which pop up instantly without warning. Since the editing doesn't follow any logic other than the passage of time as the school year progresses from the onset of winter to the approach of summer you may wonder how it's all going to pull together. There are even some segments showing parents helping their children with homework that are rather dull  till the poor rural parents' academic cluelessness becomes hilarious  and then you realize it's a bit sad. There are beautiful brief sequences of the snow of cows of one of the boys cooking and driving a tractor. But what is the film talking about? we may wonder. Where is it going? Then we learn that the teacher is going to retire shortly. And since we know now that teaching is his life in a far greater sense than usual the day this school year ends when the students all come up and kiss the teacher goodbye on both cheeks three kisses in a few special cases becomes a hugely significant day. After the children leave you half expect the matre to burst into tears like JoJo when Johann knocked him down. He doesn't but we weep a bit for him for the children and for our own lost childhoods. Philibert the filmmaker has done a magnificent job just by being there but not getting in the way. He has shown us a world. Merci M. Philibert! Merci M. Lopez! Merci JoJo!".

A beautifully shot film about school kids and their teacher in a French school in the Auvergne. I had the privilege to watch the film during the International Film Festival Rotterdam and hear the directors comments afterwards.All children appr. 20 ranging from age 4 to 12 my guess in one room with a teacher who really found his vocation in life. The school was chosen after visiting numerous schools in France. One of the main reasons according to the director for choosing this particular school was the fact that is had all children in 1 room and that room had ample space which meant that no addional lighting was needed.In the course of the film you get the feeling that the camera and therefore us the viewers really gets invisible allthough that was absolutely not the case. The children behaved completely different when the camera was there. I didn't notice that. You really feel for them afterwards. This includes the teacher who is finishing his last year and will retire. One of the most touching moments for me was the last shot at the end of the school year when all the children leave for the last time and the teacher has a few emotional moments alone realizing that this is the end both for the children and himself. The moment is even more poignant when you realize that it is not acted it is real...Do not expect a high pace film with lots of drama and action. In the beginning I had a little difficulty with the pace of the film which seems slow. Especially the inbetween shots seem long but after a while I got totally gripped in it and these shots really felt right. They got me down from my reallife fast pace such as it is and settled me down.I could go on and on about what is so wonderfull about this film but my advise If you see one film this year see this one !!".

	schema:reviewBody "Teaching is a gift a talent and it can not be taughtsure people can be taught at universities about the particulars of teaching but the guts of teaching is something that imbues an adult with the warmth of dealing with young people.  Georges Lopez has that talent that gift and this beautiful film allows adults to see what happens in something we all participate in but rarely have a chance to observe after we are adults.I found the film to be mesmerizing with it's reflections on the beauty and innocence of childhood as well as the little insights into French rural life all held together with the glue provided by the teaching of Lopez with his powerful personality.  The beauty of this personality and his extraordinary attitude towards the children in his care are the parts of this wonderfully warm documentary that linger with me after viewing the film.A person feels so humbled after watching a master at work and we must question our society's values when a man of this talent can beaver away unknown in deep pockets in urban and rural settings under valued by our society while others with far less to contribute are valued to a degree beyond worth.".

Georges Lopez has that talent that gift and this beautiful film allows adults to see what happens in something we all participate in but rarely have a chance to observe after we are adults.I found the film to be mesmerizing with it's reflections on the beauty and innocence of childhood as well as the little insights into French rural life all held together with the glue provided by the teaching of Lopez with his powerful personality.  The beauty of this personality and his extraordinary attitude towards the children in his care are the parts of this wonderfully warm documentary that linger with me after viewing the film.A person feels so humbled after watching a master at work and we must question our society's values when a man of this talent can beaver away unknown in deep pockets in urban and rural settings under valued by our society while others with far less to contribute are valued to a degree beyond worth.";

And yet one is left with a nagging question  can it have been that easy when the result is something as impressive and beautifully formed as Nicolas Philibert's moving study of a village school in the Auvergne from winter through to summer?  It opens with a stunning shot of cattle stoically moving about in a snow storm and continues with the progress of a school minibus as it collects young children from farms and hamlets to take them along snowy tracks to the warm security of a stone schoolhouse and their kindly and sympathetic village schoolmaster.  He works alone dividing his attention between children from four to eleven years of age and somehow succeeds miraculously in catering for their wide variety of needs.  Shortly after their arrival I found a few doubts beginning to creep in on a first showing.  Some of the interaction between master and pupils seemed to go on for an inordinate amount of time.  When cinema adopts the role of recording the minutiae of the everyday without the discipline of the cutting scissors as happens here when the very young children in turn write the word Maman and there is an inquest on each does it not become a little like watching paint dry?  And yet  if ever a film deserves patience in overcoming its initial longeurs this is it.  What these opening sequences achieve is to help us know these children as individuals and to become better acquainted with the schoolmaster as he gradually emerges as an almost saintly figure in the way he handles the problems of his charges the two boys who fight the girl about to go to secondary school who cannot relate to others the boy who suddenly breaks down when he speaks of his father's illness and the tiny newcomer who cries for his mother.  Such very special moments transcend what could have been an otherwise rather mundane experience  these and the sheer beauty with which the director and his cameraman record the passing of the seasons.  The film concludes with the children saying goodbye to their teacher as they leave for their summer holiday.  At this point I felt enriched by this brief insight into their lives.  My tears were of gratitude for an experience that had touched me in so special a way.".

The main problem I have with many contemporary documentaries these days is that they tend to go for maximum entertainment and little else. Overly slick often gimmicky in nature with flash editing and a cynical tone they are instantly forgotten i.e. Super Size Me Inside Deep Throat Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room among many many others To be and To have beyond entertaining is an INSIGHTFUL look into us as human beings I know I know a movie about the human condition sounds corny or worse dull but it is far from either of those adjectives. The film follows a class of kinder gardeners in the French rural countryside for a year. It is both profound and simple to watch these children learn the everyday lessons of life. Even more amazing is that it does so without becoming overly sentimental or sugary. The film's point of view inevitably takes on that of a five year old finding magic and greatness in the everyday mundane aspects of life. Highlights When the teacher explains the concept of infinity to the children. Marie and Jojo in general are a delight. The handwriting lesson as insight into personality. I could go on and on.

	schema:reviewBody "Named as one of the best films of 2002 in the Film Comment poll of 59 international film critics To Be and To Have provides an insight into the learning process of thirteen children ages 4 to 10 in a oneroom schoolhouse during a sevenmonth period. The film is a tribute to the innocence of childhood and to the dedication of their teacher 55year old George Lopez. Director Nicolas Philibert selected Lopez' rural schoolhouse in the Auvergne region of southeast France from a list of 300 schools. As Philibert explained I wanted a school with a limited number of pupils so that each child would be easily identifiable and become a character in the film. I also wanted the fullest age range possible  from kindergarten to the final year of primary school  to show the atmosphere and charm of these small eclectic communities and the very specific work required from the teachers. Filming almost 600 hours of the children's daily activities with a crew of four Philibert allows us to reexperience the long forgotten frustrations of learning how to trace letters express our feelings verbally count until we run out of numbers and get along with our classmates. Mr. Lopez has taught in the same school for twenty year and has a unique ability to simply be with and respect children for who they are and what they say. He is a model of patience and an example of how to listen without making moral judgments or instant evaluations. He says of the teaching profession It takes time and personal involvement and the children return that again and again. Most of the children come from families who are not well educated but the film shows the parents struggling to do their best to solve the mysteries of their child's homework. To Be and To Have is also filled with humor as in a sequence when two very young students are fighting a losing battle with a photocopier and when a student insists on using the word pal instead of friend. Much time is spent observing a preschooler named Jojo with a very typical attention span. He is endearing but I would have liked a bit more exploration of Katherine who we find out at the end has a serious problem in communicating. Mr. Lopez works closely with each child showing sensitivity in the way he handles problems as when he asks two fighting students to imagine the effect their behavior has on others. Time and again he mediates disputes by helping children to communicate with each other as in the scene where he assists two older boys Julien and Olivier in understanding the reasons they got into a fight. You were just testing each other but then it degenerated no? he asks. The film begins in December with footage of snow falling on a herd of cows and continues until the following Summer. By the end we have come to know many of the students. When the teacher announces he is going to retire in another year the emotion on his face when the children plant kisses on his cheek as they say goodbye for their vacation was felt throughout the entire audience of 800 people. To Be and To Have celebrates the dedication of teachers whose unacknowledged labors make a profound difference in the lives of our children. A film of warmth and humanity it is the highest grossing French documentary of all time. Job well done Mr. Lopez and Mr. Phlibert.".

We don't really get to know the children or the teacher very well.  There seems to be very little taught in the school. The students are constantly writing out dictations and the teacher who is a very nice man and very kind to his students is seen having the same type of interactions with his students over and over.  After a while I became frustrated that we weren't really getting to know anyone in any depth...yes the teacher says kind and gentle things but it's like watching the same scene over and over.  Even the antics of the kids are cute but dull...in a year of filming these are the most interesting moments the director came up with?  Still a relaxing and sweet film.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS One of the most important parts of any childhood is the first few years of schooling. With a good teacher and a friendly environment a child can learn things which will help him for the rest of his life. Whether in Britain America France or elsewhere this stage is crucial to any developing child.Perhaps the most important thing about this young stage in life is how good your teacher is. If they know their stuff and can inspire children that teacher can have a permanent effect on a child. In 2002 documentary director Nicholas Philibert filmed a small class in a quiet French village. With beautiful landscapes and some amazing cinematography Philibert's Etre et avoir or To Be and To Have is an impressive work which reminds us of our own childhoods and shows just how much a good teacher can effect a child.Georges Lopez has been working at the same school in rural France for twenty years. With 18 months left till retirement Lopez will deep down always be a teacher. Inspiring a class of four to 11 year olds we are shown a period of time through which Lopez will demonstrate just how good a teacher can be.Whether the beautiful snow covered beginning to the summer conclusion the true beauty of Etre et avoir is the landscape and the way director Philibert shows it. Visually satisfying the documentary shows us images of an outside world where life flourishes.Inside the classroom the documentary is equally amazing. Whether it's Monsier Lopez dictating to the children or the often distracted Johan or JoJo lives are shaped in the classroom in front of the camera. The children are a varied collection of children who all love their teacher and who are taking part in one of the most important parts of their lives. Brilliantly shot the film manages to capture the teaching skills of Lopez whilst displaying the innocence of the children who love him.Ironically the finest moments in the documentary are actually away from the school. With parents helping their children with homework the difference in styles is brilliant. Whether it's the quiet parent watching their child work or the vocal family who all team up to help their child all the families involved are reminders of how crucial a family life can be too. That second mentioned family in particular also give us the funniest moment of the film where they bicker between themselves over whether the boy's homework is right or not. This is a normal hard working family and the scene is just yet another reminder of how real the story actually is.There's little point trying to deny that in terms of plot relatively little happens in this story. Unlike more recent American documentaries it doesn't have some major point which it tries to force across. What Etre et avoir does is that it reminds us of the innocence of childhood and our own school lives. It shows us how a brilliant teacher can inspire children and it reminds us that the early school years are crucial to a child's development. The story doesn't seem to literally go anywhere but just like everywhere else this real world demonstration demonstrates a gradual change over a period of time. Often the biggest plot developments are those which happen so gradually that you barely notice them.As a reminder of childhood Etre et avoir is a superb documentary. Mixing absolutely gorgeous landscape images with the lives of a small village the story shows us just how crucial these early years are for children. Georges Lopez is a superb teacher and combining his skills with a solid family life these children should be set for life. A masterful piece of film making.".

It stars George Lopez a french school teacher and his one room school house in rural France. He has about a dozen pupils from age 511 and we get to know them through their interactions with Lopez as well as visits with them at home. His classroom has never seen ADHD Learning Disabilities or Emotional handicaps. We only see children acting like children and he prepares them for the next stage of their education middle school. That's when these farm kids will leave his cloistered classroom and enter the 'real world.' I admire Mr.Lopez. He has known his whole life that he wanted to be a teacher and he has passion about his chosen career. If only our children could have this experience. Maybe they wouldn't be computer literate but they would have something more 6yrs with a strong sensitive moral male role model. In his school kids learn to communicate and to problem solve. We watch the highest art of teaching children to read write think and process.You won't believe that watching a year in the life of a one room school in France can be such a feelgood time. It will make you wish they had an episode each year so we could share the joy Lopez must feel to see his children grow. Like I said It's the way life should be.".

With the advent of digital technology there are many docs being made with digital video. And every once in a while it is a blessing to be able to see a documentary shot on film and on good old nostalgic 16mm. Not only does it bring back memories of documentaries from the preDV era but also it warms up the screen and makes the characters more personable. The editing is marvelous here. The attention to continuity of sound worked and gives us a nicely flowing picture. Most children are shot at eye level bringing us viewers face to face with them rather than seeing childrens heads from above the adult angle. The patience of the teacher is inspiring. The moments of kids with their families remind us of education as a collective community effort. And prizeful moments like the fear of a kid's first day at school or fights between two kids are beautifully documented events that most of us probably have been through in our school years. The almost cinemaverite approach avoids the monotonous talkinghead approach that many other documentaries like to use. Overall this film is very inspiring and pleasing.

Do go and watch this  don't take my word for it. Tongues in cheek are in season at the moment. The teacher is sincerity personified and the story of his Spanish father's migration to France his parents' financial sacrifices and the hidden sacrifices he has made in his life go to make this a story that is more interesting about the man than the children.

	schema:reviewBody "A documentary on a year in the life of a single teacher rural French primary school is on the face of it not riveting fare but I found this film insidiously charming. The style is rather like that of prewar British documentaries where the cinematographers attempted to make each shot a work of art. Every scene is perfectly lit framed and shot yet with great immediacy. The Aubergene setting is exploited to the utmost and Dogme 95 can go to Hell. I'm not sure what the title has to do with the film  I guess 'to serve them all my days ' has been already used.The naturalistic performances of the 'cast'  the middleaged teacher Lopez and his 13 pupils aged from 4 to 12 are no doubt helped by the fact that when you have a film crew around you for 5 months there comes a point when you forget they are there as some unfortunate NSW policeman found out in Jennie Brockie's doco 'Cop it Sweet' a few years ago. And of course the film makers here are showing us 100 minutes or so of the hundreds of hours they must have shot. What's left is not a tight narrative but a series of 'scenes from the lives' of the pupils and teacher. One or two of the kids are cute but they are an ordinary group and it must be said not always intellectually wellendowed. The curriculum relying strongly on rote learning is clearly outdated though Lopez does what he can with it relying on 'playway' methods. Part of his problem is that kids go to school at 4 in France and some are really too young for structured formal learning.We see a little of the lives of some of the kids outside the school such as Julien's hilarious homework session which becomes a kind of informal game show for the whole family. There's not much on Mr Lopez outside school though. A bachelor with a distant widowed mother he seems to have no personal life whatever. The only time we see him outside the school day he is doing a spot of marking. He is obviously totally involved in his work but he somehow maintains the necessary detachment and is able to give wise advice. Mr Lopez apparently sued the producers for 250000 Euros on the grounds they had 'appropriated his character'  I guess he wasn't paid and the film has done very well commercially. He cannot complain about his portrayal here where he comes across as an admirable teacher who derives a great deal of satisfaction from his profession. His pupils clearly appreciate his interest though he is a bit overwhelming for some of them at times. His chief virtue is his patience. I suspect his expectations are not terribly high 11 year old Julien for instance looks like he will end up on the family farm where he already operates the tractor with plenty of skill. But Mr Lopez does have his occasional small triumphs such as steering into friendship two boys who start out enemies.As I said this film turned out to be much easier to watch than I thought and that was partly due to the God of Small Things  a stream of minor incidents used to build up the story. There was the two kids the charming JoJo and his cute FrenchAsian friend Maria trying to operate the photocopying machine for example. How could that be funny? You'll see.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a while since I could forgo the details of a film's plot and just reiterate the title for reference. But that is exactly the shortcut I could take with Nude Nuns with Big Guns. The film as directed by Joseph Guzman is about well nude nuns with big guns. More specifically it follows Sister Sarah Asun Ortega who after becoming a nun is drugged and forced into a world of crime by the corrupt priests and padres of the clergy.But after a near fatal encounter Sister Sarah receives a message from God one that tells her to kill every last one of those that exploit drugs the church or any of the innocent workers of the clergy. Lucky for us a chance encounter leaves Sister Sarah with a big gun one big enough to help her do God's work in the most violent and exploitive ways possible. As Sarah sets off to religiously 'off' anyone that looks at her funny the church hires a bike gang called 'Los Muertos' to track down Sister Sarah and stop her before she brings down the entire drug running operation.Nude Nuns with Big Guns is undeniably 70's sexploitation brought to us with 2010 orchestrated violence. There are equal parts nudity and violence and there is plenty of each to keep audiences grinning from ear to ear with each new character introduction. Just about every female character but one bares her breasts for the film and I for one am a better man because of it. Sister Sarah in particular has no qualms about doing scenes involving full nudity between all her gunslinging and brain blasting. Priests nuns bikers lesbiansno one is safe once this sister straps herself with a sizeable firearm.There is a semblance of a story in Nude Nuns with Big Guns but the plot goes in usual directions ensuring that what it lacks in originality as a revenge flick it makes back up in sheer audacious and gratuitous nudity and violence.Asun Ortega is competent and evidently confident in the lead role and everyone involved in the production hams up their part with just enough cheese and lack of seriousness that the film actually works as a watchable piece of exploitation.Director Joseph Guzman takes a major step forward from his 2009 debut in Run! Bitch Run! While both Run and Nuns are of the same genre that Robert Rodriguez tried to capture with 2010's Machete Guzman has shown a maturity with both the camera and with the promotion of lurid subject matters.Nude Nuns with Big Guns isn't for everyone but it is for everyone that reads the title of the film before putting it into the DVD player or downloading through VOD. It is guaranteed to entertain while titillating and it proves that exploitation films are alive and can work given the right exposure and attention.www.killerreviews.com".

	schema:headline " An exploitation masterpiece that joyfully relishes and wallows in its excessive sleaze brutal violence and gratuitous sex! Hallelujah!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "If your looking for a movie that is a perfectly stylistic rendition of what a grindhouse movie from the seventies wanted to be but probably never was then this shocker has everything you've been waiting for with style to boot. What makes this movie a winner is not just it's excessive bloodshed in the form of bloody shotgun blasts to the upper torso of naked nuns multiple bloodspraying headshots leaving nice red meaty holes in the wideeyed gapedmouthed faces of the victims or a corrupt priest having bullets pounded systematically into him in the form of a cross. It is not the bevels of naked slave nuns forced to cut cocaine instead of contemplating Christ the rampant lesbianism involving strungout biker chicks and raptureseeking sisters of the cloth the endless parade of beautiful dancing barebreasted whores or the scenes of rape that are so visually exaggerated and overzealous that they are as stomachturning as they are comical. Neither is it the deliciously sadistic dialogue which ranges from surprisingly reverent insightful and philosophical to the downright racially profane colorfully sadistic and intimately vulgar. No.This movie is ALSO great because it is so wellmade. Despite other misguided hecklers who have denigrated the plot for being lacking in many regards the narrative structure is quite snakey sophisticated and intelligent using flashbacks and a veritable sideshow of sleazoid characters to interlink all the violence sex and perversion on screen while never failing to propel the twisted tale of Sister Sarah's vengeance full speed ahead towards it's ever increasing violent climax. Unlike in Kill Bill where Uma Thurman's character basically hops from one confrontation to the next in a tediously simplistic fashion Sister Sarah is surrounded by villainy and deceit in the form of psychotic bikers and sociopathic clergy all with their own agenda that is as equally threatening and as merciless as her own. The filmmakers and cast take considerable pleasure in fleshing out these unlikely though gleefully perverse situations and each scene and shot is greedily milked for every possible iota of sleaze moral filth and sexual violence that they are worth.Now technically the film is also a triumph of style lighting and cinematography. The images manage to look both grimy and crisp in all the right ways. The picture is lit with heated reds glowering dirty yellows and somehow is still able to present a crisp picture while capturing the grimy corrupt texture of every image without being compromised by the shadowy murkiness of its own polluted atmosphere. Every image in the movie is shown with perfect clarity and yet the movie never loses its grip on its own dirty vile charm for a second. Amazing. The pacing is another amazing feat. The filmmakers seem to pride themselves on keeping the action not only going but as volatile as possible without losing cohesion with constant zooms on exaggerated dramatic moments colored filters and repetitive images creating visceral shot montages and freeze frames to capture the moment of impact of many of the most violent scenes. The special effects are perfect for the movie's psychotic tone consisting mostly of perfectly formed gunshot wounds that look good enough to stick your finger into. One last thing to mention is also the superior music and sound effects which effortlessly capture the mood of each scene while enhancing the violence and tension both seen and unseen.Nude Nuns with Big Guns deserves it's praise not only for it's energy dedication to style certainty of character and unwavering delivery of all the violence and sex that have become iconic staples of the mythical exploitation genre but for being a beautiful piece of cinematic art full of style great lighting and cinematography deadon dialogue great character acting juicy plot and narrative and doing it all on a meager budget of what the IMDb site estimates to be 85000. For that alone it is an incredible feat but even if the budget were five times that much I would still considerate it to be an incredible masterpiece of filmmaking talent that is equal to and perhaps surpasses the likes of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantio. I may not be an exploitation cinema expert but from what ideologies and iconography I've absorbed out of all the lowbudget violencefilled and sexsoaked films I've watched when I think of an exploitation film this is exactly what I've imagined it to be.".

I sit through a lot of stuff that most people cannot abide a lot of 70s sexploitation and Japanese weirdness and Italian giallo and so on. But I'm sorry this movie is not fun funny or campy.For the first 50 minutes of the movie you get roughly four or five featuring the hero Sister Sarah doing the fun vigilante nun with a gun thing. The rest is rape fantasy after rape fantasy as the story largely follows a biker gang as they go about enjoying their rape. After a certain point it stops being Geez these guys are real baddies now let's blow 'em up to smithereens but what feels like hours worth of prolonged meaningless rape.Fact is there are a lot of movies that use the whole Strong woman character comes back to destroy the bad guys as an excuse to get away with rape fantasy and my patience for these narratives extend further than what is probably healthy but I have to draw a line at the point where the strong woman vigilante just... isn't there. She's written into the script but has no face time it's not ABOUT her Sister Sarah is not the hero of this show. Chavo the bike gang leader he's the one that holds the camera and pushes forward 90 of the narrative. He's the hero and he's just not given his just due. The movie treats his actions as if they should be entertaining but once you get passed the silliness of how they use the RodriguezTarantinoesque throwbackto70s titles in this movie there is nothing funny about what happens in this movie.So props to the title 'cause it got my attention but I'd recommend even bmovie fans give this one a pass. Even if you god help you find rape to be funny let me just reiterate that it drags and drags. Often when something not naked or guntoting is on screen endless dialog copied and pasted from other movies slurges across a poorly recorded soundtrack. So overall not much appealing behind such a titillating title.PolarisDiB".

The story could be presented in a 30 minute film. It's a good story for a depressing documentary not a action violence blood and gore film.

The lone innocent survivor is our heroine Sister Sarah Asun Ortega who is subsequently thrown into forced prostitution by the bikers and drugged out of her mind as she services the customers.As fate would have it however a kindhearted doctor I use that term loosely named Mr. Foo Maxie J.

Upon awakening Sister Sarah reveals that she has received the word of God which has entrusted her with dishing out some divine justice on those who did her wrong. Foo then proceeds to arm are with a pair of silver pistols to help her on her mission only to have Sarah put a bullet through his noggin not cool man. Thus begins our heroine's journey of hatefueled revenge served cold and hard with the most translucent metaphor for phallic aggression a lesbian nun can holster.Though short lived Mr. Foo is a pretty cool character equal parts Yoda and Tommy Chong Foo exudes a hipster charm that helps balance the darker elements of the story. Unfortunately what follows after his demise is bleak mess of boobs and talking plus more boobs with very little scenes of heavenly justice doled out and nowhere did I ever really see any big guns with great exception to scary ass Xango Henry as Kickstand a Dul Hill Psych lookalike. When the biggest threat of a film is a black man's genitals as he violates elderly nuns there's not much else that needs to be said.In the end as much as I wanted to like a film with a name as cool as Nude Nuns with Guns it simply didn't push any one boundary far enough. In fact I couldn't help but think that this was really lost footage from Machete given the overall borderland motif and badass Mexican bikers. It even goes so far as to riff on Rodriguez's Planet Terror theme from the RodriguezTarantino Grindhouse double feature. Yes there are nuns and they're generally nude. Yes there's softcore rape and bullets to the head. However a lack of any real action will likely see you walking away limp from this peep show long before the credits ever role.".

You get the picture.The films goal is only to show as many naked women as possible preferably having se x with each other. Plus a bunch of perfect head shots. Yes  all shots are to the head pretty much no exception.My eyes and ears started bleeding a little and a kitten died because I watched this.

	schema:reviewBody "Run! Bitch Run! director Joseph Guzman has produced a flavorful example of the vile Nunsploitation genre with his bloody blasphemous boobladen revengedriven actioneer Nude Nuns with Big Guns. Basically Nunsploitation grew out of the exploitation film movement in the 1970s. Nunsploitation movies were popular at the same time that the salacious expose womeninprison movies and degenerate Naziploitation movies were generating controversy in Europe. These thoroughly objectionable grindhouse movies appealed to amoral audiences that wanted to see the Catholic Church ridiculed without mercy for centuries of corrupt repressed sexually perverted clergy as well as nuns raping vulnerable nuns. Guzman has faithfully recreated this lowclass gradeZ genre and combined it with elements of biker films. Despite its obviously low budget and lack of celebrity talent Nude Nuns with Big Guns isn't totally beyond redemption. Instead as a comic payback in Hell epic Guzman's film appropriates those despicable themes and makes them surprisingly palatable on a remarkably shoestring budget. Moreover this movie doesn't have those obvious onetake scenes where everything is shown in one take. The opening bus scene for example appears to have been shot in at least two takes with the suitcases of cocaine lensed in a different take.In Nude Nuns with Big Guns a depraved priest is working handinhand with a Mexican gang selling them coke. One of the nuns steals a package of coke from evil biker gang chieftain Chavo. The villainous Hispanic murders two nuns in cold blood without blinking an eye and takes the third one as a gift from the angry priest. Naturally Chavo presses her into service to use as a whore. Nude Nuns with Big Guns is a savage bloodthirsty saga with rape murder and pillage galore. One of the brutalized nuns escapes Chavo's stronghold where she had been shot up with drugs and forced to commit horrendous sex acts. Sister Sarah Asun Ortega embarks on a onewoman crusade against these abominable dastards and kills them with extreme prejudice. Sarah shoots it out with a corrupt priest in a confessional box. The priest packs a small automatic pistol that he conceals in his Bible while Sarah is armed with a sawedoff doublebarreled shotgun. Guzman doesn't pull any punches in his depiction of all the violence. This is the kind of shootup drivein melodrama that Sin City director Robert Rodriguez could make because of its vivid loathsome subject matter. The biggest difference between Guzman's movie and the original European stuff in the 1970s is the humor. Nothing is to be taken seriously in this bulletriddled saga. After Sister Sarah escapes from Chavo's house of illrepute she arms herself with two large chromeplated revolvers and metes out death to sadistic priests and nuns who have taken advantage of her sister of the cloth. Indeed Guzman treads a thin line between fantasy and reality. With a bit of a push he could have gone completely overboard but even he must have felt the urge to exercise a modicum of restraint. Although it sounds like a lefthanded compliment Guzman succeeded in making a decent shootem up with atmospheric production values and Edwin M. Figueroa's solid wellcomposed photography. At the heart of all this mindless violence writhes the theme of female empowerment. The squeamish the tenderhearted and the religiousminded are strongly advised to shun this profane recreation of a defunct genre. Nude Nuns with Big Guns lives up to his premise and its advertising. At one point Sister Sarah invades a whorehouse kicks in doors and fires bursts from her Thompson machine in at the participants. The crowning glory occurs at the end when one nun that Chavo raped actually shoots him in the groin and we see the replica of a shredded penis hit the carpet. Not content to leave this to our imagination Chavo howls in agony and snatches up the fragment of his penis and stares in horror at it.".

That churches in a certain region may be corrupt should not be taken as offensive to the church as a whole but the treatment of the church may help explain some of the ones as well as reactions to my review. The film has mighty tough outlaw bikers but I as a rider from way back am in no way offended. There is good and back in practically anything and this film concentrates as many films on certain human failings. We human beings do do some bad things to one another. Very entertaining and not the low level film that one might suspect from the title. Oh and the ending. I mean at the very end the last scene. Nice. I did not see it coming and you won't guess.".

Also I am in no way associated with this movie.I feel it necessary to elaborate on what other's have said. If you are offended by any of the following don't see this movie heterosexual rape nudity exhibitions of lesbian sex extreme violence and or religious institutions being portrayed in an offensive manner.I am rating this movie a 8 based on the type of movie it is and how it was presented. It is a cheap not campy or comedic exploitation film. If you can try to imagine one of those old black and white porno comics full of tasteless violence bad sex and a unrealistic plot and you've got this movie. The difference is it's not a porno.The sex is neither explicit or erotic enough for that and the violence while somewhat graphic is certainly not as bad as I've seen in recent mainstream films Piranha 3D for example.In my opinion the acting is pretty good. The plot did flow and the dialog was delivered as intended.I have to compliment the director for the fact that the movie really does look like it was filmed in a backwater town of Mexico. It was actually filmed in California. Where did they find those cheesy buildings? You have to remember that sex if you can call it that isn't meant to be arousing nor was the plot meant to be believed. This film is designed to appeal to a specific audience which is one reason it isn't for everyone. It's a cult film in a strange genre not a cult classic. That's what it's supposed to be. You have to have bizarre taste to really enjoy it. But if you like 'nun exploitation films' Nude Nuns with Big Guns is probably for you.Now having said all that I will add this... it wasn't my cup of tea! The title got my attention. I don't like rape scenes and like my sex scenes to be erotic.One last thing I really liked the music in the closing credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yep 8 but you have to take it the right way.For starters  it IS excellently crafted. Beautiful shots of sunsets mixed in with the violence mixed in with the drugs give the whole thing a sense of surreal nightmare. That alone takes it out of the realms of trash into those of 'cult classic'. Secondly it's not a porn film even though there's a lot of nudity in it. It wasn't meant to be a porn flick. POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER ALERT  What the men do to the girls is meant to make you feel a little dirty a little ashamed it's done to put you on the girls' side so when the nun gets vengeance you're cheering her on. I sure was!  END OF POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER The music starts off as oneguitar dodginess but gets better and better until it's almost Ennio Morricone standard. True the Catholic Church isn't portrayed well but we know what the priests do to choirboys we've yet to learn what they do to nuns so maybe just maybe...And surrounding the whole movie is the ghosts of Clint Eastwood movies like a Fistful of Dollars. Somehow it's got the same atmosphere. Except you've got a nun in the Clint Eastwood part. She's seeking revenge just as Clint always did. And I found myself cheering her on all the way.Thing about the other reviewers here is they went into this movie with preconceptions and you can't do that with this one. Tons of nudity but is it a porno? Is any of it titillating? No  it isn't meant to be. POSSIBLE SPOILER COMING UP  Brutal sex scenes for sure but are they meant to turn you on? No they're meant to make you feel sorry for the woman and hate the man who's doing it to her so you're glad when the nun finds him. Priests selling drugs? That's clever  the cops would have to go through a lot of channels before they could stripsearch a priest or gatecrash a Church!  END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER.Overall impression? IF you go into this movie with no preconceptions with an open mind you'll find a beautifully made film that everyone concerned absolutely put their hearts and souls into. Are they great actors? No  but they're all genuinely trying their hearts out and the director got the best possible performances out of all of them. Is the story good? It's a VERY twisted Spaghetti Western for the 21st Century. You'll not have seen anything else quite like it  which for nowadays is saying something. Did I enjoy it? I've watched it twice and I got more out of the second viewing than the first. It's honestly got subtle depths if you open your mind enough to find them.If you're expecting a ton of titillating nudity and sex scenes to turn you on go watch a different movie. If you want to see a film that makes you feel angry and sad at how men humiliate women and glad when some of the men get what's coming to them and has a beautiful dark heart within it give Nude Nuns with Big Guns an openminded try. Jessica's right. It's a cult classic waiting to happen.Now if only I could find where to buy the soundtrack...Just found it  it's a legit. free download on Dan Gross the composer's website. If you're into GOOD Spaghetti Western style film music add this to your collection.ulrichburke".

	schema:headline " A Biopic That Asks Disturbing Questions";
	schema:reviewBody "Director and cowriter Alejandro Amenabar didn't make things easy for viewers of his taut a bit overlong but very disturbing story accurately based on a Spanish man's struggle to obtain assisted suicide. Mar Adentro The Sea Inside is gripping and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater.With the awardwinning Canadian movie The Barbarian Invasions folks got to see a family along with a coterie of devoted friends address the wish of a beloved albeit irascible man to end his life. In that movie the center of attention suffered from progressive incurable cancer and his descent into a terminal stage was fast. Emotional as the scenes were death was inevitable  the question was how gentle could it be made through solicited intervention.Ramon Sampedro brilliantly played by Javier Bardem is a different story. For well over two decades he's been a quadriplegic because of a diving accident. Very sharp viewers may detect a terrible irony as to why he ended in that condition because of his improvident dive. Once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women he now lies trapped in an immobile body his every need attended to by a truly devoted family who willingly surrender much of their privacy and time to sustain their beloved relation.Rosa Lola Duenas a single mom of two small boys enters the Sampedro household out of what might have been mere curiosity to learn about the paralyzed man's plight but she becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece for Ramon as well as an amusing but occasionally aggravating presence. A nice performance by Duenas.The problem of course is that Sampedro isn't sick in the normal sense. He may well live for decades more with proper care. So his softly but persistently voiced desire to end his life with dignity creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who not surprisingly react from different ethical and religious perspectives.Ramon is the poster quad of a group dedicated to changing Spain's laws concerning assisted suicide. Death with Dignity is their watchword. Gene Clara Segura is a sensitive activist who enlists the aid of pro bono publico counsel Julia Belen Rueda. Julia has her own health issues which carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a devoted spouse she bonds emotionally with her client.What follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife their technophile teenage son not the intellectual Ramon is and his aged dad who can't stop grieving over his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness.The moral and legal issues are played out through excellent acting and short vignettes including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account Ramon's feelings and views. It may be Spain but the issues are alive in most countries including the U.S.Especially amusing is a shouted first floor to bedroom debate between Ramon with a dropin lecturing Jesuit priest also a quadriplegic but one whose hidebound dogma casually masks the absence of a soul.Special kudos to Mabel Rivera Ramon's sisterinlawManuela for a wrenchingly authentic portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together. And the same compliment fulsomely extends to Belen Rueda Julia who segues from objective advocate to close friend to a woman hurtling towards a dark fate.The director imposes no value judgments allowing each character full range to express his or her feelings effectively and at times movingly. Like Dead Man Walking this movie can support any view about its deadly subject.No one can stop a person from committing suicide if heshe is determined but the universal tragedy of the world's Ramons is that without assistance life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals.The cinematography is wellmatched to the story and the beautiful Galician scenes are an intended contrast to the limited views the once globetrotting Ramon experiences from his special bed.910".

Happily married to a devoted spouse she bonds emotionally with her client.What follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife their technophile teenage son not the intellectual Ramon is and his aged dad who can't stop grieving over his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness.The moral and legal issues are played out through excellent acting and short vignettes including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account Ramon's feelings and views. It may be Spain but the issues are alive in most countries including the U.S.Especially amusing is a shouted first floor to bedroom debate between Ramon with a dropin lecturing Jesuit priest also a quadriplegic but one whose hidebound dogma casually masks the absence of a soul.Special kudos to Mabel Rivera Ramon's sisterinlawManuela for a wrenchingly authentic portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together. And the same compliment fulsomely extends to Belen Rueda Julia who segues from objective advocate to close friend to a woman hurtling towards a dark fate.The director imposes no value judgments allowing each character full range to express his or her feelings effectively and at times movingly. Like Dead Man Walking this movie can support any view about its deadly subject.No one can stop a person from committing suicide if heshe is determined but the universal tragedy of the world's Ramons is that without assistance life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals.The cinematography is wellmatched to the story and the beautiful Galician scenes are an intended contrast to the limited views the once globetrotting Ramon experiences from his special bed.910";

The experience is profoundly rewarding causing the intelligent viewer to make diverse reflexions over the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro' Alejandro Amenbar has surpassed the best he has done to date and even redeemed certain deviations in his earlier films which smacked a little of being aimed at Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem put to music Hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this tinglingly inspired human  and humane  story.In no way should one interpret 'Mar Adentro' as an apologia for euthanasia this story based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramn Sampedro is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love a reaching out for human compassion for understanding emotions. Sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the Galician coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed. 'Condenado a vivir' 2001 TV was the first version of this man's life on which I have already commented. However Amenbar has succeeded remarkably at portraying this man with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humour in an equally articulate and intelligent way.And Javier Bardem rose to the occasion met the challenge headon complete with a Galician accent producing an electrifying compelling enthralling performance such that the actor and the fisherman become fused into being the same person on screen. Here indeed is an occasion to doff your cap and softly mutter 'chapeau'. Bardem is driven on in his task by a magnificent cast especially Beln Rueda Lola Dueas Mabel Rivera Celso Bugallo Los Lunes al Sol qv and Clara Segura Galician and Catalan accents taking prominent part. Amenbar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves oneonone or in groups with excellent chemistry thus demonstrating that this young Chileanborn Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results his global concept of the film includes his own music interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's recordplayer.Whilst viewing 'Mar Adentro' I found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' qv. I refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene.Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is superb as usual. As I have mentioned elsewhere on IMDb he does not simply film the events and scenes  he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment deftly catches that look in the eyes light and shadows such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story. A superb artist.'Mar Adentro' is another landmark in the history of Spanish cinematography among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. This film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as 'El Sur' qv 'Los Santos Inocentes' qv 'El Abuelo' qv 'La Lengua de las Mariposas' qv 'Las Ratas' qv 'A Los Que Aman' qv and I think I must add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' qv.Superbly orchestrated story of a real man and those who loved him around his bedside not to be missed.".

This is a movie that has been rewarded with numerous accolades not only in Spain but throughout the world wherever this wonderful movie has been shown.If you have not seen the film perhaps you would like to stop here.Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed. Being quadriplegic he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything. Since his accident Ramon only thinks in one thing alone how to end his life! This is the moral issue at the center of the story based on the real Ramon Sampedro's life.Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. After all he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case became a cause celebre in favor of euthanasia a theme that no one in that country wanted to deal with in Spain.With its background of being a predominantly Roman Catholic country Spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in Europe a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator. Yet in spite of the advances in that society the idea of taking one's own life is something not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country.Ramon Sampedro was a man that loved life. He lived an intense life as a young man when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world. Having no money this was the only way for him to see other lands experience other cultures. Ramon's love affair with the sea is something that people in Galicia learn to love from their childhood. Imagine how that same friendly sea is the one that takes away Ramon's life as he knew it! In a second Ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable!Ramon's family is shattered by the experience. Suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. His brother and sisterinlaw are stoic people that deal with the situation as a matter of fact. Their lives become something of an afterthought because Ramon's life comes first. They tend to the sick man without protesting or blaming Ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive.That is why in their minds the Sampedros can't comprehend Ramon's wishes to end it all. Haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him? This moral issue weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people because in their minds they are doing what came naturally.The second subject of the movie is the legal issue of the euthanasia and the well meaning people that suddenly enter Ramon's life in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering. There's Julia the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare malady. There is Rosa the fish cannery worker who becomes infatuated with Ramon. Javier Bardem makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. His transformation is total. We don't doubt from one moment he is no one else but the paralyzed man on that bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face in order to convey all the emotions trapped inside Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This is perhaps Javier Bardem's best role of his career. He surpasses his own award winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas the late Cuban poet he portrayed in Before Night Falls. In the supporting roles Belen Rueda makes an impressive appearance as Julia the woman fighting her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa the kindred soul that loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo as Ramon's brother shows a man at a crossroads of his own life. Mabel Rivera makes a compassionate Manuela the sisterinlaw that never asks anything of life but tends to Ramon without questioning why she has to do it at all.Mr. Amenabar also has composed the haunting music score for the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Mar Adentro Out at Sea would be the better translation last Sunday. The movie is powerful and moving as was the true story of Ramn Sampedro a quadriplegic from a coastal village in Galicia Northwest Spain. Sampedro lived for 27 years lying in a bed unable to move but his neck and face needing help and attention with everyday needs and fighting a battle to obtain legal permission for somebody to assist him in his suicide. A sensitive and articulate man Sampedro wrote with his mouth gave television interviews and captivated the Spanish public with his good humour his wit his intelligence and his dramatic and wellreasoned determination to be able to control his life and death. The legal battle was predictably lost but Sampedro died anyway. It is no small feat that this reallife story remains as poignant on screen as it was in reality. Amenbar has intelligently stayed close to the real characters and their surroundings. Beautiful landscapes an outstanding score most of it by Amenbar himself played and arranged by Carlos Nez. The cast is prodigious overall. Bardem's performance as Sampedro is superb even in points such as the slight Galician accent convincing and never overdone. Few actors have so dominated a movie despite the limitations inherent in playing a quadriplegic. Mabel Rivera outshines the rest of the supporting cast as Sampedro's unselfish undemanding loving sisterinlaw. Beln Rueda gives a competent performance as Julia one of Sampedro's pro bono lawyers who suffers from a degenerative disease herself and is considering euthanasia. But her character is a weak presence in the movie and only makes sense towards the end when her disease has deprived her of the ability to choose. Most troublesome is the unconvincing love story between Julia and Sampedro this may have been an attempt in my view failed and superfluous to underline how seductive a character Sampedro was Bardem should have been trusted on that without this superficial prop. The multiplicity of characters combined with the slowpace majestic rhythm of the movie punctuated by flights over breathtaking landscapes and the repetition of the scene of Sampedro's accident are at odds with how many layers of complexity Amenbar can show in the time of a movie. And this may be the source of one of its few weaknesses we are left with a slightly manichean view of things. For example the only two characters not supportive of Sampedro's decision to die are slightly or grossly caricatured one of them a quadriplegic priest provides one of the intensely comic moments of the film. This in turn is one of the many merits of the movie faithful to Sampedro's personality there is humour there is wit there are moments to laugh Sampedro asks Julia for a cigarette she reminds him that he does not smoke he replies I know but what if it kills me?. This is not a depressing movie but a movie about the irreductible freedom of the human being about dignity about love about selfsacrifice. And about our bonds to our fellow humans how we create them how we nourish them how we abuse them and how we must realize painful as it may be that we have no rights over other people's lives. Films like Mar Adentro remind you what moviemaking is or should be about.".

	schema:headline " Sensitive Drama About a Polemic Theme";
	schema:reviewBody "In Spain the former sailor Ramn Sampedro Javier Bardem has been quadriplegic for twentyeight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend Gne Clara Segura. Ramn is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause Julia Beln Rueda who has a degenerative fatal disease and meets Rosa Lola Dueas a lonely worker that has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of Rosa and Julia.The Chilean Alejandro Amenbar is in my opinion one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography released in Brazil is composed by excellent and original movies Abre Los Ojos Tesis The Others and Mar Adentro. Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the present days. Their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme the right of committing euthanasia. This drama is never corny or depressive since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations. The performances of the cast are perfect with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme. The dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noted in IMDb plot outline that this movie is based on the reallife story of Ramn Sampedro. Unfortunately neither the movie nor the DVD gives this important information. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Mar Adentro Sea Inside".

	onyx:emotionText "In Spain the former sailor Ramn Sampedro Javier Bardem has been quadriplegic for twentyeight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend Gne Clara Segura. Ramn is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause Julia Beln Rueda who has a degenerative fatal disease and meets Rosa Lola Dueas a lonely worker that has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of Rosa and Julia.The Chilean Alejandro Amenbar is in my opinion one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography released in Brazil is composed by excellent and original movies Abre Los Ojos Tesis The Others and Mar Adentro. Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the present days. Their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme the right of committing euthanasia. This drama is never corny or depressive since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations. The performances of the cast are perfect with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme. The dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noted in IMDb plot outline that this movie is based on the reallife story of Ramn Sampedro. Unfortunately neither the movie nor the DVD gives this important information.

	schema:headline " Amenabar's mastery at the service of a True Story";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the privilege to watch Mar Adentro last Friday and I am still shocked by its beauty the powerful work of every single actor and actress and Amenabar's unbelievable ability to narrate the story of Ramn Sampedro who was well known in Spain for asking for a legal euthanasia lost the court cause and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison freezing all our hearts with his determination not to go on living forever immobilized because of an accident. Before watching the movie I was already mesmerized by the strong symbology in its title which I would translate as Into the Sea and not as some suggest Out to sea and which is taken from an original poem written by the man this story is about. Then I watched the movie. Oh my friends. This is Cinema with a capital C. The narration flows to take you to the heart of every single character Sampedro reincarnated in a Bardem that you forget from the very beginning is in the center as a man full of sense of humour and full of hope and his hope is to die because for him the life he is living is not worthy to be lived. The rest of the characters but one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as a human independent being forgetting he depends on the others for everything even though they do love him so much. And this is what the movie is about love. You can feel it you can breathe it in the skin of every character. You witness the growing of the feeling within three women who meet him in the movie Gen the member of the association that defend his right to die with dignity his friend her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones that can live a normal life in this world Rosa the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her Julia the woman who shares a tragic destiny with Ramn and eventually acts in a way we cannot but only understand.However before meeting these women Ramn knew what was love like because you cannot meet him without loving him and he is deeply loved by his abnegated family Four characters unique in their humbleness and bravery each with their own thoughts about his decision each thought respectable in its own way because the terrible thing about this story is that nobody is to blame for what happened. That sadly life sometimes is that terrible. From this familiar quartet I specially liked Mabel Rivera's work as Ramn's sister in law Manuela a terrific performance.I would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best climax points I have seen in a long time and if you haven't seen the movie don't read this pass over this paragraph and read again from the next one starting Mar adentro let the movie show its secrets to you. The episodes I loved were 3. The best love scene I have seen in a movie when I really felt love invading the screen is when Ramn dreams awake that he is flying to meet Julia in the beach and they kiss each other. 2. Gen speaking by phone with Ramn the day before he is going to do it and he tells her it is better they say goodbye at that very moment not to put her in trouble with the authorities. And then she knows it is the last time they are going to talk and she has fought for his right to die... but she does not want to lose him because she loves him as a true friend and even though she is respecting his decision at all cost. 1. The best. A young Ramn in the beach looking at his girlfriend under the sun jumping to the water from the rocks to a sea that is retreating. We see the crash we hear his voice recalling what happened and claiming he should have died that very moment. The face of Bardem face downward shown to us from the bottom. And the hand of a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others like the impressive ending in spite of the fact that in Spain we know too well what Ramon did.Mar adentro did not deceive me Amenabar never does but this time he has to thank the actors that took part in the project and who maybe took it personally because this is not just a movie it is an elegy to a man who died alone when he was asking to die legally which meant for him as Bardem pointed out dying with the people he loved and who loved him around.".

	schema:headline " Mostly excellent story of a man who wants out of life";
	schema:reviewBody "The true story of a Spanish paraplegic Ramn Sampedro who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized. This film along with the Best Picture winner of the same year Million Dollar Baby caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death. Both advocates for the disabled and unfortunately for the disability advocates conservative prolife groups protested both films and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle just to put it all in some historical perspective. The protests especially from the disability groups against Million Dollar Baby make some sense  the film clearly depicted without wavering the life of a paraplegic as worthless. The film's central character Maggie Fitzgerald becomes a paraplegic doesn't seem to get any counseling whatsoever no help whatsoever and immediately wants to die. The film is honestly pretty dumb and uncomplex. The Sea Inside based on the true story is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject. It most likely got railroaded into the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its protesters having even seen it an incredibly common phenomenon. The film does give time to many different sides of the argument. And it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. It is guilty of a couple of crimes though and I'd still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. First and foremost there's the protagonist's meeting with a paraplegic bishop. I don't look kindly on the way he's depicted. His orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd and there's almost a comic sequence where his effeminate boytoy servants are dragging him in his chair up the stairs. He can't even reach the room in which Ramn is located and one of the boytoys is forced to carry the conversation between them. I had to think gee maybe if Ramn lived in a slightly more wheelchairaccessible household he wouldn't spend his entire life in bed and might find life more fulfilling who knows how closely the film depicts the reality. Director Amenbar The Others also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more lifeaffirming like a crosscut sequence where Ramn looks thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born. But besides a few ugly moments the film is very good. It hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. However in the end our lives do belong to us. Shouldn't we have the right to choose? The film's strongest asset is its supporting characters and the actors who play them. It depicts how Ramn's fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision. The family members in particular are great and Ramn's final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and had me in tears. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueas whom I also felt gave the best or at least certainly most undervalued performance in Almodvar's Volver last year.".

	schema:headline " Reviewing the film not the ideological issues";
	schema:reviewBody "As I expected would happen too many reviews of this film from professionals and amateurs alike have focused as much if not more on the film's ideology. That's because The Sea Inside aka Mar adentro is a film about euthanasia. Specifically it's a true story about an infamous Galician named Ramn Sampedro who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide who was denied that right by the Spanish constitutional court and whowell I don't want to ruin the ending of the film for you.The real life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with producerdirectorwritercomposereditor Alejandro Amenbar's Abre Los Ojos 1997 and The Others 2001 biopic The Sea Inside another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issue.But as I keep saying to deaf ears? your opinion pro or con on the film's ideology shouldn't affect your rating of the film. You're not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that Amenbar wants to make. You're supposed to be rating the film as a film. Maybe that's a bit too idealistic as none of us can likely completely divorce our evaluations from our ideological biases but idealistic or not that's the goal.So forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment. As a film Amenbar has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date. He does not focus on societal debates. He does not focus on Sampedro's legalpolitical struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man living out his days confined to a bed in his brother's home.Sampedro played here in an amazing performance by Javier Bardem was a quadriplegic. As the film begins he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years. That condition was brought about as Amenbar shows us through marvelously shot flashbacks by a diving accidentSampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman miscalculated the water dove in snapped his neck and almost drowned. As a quadriplegic he eventually began writing poetry some of which was published in a book entitled Cartas Desde El Infierno Letters from Hell in real life Sampedro's book became a best seller in Spain. Perhaps taking Sampedro's artistic work as a cue Amenbar has created an elegantly poetic film.Most of The Sea Inside is set inside Sampedro's bedroom. The focus in these scenes is Bardem's complex and sublime performance. As a quadriplegic Bardem is limited to moving his head and talking. He has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenbar have Sampedro often waxing philosophical in understated speech but there's always a combination of a wicked sense of humor passion for the aestheticincluding music and women and a sadness and even occasionally bitterness not far below the surface. Different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the ocean.The people Sampedro interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways. These others include his sisterinlaw Manuela Mabel Rivera who has been his chief caretaker since Sampedro's accident his brother Jos Celso Bugallo who is one of the vocal objectors to Sampedro's wish to die and with whom there is an underlying unresolved issue it seems like maybe Jos was the one to save Sampedro from drowning? his nephew Javier Tamar Novas who is perhaps the most understanding towards him a righttodie advocate Gen Clara Segura a pro bono lawyer Julia Beln Rueda whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease CADASIL Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy and would thus by more empathic and who he falls in love with and Rosa Lola Dueas a local woman who works at a cannery and moonlights as a DJ who heard about him from the media who wants to convince him to desire to live and who falls in love with him.The bulk of the film consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his room. There are also a few other ancillary characters including Sampedro's father who remains oddly distant and a notorious and mediaconscious priest Padre Francisco Jos Mara Pou who does his best to change Sampedro's mind via philosophytheology in a scene often mistakenly characterized as comicit has an attendant comic element but the scene is primarily very serious.That most of the film takes place in Sampedro's room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact. Sampedro's room has a nice big window which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world. Maybe even more importantly he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the hillsides to the ocean which he always loved and which has been the most influential force in his lifeit provided his living when he was younger and took his mobility away. Amenbar gives us a fantastical sequence of Sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea. It is beautifully shot with low angles presumably from a helicopter of the hills rushing by until we follow a stream to the wideopen ocean which in this film represents freedom the infinite and natural forces.The other significant change of setting arrives with Sampedro finally taking to a wheelchair he otherwise refused them saying they mocked his immobility to make an appearance in court to help plead his case. Amenbar gives us a poignant melancholy travelogue shot subjectively of Sampedro viewing life and the world in action from the car window.Whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not it's difficult to deny that this is a wellacted wellscripted and wellconstructed film. You may not believe that it's a ten and that's even more unlikely if you disagree with legalizing euthanasia but it's still worth watching as a fine example of artistic sophisticated filmmaking.".

Nec plus ultra and it supports my opinion that Spain produces the best cinematography of all countries lately. The story inspired from realityis scripted to emotional perfection.

Justly awarded for this movie he has carved a solid name for himself in cinema.Javier Bardem gives probably the best performance of his career though I really hope he is able of even more in the future. European Film Awards granted him aptly the Best Actor prize that year. For a movie about the very lack of mobility with most scenes in a room with a bed and little more for a character that moves eyes and eyebrows Bardem is a wonder in the acting guild. Another noted performance of Bardem would be his deliciously versatile act in Before Night Falls The supporting actors deliver strong scenes especially Belen Rueda Julia. Some review this film as being a debate on an issue. It is but also far more than that. It is the essence of humanity makes you think makes you cry.

This is the story of Ramon Sampedro a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the traces of an afternoon made for TV melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar cowrite in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY. There is a few laughs spare a long the way like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct Sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie. It is a heartbreaking experience specially when Sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die but when you strip a man of his dreams The film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with Sampedro. That's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie. Bardem was not granted his second Oscar nomination probably in favour of Eastwood but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD where the acting looked effortless and I reckon Bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur. I was never fond of his early work but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH he is on a roll LOS LUNES AL SOL THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and the Oscar nominated BEFORE THE NIGHT FALLS made him an international star and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how Bardem has now become a real reference for Spanish cinema in the whole world.

	schema:reviewBody "I had planned to ignore The Sea Inside after initially viewing it assuming it would be another one of these small films that would creep out of the theaters unnoticed and forgotten. To my dismay it was recently nominated by the Academy for Best Foreign Film over deserving films like House of Flying Daggers bleakly ensuring Sea a run of at least another two months. So I feel it my duty to break the bad news for the critics who wept for this film The Sea Inside is a terrible and terribly simple movie. This does not take away from the excellent performance by Javier Bardem who in the film plays a quadriplegic named Ramon condemned to a life in bed. As Bardem spends most of the movie under sheets the role is exceedingly more difficult than the casual filmgoer may be led to believe. In short it's a masterful job of communicating charisma and pathos through facial tics alone. In the hands  or more aptly face  of a less capable actor this role could be not just profoundly boring but terribly frustrating. Bardem the great actor he is commits a fine face to the screen. Of course in all fairness since he IS lying on his back for a good portion of the film it's not the most difficult role ever created. I got a small kick out of seeing him move his head around with that brush just for the fact that there was finally some movement in his dreary dun bedroom.With that out of the way now we can criticize this sappy proselytism. The basic plot line is simple and straightforward and you can read it from the many other reviews on this site. What is not commented on is the dreadfully mawkish manner in which director Alejandro Amenabar chooses to tell his story. Every character gets his and her cameo to shed a tear with an 's' in some cases and Amenabar insipidly captures this sentimentality in gross closeup after closeup. Let's face it folks Amenabar is no D.W. Griffith and these grieving mugs aren't in the same league as Lillian Gish. Hell I'd even settle for Julianne Moore's Gretta Garbo imitation here. But  as the director prods us on  can't we see the sorrow and grief that not supporting euthanasia is causing? Yes and that's all we see. Amenabar relies on this type of manipulation for two hours to push his agenda. Let me put it simply any hack can plunge the knife in our hearts and twist. In my mind The Sea Inside mines territory covered by Stepmom by Beaches by Terms of Endearment. This is not intended as a complement.Amenabar might think he's making waves but he's really just treading water and going nowhere in his sea of tears as he preaches his sermon. Rather than present an argument for euthanasia Amenabar settles for cheap good vs. evil storytelling. The chief flaw in this type of presentation about an actual social problem not only in Spain but also in most of the world is that there is absolutely no conflict of views. Believers in euthanasia are obviously understanding and sympathetic in the film detractors of it are pious religious types with no brains of their own intent on oppressing one's life for selfish and ignorant beliefs. Excuse me if this isn't simplifying the subject all as the film clumsily sidesteps any moral or social dilemmas this topic has clearly had an effect on in society. Hamhanded attempts at equalizing discussion such as a mildly amusing debate between Ramon and another crippled priest are not as even as they may seem. I include debate in scare quotes because there really isn't even a reasonable battle of argument the film clearly sides with RIGHT Ramon and his irreplaceable wit over the less articulate stubborn and clearly WRONG priest. By showing scenes like this Amenabar doesn't want to challenge his own views and instead piles on more hypocrisy and ad hominem by attacking Ramon's family rather than the issue of euthanasia itself. These instances are just a couple in many the courtroom scene the sympathetic lawyer the didactic conclusion that show how gutless singlemindedness can ruin a potentially good premise.Those looking to be converted need not see Sea. Like Michael Moore and Fahrenheit 911 like Mel Gibson and The Passion of the Christ Amenabar here a proud liberal is only interested in addressing likeminded fans who agree with him. He sticks to his understanding of a sole idea slavishly and ostentatiously. T.S. Eliot you may recall said of Henry James that the writer had too fine a mind to be violated by a single idea. This film on the other hand seems entirely to be the violation of a single idea the unquestionable and unchallenged correctness  and political correctness  of the verity of euthanasia. I guess it's what we thought all along anyway right?".

	schema:headline " So much LIFE in a movie about death";
	schema:reviewBody "Ramon Sampedro has been a quadriplegic for nearly three decades as a result of an accident in his midtwenties. Restricted to movements from only neck and up he is under the tireless care of his family of four a loving widower father a stubbonly religious and honest brother a sisterinlaw who treats him like her own son and a sensible though not particularly intellectual nephew. This film is about Ramon's sober calm but fiercely determined effort to seek consent from the Spanish courts for euthanasia.This is not an emotional decision. His life after the accident has not been devoid of bliss. He is blessed with a loving and caring family that makes his handicap less difficult to endure. He is talented and his talent is gratified in his ability to write beautiful poetry and he has learned to cry with a smile. After 26 years inertia alone might sustain his carrying on. But he says he no longer wants to live without dignity. I think the real reason for him to want to die particularly at this point may be that he no longer wants to be a burden to his family. His father while still healthy is old. His brother and sisterinlaw are both older than he. His nephew will finish school soon and deserves to focus on his future and career.Here comes the biggest irony. We see so much zeal energy vitality and LIFE in Ramon's quest to seek death. Through his good friend and deathright activist Gene and her husband he engages a lawyer to fight the legal battle culminating in his yielding his resistance to wheelchairs so as to be able to appear in court to demonstrate that his is a fully rational and responsible man capable of making a wellreasoned decisions. Interesting to note that during this time Gene is pregnant and the scene of childbirth punctuates Ramon's effort to gain death.Julia the lawyer undertaking his case is a gentle perceptive woman happily married but suffering herself from a disease that progressively destroys her first putting her in a wheelchair and eventually damaging her brain. What we see in most of the film though is the development of a wonderful love story between Ramon and Julia from their working on the case their gradually understanding appreciating and empathizing with each other and Julia's helping Ramon to get his poetry published.Another woman that comes into Ramon's life is Rosa a divorced factory worker with two children. Rosa has read about Raman and wants to persuade him to continue to embrace life. Not at Ramon's intellectual plane but shrewd in her own way Rosa soon falls in love with him. At the end she become the one who helps Ramon to gain his wish after the court turns down his request.The most remarkable thing about this film is that it is so full on life. Part of this is in the vivid energy with which Ramon pursues his purpose so vibrant that you sometimes forget that this purpose is death. Part of this is in another line of activity  first the discovery then the publishing of Ramon's poetry. But mostly it is in Ramon himself. If there is selfpity you see very little of it. He is articulate in his arguments and firm in his conviction. He can be irritable but he can also be humorous and gentle. He is intelligent and charming so much so that both Julia and Rosa from very different backgrounds fall in love with him almost instantly. And all these are portrayed by Javier Bardem acting from only his neck up. Surely language should not be a barrier to his winning the Best Actor Oscar this year.This film is rich in every aspect deeply moving at times hilarious funny at others. The cast is wonderful. In addition to the two women who fall in love with Ramon played by Belen Rueda Julia and Lola Duenas Rosa special mention must be made of Mabel Rivera whose simple and enduring goodness as Manuela the sisterinlaw will surely break the hardest heart.For an artistically splendorous scene everyone will remember Ramon's flight out of the window over the vales to yonder lovely shore under the rousing music of probably the most popular tenors' showoff aria Nessun Dorma.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SEA INSIDE 2004  Javier Bardem Belen Rueda Lola Duenas Mabel Rivera Celso Bugallo Joan Dalmau Alberto Jimenez Tamar Novas Francesc Garrido Jose Maria Pou Alberto Amarilla Nicolas Fernandez Luna.Dir Alejandro AmenabarAn inspiring tale of a living death Bardem is superbThe true life account of Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedro and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia by the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration but this film is just that.Sampedro played superbly by Bardem was a virile energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic diving accident recounted horrifically in flashback with a visceral jolt to the senses and for nearly thirty years lay paralyzed in bed while his loving family cared to his every need. Although his abilities to move were nil his mind was very much active and proved skillful as an inventor poet author and artist that kept his mind busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his stunted condition.Enter beautiful yet also afflicted with a crippling disease attorney Julia the ethereal Rueda who matches Bardem beautifully as if they were indeed soul mates is hired to see through Sampedro's final wish to end his life and in turn becomes an aide de camp when he begins to open up to her like to no one ever before. Not too long has time passed and Julia begins to investigate her charge's past discovering many letters hidden away by his family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this he at first is reluctant to discuss any thing with her but eventually he agrees with her that this may help his case and the project becomes a book in the making  a memoirbiography by way of freestyle poetry and prose. The film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love eventually triumphs over heart ache in many forms including for Ramon the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named Rosa Duenas a single mother who sees him on TV one day inspiring her to bicycle to his remote farmhouse in Spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life.Filmmaker Amenabar who cowrote with Mateo Gil the fascinating screenplay allows some fantasy into the mix when Ramon envisions himself magically leaving his bed and flying across the bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not a complete downer with a sly wit and occasionally humorous tone throughout that doesn't dilute the impact of the story's final act. Kudos also to the remarkable makeup job by James and Jo Allen do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant Bardem to an aging man to full effect that should get them an Acadamy Award nod. Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite Rueda's Julia being married to a loving doting husband that a pair of people so made for one another it is down right impossible they were never together to begin with. That's just one of the cruelties that rings true but it is not by definition of the film as its whole it is a mustsee and one of the year's best.".

	schema:headline " Multiawardedwinner based on realcase notorious in Spain of a paraplegic who wants to die  including a wronged message  proeuthanasia";
	schema:reviewBody "The factual story of Spaniard Ramon Sampedro a nearunrecognisable Javier Bardem whose unflashy expertise acting does justice to him and his cause  who fought to wish to die  a thirtyyear campaign in favor of euthanasia and his own right to pass away . Meanwhile  Ramon tries to stimulate his fertile but frustrated imagination . Ramon is tired of being a burden to his family  friends and an object of pity to others . He's even more tired of the Spanish government when his advocate in law Marc Francesc Garrido defends his case and Court refuses to allow him an assisted suicide means he can't attain the dignity in death he feels he's denied in life . Film explores Ramn's relationships with his family  sisterinlaw Mabel Rivera  oldest brother Celso Bugallo  grandfather Joan Dalmau  and two women Julia Belen Rueda  a lawyer who supports his cause and helps him his published memories  and Rosa Lola Dueas  a local woman who wants to convince him that life is worth living and mostly attempts to persuade him to carry on . This is a feeling drama plenty of sensibility  emotion dramatic moments  hugely engaging interpretations and sense of style . Direction  cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe soundtrack also by Amenbar all are assured and respectful . It is a superior uplifting Weepie with some manipulative limitations that entail the story . This is the second Spanish movie about Ramon Sampedro's life the first one was Condenado a Vivir 2001 by Robert Bodegas . It deals with a titanic fight carried out by the Galician exsailor against government  Justice and Catholic Church represented by another quadriplegic  a priest perfectly played by Jose Maria Pou . Very good acting by Javier Bardem as terribly restrictive quadriplegic confined to his bed with just books and the sight of the Galician hills outside his window . For international spectators the main attraction will surely be the immensely charming  very expressive acting of a magnificent Javier Bardem . Special mention to Belen Rueda as an adoring lawyer  however  when Beln Rueda was phoned to be informed about she had just been chosen to play a role in an Amenbar film she hung up  as she thought they were kidding her  from now on  she obtained a lot of important roles such as The orphanage The Julia's eyes  The body Septimo No Tengas Miedo among others . This was the most awarded Spanish movie at the Goya Awards winning 14 of the 15 awards for which it was nominated . Selected by the Spanish Cinematographic Academy to represent Spain in the Best Foreign Language Film Category of the 2004 Oscars. The motion picture was compellingly written along with Mateo Gil and directed by Alejandro Amenbar . Alejandro's slickness ensures entertainment  amusement and many engaging moments . Since his perhaps bestknown early shortfilm Himenptero in 1992 in which he directed  produced acted and wrote the script and the music Amenbar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with Thesis Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut  a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And Abre Los Ojos that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky 2001 starring Tom Cruise who in The others was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . Los Otros 2001 was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky 2001 the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabr''s Abre Los Ojos 1997. Ironically it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . Los Otros confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenbar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the alltime worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music as well as composing the music for other films  most notably Butterflies tongue 1999. He subsequently directed this Mar Adentro with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epichistorical Agora with Rachel Weisz . Rating  Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching .".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sea Inside is a fantastic Spanish film starring Javier Bardem as a quadriplegic who wants to end his life with dignity. I know that a lot of people will condemn this film for supporting euthanasia and giving a onesided debate but this isn't a film about a euthanasia debate. It's not something a religious studies teacher will put on for their GCSE class. The Sea Inside is simply about Ramon and the brilliantly written characters which surround him. I firstly have to praise the outstanding performances in this film. Javier Bardem is extraordinary as Ramon and manages to pull off a string of different emotions without using any part of his body aside from his head of course. It's a magnificent performance and far from his psychopathic Sugar in No Country For Old Men. Belen Rueda a somewhat underrated actress is also breathtaking in her role as a lawyer befriending Ramon and suffering from a life threatening disease herself.The Sea Inside manages to captivate its viewers for its entire two hour running time which is no mean feat for a film largely set in a man's bedroom. Alejandro Amenbar's directing is often extraordinary and always captivating. There's a magnificently heartbreaking moment where Ramon imagines getting out of bed and flies out of the window to the operatic tune of Nessun Dorma. The fluid camera work is quite extraordinary and dreamlike. It perfectly captures Ramon's desire to be free and makes us all appreciate the use of our able bodies.Alejandro Amenbar's screen writing screens are also quite brilliant. Whilst the film does have plenty of emotionally draining moments there are also plenty of uplifting ones too to make you smile. He makes Ramon a sympathetic and extremely likable character as well as the goodnatured people who surround him. I especially enjoyed the romantic subplot which is sure to pull at anyone's heart strings. The Sea Inside largely works so well because of its magnificent characters and powerful dialogue.The film is all the more painful to watch because we know how it's going to end. The suicide scene is pretty intense to watch with the camera stationary allowing us to see Ramon die almost like in real time. And whilst the film may not be as relentlessly painful to watch as say Amour it still has plenty of powerful moments and many did actually pull on my tear ducts which is a very rare thing for me. The only films to actually make me cry are Amour and Dancer in the Dark but The Sea Inside did make me tearful. This is a fantastic film about humanity and the right to freedom. It's a film I'd highly recommend to everybody.".

His presence on screen was something extraordinary and i could tell the guy knew how to act. Sea Inside is definitely a film were his talent shines. The character he plays as is a paraplegic. After an unfortunate accident he's left paralyzed from the neck down. After so many years he decides that he's had enough and wants to attempt suicide. As he tries to find the right person to help him we get to meet so many great characters played by many great actorsactresses. From his family to his friends you get this emotional bond between everyone and it really makes for a real powerhouse. You will believe Bardem is paralyzed it's so effective. He makes it seem so realistic from beginning to end. This film has a very deep and dark meaning that anyone could feel for. It'll make you cry it'll make you laugh and it will leave you in silence. If your a fan of Javier Bardem or your a fan of a good and solid piece of art do your self a favor and see this movie.".

Bardem gives a truly heartbreaking world class performance and is closely matched by those around him. Director Amenabar also wrote the score for his own film and it is terrific and original.

It stars Sam Shepard Eduardo Noriega Stephen Rea Magaly Solier Nikolaj CostsrWaldau Padraic Delaney and Dominique McElligott. Music is by Lucio Godoy and cinematography by Juan Ruiz Anchia.It was believed that Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid both perished at the hands of the Bolivian army in 1908. Not so for here is Butch Cassidy 20 years after the supposed event alive and well and living in a secluded Bolivian village under the name James BlackthornWhat a lovely idea that of one of history's most famous outlaws actually living longer than history led us to believe. OK it's a scratchy premise but it allows for a quite elegiac film as we follow an older and grizzled Cassidy on another adventure. That adventure sees him team up with mischievous Spaniard Eduardo Apodaca the latter of which tries to rob BlackthornCassidy and then offers to repay the old outlaw with the proceeds from some hidden loot stashed away from a robbery. They set off and sure enough there is a posse on their tail meaning the pair have to stay one step ahead of their pursuers something which puts the twinkle back in Cassidy's eyes. But not all is as it seems and with flash backs showing Butch and Sundance in their prime Waldau as the young Cassidy is an inspired choice as per likeness to Shepard aided by the feisty Etta Place this is a fully rounded tale.The film quite simply is unhurried and respectful to the art of story telling and is rich with a lead characterisation of considerable substance Shepard is wonderful really gets to the soul of the character. Oh it is punctured by the odd action scene even some humour is in the mix there's even time for machismo and romantic threads of worth but this beats a melancholy heart and is All the better for it. It also happens to be one of the most gorgeously photographed Westerns of the modern era. Filmed primarily on location in Bolivia the landscapes  be it the mountainous ranges or pin sharp salt flats  are sublime God's wonderful Earth in all its glory expertly realised by Anchia marking this out as an absolute Bluray essential for Western fans big into location photography. While Godoy's musical score is pitch perfect for the tonal flows in the narrative.There's the odd clich Rea is a touch wasted and some may decry the simplicity of plot but this is thoughtful and awash with the love of the Western genre. If only for Shepard and the photography then this is worth it for Western fans as it is it also calls out to those who like some emotional reflection in their Oaters. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a guy and you haven't at some point had the dream of becoming an outlaw who takes down government banks and rolls with either a wicked car or a massive horse then...well...you're weird. Let's just be honest being an outlaw is just super cool. Robbing from the rich and corrupt taking out bad guys even though you're kind of a bad guy yourself and living outside of the law are all exciting ideas and make for even more exciting men and women. We gravitate toward those characters in movies because they are always charismatic fun and give off an air of freedom despite and perhaps because of always being just one step ahead of certain death at the hands of stodgy law makers and guys who don't have the stones to be outlaws themselves I'm talking to you Pinkertons!. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of my very favorite films the rare classic that plays just as well today as I imagine it did when it opened in 1969. The idea then of an alternative history in which Butch and Sundance escape the doom that awaited them at the end of that film and in real life I guess is beyond interesting to me. I saw a blurb about Blackthorn a couple of months ago and immediately knew I would seek it out. I'm awfully glad I did.20 years after the standoff in which he and the Sundance Kid supposedly died an aging Butch Cassidy Sam Shepard still lives in Bolivia laying low and breaking wild horses for wealthy riders. He has a good life but one that is a good deal quieter than he experienced in his outlaw days and that lack of action wears on him. So when he comes in contact with Eduardo Apodaca Eduardo Noriega a Spanish engineer with a plan to steal thousands from a mining company he senses an opportunity not only to relive the glory days but to buy his way back home. The heist turns south however when it becomes clear that Noriega isn't who he says he is forcing Cassidy into circumstances he may not be able to overcome.Blackthorn which is the name Cassidy goes by is a slowburn that moves methodically through both the narrative and the Bolivian landscape providing action in short contained bursts rather than excessively throughout the run time. Part of the story is told in the form of flashbacks that fill in the blanks between BCSK and while these aren't the best parts of the film they reengage the audience with the Cassidy storyline and essentially create an immediate rooting interest in the character. This is a big part of what makes the film work. It progresses exactly the way a Western should when it concerns itself with an aging protagonist and that makes for a rich and intriguing narrative. And by the way can we please have more Westerns Hollywood? They don't have to be big budget entries like Cowboys and Aliens just simple little films like this and Meek's Cutoff. More of that please. In addition the behindthecamera work on Blackthorn is excellent. The shot selection is simple yet purposeful and the settings are wellchosen. The cinematography is outstanding highlighting the tremendous and beautiful geographical diversity of South America. The landscape is in many ways the premier supporting character. But as you might expect Blackthorn depends almost entirely on the performance of Shepard and the man delivers magnificently. Shepard is one of the greatest actors of his generation and yet he is often overlooked when that conversation comes up and I am one of the guilty who has too often neglected to mention his name. I can't think of a single actor who I would prefer to play the aging Cassidy and he completely lives up to that statement. I think it would have been very easy to play Cassidy as some sort of knockoff of Paul Newman's interpretation of the character. Instead Shepard makes him wholly his own with just a hint of reminiscence for the iconic original. The years have taken their toll on Cassidy but Shepard never makes him come off as bitter or even overly tired so much as hardened and slightly more crotchety. Cassidy shows the physical rust that would accumulate during a 20 year hibernation but he displays the wits and reflexes that make men like himself so exciting. There are a few moments in which I found myself thinking The guy still has it! the same way I would if I was watching an aging slugger take one monster swing that sends a ball 450 feet up into the stands. It's a powerful yet understated performance that has reminded me of Shepard's true greatness. I won't be forgetting his value again anytime soon and the same should be said for Blackthorn as a whole.Please check out my reviews at www.ieatfilms.com".

This tale of an agingexiled American outlaw and his attempts to return home may seem a bit straightforward and tame but in the end it's not and you'll be glad to have spend the hour and fortyfive minutes partaking in this latest great example of the genre.The directing isn't too bad either and the actors generally deliver their lines well although a few are a bit overread.For a modern western that's not an adolescent fantasy and has a great deal of heart it gets 910.".

This tale of an agingexiled American outlaw and his attempts to return home may seem a bit straightforward and tame but in the end it's not and you'll be glad to have spend the hour and fortyfive minutes partaking in this latest great example of the genre.The directing isn't too bad either and the actors generally deliver their lines well although a few are a bit overread.For a modern western that's not an adolescent fantasy and has a great deal of heart it gets 910.";

There's not apotheosis at the endings of the sequences with a high emotional music theme. Poetry it's in the words the silences the landscapes and the development of the characters. Apparently it's a traditional story about compensation with the past but there's much more. An alaHawks representation of male friendship a social message a nostalgic review of classic Western and two little twists in the story that avoid a possible predictable ending. Very interesting it's the Mateo Gil's choice in opposition to the Roy Hill movie to show Bolivia as a wide open country. While Roy Hill in the 1969 movie shoot the South American scenes in a cloistered vision to give them a claustrophobic value that works as allegory of the characters mood in contrast with the North American scenes Gil hasn't renegade to shoot the desert the wide plains and even the canyons from Bolivia brought out by the brilliant cinematography of Ruz Ancha. Perhaps there're a couple of moments that the narrative pace goes down in contemplative scenes but overall the rhythm and the story will keep your attention. Great works of Sam Shephard Eduardo Noriega Stephen Rea and Nikolaj CoasterWaldau. You would like Blackthorn if you like Unforgiven Appaloosa Open Range or of course Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but not if your taste it's nearest to The Quick and the Dead Young Guns I or II or Cowboys  Aliens.".

	schema:reviewBody "An aging Butch Cassidy Sam Shepard now calling himself Blackthorn and living a quiet life in 1920s Bolivia learns that Etta Place has died in San Francisco living her young son behind to whom Butch has long been writing in the guise of Uncle Butch. He decides to travel back to the States to see his nephew and sets off with the blessings of his indigenous girlfriend Yana Magaly Solier. Early on however he comes across Eduardo Eduardo Noriega a young Spanish man on the run from a posse after he stole a lot of money from an evil mineowner. Eduardo's horse is dead and he is lost and he begs Blackthorn to help him somewhat against his will Blackthorn does so and they set off on a last grand adventure together. But Eduardo isn't all that he seems and in addition to the posse an old brokendown Pinkerton man Mackinley Stephen Rea is also aware that Butch Cassidy didn't die all those years ago....I'm not big on Westerns usually but this is an exception. Beautifully filmed on location in Bolivia and employing numerous indigenous actors we are also treated to flashback scenes of a younger Butch played as a young man by Nikolaj CoasterWaldau who looks very much like a younger Sam Shepard his friend the Sundance Kid Padraic Delaney and their mutual love Etta Place Dominique McElligot which deepen and enrich the larger story. I'm not sure why this screened at FantAsia as it's not really genre but perhaps it's because the director Mateo Gil making his Englishlanguage debut here is known for earlier Spanish thrillers that were screened in earlier years. In any event I'm very glad that I saw this unusual Western which I believe will get a regular release later this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spanish filmmaker Mateo Gil has been constantly collaborating with Alejandro Amenbar since his first film Tesis 1996 the latter subsequently putting the former in the shade. Thus this is only Gil's second feature film. I haven't seen his first work and apart from Amenbar's films and little projects of his own he also spent his time trying to adapt the novel Pedro Pramo which proved to be unmanageable. And that brings us to Blackthorn a film that must have been on Gil's mind for quite some time whether directly or indirectly. In any case it is a great film so it makes me hope it's not too late for Mateo Gil to develop a fruitful career as a fulllength film director.On the surface Blackthorn doesn't tell anything new it brings back the crepuscular atmosphere of the likes of Sam Peckinpah's westerns with an iconic but worndown figure as the main character. The man is getting old and wants to go back home he's saved enough money for that but he loses it when he runs into an adventurous and foolish Spaniard. So the two of them must now work together to get the money so that the old man can leave. The most original aspect of the film again only at first sight comes from the setting this western takes place in the barren landscapes of Bolivia the country where supposedly Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid got killed see the last shot of George Roy Hill's 1969 movie. The film starts off from there imagining that in fact Butch Cassidy never died.So Sam Shepard plays a 50 or 60 something Butch Cassidy now going by the name of Blackthorn. Shepard brings the right amount of wisdom melancholia and roughness to the character. His performance is somewhat reminiscent without going very far back in this comparison of Jeff Bridges' in True Grit. They also have in common that they are both worthy of award recognition. Sam Shepard should pick up at least a handful of nominations for his touching restrained yet aggressive turn but considering the kind of film we're talking about it probably won't happen. Shame. As for the rest of the cast everybody's all right. Eduardo Noriega does an OK job at keeping up with Shepard's performance and the other relatively fleshedout character Mackinley is played by Stephen Rea with skill despite the character in question being quite underused.That brings me to the first and main flaw of the film the way the flashbacks are structured is questionable at least for the first few of them. Unless I'm wrong there are six flashbacks throughout the movie showing us the younger years of Butch Cassidy and his teaming up with the Sundance Kid and their lady friend Etta Place. The flashbacks have potential and it's hard for me to say anything against flashbacks being used in film narrative in my eyes they usually improve a film a lot but said potential is not exploited that well thus achieving sometimes confusing transitions between the present and the flashbacks which is reinforced by the fact that these are not clearly differentiated tonally speaking from the present scenes and lacking the lyricism except for the last ones they could've had. Regarding Mackinley he only shows up in one of these flashbacks. So when we see him in the present supposedly as a character with great relevance in the film and in Butch Cassidy's life it doesn't work very well because we've only seen him for about a minute before that.Blackthorn has a few other flaws mostly in the form of missed opportunities not to mention a somewhat unsatisfactory ending but its qualities easily outshine them. Apart from Sam Shepard's terrific personification the cinematography is a strong highlight which isn't that surprising given the genre and setting as well as the score making a risky move by alternating between some epic music and countrylike songs. Some of the dialogue is also memorable and as far as the progression of the story goes every plot detail is worked out competently. But what I liked most about the film was the nostalgia surrounding it those letters Blackthorn writes to his kid the mountains and the deserts where he quietly rides his horse his memories and his determination to go back home. In his words approximately there are only two significant moments in a man's life when he leaves home and when he finally comes back. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Blackthorn Dir. Mateo Gil 2012 is what I'd like to describe as a real western. It is full of shootouts lost treasures and cinematic vistas. I have always been a western fan and whenever a new western is made I make a huge effort to catch it on release. Unfortunately Blackthorn isn't on in many cinemas and so many of you will have to wait for it on DVDBluray at the beginning of June.Blackthorn is centred on a retired Butch Cassidy who now goes by the name James Blackthorn after he and the Sundance Kid narrowly escaped death in Bolivia. One of the only downsides about this film is the fact that Paul Newman died four years before its creation and therefore couldn't revive his role as Butch Cassidy. But Sam Shepard embraces the role of Butch Cassidy and provides a strong and driven protagonist for the film. The character Eduardo Apodaca Eduardo Noriega puts it best when he says you're a damn legend. As that is what Butch Cassidy is a legend and it was only a matter of time before cinema decided to embrace his presence once again for another fantastic western.Both Shepard and Noriega are implausible in their roles complimented with a sturdy performance of a washed up pinkerton by Stephen Rea. But an actor who hasn't had nearly enough recognition within cinema is Nikolaj CoasterWaldau who a lot of you will recognise from the popular television series Game of Thrones 2011. His presence in Blackthorn not only reinforces the film as he plays a young Butch Cassidy but he also bears great similarity to Shepard conveniently. Through the use of flashbacks we see how Butch ends up in Bolivia and how his partner Sundance is no longer with him. These flashbacks also aid in fortifying the attachment the audience has with the protagonist James Blackthorn.Everyone will notice when watching Blackthorn that it fantastically utilises onlocation shooting. The open vistas forested valleys and Bolivian villages create a strong sense of verisimilitude while also making it very clear how much bigger the world is than the two protagonists. Another thing this film explores is how to cope with old age. As it is clear that perhaps Butch has lived such an exciting life and longs to return to it before he eventually dies. But after experiencing this freedom will he yearn for a quieter life with his longlost nephew?This film is full of everything I look for when watching a western. The only problem I had with it was its length it almost feels like three thirty minute long episodes that have been pasted together to create a movie. After the first thirty minutes the narrative has progressed a great deal there has even been an acoustic cover by Shepard of Sam Hall. The flashback scenes in Blackthorn are imperative to the plot as they hold the film together and without them the film would have a much less gripping story.httpdalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com".

This western gives the audience its money's worth in cinematography because it actually takes place in Bolivia where it was filmed it also has an authentic feeling we need to credit the producer for.

I've heard others make that same mistake which is why I thought it might be interesting to write this. It turns out according to my research Sam Elliott played in the original Butch Cassidy and just a glorified extra part and married Katherine Ross in 1984 who played the role of Etta Place in the original Butch Cassidy and.In Blackthorn we have a few flashback moments of Butch Sundance and Etta as they trek through South America to help the audience unfamiliar with the original key characters or for those like me who had forgotten most of the original film story get that important background in perspective.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of my alltime favorites. Action adventure gun play wisecracking romance charming lead actors and a touch of western legend all combine for a very entertaining film. Spanish screenwriter and director Mateo Gil sp The Sea Inside takes up the story 20 years from the infamous freeze frame that ended Hill's 1969 film. Sure you might need suspension of disbelief since we all remember the hundreds of Bolivian soldiers firing at once when Butch and Sundance attempted their escape but this film is really more about aging and trying to put things right. The Butch we are first introduced to is writing a letter to the son of Etta Place after her death. He writes that it's time to come home  meaning he is to leave the quiet life in rural Bolivia and make the long journey back to the U.S. This aging Uncle Butch we meet is played by the great Sam Shepard. Mr. Shepard is not just a Pulitzer winning writer but he has always had an incredibly strong screen presence ... a wonderful face and trustworthy voice. Here is in full grizzled cowboy mode and sports the bright eyes we remember from Paul Newman while displaying a newfound peace raising horses in the Bolivian countryside. He lives this life as James Blackthorn not Butch Cassidy. He even has a relationship with one of the local ladies who seems filled with the spirit that Butch had as a younger man.Blackthorn collects his savings from the bank ... a bit ironic eh? He sets off on the journey but is quickly knocked off course thanks to the recklessness of a Spainish thief played by Eduardo Noriega. Noriega says he can makes things right and the two form an unlikely team. Of course Butch has become more trusting in his old age and Noriega turns out not to be the partner than Sundance once was.This whole story is a bit outlandish but it's at its best when Blackthorn runs smack dab into Makinley one of the old Pinkerton men who was chasing him twenty years ago. Turns out Makinley Stephen Rea is a social outcast because he was the only one who thought the boys survived that attack so many years ago. Seems both Makinley and Blackthorn have been cast aside and trapped in Bolivia.While Shepard is outstanding he shares star billing with the terrain of Bolivia. It definitely holds its own versus the Monument Valley we have seen in so many westerns over the years. The salt flats are particularly beautiful and treacherous and filmed with skill by the director. We are also treated to periodic flashbacks and a few of the key moments for Butch Sundance and Etta. We learn that the partnership was truly that ... one for all.This film will have little box office success but it's certainly worth a look for those of you intrigued by the Butch and Sundance legend and are able to wonder just WHAT IF ....".

Butch Cassidy is closer to us in time than Robin Hood his descendants are known to us and we do not live in a feudal but in a capitalist system just like Butch. The legend Butch is real whereas Robin is closer to King Arthur and Merlin.Blackthorn makes us sympathize with the figure of a hunted criminal Butch Cassidy having survived the ambush living in old age of his humble farm in Bolivia. The death of his and his deceased comrade's love draws him home to the United States. He says farewell to his Bolivian lover takes all his booty money from the bank and gets back into the saddle for his last long ride. Before our hero crosses the Bolivian border his plan is interrupted by another criminal who is being hunted for stealing money from a Bolivian mine. He teams up with the young robber seeing in him his younger self or rather his dead brother in arms the Sundance Kid. All looks good until the terrible truth comes out. The young robber stole from a collective of families that bought the run down mine for the people from the coorparation.Butch Cassidy never stole from the poor so the myth tells us he fought the law the system. In this story he is being confronted by a different kind of criminal. One that does not hesitate to exploit the trust and need of the poor to take what little they have.For this alone I would give the movie ten stars. It is not 50's Western it is not Italo Action fans beware. This is thoughtful post Unforgiven. Blackthorne has everything my beloved genre demands great sorytelling amazing photography of country desperados indians colt revolvers cartridges liquor smoking and riding. It even has chewing of coca leaves. A statement knowing our drug war.Very good movie even for people who do not like the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 2011 Blackthorn is the unofficial sequel to the 1969 Western hit Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It took 42 years but it was worth it.THE PLOT Almost 20 years after Butch Cassidy was supposedly shotdown in Bolivia he is shown alive and well living in a ranch house in the mountains under the name James Blackthorn. He has a nephew or more likely a son in the USA and decides to take his stolen loot retire there and live happily ever after. Unfortunately for him a young outlaw Eduardo Noriega puts the kibosh on his plans but they eventually teamup perhaps because the dude reminds him of his younger days or of his deceased best friend the Sundance Kid.Another reviewer pointed out that Butch Cassidy is essentially regarded as a reallife Western Robin Hood. Yes he was an outlaw but he stole from the rich the banks trains and such and gave to well himself. Okay so he wasn't exactly Robin Hood but people give him a pass because he fought the system and won at least until his reported death at the age of 42 in 1908. But there are theories and support for the idea that he didn't die and this movie explores this possibility.The reason I bring up the whole Robin Hood ethic  i.e. steal from the rich etc.  is that the movie illustrates that outlaw though he may have been even Butch Cassidy had an intrinsic moral code that he followed. Those who broke that code were not worthy of his time respect or compassion. Period.Another reviewer seemed to read too much into this element and interpreted the movie as a Socialist vehicle with didactic politics The idea that being singularly rich is intrinsically evil and therefore those less fortunate are morally justified in demanding i.e. stealing their wealth. But I don't think the filmmakers necessarily support this view any more than the makers of the original movie did in 1969. It's basically just Butch's personal justification for his lifestyle. He's a thug who unsurprisingly made excuses for his foolish way of life and he keeps payin' the price Everyone around him dies prematurely he's left alone  weary and his stolen loot seems to keep falling through his fingers one way or another. Yeah Karma's a real biyatch. When my wife or I watch Westerns we always ask each other Was it as good as Dances With Wolves? The inevitable answer is always No but Of course few Westerns are as good as Dances With Wolves it's the but that will determine if the movie is worth seeing. In the case of Blackthorn this is definitely watchable for a number of reasons including the intriguing ideas noted above. It's just a solid modern Western with many of the requisite staples that mark the genre such as excellent landscape cinematography in this case Bolivia shot on location a quality modern Western score shootouts brooding outlaws saloons booze posses mines escapes beautiful women Pinkertons Natives cowboys horses and locomotives. Speaking of posses the possepursuit in this film is at least twice as long as the elongated posse sequence in the original movie and probably longer. Blackthorn borrows from Westerns like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid naturally The Shootist 1976 Unforgiven 1992 and the more modern Seraphim Falls 2006. The association with the first film is obvious. It's reminiscent of The Shootist and Unforgiven in that the story involves an aged and meditative outlaw who doesn't have much further to go. It brings to mind Seraphim Falls and Jack Nicholson's The Shooting from 1966 with its long surreal chase scenes in the desert. The modern gloss also brings to mind Seraphim. Lastly the basic tone is akin to The Long Riders 1980. What makes Blackthorn unique is its setting in Bolivia and to a lesser degree the time period 1927.FINAL SAY I suppose you could say that this is a character study and Sam Shepherd is excellent as Butch Cassidy. Like Unforgiven it's a brooding elegiac Western focusing on lessthanrespectable characters with flashes of Westernstyled violence. It also has something interesting to say although it's nothing enlightening or deep.The film runs 98 minutes.GRADE B".

It took 42 years but it was worth it.THE PLOT Almost 20 years after Butch Cassidy was supposedly shotdown in Bolivia he is shown alive and well living in a ranch house in the mountains under the name James Blackthorn. He has a nephew or more likely a son in the USA and decides to take his stolen loot retire there and live happily ever after.

	schema:reviewBody "Blackthorn 2011 12 out of 4This film goes on the assumption that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid didn't get killed by the Bolivian Army in 1908. Our film kicks off twenty years after those said events when Butch Sam Shepard finds himself wanting to get back to his family in the U.S. so he takes his life's savings and heads off but a turn in events places him with a Spanish Eduardo Apodaca criminal on the run from the law. When the end credits came up on BLACKTHORN I really wished I had enjoyed the film more than I did. I mean it does feature a marvelous performance by Shepard who is given his greatest role in years but sadly the overall film is somewhat of a mess and a rather uninteresting one as well. I don't mind buying into this alternate history because there are many who actually believe Butch and Sundance lived a lot differently than what the 1969 film told us. The problem I had is that this film bounces around so much and has so much filler that I really started to lose interest all around. The film bounces from Butch as an old man trying to make his way back to the U.S. and this here is the strongest aspect simply because it features Shepard. This portion of the film is told in a very slow manor and it's clear that they're wanting to build up some psychological stuff but this doesn't happen because the screenplay never really seems to know what type of story it wants to tell. Is it about Butch living under this fake name and his true identity becoming known? Is it about his relationship with this mysterious criminal? We have another man played by Stephen Rea who comes into play. You then have the various flashbacks to what really happened to Butch and Sundance after getting away from the Bolivian army. All of these flashbacks are told in such a fast manor that it's really hard to get to know these young characters and the scenes also seem extremely rushed. I'd also add that the scenes really don't contain that much punch energy or excitement and in the end they just seem so flat. I think one major reason for this is that Shepard and his intense performance is off the screen. If you took Shepard out of this movie then you'd be left with a real mess but thankfully the actor is on hand and delivers one of his finest performances. There are many bits of dialogue here but what I was really impressed with was the quiet scenes where the look in Shepard's eyes told us everything we needed to know. Noriega is also extremely good in his part and Rea is as well but the screenplay really doesn't do him any favors. The cinematography is another major plus. BLACKTHORN has an interesting idea that never fully materializes and it's a real shame because Shepard's performance is so great. The film is still worth viewing for that performance but at the end you just can't help but wish they had gotten more done.".

	schema:reviewBody "People change in time relationships change in time Love doesn't. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife through several shocking surprises after his death. This movie would tell why love is the only power that connects people if no one could tell anymore what it really means. Gerry and Holly's relationship is a good example of how couples bring their love to the end quickly. Leading actors Swank and Butler accomplished wholeheartedly acting jobs. A true success with Harry Connick Jr.'s role playing Holly's first flirt but poor acting from Jeffrey Dean Morganwhom we'll see him in Watchmen next year playing as her second. As a novel adaptation the screenplay is effectual. Some parts of the script is totally noticeable that hold our attention continuously. I liked the editing job very well after I've seen the deleted scenes from the special features of the DVD. The music score is so relaxing and emotional. Everybody keeps telling this film is a tearjerker which I disagree it's only because of the sensational existence of Hilary Swank. Her talented way of expressing psychological trauma just catches eyes that's all. There are 5 of my favorite scenes which I rewind each time I watch 1One of the greatest opening scenes for a romance of all time. In that scene just in 2 minutes we get what type of personalities each character has. Lovers find a quarrel over a straw. They yell at each other and Gerry leaves Holly getting out of the door. A minute passes or not Holly comes back from bathroom and Gerry back from the door. Then they wildly lock in a close embrace after running towards to each other into the middle of the living room... 2After the funeral of Gerry at a time when Holly's longing of him hits the top she can't help herself calling the homephone from her cellphone just to listen to Gerry's voice from his answering machine record while trying to sleep... 3Holly's receiving of Gerry's first P.S.I Love You letter and his true guesses of what Holly is going to say in respond after his each time of gaffes... 4Gerry's calling to memory of their first meeting in Ireland from his words... 5And best of all my best favorite scene Holly's return to karaoke stage singing Love You Till The End and imagining as if he is there forming a lonesome audience. This scene is the one I burst into tears. I don't remember myself crying because of a movie or because of someone else's sadness ever including the end of Dr.Zhivago or Love Story or The English Patient. Yet it just reminded me of a photo of my fiance with whom we were parted away. In that photo she was standing on a step of an amphitheater watching my mockery of a standup show at the stage forming the whole audience herself. This is a therapeutic relationship movie. Watch it with your partner and you'll be able to see the missing lacking or the incomplete part of your unity. Strongly recommended for couples who used to be in love before. Find out why love is eternal.".

	onyx:emotionText "People change in time relationships change in time Love doesn't. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife through several shocking surprises after his death. This movie would tell why love is the only power that connects people if no one could tell anymore what it really means. Gerry and Holly's relationship is a good example of how couples bring their love to the end quickly. Leading actors Swank and Butler accomplished wholeheartedly acting jobs. A true success with Harry Connick Jr.'s role playing Holly's first flirt but poor acting from Jeffrey Dean Morganwhom we'll see him in Watchmen next year playing as her second. As a novel adaptation the screenplay is effectual. Some parts of the script is totally noticeable that hold our attention continuously. I liked the editing job very well after I've seen the deleted scenes from the special features of the DVD. The music score is so relaxing and emotional. Everybody keeps telling this film is a tearjerker which I disagree it's only because of the sensational existence of Hilary Swank. Her talented way of expressing psychological trauma just catches eyes that's all.

	schema:reviewBody "In a poignant scene Gerald Butler's spirit of Gerry confesses to Hilary Swank's Holly I'm not asking you to remember me and to move on. Although being a little too long Writer and Director Richard LaGravenese's P.S. I Love You is a whimsical and surprisingly touching romantic comedy about life continuing forward. Swank and LaGravenese have collaborated before on Freedom Writers as evidenced in the movie's comfortable and sturdy feel. Hilary Swank is great in this romantic comedy an edgy departure for the actor. Swank thrivesshe never forces the humor completely natural. She embodies a humanity and spirit in Holly that makes her vulnerable and funny in the story's context. Gerald Bulter is boldly charming as Holly's late husband Gerry the Irishman full of life and dreams. Swank and Butler have a wondrous chemistry that smooths out the rougher edges of LaGravenese and Steve Rogers screenplay based on the novel by Wendy Finerman.Even with its over wrought indulgences P.S. I Love You rewards the narrative payoff. Wisely on the part of LaGravenese and Rogers the catharsis opts for the lyrical and realm of possibility. The performances are stellar. Academy Award Winner Kathy Bates is awesome as Holly's mother Patricia. Seeing fellow Oscar Winner Swank and Bates together is truly something special. There is a heartbreaking scene where Swank's Holly breaks down to her mother saying I'm alone! Later Bates's Patrica says to her daughter If you're all alone we're all together with you in that too. So even with its intentional quirks and cheesy trappings all is forgiven because ultimately P.S. I Love You is about the courage to love again and live life.As P.S opens Holly is furious that Gerry told her mother at dinner that they are not planning on having kids right now. Although accurate Holly is still livid. Holly laments that she is waiting for her life to start. Gerry reminds We are in life Transparent to us Gerry and Holly are soul matesthe great love of each other's life. Fast forward several months Gerry has died of a brain tumor. After the wake Holly discovers that Gerry has arranged for the delivery of his letters all making requests of Holly. Unable or perhaps unwilling to move on after her loss this may not be the best thing for Holly. Or is it a way for Holly to discover life anew? Much of the movie's charm derives from Holly's trip to Gerry's Irish homeland and her loyal friends. Lisa Kudrow plays Denise Holly's gal pal who is crassly determined to hunt down a single straight and employed mana crusade seemingly more difficult than it seems. Kudrow is at her scattered and hysterical best. Hot and sexy Gina Gershon plays other gal pal Sharon. Gershon is deceivingly strong and smart with the apparently vapid Sharon who really possesses a depth of character. In a surprising moment in what initially feels like a frivolously long fishing scene with all three women reminds Holly that her friends are moving on with their lives. Holly's trip to Ireland is a beautiful interlude that represents an eloquent return to the traditional and solid. Here LaGravenese brilliantly orchestrates his story of love everlasting and regret. Hilary Swank amazingly balances the suffering and resolute spirit in Holly. She too is brilliant and absolutely beautiful. Her smile just lights up your soul and her anguish strikes an emotional chord. Gerald Butler is at his charismatic best. Butler also expertly tempers his charm with a touching and gentle compassion.P.S. I Love You is one of the best romantic comedies in a long while that has a great love story. Richard LaGravenese tells a wistful and touching tale with amazing performances and chemistry by Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler. Take a chance on P.S. I Love You.".

My Comment This is definitely a chick flick that will not only make you cry but make you laugh plus the women will fall in love with Gerard Butler. Gerard was excellent in his part and Hilary did a fine job as well. At first I didn't think Hilary could pull off the romantic comedy role but in the end you get use to her doing it.

It stars Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler that gorgeous hunk of man who starred in 300 if you haven't seen itgo rent it.At the start of the movie Holly Hilary Swank and Gerry Kennedy Gerard Butler are married and they are having a marital spat which trust me is hilarious. Let's just say they end the fight with him doing a very funny striptease. In the next scene we find that he has died. Holly is so bereaved she is unable to function but soon letters start arrivingfrom Gerry. He spaces the letters about a month apart and in each letter he teaches Holly how to get on with the business of living.Her ensuing adventures with best friends Lisa Kudrow and Lisa Gershon are hilarious. Along the way she meets Harry Connick Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan who played Denny in Grey's Anatomy. The supporting cast is wonderful especially the hilarious Lisa Kudrow. The movie is very funny much more funny than sad. And Gerard Butler is quite terrific in it and I am not just saying that because I am a fan. He is romantic sexy and just plain sweet. The striptease scene alone is worth the price of admission. I never laughed so hard.Hilary Swank is very very good. She and Gerry have really great chemistry. In the scenes they have together you totally see how much in love they are with each other and why Holly is so bereaved when he dies. Although the movie does stray from the book at times in my opinion it's an improvement. For example Gerard Butler is not only in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie but he is also in it quite a bit through flashbacks and such. Plus you get to hear him sing which he has not done in a movie since The Phantom of the Opera.So if you get a chance this holiday season go see this wonderful romantic funny movie. You will love it!

	schema:headline " Boring in a nutshell";
	schema:reviewBody "I've felt the need to write the first movie review on my profile. If no news is good news I have a lot of news. It started with some lame godawful song. The opening scene went from the characters Holly and Gery played by Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler who had absolutely no chemistry at all fighting to having sex. The second scene? Gery's funeral. What?! Oh right a brain tumor I guess...Because you weren't able to get to know Gery as a character you weren't able to feel any emotion when he died. Then the whole movie focused around some letters he wrote before he died. He arranged them to be sent to Holly after he had passed. One told her to dress in a dreadful disco dress and sing some boring karaoke song at the bar all while being tone deaf. I didn't really understand the point of this.Did I mention the acting? Gag me. Remember when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year? Hilary Swank should have received a Razzie for this acting. Her acting in this movie was unemotional and very lacking. I'm talking about crying with a scrunched up face and no tears. Near the end when she buries her face into her mom's shoulder is when she didn't even have any tears. The comedy was a big fail. Holly and her two friends were on a boat. Their oars fell into the water and were FIVE FEET from the boat so what did they do?

	onyx:emotionText "I've felt the need to write the first movie review on my profile. If no news is good news I have a lot of news. It started with some lame godawful song. The opening scene went from the characters Holly and Gery played by Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler who had absolutely no chemistry at all fighting to having sex. The second scene? Gery's funeral. What?! Oh right a brain tumor I guess...Because you weren't able to get to know Gery as a character you weren't able to feel any emotion when he died. Then the whole movie focused around some letters he wrote before he died. He arranged them to be sent to Holly after he had passed. One told her to dress in a dreadful disco dress and sing some boring karaoke song at the bar all while being tone deaf. I didn't really understand the point of this.Did I mention the acting? Gag me. Remember when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year? Hilary Swank should have received a Razzie for this acting. Her acting in this movie was unemotional and very lacking. I'm talking about crying with a scrunched up face and no tears. Near the end when she buries her face into her mom's shoulder is when she didn't even have any tears. The comedy was a big fail. Holly and her two friends were on a boat. Their oars fell into the water and were FIVE FEET from the boat so what did they do? Started screaming for help in the middle of the deserted lake and let the oars float away.I kept waiting for a laugh kept waiting for something big to happen kept waiting to be touched... Nothing. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Okey ladies i went to see P.S. I Love You last night with a girl friend now that we are both back in the OC for winter break. I have to say this movie is all i hoped it would be and more. I sobbed for a whole 2 hours not kidding. It was sad yet uplifting and made me really think about life.I'm 19 and a freshman in college i went to an all girl's catholic high school. So personally this movie really hit home and made me think What if i don't ever find my Gerry? I mean I'm 19 and I've never been kissed or been on a date. It just got me thinking about the fact that life is short and i want to be happy. I want my Gerry obviously he doesn't have too be this romantic but someone to love me with their whole heart as Gerry loved Holly. It also gave me some hope maybe there is a Gerry out there for everyone. My friend and i went to chili's for dinner after and i pretty much cried through dinner but like i said this movie really hit me.It was absolutely perfect and even the scenes that our Gerry wasn't in his presence could be seen and felt every step of the way. All i can say is that GB has moved me in a way i never thought possible with a movie. I think this one has actually changed my life for the better or at least pushed me in the right direction.Even after seeing JDM nekkid bum i must say our man still wins my heart. His voice is so amazing and many times that all there was in a scene just his voice yet it had me busting out into tears every time. I am still letting this amazing experience sink in but all i can say is if i ever could say one thing to our Gerry it would be that he has truly made me love my life and hope that the love of my life is out there somewhere.Oh and Gerry's singing is amazing too as are all his witty remarks and comments.... i can still hear his voice in my head! Erinne P.S. I Love You.... Till The End".

	schema:reviewBody "Generally speaking I dislike the romantic American tearjerker dramas especially films like 'Titanic'. So i tend to avoid them. A few that I have liked include 'Far and Away' and 'The English Patient' which was much more than the average movie of this genre. What interested me about 'P.S. I Love You' was the interesting ensemble cast. Now that I have watched the film I must say that it came as a pleasant surprise.I found it very fresh the cast which brings together talents like Lisa Kudrow Kathy Bates and Hilary Swank the idea of shooting in Ireland was very refreshing and the beautiful locations were so wonderfully shot that it just makes one want to visit the beautiful country the screenplay yes it is flawed as there are a few corny moments and some of the situations are a little too convenient but most of the dialogues are great the comedic undertone is mostly welcoming and not misplaced the ending is different from what one would expect the soundtrack which adds more life into the moments.It's ironic that just the other day I watched 'Reign Over Me' which also dealt with 'grieving over' lost loved ones. Both films were totally different but it was interesting to see how the central character of both films deal or more correctly fail to cope with their losses in different ways. Both the writer and director LaGravenese put a lot of heart into 'P.S. I Love You' and the film is strengthened by the chemistry of the actors.Both Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent. The chemistry between them is electric. Swank gracefully shows Holly's transition from the whiny but loving working wife to the lonely widow. In a flashback scenes we see her brilliantly pull off the naive teenager. It's no surprise that the woman can act. Butler is terrific as the charming lively and funny Gerry but his grasp of the Irish accent is disastrous. Lisa Kudrow provides comic relief. The actress gives a natural performance with shades of her famous Phoebe Buffay character which I didn't mind as I miss Phoebe but I wish she was given more screen time. Even Gina Gershon springs a surprise with a decent performance. Kathy Bates's acting is beautifully restrained. Harry Connick Jr. too adds some comedy which might not appeal to all.'P.S. I Love You' makes for a good rainy day film. It might not appeal to all as there are a few fluffy corny moments but the film does make its point well and for me it was worth a watch.".

This film however managed to live up to the trailer and many of the best moments of the film were left out of the trailer and for good reason as to not ruin the surprises.I found Hillary Swank's character Holly to be believable in her grief and her inability to function after loosing the man she had been married to for 11 years to a brain tumor. I recently lost my mother to a brain tumor as well. I was able to empathize with her character in the feelings of loss and confusion. Through a series of letters her husband Gerry wrote prior to his death Holly attempts to pick up her life and learn how to go on living without her husband. The movie is filled with flashbacks that show the viewer the type of life this couple had coupled with moments in which Holly believes her husband to be 'there' with her. I cannot go without mentioning the great performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan who plans an Irishman that Holly meets while on a trip back to her late husbands hometown. He's pretty nice to look at too. Overall wonderful performances by both Gerard Butler and Jeffery Dean Morgan. Hillary Swank managed to carry the story well in a genre she usually does not venture into but has done well in film.".

Also I couldn't understand why the film did not show Jerry actually being ill or dying the film jumped from Jerry and Holly bickering to his funeral which didn't make sense.Other major irritations of the film where the shocking Irish accents though this did cause much and the main amusement for me and my friend who happens to be part Irish which leads me to my next point.why were all the Irish characters so stereotyped? They were always drinking either Guinness or Jameson's and both of them looked and dressed pretty much identically.I was also disappointed as I really rate both Gerard Butler in 300and Hilary Swank in Boys don't crybut their chemistry on screen was nonexistent.So to anyone who is contemplating watching this film I advise you to spend your money on buying the book instead!".

I only watched it because my 12 year old was having a cinema party and THEY wanted to watch it. The acting was atrocious the story line was probably written by a cheerleader who likes Ireland or something. It was Hollywood at it's worst. Please if you think you are going to do a film partly about a European country have some Europeans on board who will advise you how schmaltzy a film can be for the rest of the world and don't release it over here. The theatre was pretty empty and I can see why. Waste of 6 pounds for me. The main actress was so annoying to watch and look at those teeth my goodness.... Only redeeming qualities were the shots of NYC and Ireland and a rather good conversation between the mother and daughter towards the end. It wasn't worth watching for those reasons however.".

	schema:headline " Not just a chick flick";
	schema:reviewBody "To be fully honest I'm not one for what we know as chickflicks because of their tendency to be as predictable as a crystal ball or as cheesy as cheese. However hearing that Gerard Butler and James Marsters were both in this film together seeing as I adore both actors for many different reasons I thought I might be able to stomach it and maybe even have a laugh. By the end of the film I found this film to be more than just a chickflick it was instead a bittersweet story about a young widow played by the strongly talented Hilary Swank coping with the death of her husband through letters that he'd written for her teaching her how to live and remember how to be happy with herself. All in all I'd say it was a great film. It was one of those film that can make you smile scream laugh and cry and the writers capture the audiences emotions beautifully. The writer has clearly gone through the same situation of losing a loved one because if I'm not mistaken I do recall hearing my grandmother going through the same emotions that Swank's character was going through after her own husband passed away. The acting in the film is perfectly done. Butler though he can't hold an Irish accent very well plays the role of a goofball perfectly especially in his striptease scene and when he was watching his wife sing a sexy karaoke tune poor guy was trying to contain himself while covering Marsters' eyes. Swank is also hilarious and in a scene when she's crying in an emotional breakdown she plays it more realistically than I have ever seen on film. What is also great about the film is that it rebels against most romantic comedies by practically spoofing typical chickflick events which was a great relief to me since the recycled plots that I see in too many films and books nowadays coughEnchantedcough gets more than just annoying. Out of ten I will give it a nine because the only problem I had with the film was Butler's accent. Other than that it was a great film with a wellchosen cast and a wellwritten script.".

Wed at 19 he is the only love of her life and they have big plans for the future. Sadly however Gerry is stricken with cancer and dies leaving Holly desolate. But much to her surprise letters start arriving from Gerry under unusual circumstances letters that provide encouragement for Holly to move forward with her life. Gerry suggests that Holly do some karaoke and take a trip to Ireland where she should learn to fish and visit his relatives. It doesn't' hurt that Holly has two loving friends Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon a hovering mother Kathy Bates and a goodlooking new friend Harry Connick Jr. looking out for her also. But can Holly truly overcome the serious blow that life has given her? This is a sweet movie but I must confess I was a wee bit disappointed. Yes I loved the basic story and the cast is beyond terrific. Swank is quite nice as the young widow while Butler is greatly engaging as the husband with many of his scenes told in flashback. In fact Butler is a new favorite among American women thanks to Dear Frankie and let us all hope we see much more of him. Kudrow Gershon Bates Connick Jr. and some of the Irish players are just right too breathing more life into a script that is erratic and sometimes contrived. Of course the sets in Manhattan and Ireland are very wonderful as are the costumes and great camera work. But the film could have used more careful direction and editing in my view. However all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around.".

I was dumbstruck with the sheer awfulness of this contrived nonsense. I never really bought Holly and Gerry as a couple and believed for a second that Gerry could plan all these tasks for his wife when he was dying.Just look at the scenes set in Ireland. Holly ventures into a small pub and just happens to stumble upon someone singing a song that Gerry sang to her. She is pushed by her friends to have a drink with the singer Jeffrey Dean Morgan and before long they end up in bed because he also just happens to single and available.

	schema:headline " The Perfect Murder ... The Perfect Thriller!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sleeping Car Murders is a quintessential and bona fide and prototypic Giallo and yet at the same time  NOT a Giallo at all. Gialli are  generally speaking  Italian productions from the early 70's with a script written directly for the screen. The Sleeping Car Murders is French released during the mid 60's when Mario Bava only just kickstarted the Giallo concept in Italy and the script was adapted from a novel by Sbastien Japristot. Surely both Japristot and director CostaGavras didn't had a clue what a Giallo in fact was and simply aimed to deliver a good oldfashioned whodunit that would keep the readerviewer guessing until the very end. Well the least you could say is  they succeeded! The Sleeping Car Murders is an engaging intelligent and convoluted murdermystery with a tremendous amount of effective red herrings detailed character drawings and one perplexedly flawless conclusion. I honestly can't fathom why this movie is so little known especially since it concerns the writer of A Very Long Engagement and the director of the political top thriller Z. If this exact same story were filmed by say Alfred Hitchcock I bet the film would have ranked high in this website's top 250.Speaking of Hitchcock several of his film revolved on the potentially perfect murder plot like Strangers on a Train Dial M for Murder but  in my humble opinion  this is the film which comes up with the most ideal and waterproof scheme to get away with murder. I've rarely been overwhelmed and impressed as much as when upon witnessing the denouement of The Sleeping Car Murders. Obviously I can't reveal too much about the climax but it's so damn great that I really was almost tempted to select some random people and try out the formula myself! Six strangers share a compartment on the night train to Paris one of them being a fare dodger who met up with a cute young girl in the compartment itself. The next morning one of travelers a woman lies murdered in her bed and a hugely complicated police investigation led by the cynical Inspector Graziani ensues. The next following days however the other residents of the compartment are murdered  Agatha Christie style  in cold blood as well as if the killer wants to eliminate all potential witnesses before they have a chance to talk to the police. With the number of compartment survivors rapidly decreasing the fare dodger and his girlfriend will have to seek protection before the killer finds them.The setup of The Sleeping Car Murders is brilliant without any form of exaggeration and the tight screenplay fills in every tiny detail and remains always several steps ahead of even the cleverest viewers. The plot patiently takes its time to draw a detailed portrait of every witness and since they each have their own dark secrets and suspicious characteristics they could all be the culprits. The structure and unfolding of the plot is truly genius here. Whenever you're sure you figured out the killer's identity heshe gets killed or some other type of twist points out heshe couldn't have done it. The film also gives some marvelous and realistic insight into the progress of a police murder investigation like stressed Inspectors false attentionseeking witnesses deadend leads media circuses and a lot of hatred from wrongfully accused suspects. The entire cast and crew also contributes a great deal to the high level of brilliance of the film as well. This may perhaps have been CostaGavras' longfeature debut as a director but his obvious talents and straightforward vision place his right away up there with the greatest filmmakers ever. The performances particularly from Simone Signoret and Yves Montand are just as topnotch as every other tiniest detail in the rest of this ingenious but shamefully overlooked production.".

It is an excellent mystery with outstanding performances by Yves Montand and Simone Signoret but it is much more. Most mysteries do not work the second time around. What matters too much is discovering who the murderer is but not here. What counts is not just the suspense and action but something else a profound moral statement. The film reminds me a lot of Hitchcock's Vertigo in which the audience knows twothirds of the way through the film what has been happening. Well in this film the audience begin to catch on to something else something more significant than the identity of the killer. We discover something more disturbing the pettiness of crime particularly of murder. It is what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil.I like movies that have depth to them. I should having degrees in several areas. As a philosopher and ethicist I relate strongly to what this film says. There is no greatness in criminality by the end of the film we feel only a gnawing sense of all that has been lost.".

	schema:reviewBody "Six people on a MarseillesParis sleeper carriage. One murder on arrival. Then a killing spree by an unknown assassin bent on wiping out all remaining passengers.The Sleeping Car Murders is a French Hitchcockian thriller. It presents a pretty interesting puzzle to be solved a mystery with a quite satisfying clever resolution. In some other ways aside from the AngloAmerican Hitchcock influence it's a movie that also contains elements of the Italian giallo what with its black gloved killer who prowls around bumping off each subsequent victim. It isn't as violent or salacious as the gialli though but it does have the sense of style associated with them. Although this one has a definite Gallic flavour with its Paris setting. It also has a very cool swinging 60's theme tune which adds to the overall chic value. Its plot is admittedly a little muddled at times and it's not always obvious who is who and what they are up to. But things do become clearer as the flick proceeds. It's certainly an interesting obscurity and should be of value for fans of postnoir. Look out too for an appearance by a young JeanLouis Trintignant.".

	schema:reviewBody "This twisted cop mystery follows the efforts of the overworked Paris police to solve first a murder in a couchette car the dead body discovered only after all the other passengers left and then the strange necking of many of the others before the cops can get to talk to them. There is great acting here from Signoret Montand and others and very amusing supporting parts the seasoned crook and talker Bob will have you cracking up but the film doesn't really hang together tight as a police mystery. I agree with an earlier reviewer that it spells trouble for you as a viewer that the passengers whom we glimpse in halfdarkness on the train remain nameless for too long and when they are identified by the police the names are not steadily linked to faces.It's confusing too that some of the characters suddenly muse into flashback kicking off from lines spoken to them on the train. This deepens them as characters but doesn't make the story concise. And at the police station things are suddenly tossed in by phone calls in a way that looks haphazard. The root cause I think is that the film followed the book too closely while CostaGavras knows how to create arresting vivid scenes he hasn't learnt at this point how to reimagine a storyline from writing so that it works on the screen and so the movie seems a bit unfocused. When the final cause of the murders starts to crop up it looks for too long like a joke element brought in for atmosphere.It's not a bad movie at all the photography is great the final car chase is a winner how often do you see a car chase in 1960s Paris? and the acting is very good. Don't expect a murder story though with the tightness and relentless upheld suspense of Strangers On A Train or even some episodes of Columbo or Kojak.".

And I finally rediscover the very first CostaGavras movie a restored masterpiece in the way of shooting and editing so fastpaced and inventive thanks to the cinematographer Jean Tournier. Jean Tournier worked again with CostaGavras on his second movie Un Homme de Trop even more fastpaced than his first and still with fabulous Michel Piccoli as the very special man. In both movies the cast is terrific but much more tense in Un Homme de Trop. My favorite scenes in Compartiment Tueurs are  in the train with Piccoli and the last part when cops begin to understand it gets faster and faster fasten your seat belts. But my top favorite scenes are with the killer  I hadn't seen this movie for a long time and had since discovered Gialli I've seen around 300 titles. So I got a shock when I first saw the killer in black leather seeing him again and again  total giallo style. And what about the last scene seen also in a giallo. And the car chase like the killer scenes are so similar to a master of gialli and crimi I'll let you guess.Thank you Sir CostaGavras.".

Jean Tournier worked again with CostaGavras on his second movie Un Homme de Trop even more fastpaced than his first and still with fabulous Michel Piccoli as the very special man. In both movies the cast is terrific but much more tense in Un Homme de Trop. My favorite scenes in Compartiment Tueurs are  in the train with Piccoli and the last part when cops begin to understand it gets faster and faster fasten your seat belts. But my top favorite scenes are with the killer  I hadn't seen this movie for a long time and had since discovered Gialli I've seen around 300 titles. So I got a shock when I first saw the killer in black leather seeing him again and again  total giallo style. And what about the last scene seen also in a giallo. And the car chase like the killer scenes are so similar to a master of gialli and crimi I'll let you guess.Thank you Sir CostaGavras.";

	schema:headline " An exciting and ingenious French film noir by CostaGavras";
	schema:reviewBody "This film the original French title of which is COMPARTIMENT TUEURS is known in English as THE SLEEPING CAR MURDER. I don't believe it has ever been available with English subtitles on DVD or video. I obtained a poor DVD copy of an off the air tape which was dubbed into English. Despite the poor quality of my copy it was well worth viewing. The film is directed and scripted by the famous CostaGavras but is one of his least known films because of the lack of distribution. It goes at a cracking pace and has a splendid cast. Probably the best job of acting is done by Michel Piccoli as a hopeless creepy lech who is on the edge of madness and can't make it with women despite his uncontrollable lusts and interior rants of frustration which we hear as voiceovers. Tthe film is filled with other well known actors. Yves Montand plays a worldweary Paris police inspector Simone Signoret plays an aging woman who has fallen hopelessly in love with a mysterious young man played by JeanLouis Trintignant. The scene where Montand interviews Signoret the two in real life were a well known couple as most people are aware is amusing because they struggle to control their giggles. Catherine Allgret plays a young girl just travelling to Paris for the first time in a sleeping car with five other people two of whom are Signoret and Piccoli. They are on an overnight train journey from Marseilles although the story starts at Avignon to Paris. Upon arrival a glamorous woman in the compartment is discovered to have been strangled to death. The police set about trying to find the killer and start by attempting to round up all the people who had spent the night in the sleeping car. But then one by one before the police can get to them the people in the sleeping car are brutally killed by the same person presumably to get rid of witnesses to the strangling of the woman in the sleeping car. However the story has a lot more surprises than that. The film is based upon a novel by the very clever writer Sbastian Japrisot who is famous for A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT 2004 starring the Elf Audrey Tautou and THE CHILDREN OF THE MARSHLAND 1999 see my forthcoming review. This was the first feature film directed by CostaGavras who was later to shake the world with his powerful political dramas such as Z STATE OF SIEGE MISSING and MUSIC BOX. He is still with us aged 81 and directed the film CAPITAL starring Gabriel Byrne and Philippe Duclos one of my favourite actors as recently as 2012 when he was 79. One curiosity of the casting is that Claude Berri appears as a porter in the film though uncredited. It was in this same year that he produced his first short film LE POULET. He had already been acting for twelve years. This film has many twists and turns and an extraordinarily ingenious plot. I will not spoil things by even hinting at an explanation of it. CostaGavras directs with verve and intensity and he achieves a spectacular success with the complicated filming of a sequence where a speeding car is being chased by a gang of motorcycles. It is no easy thing to keep track of half a dozen speeding vehicles of different sizes streaking across the streets of Paris at night and make it look convincing. The cinematography by Jean Tournier is a tour de force and the editing by Christian Gaudin enables the director to achieve his sense of an insoluble mystery hurtling over a cliff into the unknown at everincreasing speed with Yves Montand who is heavylidded and has a cold streaking after it determined to find out whodunit if it is the last thing he does I mean the last thing he does before going to sleep as he so laid back that one often does not know whether he is thinking or napping. The spider's web of complexity of this film's plot and the explosive speed at which it travels creates what was to be the trademark CostaGavras sense of danger and excitement from this his very first film. If you can find it and manage to see it you certainly won't regret it. What a way to start his career as a director!".

If you want detailed accuracy about the Beatles this is not for you. Read the books. But if you want to see a film which tells a good story well and which will give you a real feel for the vibes of the time and for the characters it claims to portray and an insight into one important aspect of the early history of the Beatles I think you will enjoy this. I thought I wouldn't but I did. And I will watch it again. And did I say? it's about the Beatles.This is not a biopic nor does it pretend to be but it does claim to tell the story of Stu and Astrid and I thought it did that very well. I don't object at all to the use of some artistic licence such as Astrid's excellent English. Contrary to some other reviewers I found the portrayal of the quiet enigmatic Stu by Stephen Dorff quite excellent a perfect foil to the bitter sometimes thoughtful and wholly charismatic John Lennon portrayed just as well by Ian Hart.I first heard the Beatles just before their first British record Love Me Do became a minor hit in Autumn 1962. This film portrays events mostly more than a year before then and even longer before their last stint in Hamburg at the StarClub in December 1962 the subject of a famous amateur recording. Apart from the Polydor recordings by Bert Kampfaert we have little to judge objectively what the band sounded like in 196061 but judging from the 1962 live recordings and the comments of those who heard them before they were famous I'm quite prepared to believe the Beatles sounded then very much like the band used for the soundtrack to this film. OK the band aren't the Beatles and some of the details are a bit askew but the rockandroll standards portrayed were all part of the Beatles' act and are performed much as they performed them. Everyone tells how Stu Sutcliffe often played turning away from the audience as often seen in the film. It's hardly a realistic portrayal of the Hamburg clubs on the Reeperbahn in the early 1960s but I've seen worse and if you have little idea what life was like for the band before 1962 this will not be a bad introduction.Comparisons with A Hard Day's Night are ingenuous that was a film made by the Beatles early in 1964 after they were famous in Britain at least this is a film about the band when they were teenagers before pretty much anyone knew them outside Liverpool and Hamburg. Not the same at all. And of course they didn't sound back then like the Beatles' later recordings or even like they did on their tours of the US and elsewhere. Perhaps the only recording you can really compare is their first album Please Please Me and the live StarClub recording if you have it.It's a film for goodness' sake. I enjoyed it as one and I hope you do too. The characters rang true especially Ian Hart as John Lennon and the story is well worth telling and well worth watching.

This was the crucible in which the band was transformed from noisy amateurs to professionals ready to take on and change the world. The focus is on two young friends from Liverpool John Lennon Ian Hart and Stuart Sutcliffe Stephen Dorff. As a critic once noted dead men don't file lawsuits. Stuart is a sensitive lad with a great talent for painting. John is a cynic with a very large chip on his shoulder. He may be sensitive and intellectual too but he'd rather die than admit that to anyone. His artistic passion is expressed in the rock  roll music he's driven to play. Stu likes the image more than the music so he buys a bass guitar turns his back on a promising art career and joins the band. The fact that he can barely play his instrument is not lost on bandmate Paul McCartney Gary Bakewell.Playing a backbreaking schedule in Hamburg they meet up with two young Germans who become important in their lives Klaus Voorman Kai Wiesinger and especially Astrid Kirchherr Sheryl Lee two exi's sort of latterday beatniks or early hippies. Stu and Astrid fall in love and John is both irritated and fascinated by her. Soon Stu has to choose between his love for Astrid and painting and his deep emotional ties to John and the band.The actors portraying the most wellknown characters Hart Bakewell and Chris O'Neill as George Harrison all bear striking resemblances to their look in the early '60's. But this movie not only gets the style right but the substance as well. Paul McCartney has said it was full of inaccuracies like John singing Long Tall Sally always Paul's number but as an avid Beatles fan since 1964 my view is that it's a very honest portrayal. Ian Hart shines in his evocation of the complicated personality and tortured soul of John Lennon. He practically looks like a twin of John's son Julian. Sheryl Lee also stands out as the supercool Astrid in a restrained but powerful performance. The musical performances are fine too done by a band including Mike Mills of R.E.M. No Beatle originals are used in the movie but that's OK because at the time they were mostly playing powerful cover versions of American rock and soul. In fact the B word is not seen or uttered except once just before the film's conclusion.This movie is a triumph for all involved and even though it's not official it will only add to the great legacy left by the Beatles.".

I should identify that this movie is for mature audiences only aside from the language and sex it shows how John Paul George Pete and Stu got addicted to speed so that they could keep playing as a result they got little sleep and their eyes got all glassy as they laid awake.A really effective scene is right after Stu leaves the Beatles. Hoping to devote his life to art he goes out and gets all drunk. Around this time East Germany's government erects the Berlin Wall. Watching it on TV Astrid and Klaus hold hands to be supportive of each other. When Stu sees this he gets all violent. This scene  possibly more than any other in the movie  shows his mental breakdown.All in all a great movie. We also see that they first met Ringo in Hamburg.

Remember there had been nothing like it before. Even Elvis's influence lacked the raw dark smoky sweaty feel of Hamburg the Cavern Club and many venues that have disappeared from history. Astrid's art work through pictures captured the early feel of the Beatles and their livestimes like no other. When you look at those photos you can almost touch that slightly dangerous era.The various films about the Beatles early years all contribute varying flavours of that time without individually capturing the whole and I would recommend Beatlesfilm buffs to look up and watch all versions.Most of all the individuals.John was THE leader. Paul the workaholic perfectionist. George dedicated to improving his art while not taking any of it too seriously. Stuart doing his best for his friend John but inevitably his destiny sadly abbreviated was art. Pete was only transitional and Ringo who had already performed with them became an important factor.

I really enjoyed the dialogue interaction between the characters and the music even though there was no room for a genuine Beatles number. Whilst a massive Beatles fan generally in particular I am a massive fan and have huge respect for John Lennon as probably the greatest popular musician of all time. When you bear in mind his childhood and family background it should come as no surprise that he was such a tortured soul and as one of the other comments puts it had such a chip on his shoulder. We are just lucky that this manifested itself in his incredible writing and soulful singing surely he has the most underrated voice ever  just listen to Mr Moonlight Beatles for Saleor it's only love if help you don't agree. My overriding thought at the end of this movie was just how close Stuart Sutcliffe and Lennon were and thus what a massive impact his death must have had on him.

Much of the story is of a Tug Of war between John lennon trying to keep him involved in the music and Astrid who sees his artistic potential.  It's a story that has been played over and over again but is refreshed in the context of surrounding characters that you feel you already know.The Characteristically funny Lennon Business like McCartney Shy Harrison all come across very comfortably.

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this film but I just had a little trouble with the music. It was truly terrific but Dave Pirner sounds nothing like Paul McCartney by any stretch of the imagination nor does Greg Dulli sound anything remotely like John Lennon.  I thought it was great that they used such wellknown and talented musicians as Thurston Moore and Dave Grohl but couldn't they have found somebody that sounded a little bit more like Lennon and McCartney? Ok enough about that.  I didn't know the whole story about Stuart Sutcliffe and I had no idea that SPOILER he died.  That was awful.  But I really enjoyed learning more about one of my favorite bands especially since I completely missed out on their heyday. John Lennon died about six months before I was born!  Oh the agony!  I really didn't know much about the early days of the band so this movie was very informative.  I thought all the actors looked incredibly like their reallife counterparts.  I had already see Ian Hart portray Lennon in The Hours and the Times so I knew his characterization of Lennon was awesome and made me enjoy his performance in Backbeat all the more. I highly recommend this film to all Beatles fans and anyone interested in rock 'n' roll history.".

It was truly terrific but Dave Pirner sounds nothing like Paul McCartney by any stretch of the imagination nor does Greg Dulli sound anything remotely like John Lennon.  I thought it was great that they used such wellknown and talented musicians as Thurston Moore and Dave Grohl but couldn't they have found somebody that sounded a little bit more like Lennon and McCartney? Ok enough about that.  I didn't know the whole story about Stuart Sutcliffe and I had no idea that SPOILER he died.  That was awful.  But I really enjoyed learning more about one of my favorite bands especially since I completely missed out on their heyday. John Lennon died about six months before I was born!  Oh the agony!  I really didn't know much about the early days of the band so this movie was very informative.  I thought all the actors looked incredibly like their reallife counterparts.  I had already see Ian Hart portray Lennon in The Hours and the Times so I knew his characterization of Lennon was awesome and made me enjoy his performance in Backbeat all the more. I highly recommend this film to all Beatles fans and anyone interested in rock 'n' roll history.";

The historical inaccuracies alone just kill it. But worst of all they just don't sound anything like the Beatles. Just listen to the Cavern Club stuff on the Anthology DVD's and you will see what they sounded like just a year later. OK I know the Beatles had a ball in Hamburg drugs girls etc but this is so far off the mark it's just silly. Lennon comes off as a complete dick head with no artistic qualities and Stu as some sort of genius while he could hardly play bass. Stu was about 5ft4in tall in real life but here he's as tall as Paul. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over because it plays like a TV movie of the week but I always feel a little used afterward this was really just a rip off and a money maker on the Beatles name. Oh and Stu was already out of the band when they recorded My Bonnie.".

The former will probably enjoy the film for what it is the latter will find it annoying. I am sorry to say that I am in the latter camp. There are so many historical inaccuracies that it is hardly worth listing them. The most annoying to me was the placing of the recording of My Bonnie before Stuart Suttcliffe had left the band. I thought that was totally unnecessary. Another inaccuracy is depicting Paul McCartney trying to kick Suttcliffe out of the band so that he could take over the bass. Also the length of Astrid's hair is based on a self photograph of hers. Contemporary photographs show her with shoulder length hair.As well as the Beatles themselves who walk onstage and start to play without plugging their guitars in the film also features the real life characters Astrid Kirchherr Cynthia Powell Lennon and Klaus Voormann who are named and Bruno Koschmidder and Tony Sheridan who are not.Since John Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe are dead the film makers can imply that the pair had homosexual feelings for one another and not get sued.The rest of the Beatles are reduced to one dimensional cutouts the serious one the quiet one the cipher.That's what the film got wrong. Let us see what the film got right.When you look at an historical film  especially one that covers a period within living memory  one can find lots of anachronisms with the fashions of the time. Normally I will home in on half a dozen things that were not around in 196061. Not in this film. The shooting and direction  apart from the little melodrama at Sutcliffe's death  was good and the scene where Sutcliffe spazzed out and threw red paint all over the bathroom was excellent the red paint signifying blood as though a murder had been committed.But alas the scriptwriters were not up to the same standard as the wardrobe department the cameramen the musicians and the director and I found titles of Beatles songs yet to be written like Hard Day's Night and Eight Days a Week being worked into the script utterly ridiculous. What were the scriptwriters trying to do?".

It is a sensitive piece without a doubt and a decent homage to the beginnings of the world's most popular band but Stephen Dorff as Sutcliffe is pretty horrible his overacting almost painful to watch. Unfortunately his performance ruined a lot for me which is the film's greatest pity because Sutcliffe was an interesting character. He came to the band in 1960 as bass player after Lennon wheedled him into. While staying almost exclusively in Hamburg Sutcliffe met the German photographer Astrid Kirchherr who was also the inspiration for the famous haircuts and fell in love with her. He neglected the duties of being a band member concentrated on painting instead and spent his time with Astrid whereupon McCartney fired him. So Sutcliffe accepted within a blink and said that the band is not going to become famous anyway. You bet. However Dorff was definitely the wrong choice for the role.".

The plot focuses on Stuart Sutcliffe and his relationship with John Lennon. In a way the movie shows us the Beatles as most of us do NOT know them  the setting is neither London nor NYC Liverpool plays a relatively minor role they're not being chased by hordes of screaming teenagers their drugs are still beer and tabs and some amphetamines most of all they're still a rock 'n' roll band trying to break through.That's actually one of the movie's biggest assets it manages to convincingly show the group as a kickass rock band although they're playing covers of USAmerican hits for the most part. The actors playing Lennon Harrison and McCartney are surprisingly convincing.Some fans have criticised the movie for being inaccurate because for example John's later wife Cynthia is shown as a homely girl with a scarf whereas she stated that she didn't like wearing scarfs. And I'd say it's true that Stephen Dorff's portrayal of Sutcliffe is too aggressive histrionic over the top in scene for example he needlessly attacks the Klaus Voormann character in a way that would probably get him an extended stretch for attempted manslaughter in the real world. But as long as you keep in mind that this is not a documentary the average nonstickler fan should be more than happy with this fare.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite excellent performances by Dorff and Ian Hart this film is a horrible melange of poor screen writing and a lack of any desire for historical accuracy. It is a horrendous misrepresentation of Sutcliffe and Lennon and Ian Soiftley seems determined to just fill each scene with angry shouting and pointless and senseless actions to cover up the lack of character development and the lack of any reasoning for the characters' behaviors. The characters come across as the most superficial of clichs and stereotypes. One should avoid this film entirely for it is slanderous and superficial despite being about some of the most complex and fascinating people in the history of music. The saddest thing being that people will see this film thinking it is an accurate portrayal of the people whose lives the film is based upon and the deep and complex relationship that Sutcliffe and Lennon actually had in real life but the inaccuracies abound. Spoiler Alert The film shows an entirely fabricated scene that has absolutely no basis in fact whatsoever in which Sutcliffe in a jealous rage attacks a platonic male friend of his girlfriend Astrid. I have done research on this and there is no basis in fact whatsoever and in truth both Lennon and Harrison have been quoted in stating how gentle and nonviolent Sutcliffe was. This is just one of the many scenes that seem to indicate that the screenwriters just wanted to cash in by making a film about the Beatles without any true research and to just fill each scene with as much violence and rock and roll as they could to make up for the mindless screen writing. The film limps to its closure without the viewer having any idea why any of the characters said or did anything that was played out in the film. Lennon comes across as a whiny angry homophobic mess and Sutcliffe comes across as a moody jerk with no emotional depth or logic. Given the subject matter this could have been quite a film. For a much more accurate and riveting film about Lennon and Sutcliffe view the made for TV movie titled Lennon.".

	schema:headline " The Story of Stu Sutcliffe the lost Beatle...Who cares?!";
	schema:reviewBody "Honestly I expected much more of this film than what I got. As a dedicated Beatles fan I was appalled by what I was watching. First of all the script is clearly flawed there are a lot of historical inaccuracies among one of the things that enraged me was that they basically made Paul McCartney out to be the villain of the story when in fact that was the farthest thing from the truth. In fact John wasn't actually that upset when Stu told him he wanted to leave the band he was more upset with the fact that Stu was staying in Germany and not returning with them to Liverpool. Another thing that didn't anger me but annoyed the hell out of me was Stephen Dorff's awful Liverpudlian accent. It was just really annoying and it took me completely out of the story. No matter how much Dorff resembles Sutcliffe he is the worst choice to play this role. I don't believe that at the time he was an experienced actor that was prepared for a role as demanding as this one. The dialogue was pretty shoddy apart from the stuff being uttered by Hart Bakewell and O'Neill. Honestly every time Sheryl Lee and Stephen Dorff opened their mouths I wanted to puke. The love scenes were cheesy and dated. Also in real life Miss Kirchherr didn't even know a word of English and had to communicate with Stu and the rest of the lads with a dictionary. Wouldn't it had been easier for them to have hired an actual German actress who spoke English to play the role of Astrid rather than an American with a crappy German accent. Also the music being played is very punk rock a genre and a style that didn't even exist back then. The producer of the film said this was done to better convey the way the music came across to the audience at the time well as wonderful as an idea as that is what it does is to confuse and annoy the audience especially real Beatle fans like myself that have seen footage of the real Beatles performing classics like Long Tall Sally which was by the way massacred in this film. Another thing the whole movie sells it self as the story of Stu Sutcliffe the Beatle that could have been. Honestly who cares? What people want to see going in to this film is John Lennon or Paul McCartney or even George Harrison or poor Ringo who doesn't even have lines in this movie he's in it for less than a minute and he's lying on a bed sleeping for the entire two seconds he's on the screen. Could it have hurt the producers to give the poor guy a line or two if merely for the fans' sake also Ringo was one of their closest friends in Hamburg and even played a few gigs with the Beatles themselves when Pete Best didn't show up to some gigs which was actually quite often. So it wasn't like they were going to stretch the truth if they gave the actor playing Ringo a bigger role. But no instead they write more crappy love scenes between Dorff and Lee who barely have any chemistry. Poor Astrid Kirchherr she is portrayed in this movie as a lovesick slutty harpy who tore Stu and John apart. She was actually very close to all the Beatles even Paul who had his differences with Stu.It would have been more interesting and better if the film focused not only on Stu but on all the Beatles and presented the growing problems with the band like Pete Best's absence and his lack of interest or the songwriting partnership between John and Paul and the fight for leadership or George's frustration as the youngest member of the band or their growing friendship with Ringo. But not all is bad there are some good things though not many. Ian Hart is absolutely fabulous as John Lennon if there is one person who can completely embody the icon it's him. He delivers the lines so well that it feels like he's improvising some of the stuff and who knows maybe he did. Gary Bakewell looks and acts like a young cocky Paul McCartney and does what he can with what is given to him. He's written like a villain even though for most of the film we actually agree with him but that's also due to the fact that the writers in trying to make Sutcliffe interesting and sympathetic due the exact opposite he's just an annoyance and as soon as he's on the screen you want him to go away. Scot Williams and Chris O'Neill also do a pretty good job with the little they're given. Lee's accent is atrocious as is Dorff's and that pretty much messes their whole performances. Jennifer Ehle is passable as Cynthia No wonder the real Cynthia Lennon was upset when this film came out she's portrayed as a pathetic melodramatic woman. It's not Ehle's fault though it's more the writers and director's fault. I don't even know what kind of pathetic research Ian Softley did when he wrote the script and made this movie but obviously he should of done more. The ending is sappy and melodramatic but what do you expect from such a cheesy and historically inaccurate biopic.".

Poor Astrid Kirchherr she is portrayed in this movie as a lovesick slutty harpy who tore Stu and John apart. She was actually very close to all the Beatles even Paul who had his differences with Stu.It would have been more interesting and better if the film focused not only on Stu but on all the Beatles and presented the growing problems with the band like Pete Best's absence and his lack of interest or the songwriting partnership between John and Paul and the fight for leadership or George's frustration as the youngest member of the band or their growing friendship with Ringo. But not all is bad there are some good things though not many. Ian Hart is absolutely fabulous as John Lennon if there is one person who can completely embody the icon it's him. He delivers the lines so well that it feels like he's improvising some of the stuff and who knows maybe he did. Gary Bakewell looks and acts like a young cocky Paul McCartney and does what he can with what is given to him. He's written like a villain even though for most of the film we actually agree with him but that's also due to the fact that the writers in trying to make Sutcliffe interesting and sympathetic due the exact opposite he's just an annoyance and as soon as he's on the screen you want him to go away. Scot Williams and Chris O'Neill also do a pretty good job with the little they're given. Lee's accent is atrocious as is Dorff's and that pretty much messes their whole performances. Jennifer Ehle is passable as Cynthia No wonder the real Cynthia Lennon was upset when this film came out she's portrayed as a pathetic melodramatic woman. It's not Ehle's fault though it's more the writers and director's fault. I don't even know what kind of pathetic research Ian Softley did when he wrote the script and made this movie but obviously he should of done more. The ending is sappy and melodramatic but what do you expect from such a cheesy and historically inaccurate biopic.";

I had seen Dorff previously in The Power of One and was amazed at his uncanny ability to get an Afrikanse accent right in a South African story. He does similarly here with not a British accent but a Liverpudlian one. He certainly got no complaints from white South Africans or Liverpudlians for either film. He's got the best ear for speech patterns this side of Robert Mitchum.Sheryl Lee is a fetching Astrid Kirschner beloved of Sutcliffe and possibly of Lennon also.

It's like looking in young Lennon's soul.The other Beatles are there Paul McCartney George Harrison and Peter Best and there's a brief appearance by Ringo Starr who was drumming for another band and would be the piece that completed the revolutionary quartet eventually.

But the various milieu in which the characters lived  the bleakness of Liverpool the sleaze of Hamburg  is beautifully conveyed and gives you a better sense of what shaped John Lennon's tortured genius than any dry recitation of recordingsession dates. You get a nice sense of the Beatles' looming threat to Britain's staid popular culture in an early scene of John Lennon and best mate Stuart Sutcliffe sitting in a trad jazz club wearing leather jackets and heckling the band. You also get a good idea of Hamburg's sordidness from a quickcut stripper montage after the lads have departed England for the Reeperbahn. Musically the band performances don't sound exactly like the early Beatles but the filmmakers choose wisely when they asked a group of indiemusic allstars like Thurston Moore Sonic Youth to play on the soundtrack. The loud slightly dissonant take on early Beatles classics are as vivid and startling as the Beatles must have been to early 60s audiences. Finally the film doesn't gloss over any bad behavior  there's drugs and whoring galore and Lennon is depicted as an obnoxious if engaging genius. How did you get to be such an hole? asks Astrid Kirchherr. Practice responds Lennon. It's a wellmade lively portray of The Artists As A Bunch Of Horny Young Men on Speed and if a few dates get muddled well you're supposed to look those up in books anyway not get them from movies.What keeps Backbeat from being brilliant sadly is the central character of Stuart Sutcliffe who comes off as a wooden shallow pretty boy. I don't know if that's a fair portrayal of the real Sutcliffe or a side effect of asking Stephen Dorff to play him. Lennon and Astrid are competing for Sutcliffe's love and their rivalry is a lot more interesting than the relationship either have with Stuart himself probably because they're stronger characters played by better actors.

Whatever you're watching this movie because you're a Beatles fan you don't need a love story. As for the supporting characters now legends Paul McCartney doesn't come off all that well but he never does on film Cynthia Lennon gets a surprisingly sympathetic treatment she's a cipher or a shrew elsewhere and George Ringo Pete Best et al all sort of lurk in the shadow of John Lennon's and Paul McCartney's opportunism just like in real life.".

How different would the success of The Beatles have been without his contribution? Basically if you take him out of this story you don't have much left.

	schema:reviewBody "If you haven't seen the movie yet let me say right out of the starting gate it's worth watching. The writing is welldone. The acting is great despite the lackluster Liverpool accents and it's packed full of music. Although a fun watch it has some major flaws in terms of historical accuracy not necessarily in terms of story although there are a few but particularly through the twisting of characters to help the story along. Such flaws reportedly were enough to make the real George Harrison walk out of the screening minutes into the film. I understand that for most people it doesn't matter a whole lot but if you're a diehard Beatle freak looking for a historical account this may not be for you. Allow me to explain... Forgive me. I'm about to geek out.1. Important people and events from the time were not present in the movie at all like Allan Williams The Beatles' first manager who got them the Hamburg gig. Paul and Pete getting deported for arson is completely left out of the movie. 2. Accounts of Lennon in Hamburg have presented him as quickwitted and goodnatured although vulgar and at times a troublemaker. Lennon is portrayed in the movie as an angry crying and confused person who can't control his emotions.3. The movie portrays The Beatles as a tight energetic pitchperfect band from the beginning. In reality The Beatles were notorious around Liverpool as the worst band in town with the worst equipment and no stage presence. It was playing in Hamburg that made them the stomping screaming watertight group they became but their progression as a group is nonexistent in the film. Also the recording date with Tony Sheridan took place after Stu was no longer in the band. He actually attended the recording session to watch.4. In the film McCartney and Harrison take a sort of back seat and are portrayed as outsiders not able to understand the complex relationship of Lennon and Sutcliffe. This undermines the importance they had in the development and sound of The Beatles. Furthermore although McCartney has stated that he felt he had to take a backseat to Sutcliffe Lennon considered McCartney his musical partner and had known him longer than Sutcliffe. It's unlikely that the friction between them was as great as shown in the film especially considering that they agreed on Sutcliffe's subpar playing to begin with.5. In the movie Astrid appears to live on her own. Actually she lived with her mother and siblings who took Stuart in as one of the family until he died. 5. There is little to no support for the homosexual implications between Lennon and Sutcliffe. None of the other Beatles have ever mentioned such a thing and Sutcliffe's own sister says the claim is probably false. Also Lennon's crush on Astrid was another fabrication for the film. Tony Sheridan fellow Hamburg performer and friend of the band at the time has since said that it was McCartney who was interested in Astrid adding to the friction between he and Stu. Lastly and most importantly I think the viewer shouldn't overestimate the value of Stu to The Beatles. I understand that since the movie revolves around him he's going to be presented as a young genius at odds with a selfish and famehungry McCartney but that seems to me to be giving Sutcliffe a little too much credit. There's not enough focus on the fact that Stu could barely play bass at all. They show him as a guy who just makes mistakes sometimes when really he could barely hold it together. It's been documented that every other Beatle including Lennon was never satisfied with his playing and was often embarrassed by him. Stu Sutcliffe has been described by both McCartney and Harrison as just a school friend of Lennon's who never should have been in the band to begin with. To them he was nothing more than that.Ultimately he's a footnote on their page in history and they viewed him as such. The issue with this movie is that it was billed as being about The Beatles when really it's about John and Stu's friendship. And it seems pretty obvious to me that there's a concerted effort to add gravity where there shouldn't really be any. If you want the real story of The Beatles without the Hollywood addins I recommend The Beatles Anthology. Backbeat was a good movie but if I'm taking George and Paul's word for it and I do Stu was much more a pretentious hipster who owned a bass than he was a tragic genius.".

Paul and Pete getting deported for arson is completely left out of the movie. 2. Accounts of Lennon in Hamburg have presented him as quickwitted and goodnatured although vulgar and at times a troublemaker. Lennon is portrayed in the movie as an angry crying and confused person who can't control his emotions.3. The movie portrays The Beatles as a tight energetic pitchperfect band from the beginning. In reality The Beatles were notorious around Liverpool as the worst band in town with the worst equipment and no stage presence. It was playing in Hamburg that made them the stomping screaming watertight group they became but their progression as a group is nonexistent in the film. Also the recording date with Tony Sheridan took place after Stu was no longer in the band. He actually attended the recording session to watch.4. In the film McCartney and Harrison take a sort of back seat and are portrayed as outsiders not able to understand the complex relationship of Lennon and Sutcliffe. This undermines the importance they had in the development and sound of The Beatles. Furthermore although McCartney has stated that he felt he had to take a backseat to Sutcliffe Lennon considered McCartney his musical partner and had known him longer than Sutcliffe. It's unlikely that the friction between them was as great as shown in the film especially considering that they agreed on Sutcliffe's subpar playing to begin with.5. In the movie Astrid appears to live on her own. Actually she lived with her mother and siblings who took Stuart in as one of the family until he died. 5. There is little to no support for the homosexual implications between Lennon and Sutcliffe. None of the other Beatles have ever mentioned such a thing and Sutcliffe's own sister says the claim is probably false. Also Lennon's crush on Astrid was another fabrication for the film. Tony Sheridan fellow Hamburg performer and friend of the band at the time has since said that it was McCartney who was interested in Astrid adding to the friction between he and Stu. Lastly and most importantly I think the viewer shouldn't overestimate the value of Stu to The Beatles. I understand that since the movie revolves around him he's going to be presented as a young genius at odds with a selfish and famehungry McCartney but that seems to me to be giving Sutcliffe a little too much credit. There's not enough focus on the fact that Stu could barely play bass at all. They show him as a guy who just makes mistakes sometimes when really he could barely hold it together. It's been documented that every other Beatle including Lennon was never satisfied with his playing and was often embarrassed by him. Stu Sutcliffe has been described by both McCartney and Harrison as just a school friend of Lennon's who never should have been in the band to begin with. To them he was nothing more than that.Ultimately he's a footnote on their page in history and they viewed him as such. The issue with this movie is that it was billed as being about The Beatles when really it's about John and Stu's friendship. And it seems pretty obvious to me that there's a concerted effort to add gravity where there shouldn't really be any. If you want the real story of The Beatles without the Hollywood addins I recommend The Beatles Anthology. Backbeat was a good movie but if I'm taking George and Paul's word for it and I do Stu was much more a pretentious hipster who owned a bass than he was a tragic genius.";

On first viewing much of my brain was occupied with figuring out what was going on and how the subplots related. On second viewing I got to enjoy many of the subtler aspects of the script and the performances which are all first rate. This is a demanding movie. It's complex the story is revealed slowly and nonlinearly and many of the areas of personality and philosophy it explores are dark. But there's also great humor easily understood echoes of Our Town and It's A Wonderful Life and a satisfactory resolution. Great writing and marvelous acting beautifully captured on film. And it definitely repays repeated viewing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I got to see this movie for the second time at the Boston Independent Film Festival 29 April 2007 and my admiration grows. On first viewing much of my brain was occupied with figuring out what was going on and how the subplots related. On second viewing I got to enjoy many of the subtler aspects of the script and the performances which are all first rate. This is a demanding movie. It's complex the story is revealed slowly and nonlinearly and many of the areas of personality and philosophy it explores are dark. But there's also great humor easily understood echoes of Our Town and It's A Wonderful Life and a satisfactory resolution. Great writing and marvelous acting beautifully captured on film. And it definitely repays repeated viewing.";

We don't know why the characters still don't know why but in the end it doesn't matter because magically Finn is healed of his misery. Maybe he just needed a good cry?

In a stronger movie he would have been nominated for an Oscar. The movie looks absolutely beautiful. Some of the shots are inspiring and moving.The problem of this film is that the story Aaron J. Wiederspahn writes and direct is long tedious and goes in circle. For instance Scott Wilson plays a character called Tucker with aplomb but after a while it's just difficult to sympathize when nothing is going on but a sort of selfpity festival.Without a doubt the worse moment in this movie is its resolution. A long scene featuring Strathairn and Ian Somerhalder of Lost fame and as bad as usual is just outrageously silly. It's probably the first time ever I didn't find Strathairn believable and the whole scene ends up being an embarrassing mess and a pathetic conclusion.What raises this movie to a four is some beautiful shots throughout the movie and Daniel Gillies' performance. I'm glad to learn that Gillies will soon direct his first movie. Hopefully this should allow him to shine in something other than a sub par drama.".

But after seeing Lyne's brilliant version of Lolita I can see how he manages to breathe fresh controversy into this familiar story.  Lyne's lascivious lens eroticizes Lolita's every movement and pose.  The viewer is forced to see her through the eyes of Humbert and to feel his obsession and desire.  We are coconspirators in his crime and at the end we share his shame.  Rather than shocking us and having us pull away in revulsion Lyne draws us in and makes us face the Humbert in ourselves.

	schema:headline " Humbert the noble or how to make a pedophile lovable.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's brilliant book about the sordid relationship between a grown man and a teenage girl.  Although still disconcerting the subject of pedophilia is far less shocking today than when the book was published almost 50 years ago.  Yet despite the subject matter the book was wildly popular because it was a literary work of art beautifully written with some of the most splendid metaphors and descriptive narrative in American literature.  This was all the more amazing when one considers that English was Nabokov's second language.Director Adrian Lynn Fatal Attraction 9  weeks Indecent Proposal is no stranger to stories with perverse sexual content.  His presentation of the story does the book justice although certain interpretations may not have been what Nabokov had in mind.  Lynn gives us a presentation that is very sympathetic to Humbert.  Nabokov's Humbert was very complex partly a victim of his fixation on young girls partly a sexual predator and partly a hopeless romantic.  Nabokov's Lolita was extremely innocent just approaching the threshold of sexual curiosity and urges more playful than consciously provocative.  While Nabokov hints at a mutual seduction he leans far more heavily towards Humbert as the cause of the events even though Humbert is clearly helpless in the face of his obsession.  Lolita entered into the sexual relationship more as a result of longings burgeoning from her blossoming sexuality than a desire to seduce Humbert in particular who was not even her first lover. Lynn's presentation transforms Humbert from the seducer into the seduced whose weakness for young girls is manipulated by a sexually precocious siren tempting him to dash himself on the shoals of pedophilia.  Lynn portrays Lolita as the aggressor an adolescent temptress who knows she is desired and simultaneously teases and entices him to do her lustful bidding knowing he is powerless to resist.  Lynn's Humbert is more of a hapless romantic than a fiend ennobling him as a victim of love rather than the confounded sociopath he really is.  In Lynn's version Humbert becomes the fly to Lolita's spider.However after the initial seduction when they take to the road the film is very true to the book in chronicling the decay of the relationship Humbert's further plunge into feelings of romantic desperation and Lolita's shrewish exploitation of him as she increasingly uses sex as a weapon.  The book was very effective at portraying the relationship as a symbiosis of two deficient beings each selfishly taking from the other what was needed. Lynn does an excellent job of portraying that here.  As the relationship degenerates Lynn is effectual at portraying the ugly side of both characters.  The bitterness and rancor that results is compelling.  To his credit he understands that Nabokov's story was more of a character study than a sex story and Lynn avoids the temptation of becoming too lurid focusing instead on solid character development of two very flawed beings.I must take a moment to give Lynn the highest praise for his period renderings.  This is one of the finest portrayals of 1940's Americana I can remember.  The costumes hairstyles cars furniture locations and sets create a 40's reality that is like being hurtled back in a time machine. The music is not just precise for the period but it is perfectly integrated with the story.  As the two travel the music changes to reflect the region. Having Lolita dance and sing to period music on the radio is a nice touch because that is exactly what teenage girls of any era are apt to do.The acting is first rate all around.  When the film was made Dominique Swain was 17 and although she looked young for her age she could never pass for 12.  So for the first part of the film before Charlotte's demise she is simply too mature.  However for the road trip she is ideal.  Though I don't agree with Lynn's early interpretation of Lolita as the teenage temptress I can't imagine it being done any better than the performance Swain delivers.  She is playful and provocative in a childlike manner part pixie and part vamp.  Once they get on the road Swain hits stride with a performance that is almost a force of nature.  She is powerful and intense effortlessly moving back and forth between sweet innocence and the emotional torrent typified by the murder me' scene.  It is an outstanding performance with depth and breadth that is very unusual for an actor so young.Jeremy Irons is wonderful as Humbert giving him as amiable a personality as one could possibly imagine for a character with such vile intentions.  Irons injects a good deal of wry humor into the part in addition to giving Humbert an almost quixotic romantic quality.  Melanie Griffith is just the wrong actress to play Charlotte.  She looks nothing like the portly and plain character described in Nabokov's book.  Though her acting is fine and she is appropriately obsequious she is far too attractive to be the repulsive troll Humbert despised.  It takes away from Humbert's desperation because it hardly seems like a great sacrifice to have married Charlotte to be near Lolita.Frank Langella Dracula is more obnoxious than mysterious as Quilty making the audience want to exhort Humbert to pull the trigger as he confronts Quilty with the revolver.  Again I think this is probably Lynn's doing since his vision is clearly that of a Humbert sympathizer.This is a fine film with great production values terrific performances and a classic story.  I feel that it surpasses Kubrik's adaptation in its ability to capture many of the finer points of Nabokov's book even though Nabokov collaborated on the Kubrik film.  I rated it an 810.  It is definitely worth digging out of the rental stacks.".

Even the dialogues in many scenes remained exactly the same. Most of the movie is a flashback but Lyne doesn't make the same mistake as Kubrick and he follows the correct order of events Quilty's murder i.e..The casting is excellent. Jeremy Irons proved to be a much better choice than James Mason was in Kubrick's version. Irons delivers probably one of his best performances as he portrays the tragic character of Humbert Humbert. Iron's voice overs help us get into the mind of Humbert and understand his thoughts and actions. Dominique Swain is excellent as Lolita. She is the perfect nymphet. Young and innocent but vulgar and crude at the same time. Frank Langella as Clare Quilty is a little bit too mysterious and he probably should've been a bit funnier as his character was in Nabokov's book.The final reason why this movie is better than its predecessor is its photography. The colors are just amazing. They actually seem to follow the mood of the story  from excitingly colorful to tragically dark.I'm going to keep this user comment rather short. I could compare it to Kubrick's version some more but it's easier if you just read my comment for Kubrick's Lolita.The highlight of the movie is definitely the last scene in which Humbert surrenders to the police  he stands on the top of a hill listens to the voice of children playing and expresses his remorse for ruining Lolita's life. In this one scene Lyne managed to capture the whole point of the book that Kubrick totally missed in his movie.The movie is a perfect 10. Just please go see it without any prejudice.".

I do think however that he did pinpoint one of the key components of the novel's genius a capturing of life on the newly paved highways of midcentury America.  As Humbert Jeremy Irons is as good as his predecessor James Mason.  Frank Langella's interpretation of Quilty entirely diverges from the one given by Peter Sellers and rightfully so who wants to compete with Sellers?.

	schema:headline " A powerfully moving adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Briefly put this film is a quite brilliant adaptation of the novel. While staying pretty faithful to the original source Stephen Schiff's screenplay fleshes out the primary characters and their relationship which plays out as a taboo but reserved love story. Maintaining the central themes the plot is reduced to the essence of the major players and the linear events of the book. It's almost impossible to adapt a long book into the confines of a single averagelength movie but Schiff captures most of the important moments quite well and humanizes the characters who could have come off as bizarre depictions from Humbert's narrative.Lyne's movie is at once haunting compelling and beautifully photographed. For all the controversy it is a mature reflective and subtle film. Lolita is a challenging piece of work that sublimely reflects the pathos of the story and manages to retain bits of the complex humor of Nabokov. This Lolita abandons the notion of being a complete social satire and works as an essentially dramatic portrayal of a doomed inappropriate romance that is ultimately a sad tragic tale.The performances are remarkable especially those of Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. Irons is utterly perfect as the illfated wretch Humbert Humbert. So understated but evocative with every move and gesture he is the definitive OldWorld European whose obsession bristles beneath his timorous demeanor. He evokes an incredible amount of sympathy for the character. Swain delivers an ontarget portrayal of the flowering nymphet who toys with her burgeoning sexuality but hasn't overcome her fundamental brattiness. Swain elicits both allure and pity as the wayward character whose immaturity in mindset and behavior does not excuse her complicity in her affairs. Despite what some critics may have written Melanie Griffith is fine in the small role as Lolita's overbearing mother. She is comically obtuse and her veneer hits all the right grating notes. Frank Langella rounds out the cast as the mysterious Quilty. He is appropriately shady vague and sinister when he appears from time to time slowly revealing himself.This is a real winner on many levels and should be up for several awards including best picture director actor actress and adapted screenplay. Showtime should be congratulated for its smart acquisition. I hope the movie finds its way to the largest possible audience.".

	schema:headline " Worth seeing if you love the novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Nabokov's best novel save for Pale Fire will probably never get an ideal filming unless someone decides to actually commit Nabokov's own script to celluloid he wrote it for the 1962 version and his name appears in the credits but the finished product was almost wholly the product of Kubrick's pen and Peter Sellers' adlibbing.  But I like both the Kubrick and the Lyne versions with reservations.With Kubrick's the only real problem is that it's not Nabokov. James Mason's performance contains the core of an accurate portrayal of Humbert and he's often moving. But Sue Lyon was too old for her part and Sellers' Quilty is an altogether different conception from the author's not that he isn't lots of fun. The film also suffers from having been filmed in the UK. Nabokov had a complex vision of America  vast tacky seductive and grindingly mundane all at the same time  and this just can't be conveyed in a studio and with a few wellchosen locations.That's where Lyne's version excels. His compositions or his cinematographer's are indeed beautiful to look at and I think capture suburban and roadside America very much the way Humbert would have experienced them. Irons is fine as Humbert although the typecasting was initially painful to contemplate and Swain is a vast improvement over Lyon as young Dolores still a bit too old for the part an inevitable problem perhaps for anyone who wants to film this book but her intelligent performance makes up for this. Despite his cheesy reputation Lyne wisely refrains from making his Lolita a teenage bombshell something the more artistic Kubrick couldn't resist.Again however the problem is Quilty. Both directors obviously felt compelled to render in three dimensions a character who is one of Nabokov's phantoms Does he really exist? Who is he and what do we know about him outside of Humbert's increasingly paranoid imaginings? Can we trust anything at all that's said about him in this book? I expect that Nabokov himself regretted having to bring Quilty out of the shadows at all for the denouement.Sellers carried off the role with style making you forget for a moment that his routines seem to have wandered in from another film. Lyne turns the final confrontation between Humbert and Quilty there is no flashback framing device as in Kubrick into pure Grand Guignol and so we have to endure watching poor paunchy Frank Langella running down a hallway of his ridiculously overstuffed house his bathrobe falling open to reveal his endowments to our embarrassed gaze before being blown away Dirty Harrystyle by the avenging Humbert. A major wrong note to say the least.So Quilty in the end defeats both of Nabokov's filmic approximators. But if you love the book see both movies Kubrick and Lyne each capture different aspects of the master's great story in valuable ways and the new Lolita is clearly Lyne's best work yet proving that a great novel can inspire excellent filmmaking if not guarantee an ideal adaptation.What we really need now however is not a third version of Lolita but finally a filming of Lolita A Screenplay. Nabokov had fun writing this and any fan of his should read his script as well. Wouldn't you like to see a move of Lolita in which Humbert searching through the woods for his Lo encounters a butterfly collector named Vladimir Nabokov? Of course you would!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Author would be dismayed and precisely because the story is so faithful to the book. But the story in the book was incidental just something on which Nabokov could hang his layered challenges to concepts of narrative. The narrator is crazy overly colors and outright lies. The story never fully exists in the book at all and such as it does one can never be sure what is true and what imagined. Humbert is a made up name as are all names and clearly the narrator makes up most of the elements of his own character as well European Professor Author... obviously a joke by the narrator on Nabokov.In this film everything makes sense exactly the opposite of the reason the book exists. This is a beautiful film with lovely detailed cinematography good acting and great score and all to solidify something that Nabokov created such that it could not be so. I believe that Peter Greenaway could make a good film of Lolita and that he would have the courage to make it confusing and unerotic and unresolved. Why does Dolores' fate have to change in the film's epilogue? Because it ties up every last loose end. On Christmas Day no less!The real scandal is not that audiencescensors are shocked by prurient subjects but that they take one of the greatest literary achievements ever and make it explainable. Is this the only thing we can accept?But take the film on its own presumption that the book's story is what matters. This Lolita is too old too pretty and sexy too controlling. Irons is clearly narrowly channeled here and he is smart enough to know it his frustration with the unimaginative stance of the film translates to a frustrated Humbert. I think Melanie is just right just because HH calls her a cow means nothing. HH's violence with his previous wife should have been mentioned her running away with the Russian cabbie is as much a setup for the Lolita fixation as the childhood dalliance and better justifies the angst of loss. There should have been a few butterflies and some explanation about the play that it was written to allude to that first night at the hotel.I highly recommend the audio tape version of Lolita. It is read by guess... Jeremy Irons! What he brings to the audio tape is the voice and phrasing of a man in a cell continually going over things in his own mind embellishing and exaggerating and confusing and speculating and sometimes not at all sure about any of it. He brings this same voice to the voiceovers in the film but it conflicts with the images which purport to represent a narrative stance of real truth.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the Kubrick version and thinking no one could ever make a better Humbert than James Mason or a better Lolita than Sue Lyon I saw this updated version and I was very impressed.   It's actually an improvement.1. Quilty  Of all the things I did not like about the Kubrick version it was Peter Sellers' quirkily irritating and totally unclear portrayal of this jerk.   The latest version completely downplays the character other than to show that he is a dark mysterious monstrous person who keeps showing up in the shadows.   Also it finally clarifies that Quilty is the very worst of Humbert... It is Humbert without a soul conscience or any redeeming quality.  It becomes clear that he is truly a monster and makes Humbert look almost saintly by comparison.2. Humbert and Lolita  While I enjoyed the chemistry between James Mason and Sue Lyon immensely the chemistry between Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain is ten times better.  This is due mostly to Swain who basically portrays a part of herself.   Her teasing and her battles with Irons are priceless and extremely believable.   Also the Sue Lyon version showed Humbert going after an older teen not as repugnant as the Dominique Swain version showing Humbert going after an actual underaged teen.  Also in this version most of the movie is about Humbert and Lolita and their adventures misfortunes and run from the law.3. Humbert himself  For the first time we see the reason for his obsession and it isn't entirely pedophilia as in the case of Quilty. Irons is given many additional scenes to show the conflict between his better nature and his pedophile nature to show that he understands that what he is doing is not only wrong but will be his downfall.4. The ending  I prefer the way it ended so much more in this later version.  First Quilty finally for the first time comes out of the shadows and we see him for his repulsive self.  Sellers' portrayal was too offbeat to allow us to despise this guy as he should be despised.  Also the final fini is so downbeat so as to let you know in no uncertain terms that you have just witnessed a multiple tragedy.Adrian Lyne did an excellent job of directing and the music of Ennio Morricone was a great help to the also excellent cinematography.".

Frank Langella is a bit of a shock in Lyne's version not the good kind. And then Lolita herself Stanley Kubrick had Sue Lyon and although she was a bit older than Navokov's Lolita she is sensational.

	schema:reviewBody "This is not at all a bad movie and is surprisingly faithful to the book. At times I suspected some scenes had been inserted to appease a contemporary sensibility but on checking I found they were all in the book.I generally prefer this Lolita to Kubrick'e version but both versions raise an interesting question.It is a presumption of cinema that any novel can be satisfactorily filmed. Lolita casts doubt on this.The problems can be illustrated by a small but crucial change that both films make to the book. When Humbert first meets Lolita she is 12. In the movies she is 14 and is played by actresses who were 15 and 16 respectively.Objectively this change shouldn't matter under age is under age. In practice it does. When you see a 14 or 15 yearold you can see the woman she is about to become. When you see a 12 yearold you can only see the child. Raising Lolita's age makes Humbert seem less perverse than Nabokov intended and James Mason and Jeremy Irons both make him too sympathetic.All Nabokov needed to write Lolita was a typewriter and some paper. To film it Kubrick and Lyne needed a young actress. Jodie Foster Nathalie Portman and Lindsay Lohan all show that it would have been possible to find a 12 yearold actress good enough to carry the movie  but should she be asked to? If it was absolutely necessary to have a 12 yearold in order to make this movie then most people would say Don't make it then.But this is only part of a wider issue.Nabokov wanted to put readers inside the head of a paedophile without them endorsing his actions empathy doesn't necessarily imply sympathy. His first attempt was The Enchanter which gave us the word nymphet. It was written in the third person. Nabokov was unhappy with it and it was only published after his death.Lolita was written in the first person and that changed everything.The book is Humbert's own testimony. He wants to present himself as a sensitive aesthete a romantic lost soul surrounded by dull uncomprehending Philistines. He charts his seedy obsession in elaborate overripe 'poetic' prose trying to draw the reader into his selfdelusion but we soon come to doubt the truth of what he is telling us. He can't help letting us see through his selfserving narrative to glimpse the murky reality that lurks beneath. Lolita is in real distress and is being profoundly corrupted by this unhealthy relationship.Humbert's nymphet fantasy soon starts to crumble before the reality of a troubled wilful increasingly manipulative child. Then he finds himself haunted by the ominous shadow of Clare Quilty who we come to realise is his dark alter ego Humbert's doubled name is a fairly obvious clue to Nabokov's intentions. Humbert is the doomed romantic he wants to be seen as Quilty is the evil sexual predator he really is. Inevitably it is Quilty that wins the battle for Lolita.Eventually Humbert emerges from his pubescent fixation and has a relationship with an adult woman so when he finally meets Lolita again he is able to see and love her as a real person. But it is too late. At this point there is nothing left for him to do but finally kill off his evil doppelganger and then die himself.The point of Lolita therefore is not just in the the events it depicts but in the particular way it depicts them. It is not only a story it is a specific literary device. I think this presents an insoluble problem for a filmmaker.I doubt if there is a cinematic equivalent to Nabokov's mendacious first person narrative. Cinema only really works in the third person and is a very literal medium 'the camera doesn't lie'. When Hitchcock used a misleading flashback in Stage Fright people were outraged and even film critics who should have known better complained about the deception.Kubbrick and Lyne can both show us that the real Lolita is a far cry from Humbert's idealised nymphet but we are always seeing the disturbing reality itself rather than that reality filtered through the haze of Humbert's prevarications.Kubrick tried to defuse the problem by playing up the humour. The first hour in which Shelley Winters's Charlotte vamps the stiff repressed Humbert to his considerable discomfort mines the humour of embarrassment. Then Kubrick lets Peter Sellers loose to do a series of virtuoso comic turns. They are great but overload the picture. Kubrick's Humbert is constantly being harried and badgered and in the end is less a sexual predator than a hapless victim. I don't think the movie works and Kubrick seemed to agree. He often talked about remaking it.Adrian Lyne uses the voiceover to give us more of Humbert's oily verbosity and he can be much more frank about the true nature of this deplorable relationship. But again we are spectators of events as they actually occur rather than as Humbert wants us to see them and the greater frankness only compounds the problems. Although his version is better in many respects than Kubrick's it is even more uncomfortable to watch.Because of the nature of the medium in which they were working Kubrick and Lyne both ended up making The Enchanter not Lolita.I am not suggesting that it was wrong to make these movies. Filmmakers should be free to tackle any subject that intrigues them  and it is not a crime to fail. It is just that the problems inherent in some books are so great it is unlikely there will be any solutions to them. Perhaps there are some challenges that filmmakers should just decline.I suspect Lolita is one of them.".

A selfobsessed flamboyant character with a taste for doing dirty deeds to reach his goals. Humbert in the book doesn't love Lolita. Not her character anyway. He is a man sexually obsessed with her looks and her age not her personality which he complaints time after time in the book. The Humbert character in the book was a lot closer to Clare Quilty then the 1997 movie makes it seem.This film makes Jeremy Irons's Humbert a tragic traumatized drama character full of guilt and despair. A tragic romantic lonesome man with a broken heart and basically a good person besides one little flaw.Then Lolita in the book. Lolita in the books 12 and basically not much different from your average girl in the early days of puberty. Experimenting with the power of sexuality? Yes. Slutty? No. Lolita in the book is just a girl who got into this situation by accident and tries all that she can for her young age to stay alive.The Lolita in the book is not the sexualized naughty teenager we see in the media. That was the result of various forms of media exploitation.The Lolita in the book didn't have any blond or red braids or pigtails and didn't wear sailor or any other stereotype outfits.The Lolita in the book was girl with dark brown bobbed hair and a honey tanned skin with a polkadot bikini. However the 1997 film portrayed Lolita the way she's been portrayed as a stereotype teenage hussy in the sex industry as well as the regular media. With her reddish blond braids and pigtails stereotypical childgirl outfits and average ordinary sleazy teenage character the Lolita played by Dominique Swain is NOTHING like the character in the book. Neither by look or by character. Then Clare Quilty in the book was described as a charismatic artist. Ultimately a dangerous wealthy pervert but he was never described as a dirty old man. Clare Quilty in the book was a Humbert with a bigger house and more money.Clare Quilty in this movie is portrayed as the audience of today expects it. The Marc Dutroux type of sick dirty piglike maniac.I thought this movie was good at the point when i hadn't read the book but after i read the book i thought is was a failure.I dislike it because when it came out the production team and every newspaper and article claimed that this movie was made absolutely faithful to the book. When i read the book i found out that is was all but faithful to Vladimir Nabokov's book.Kubrick's film may have been a bit shy and tame but it was closer to the heart and soul of Nabokov's novel. It didn't hide important key elements of Humbert's twisted personality.Before you watch this movie read the book. After you've seen this movie read the book again.".

After seeing this remade version I came away satisfied.  Hearing what countless critics had to say has never changed my view.  Of course it can never come even close to the novel but watching Lyne's version unfold in quiet and somber light brought to mind the exact same feelings I was experiencing reading the book. Certain things did bother me.  Lolita's mother in particular.  Hearing Melanie Griffith deliver lines as if she were reading to a group of school children set my teeth on edge although she went down in fine style.  And having the sole reason for Humbert's obsession with nymphets wrapped up in one neat reasonAnnabel was also hard to swallow. But Dominique Swain was nearly the perfect picture of the Lolita in my mind. Wistful vulnerable and a fierce manipulator all at once it's hard to believe she'd never had acting experience beforehand.  Perhaps a bit too old in certain lights she still managed to carry off a difficult role and steal every scene she was in much like Natalie Portman in Beautiful Girls. Certain expressions were incredibly poignant. Think of Lo's face when Humbert denied permission to be in the play.  Think of her lipstick smeared smile after being caught going out when Humbert went to the market. The essence of this movie is what formed my opinion that this was a good film.  The pacing the comparison to Kubrick didn't matter when the mood of the entire film was left. Maybe the critics are right and I'm missing something.

	schema:headline " Magnetic Irons";
	schema:reviewBody "With nostalgia we look back on the films of yesterday and proclaim them far superior than what is advertised on the marquis today.  Bombarded by gratuitous sex reckless violence and distracting special effects critics often dismiss today's features by simply saying They're too Hollywood.' To some extent this is true but we must not reject all current day films.  In fact 1997's Lolita is an example of a current day film that is superior to the original motion picture release of Vladmir Nabokov's controversial novel.  One could even argue that the modern version is less Hollywood since every American distributor refused to show the film. Regardless 1997 version's supremacy is due in part to the depth at which Jeremy Irons is able to take our darling pedophiliac Humbert Humbert. Irons' portrayal is magnetic due to his depth of character which is seen both in his sincerity to real life and his truth to Nabokov's writing.A flashback in the beginning of the 1997 movie portrays a fourteenyearold Humbert's doomed summer romance to Annabel which sets up Irons' Humbert as a brokenhearted romantic.  Thus when he sees Lolita for the first time lying out in the grass of the piazza' innocently letting the water from the sprinkler drench her the reincarnation of that love is clear. That clarity however transcends the simple addition of the flashback.  Unlike James Mason the 1962 Humbert Humbert Irons' startling licentious stare at Lolita is that much comprehensive.  In those eyes the viewer sees tenderness with wickedness occupation without realization a moment of pure lust.  The amorous connection is developed in that one lookwhereas Mason's look at his Lolita is obvious and plainLolita is a beautiful girl the look shows a man seeing something beautiful.  Irons not only sees beauty but he perversely sees a sexual creature correctly identifying the perplexing issue for the reader and viewer of Lolita While his love is based on pedophilia is there something in his love for Lolita that is common to all love?  His intoxication is precisely what makes the story of Lolita so fascinatingHumbert's love for Lolita is as real as anyone's love for another and the perverse thing is that he truly madly deeply loves a child.  Mason fails to show the depth of love that Irons easily does in the first meeting.From the first meeting on Irons is true to the version of Humbert Lynne and Schiff prescribe.  Unlike the 1962 version we see those rare moments of ease with Lolita delighting her with stories as they swing on the porch the rapt nearly bashful smile he gives her while she sits in his lap showing him how she can make her chin wiggle. Irons's Humbert is heartbreaking.  He is tortured.  He is helpless.  Despite those scenes when Humbert is buying affections from Lolita with a jar full of coins despite his heavy authority over her activities Irons never let's the viewer lose sight of his complete and utter dependence on Lolita.  Although Lynne and Schiff's version seems void of the cunning that is so very much a part of the literary Humbert the essential question is the same Who was in control of the situation?

	onyx:emotionText "With nostalgia we look back on the films of yesterday and proclaim them far superior than what is advertised on the marquis today.  Bombarded by gratuitous sex reckless violence and distracting special effects critics often dismiss today's features by simply saying They're too Hollywood.' To some extent this is true but we must not reject all current day films.  In fact 1997's Lolita is an example of a current day film that is superior to the original motion picture release of Vladmir Nabokov's controversial novel.  One could even argue that the modern version is less Hollywood since every American distributor refused to show the film. Regardless 1997 version's supremacy is due in part to the depth at which Jeremy Irons is able to take our darling pedophiliac Humbert Humbert. Irons' portrayal is magnetic due to his depth of character which is seen both in his sincerity to real life and his truth to Nabokov's writing.A flashback in the beginning of the 1997 movie portrays a fourteenyearold Humbert's doomed summer romance to Annabel which sets up Irons' Humbert as a brokenhearted romantic.  Thus when he sees Lolita for the first time lying out in the grass of the piazza' innocently letting the water from the sprinkler drench her the reincarnation of that love is clear. That clarity however transcends the simple addition of the flashback.  Unlike James Mason the 1962 Humbert Humbert Irons' startling licentious stare at Lolita is that much comprehensive.  In those eyes the viewer sees tenderness with wickedness occupation without realization a moment of pure lust.  The amorous connection is developed in that one lookwhereas Mason's look at his Lolita is obvious and plainLolita is a beautiful girl the look shows a man seeing something beautiful.  Irons not only sees beauty but he perversely sees a sexual creature correctly identifying the perplexing issue for the reader and viewer of Lolita While his love is based on pedophilia is there something in his love for Lolita that is common to all love?  His intoxication is precisely what makes the story of Lolita so fascinatingHumbert's love for Lolita is as real as anyone's love for another and the perverse thing is that he truly madly deeply loves a child.  Mason fails to show the depth of love that Irons easily does in the first meeting.From the first meeting on Irons is true to the version of Humbert Lynne and Schiff prescribe.  Unlike the 1962 version we see those rare moments of ease with Lolita delighting her with stories as they swing on the porch the rapt nearly bashful smile he gives her while she sits in his lap showing him how she can make her chin wiggle. Irons's Humbert is heartbreaking.  He is tortured.  He is helpless.  Despite those scenes when Humbert is buying affections from Lolita with a jar full of coins despite his heavy authority over her activities Irons never let's the viewer lose sight of his complete and utter dependence on Lolita.  Although Lynne and Schiff's version seems void of the cunning that is so very much a part of the literary Humbert the essential question is the same Who was in control of the situation?  Lolita or Humbert?  Who is more to blame for the affair? Through possibility of empathizing with Humbert's love for Lolita the viewer is left with an unnerving understanding of his pedophilia.  Unlike Mason Irons makes it almost impossible to completely detach our knowledge of what love is from the perverse love between Humbert and Lolita.Being true to a character as in being true to a book means that an actor catches the essence from the book not necessarily the exact phrasing or the exact chronology of events.

	schema:reviewBody "Jeremy Irons plays Humbert Humbert 40ish professor who falls in love disastrously with a 12year old nymphet. This movie is a closer adaptation of Nabokov's book than the Kubrick version. One flaw of the Kubrick film was that it begins with the end and gives away crucial plot points and takes away suspense. In the Lyne version the scene at the beginning takes place again near the end but this time it reveals nothing. Dominique Swain is excellent as the title character. She looks and acts the part of the nymphet that Sue Lyons could have never have pulled off. Some have suggested that Miss Swain was too old to play a 12 year old child but Dolores Haze is not 12 for the whole book. A good portion of the novel takes place after she is 12. When they are on the road she is 13. When she is in the all girl's school she is 14. She is 17 at the end. The movie is not without flaws however. Some scenes of humor with Irons falls flat. I found Melanie Griffith to be very annoying but then again Lolita's mother was suppose to be. Thankfully she's only on screen for a short time.Lolita is shown eating bananas in the movie. Besides the phallic references the bananas were used because the inspiration for Lolita came when Nabokov read a newspaper article about the first monkey to paint a picture or so he claims. The scientist gave him the tools to draw and the first thing he drew was the bars of his cage.I can't say that this version of Lolita is better than the Kubrick version they each contain what the other misses. Kubrick's version contains the humor that Lyne's version is lacking while Lyne's version contains the sadness that Kubrick missed. Including reading Lolita I would recommend that the viewer get both films. For Lolita is both a satire and a sad story rolled into one. The two films in a way compliment each other.".

A desperate pedophile Humbert somehow makes his wildest sexual fantasy actually come true or at least that is what he longs to believe but at the tragic cost of the lives he destroys including his own.Humbert explains why he is attracted to 14 year old Lolita. By his own account he became fixated on girls the same age as his childhood sweetheart Annabel who he lost forever during his own youth. It is still a mystery however why a man of Humbert's maturity indulged an adolescent sexual fantasy for as long as he did. A man his age could no more have a love affair with a 14 year old girl than could he resurrect his long lost lover from the dead. Nor could he go back to being a 14 year old boy himself.In a transparent attempt to approach the object of his desire Humbert marries Lolita's mother Charlotte even though he does not truly love her. Charlotte's accidental death gives Humbert what he had been secretly hoping for complete custody of Lolita. But how could he be happy knowing that it was his rejection of Charlotte that practically drove her to suicide especially since his flagrant negligence also hurt Lolita? This shocking realization should have interrupted Humbert's erotic dream and marked the point in the story where a responsible man assumes his natural role as a father. However when Lolita approached him inexplicably he could not control his pedophile nature.Humbert refused to abandon his love fantasy until the day when Lolita was practically torn away from him and he finally realized that he couldn't have her. But by that time the damage he had caused her was already irreparable. He destroyed Lolita's happy childhood in much the same way his own had been destroyed by the death of Annabel and he could never forgive himself for his 'sin'. Murdering Quilty an even more perverse pedophile than himself was as close as he could come to suicide. In the end he died in prison of a broken heart leaving us to ponder whether there was ever any need for such a tragedy or is it simply true that none of us can ever find bliss except for a fleeting moment.".

While the visuals and acting is subtle the story here lacked that and in turn lacks the layers of Kubrick's adaptation and Nabokov's novel.Yet even though not as strong as its predecessors Lyne's film is an interesting adaptation. It is quite a wellmade film. The photogenic visuals are wonderfully detailed. The art direction is stunning and the soundtrack and cinematography are brilliant. Jeremy Irons Melanie Griffith Dominique Swain and Frank Langella deliver excellent performances.Evidently Adrian Lyne has an eye for detail as has been proved in his other works and thus 'Lolita' is visually captivating. Even though it doesn't live up to the book and the first cinematic adaptation it's still an interesting viewing. I'll recommend it to those who have already read the book and seen Kubrick's version.".

This weird and erotic German movie about a triangle of love has good performances and direction but the story does not work very well. Sexy Lover' has the same premise a woman dating more than one man having troubles to decide who would be the man of her life' and is an excellent black humor movie. The genre of Stille Nacht' is not well defined and in the end it is lost among erotic romance drama and comedy. Having a better screenplay it could have been a great movie.

The lunacy and nonsequiturs build up very effectively in the middle of the film perhaps the tone might have been made a little more dark or perhaps less light presumably with different less jaunty music.Maybe it tails off slightly but the ending somehow seems to me a gem. The absurdism isn't compromised by a happy ending it is strengthened by a subtle fitting conclusion.I wouldn't say this was a perfect film but it is damn enjoyable far from the mainstream and never bland. The sets by the way for Copping's house are fab just thought I had to add that!Rating  12".

His childhood is not well enough explored and instead we are treated to fancy sets and fantasy sequences that aren't set in any context. Byrnes is good as the harassed wife but Hugo Weaving is lost with a stretched role where he has to jump from gentle husband to being on the same level as Collins.Overall the first half is quite interesting  you don't totally know what's going on in every situation.

It was the ending that made me want to find out more about this movie..Hugo Weaving is amazing too.. Some things to look forward to are... interesting sets like Roland's home a good story good acting and a completely bizarre ending.This movie is not for children. Watch it if you are bored of traditional movies.It's in the league of The Cell or The Fall.It's indeed a very unique and strange movie but remember don't watch this when high...";

Of course even now he is pretty amazingbut he IS around 50 now. The Jackie Chan of Police Story would have REALLY amazed the world.Police Story may not be his best movie but it is possibly the one to watch to get an overview of his abilities and filmmaking style one must not forget he directed many of his Hong Kong films.It is a somewhat uneven but often exhilarating film which mixes cop dramaslapstick comedy and amazing action. The film features opening and ending action sequences which are amongst the best done EVER. The opening has a shootout in a shanty townvirtual destruction of the town by cars and Jackie hanging on to a bus with a walking stick. The climax features an incredible fight scene in a shopping mall which is a fantastic combination of martial artsbrawling and sheer destructionand the final stuntWOW!In between the film concentrates more on comedysome of which slows the pace a little but is simply delightful to watchsuch as a scene where Jackie has to answer lots of telephones at the same time cut from the slightly poor dubbed version which also has a far inferior scorea very funny courtroom scene and even the old pieintheface routine! Some of the humour may annoy those wanting more action but it is as essential to an understanding of Jackie's art as his martial arts and stuntsand here he perhaps perfects his favoured 'everyman' heroa normal guy who may have amazing martial arts skill but still has relationship problems and is as likely to lose a fight as to win it. Sadly female stars Maggie Chung and Brigite Lin simply exist to be knocked about!By no means a perfect filmand possibly Project ADrunken Master 2 or Dragon's Forever might be better films but if you want a sampling of Jackie doing everything he does bestthan this is the film to see .It spawned 3 sequelsall of which add to and build on the first one.".

However Koo's men try to get to them before the trial  the least of Jackie's problems as his girlfriend May storms out when she sees him with Selina.  When Koo is acquitted he frames Jackie for the murder of a cop forcing Jackie on the run to clear his name and get Koo.The first film in the successful Police Story series is a fair example of a Jackie Chan film for those who have never seen one  reasonable plot great action average acting potentially bad dubbing and the comic scenes. However it is not as good as some of the sequels and just generally some of Chan's other films.  Police Story opens with a great shoot out that culminates in a car chase through a shanty town and a fantastic series of stunts on a bus.  From this point on it then focuses on the plot and quiet a few moments of comedy.  This works reasonable well but it feels like the comedy and action have been divided up into separate sections.  This takes away from the film a little bit.The plot is pretty solid for a Jackie Chan film by recent standards this is a masterpiece of writing! although some of the dialogue doesn't quite fit. The moment where Jackie is forced on the run by the police is a bit hammy and the you don't see us as people' rant just doesn't seem like Jackie. Of course part of the problem with this is the dubbing in the version I watched  I just don't understand viewers who would sooner see a really bad dubbing job than watch a subtitled version!  The cheesy American voices here do detract from the performances and I found it difficult to judge some of Chan's comedy lines when they were being delivered by another person in a very flat way.  However he still has presence and his physical work is great.  Special mention to the stunt men here also there are a lot of great falls including a dive from a bus top that must have hurt  I don't care who you are! Tung's Uncle Bill has fewer funny lines than I'm used to but he is still funny.  The female cast are pretty wasted with both Lin and Cheung on screaming duty for the majority of the film and most grating it is too!.The film ends on a rather strange shot but set up an angry cop that Chan never really convinced me as  a personae that just seemed to be dropped in the later films in the series but the overall film is still very enjoyable. The plot is good even if the acting isn't and the action involves plenty of amazing routines and stunts  it's just a shame that the action and comedy were very fragmented it disjointed the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s and the one that put him on the map. The scale of this selfdirected police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished. There are clearly differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals. In fact the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English while the original has this scene in Cantonese!Nonetheless Chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible so nonCantonese audiences don't miss much. It's not after all the dialogue that makes a Chan flick but the action and the painful outtakes. The story is easy to follow Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather Cho Yeun and assigned to protect a star witness Brigitte Lin. The action is superb from beginning to end and there's not much time to breathe in between. It'll never get you thinking but what an entertaining and well strungtogether film. Arguably this is one of the best martial arts films out there.".

If Enter The Dragon bared the socalled bench mark of Lee's greatness in the 70s then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s.Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy or any of his US efforts the one film that really typifies Chan's excellence not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking bonecrushing kung fu talisman as well as his movie career was this Police Story the first in a series of successful cop films set in mainland present day Hong Kong.I've seen many of his efforts likewise the USbased Rush Hour Rumble in the Bronx The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to Police Story. In those movies we saw a less 'dumbed down' version of Jackie of whom didn't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as Drunken Master Police Story to name. The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie. The shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed the flying shards of glass Chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town and Chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with. Considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm's way Jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially as he has the bruises to show for it. Thus he has proved that he is no onetrick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves.Storywise there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative it makes up with its endto end action and fight sequences. As for the dialogue well it's not a really huge aspect of the film which is why most fans of Jackie's and martial arts films are more interested in action as opposed to the story.Unlike say The Matrix there are no wires or CGI or any form of computer trickery involved. What you see is what you get and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic full of action and pulsating stunts.It is miles better than Rumble In The Bronx Rush Hour and all his other American efforts.Police Story is an excellent film and one I'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice Jackie Chan fan but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first.".

This stirring and exciting story about the cop named Chan Ka Kui of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan . Ka Kui Jackie Chan is a HongKong cop who pursues and arrests a druglord but he accuses Chan with the killing of another police . Chan as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals has to clear his name whilst keeping himself from getting murdered or detained  and keeping his sweetheart Maggie Chung  famous star of Asian cinema from leaving him . Chan attempts to protect a witness  the mobster's secretary Brigitte Lin who helps him to track down the gang of drug lord. Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game.This thrilling movie is crammed of brawls with punch  bounds and leaps  actionpacked breathtaking stuntwork and lots of humor with tongue in cheek. Jackie Chan is top notch as intrepid cop who scores his first big hit by virtually singlehandedly capturing and imprisoning a big druglord and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fakeshots. Awesomeincredible stunts and brief comic touches as usual  the picture is better constructed than the followings . The lightingpaced storyline slows down at times but frenetic action sequences make up for it. Spotlights movie include Jackie jumping over a bus  furthermore moving fights and brawls at a mall  among others. This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences  furthermore contains sense of humor such as subsequent entries. Lousy musical score mostly composed by synthesizer and in the American score is created by J. Peter Robinson . Lavishly produced by Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest Production and professionally directed by Chan.

	schema:reviewBody "Out of the 10 plus films Jackie Chan has directed this is his most personal. I can see why its a personal favorite of his because of the energy and sweat that was put into making the movie.  The ingredients for success are here with the actordirector's trademark of slam bang action sequences with a touch of the absurd.  Jackie Chan as director creates many show stopping moments for this well made feature.The opening sequence begins with a nicely ser up action moment that pays off with a fantasitc car chase.  My favorite opening scene in all of Jackie Chan's films because of its usage of excellent action imagery.  Ging Chaat Goo SiPolice Story1985 does lose some steam after the scene ends but only for a short while.  This sequence represents some of the best work in Jackie Chan's output from the 1980s.The car chase which concludes the opening scene of Police Story1985 is the big moment of the sequence.  Its a amazing moment especially when Kevin Chan drives his car down in and out some Shantytown buildings to catch some drug dealers.  This aspect of the car chase makes it stand out from car chases in American films of that period.  The originalty of the car chase in Police Story1985 is what makes the moment fun to watch.Ging Chaat Goo SiPolice Story1985 is one of five Hong Kong action pictures that would influence numerous American action pics of the late 1980searly 1990s.  The one actor whose films have been influenced the most by Police Story is Sylvester Stallone.  Especially true in films like Tango  Cash1988 and Demolition Man1993.  Many American action pics have been influenced by this picture and some never reaches the excellence of its action sequences.What makes Police Story work is the approach to make the character of Kevin Chan Ka Kui into an everyman figure who fights against opponents with strength and will power.  Because of this approach the movie becomes much more entertaining.  The everyman character that Jackie Chan plays is a part of what makes his films popular with audiences in manny parts of the world. He rarely plays a character who is super tough and is not an everyman.The stunt work in the action scenes are amazing because of the danger element.  Jackie Chan performs such dangerous stunts in Police Story1985 that it's a testament to his strong conditioning and bravery.  Because of his fearless attidude Jackie Chan always recovers from injury to do more dangerous stunt work.  Very few would do what Jackie does and this is what makes him beloved in the eyes of his fans. Police Story1985 finishes in style with the action sequence that tops the one at the beginning.  The physical work done in this one scene is reward with top notch execution of the action.  The closing sequence uses visual gags to strengthen its status as a classic sequence.  Many have imitated this one scene but few never bother to make any imitated scene into a great scene.Maggie Cheung plays a lousy role as the helpless girlfriend of Kevin Chan May.  One of her first major film roles before she became known as a serious dramatic actress.  During this period in her career Maggie Cheung never did any action moves or attempted to do so.  This would change when Maggie Cheung took on the role of Thief Catcher in The Heroic Trio1993.Police Story1985 and Police Story 3Supercop1992 are the best in the Polce Story series.  Both contain strong female characters in the presence of Brigitte Lin and Michelle Yeoh.  The two films have dazzling action scenes with creative thought put behind them.  Police Story1985 and Police Story 31992 have high octane finalles that never bore or disappoint.Ging Chaat Goo SiPolice Story1985 was Jackie Chan's response to the disappointing results of his second American film The Protector1985. Has many of the Chan highlights The Protector lacked.  Jackie Chan as actor and director wanted to do things with Police Story1985 he wasn't able to achieve in The Protector1985.  Police Story1985 benefits from losing the Dirty Harry style of The Protector1985.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not only Jackie Chan's best film but one of the best pieces of action cinema ever and one of my personal favourite films from since I was a child.The action is phenomenal. It's creative fun dramatic extravagant exciting brutal and meaty. The action scenes in this ranging from the serious to nonserious are all you could ever ask for in an action movie.The cinematography is great with the angles and framing optimized for the best view and proper flow for action sequences. The editing is great as well especially for showing connection with hits something most action films neglect. By this I mean sometimes when someone throws a punch just as the punch is about to connect the camera will cut to a closeup angle of the punch connecting full force than cut back to a wide to show the aftermath of the hit. It is superb action editing.The sound effects are the iconic punch and miss sound effects of the good ol' kung fu films. For me this film has one of the most iconic theme songs of all time performed by Jackie Chan and I often catch myself humming it.The story is straightforward and engaging. Characters are unique and memorable. There are iconic moments that unfold and little re occurrences that happen with characters that further the engagement.The stunt work by Jackie's team is fantastic as always with one of the biggest stunts ever done in the history of cinema in this film. It was so good they showed it 3 times something they usually do for a huge neardeath experience stunt by Chan.Overall this movie is perfect fun. An absolute blast with great characters solid story superb practical action and stunts that put modern action films and CGI to shame a catchy theme song and an awesome ending. 1010 a masterpiece.".

I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through. In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me. Having said that though this is still up there with Jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle.As usual with Hong Kong films avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles.Great stunts OK movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 710".

Despite a chaotic script process cowriter Edward Tang  whose credits include some of Chan's biggest hits including PROJECT A and MR CANTON AND LADY ROSE  was notorious for his fastandloose writing methods POLICE STORY represents an effective marriage of narrative cohesion and stateoftheart stuntwork. Opening with a spectacular drugsbust during which an entire shanty town is demolished the movie follows Chan's attempts to rout the sneering villain played to the hilt by veteran writerdirector Chor whilst struggling to protect a vital prosecution witness Taiwanese beauty Brigitte Lin whose testimony can put Chor behind bars forever. Cue lots of action and comedy culminating in a shoppingmall showdown which ranks as one of the finest handtohand combat sequences in HK movie history.Chan and his stunt team choreographed here by Chow Yungin and debut action director Wong Kwan use their incredible gymnasticballetic prowess to stage a series of furiouslypaced fight scenes in which the gunplay of traditional Chinese crime thrillers is replaced by oldstyle martial arts in a contemporary setting. Similar skills are employed for a number of comic setpieces which dominate the film's less effective middle section particularly an extraordinary sequence in which Lin is 'terrorized' by a 'mad knifeman' played by longtime Chan associate Mars who is actually a fellow police officer hired by Chan to frighten the reluctant Lin into accepting his protection. Throughout the film is distinguished by worldclass cinematography by Cheung Yiujo and editing Peter Cheung the key technical components of virtually all HK action movies.Given the slew of crime dramas which have followed in its wake POLICE STORY may have lost some of its novelty value over the years but the film's influence on international cinema has been profound beginning with the notorious 'bus' scene in TANGO  CASH. On its own terms however the movie charts an overly predictable course and suffers from abrupt shifts in tone  from drama to comedy and romance and everything inbetween  before lurching into darker territory for its showstopping finale. Never much of an actor's director Chan simply encourages his talented cast including Lau Chiwing as a slimy defence lawyer and muchloved character actor Bill Tung a wellknown racing commentator in HK and stalwart of the first three Police Story movies to stand their ground amidst all the flashy pyrotechnics. But while the stuntwork delivers a genuinely visceral impact the film is undermined by onedimensional characters and a lack of emotional conviction. Nevertheless it won Best Film and Action Choreography trophies at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards and was nominated in five other major categories including cinematography and editing. Followed by POLICE STORY PART II 1988.Cantonese dialogue".

Jackie's performance is also very strong and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film's impact just a little his charisma carries it through. Furthermore in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger Jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed! By praising Police Story as a simple 'Good vs. Evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone and whilst it's hardly The Brothers Karamazov in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas.In short this remains a quality popcorn movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene  a potent boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period.".

By praising Police Story as a simple 'Good vs. Evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone and whilst it's hardly The Brothers Karamazov in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas.In short this remains a quality popcorn movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene  a potent boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period.";

I was not dissapointed. This movie is amazing. It is full of Jackie's trademark hyperkinetic action scenes that move at breakneck speed. It also has it's fair share of humour most of it from Jackie himself. I especially enjoyed the part where Jackie finds himself alone in a small country precinct answering about 5 or 6 phone calls at once! Very funny. The highlight of the film is the climax which takes place in a huge shopping centre with Jackie facing off against a legion of bad guys. This part of the movie alone must set some sort of record for the most glass broken in a movie ever. I mean people get thrown through glass onto glass and into glass! The outakes are particularly painful as we get to see Jackie prepare for and perform some of the more brutal stunts in the film. If you can get this film make sure it's the subtitled version. It makes for the best experience of the film. A very enthusiastic 5 thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tropical Malady the fourth feature by Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul is a film of astonishing lyric power that explores in myth and reality the nature of love. The film is divided into a conventional story of friendship between two men and a mythopoetic tale that takes the viewer into the middle of a dense Thai jungle. It is a strange and haunting tone poem that is as multilayered as the forest in which it is filmed and may require repeated viewing to fully unravel. The opening story is about the tentative playful relationship between Dong Sakda Kaewbuadee a shy young farmer who lives with his parents in the Thai countryside and Keng Banlop Lomnoi a soldier on furlough from the Thai army. The relationship has homoerotic undertones but they are suggested rather than openly acknowledged.Tong is unsophisticated and appears uneasy in the relationship but never loses control giving their friendship a charm and sweetness rarely depicted on screen especially between members of the same sex. They go to a movie participate in an exercise class take a sick dog to a clinic and visit an underground temple. Their relationship develops in simple gestures of affection. Keng gives Tong a Clash tape but later tells him that when he gave him the tape he forgot to give him his heart. He places his hand on Tong's knee but the boy turns it into a mischievous game of squishing his hand with his other leg rather than acknowledging its sensual implications. Keng asks Tong if he can lay in his lap and Tong says no then a minute later he changes that to no problem. A scene in which Keng mouths Tong's hand after he had urinated and Tong returns the favor with equal passion advances the sexual nature of their relationship but it is not consummated.As Keng leaves for the country to resume his duties the screen goes blank and we are transported into a land of myth and time in which a folk tale is being narrated in a jungle setting. Called A Spirit's Path the mood suddenly changes to dark and foreboding. A narrator tells us that a shaman has transformed himself into a tiger and is terrorizing the countryside that Keng is under orders to protect. The soldier's mission is to subdue the tiger Tong and release the spirit of a white cow. The lovers are now the hunter and the hunted. Running through the jungle with tattoos all over his body Tong is a naked man who can shapeshift into an animal at will. As Keng hunts his elusive prey he begins to lose his grounding in the normal constructs of reality and the framing of the jungle scenes create an atmosphere of brooding surreal intensity.Stripped of the pretense we call civilization on the border between two worlds Keng's life unfolds in a desperate vision suggesting that we are the both the dreamer and that which is being dreamt. He talks to animals sees ghosts and receives advice from a baboon who tells him The tiger trails you like a shadow. He is lonesome. Kill him to free him from his world or let him devour you to enter his world. As the tiger perches on the branch of a tree staring at him Keng knows that in order to save his life he must be willing to sacrifice it. I give you my spirit my flesh and my memories he tells the tiger and Every drop of my blood sings our song A song of happiness. There do you hear it? Beyond the shadow of illusion Tropical Malady forces us to see in the dark. What begins with a wan smile ends in a fever of ecstasy.".

Keng makes constant sexual and amorous advances on Tong who laughs them off or makes a game out of them. He is never exactly interested but never fully rebuffs either. The two make trips back and forth from the Jungle where Tong lives and Keng is on patrol with his military unit to the city. We see the lush silent landscapes and the bustling city life from dance hall karaoke to the cinema to the solitude of a quiet lake. When Keng finally makes a move in such a way as to be beyond any doubt of a desire for intimacy he kisses Tong's hands Tong responds in turn by doing the same and then walks into the darkness of the forest. Before Keng can come to understand the film takes a drastic turn in tone style and mood.We are told by an interjected 3d person narrator the story of a shaman who is a shapeshifter known to take different animal forms who used to roam the forest playing tricks on people. One day a cunning hunter did not fall into a trick and shot him mid transformation from woman into tiger. The spirit of the shaman was then stuck as half tiger half man and eternally doomed to stalk the forest tricking and devouring all in it's path.Keng is then on patrol in his section of the forest exploring rumors from villagers about some thing killing cattle and causing general havoc. Alone on patrol in the woods he becomes plagued by strange sounds a sense of dread and images of a naked boy a tiger spectral animals and a glowing phosphorescent tree which looks as beautiful as those in Aranofsky's The Fountain...I have no idea how they got that effect on their budget but it's miraculous....This second half of the film of course calls into question our understanding of Keng and Tong's prior relationship if Tong ever existed at all.. While part one is reminiscent of a modern quirky love story like Chungking Express the second half is like Terrance Mallick shooting a remake of Predator. All sense of time and space is swallowed by the jungle and implicit politics of the first half are turned inside out in the second half it is literally cat and mouse with the possibility that the cat may want to be eaten by the mouse or vice versa.The second half is also marked by the inclusion of tribal art and cave paintings depicting the story of the shaman and the soldier with subtitles accompanying them. To paraphrase a description by director Weerasethakul it's like a silent film for the first people on earth. And together with the visual effects confident cinematography clever use of editing music and sound and disarming performances it becomes magical. Tropical Malady combines the most modern and ancient notions of fear and desire and makes something new out of them.This is Thailand's Solaris a story of the changing shapes and forms of want and need of being deceived and allowing yourself to be deceived by them. It's slow pace forces reflection on questions like what form or body comprises love is it purely physical or something more is it perhaps deception itself a fools errand we invent to forget the savagery of the jungle around us is it the need to devour or be devoured? There's a Scottish legend called Tam Lin one of my favorites long story short a woman falls in love with a faerie and discovers he used to be a man but made a deal with the faeries to serve them if they spared his life after an accident. Tam tells the women she can restore his humanity and claim him if when the faeries pass on Halloween night she will wrap her arms around him and not let go no matter what happens. She does this and the faeries transform him into all manner of creature some hot some cold some thorny others slimy some which bite and claw etc but she holds on throughout all his changes til eventually she finds herself just cradling a man. And the faeries begrudgingly let her keep him because she held on to what she loved despite the way it changed with time.The film opens with these lines All of us are by nature wild beasts our duty as human beings is to become like trainers who keep their animals in check. And even teach them to perform tasks alien to their bestialityTom Nakajima Tropical Malady is a good deal more ambiguous I suspect more predatory and reflective as well than Tam Lin and comes from the opposite side of the world but like that story manages to peculiarly harmonize emotional sensitivity and mythic scope into a coherent whole.I wished I would have paid more attention to Weerasethakul Mysterious Object At Noon the first time I had the chance he has a talent for experimenting with narrative and style that is missing in many films endlessly praised these days. The phrase I kept hearing from other reviews or the one I liked the best was If Brokeback Mountain was a mountain on the island from Lost...it's callous with a smidgen of truth but this is a much better movie than that. It is very slow moving though the first hour will give you no hint of the second half other than a few visual ones look at the various statues in the backgrounds etc but for the bold and the patient there is lush hypnotic reward to be had.".

It is utopian but it is also sad because we realize that there is never and never will be a utopia. People say love is utopian yet according to Mr. Weerasethakul it is also very consuming which becomes possessive and at the end a burden. At the end the soldier goes into the jungle to find what's been consuming him. The tiger. He is lost and completely hopeless he has no purpose without the tiger yet he cannot possibly live with the tiger because of its nature. They are codependent coexist. Is that what great love is all about?".

Words are replaced by jungle noises sounds become messengers of peace or impending danger  the soldier Banlop Lomnoi who's beyond awesome has to choose whether to give in to desire or tame it kill the tiger or let it kill him. The visual impact of this part is astonishing  the tiger appearing for the first time the branches shaken by the wind a tree lit up by fireflies the beauty of the imagery is almost epic.Seriously the movie deserves to be watched because putting this into words is almost like betraying its spirit.

	schema:reviewBody "Greed is our downfall. I was watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire. The woman won a lot of money but wouldn't stop playing. She lost and only got 30.000 Baht.The tiger trails you like a shadow. His spirit is starving and lonesome. I see you are his prey and his companion.The experimental creator of Mysterious Object at Noon is back with another abstract gem Tropical Malady. This time we have a 2parter connected by common themes and metaphors a la Wong Kar Wai's Chungking Express equally casual but much slowly paced here. The first part of the film is set in everyday world. A gay soldier pursues a young country boy. The boy is most likely not gay but he returns the attraction most of the time probably because he is attracted to the soldier on another level e.g. he is fascinated by the soldier's uniform. One day while the soldier is flipping through the boy's photo album suddenly the movie blacks out  enter part 2 a story inspired by legends that parallels part 1 but from an alternative angle that makes it challenging to detect the patterns. Set in the dark tropical forest the soldier relentlessly hunts a tiger ghost spirit for love fear or both foreshadowed by a shooting computer game played by the boy who later appears as the tiger spirit. The tiger is fascinated by the soldier's sound device. The soldier is warned that he must either kill the tiger or be devoured by it.Part 1 and part 2 are both about desire and pursuit and essentially follow the same path. In both the soldier makes great effort to pursue his passion but it leads him nowhere. He is incompatible with the partner of his desire so it cannot be satisfied in the case of a straight boy or a tiger. The soldier can be classified as greedy and it will be his downfall. The 'fairytaleesque' romance in part 1 seems almost Utopian but it's an illusion that cannot be sustained. In the end he will be consumed by his desires.This is a powerful and challenging film with 2 segments each providing a distinctive context to view the same patterns. With only 2 or 3 lines of dialogue in the second part of more than 65 minutes it's a highly sensual and contemplative experience where every drop of water wind gently brushing the leaves and sound of birds singing contributes to your senses. You can literally smell the mud in the fresh rainforest.The photography is undeniably beautiful. The last shot of the film is sheer poetry that will take your breath away.".

There were some really lovely elements I agree but there is something about the editing that was just this side of over indulgent and I happen to generally like long loving camera shots that are meditative!. The jungle portion of the film IMHO suffered from a lack of visual information in most instances and yet this is one of the strengths of some the individual jungle scenes like those of the tree the tiger and ghost ox where just because of this unrelenting sameness stand out marvelously. It could have been half the length and by virtue of that twice as effective.

	schema:headline " challenging and fascinating film";
	schema:reviewBody "Tropical Malady is a lush beautifully directed love story from Thailand that uses magic realism to spin a tale derived from Eastern folk wisdom. The first half of the film is relatively straightforward and rooted in reality as a soldier stationed in the jungle goes on leave to a bustling city and falls in love with a young man who lives and works there. The growing attachment between the two men is chronicled with so much subtlety that it takes us quite awhile to realize that there is anything of that nature between them. Then suddenly one night after a particularly tender moment between the two lovers Tong walks away into the darkness of an open road while Keng returns to his post in the jungle. When news begins to spread in the nearby village that livestock have been found dead and some humans have also gone missing Keng heads out into the forest alone to investigate the claims. And this is where the film REALLY turns strange for Keng soon discovers that some sort of beast may be hiding out there devouring both animals and people and that  get this  that beast may actually be Tong the love of his life. This second  and for me slightly less interesting  half of the film is a largely wordless journey into the filmmakers' own heart of darkness.I won't try and pretend to grasp all the mystical concepts writerdirector Apichatpong Weerasethakul is batting around in this film. The quotes he provides for us drawn from famous Thai folk tales are of some help but much of the theme of the film remains obscure and murky for Western minds not accustomed to thinking in such pantheistic terms of the world around us. Nevertheless the film still connects with us Occidental types possibly because it explores that universal belief all humans seem to share  undoubtedly implanted onto our DNA way back in our primeval days  of a socalled enchanted forest a place where evil in a monstrous form may be lurking beneath the dark underbrush ready to jump out and devour us at any unguarded moment. It shows up in many of our fairy tales of course and most recently in films such as The Blair Witch Project The Village The Two Towers and The Brothers Grimm to name a few. Yet Tropical Malady also brings a romantic tenor to the subject as it implies that the love between the two men has somehow moved into a more meaningful and primal stage one bereft of the constricting and deadening rituals placed upon it by a civilized world my suspicion is that is why the filmmakers chose to make this a love story between two men rather than one between a man and a woman though frankly the Thai society we see doesn't seem to be particularly condemning or homophobic in its response to the lads.Even if every single moment is not comprehensible to us this is still a wonderful film to watch primarily because Weerasethakul brings such a lyrical impressionistic style to his direction. He fills literally every frame with fascinating details of the setting and landscape  be it the lush vegetation of an overgrown steamy rainforest or the neonlit vibrancy of a crowded urban shopping mall. His soundtrack is also a major player in the film particularly in the jungle scenes where the natural  and not so natural  sounds become an intricate part of the mood and drama.And mood is definitely the operative word here for Tropical Malady is far more a film of feelings and sensations than of conventional narrative. The lovely performances by Banlop Lomnoi and Sakda Kaewbaudee as the two men drawn into this surrealistic drama help to ground the film enough in reality so that we go along with it even when we don't always understand it. A feast for the eyes and ears Tropical Malady is a hypnotic spellbinding film that washes over you and carries you to a world singularly its own. Take the journey.".

The film is self indulgent appeared to have no script worth the word a juvenile editing approach which included texts and lengthy black screens and jumbled sequences. There were leaps from day to night and non sequitur to non sequitur from situation to situation. The dog lies on the road. The dog is happy in the lap. The dog is at the vet and dying of cancer. What had that got to do with ANYTHING? The only justification was to show that the village boy was illiterate and unable to fill in the vet's form. So what? This was a love affair did it matter that the boy could or could not read? Later on he takes pen to paper so maybe he can write but not read. The written dialogue translated from the Thai and thus quirky had some effect... the tiger would eat the man's flesh and blood and 'memories'... nice notion. But even the quality of the goodish scenes left much to be desired. Good acting from the two leads and two lovely moments the soldier asking permission to lay his head on the country boy's lap and a show of affection with a long sniff kiss to the hand of the boy followed by the boy lick kissing the hand of the soldier followed by an incongruous moment with the boy going off into darkness and the solder riding a moped along a street with a smile on his face. Effectively there are two entirely different films present.If only they had reversed these two completely different films and paid attention to linking and a firm story line there might have been something which was less painful to sit through. I am astonished at the writers who have gone over the top with this film. I am merely confident that anyone who sees the film with anything like commonsense objectivity will agree with me. It is not smart to see inferior material as clever art. The scenes in the forest were an opportunity for some serious scary moments but it failed. Nothing happened there was no sense to it all. Perhaps the editor is the person to blame for there probably was not a writer or a director on the evidence placed on the silver screen by this work. I cannot recommend people see it except perhaps to challenge my views. Sorry but very much a miss.".

I see the metaphor of the traditional versus the original and I quite like the idea but filmwise the link betwoon both parts was messy and unclear if there was a link at all.The way I see it the lack of much dialogue or other information to clear things up and the presence of a lot of scenes of which I didn't really understand the relevance didn't really help. Don't get me wrong I kinda liked the slow pace of the story with some silent moments built in and of course the beautiful imagery of the jungle. But I really think it was a little overdone here. There was a lot of dead wood on this tree so to speak. By dead wood I mean the several scenes where things happen of which it was quite hard to understand the relevance to the central story line and of course the several pretty long periods in the film where nothing really happens at all. Instead some more 'structure' and some more elements to give the viewer a little more grip on the film in order to understand what the writer meant would have been more than welcome.".

But because of the intensity of his love when the lad vanishes the soldier must hunt in the Thai jungle for him. Although the love is gay it is not so much in the sexual meaning of that word as it is joyous. There is no nudity and hardly any touching or kissing. This is an unusual film as the first part is treated naturally the second with its own credits is a haunting fantasy. The photography in daylight is banal and cluttered with an excellent feel for Thailand's countryside but the night scenes are glowing. The work of several photographers were involved to create the difference. An extremely moving honest wellcrafted film with an interesting filmed commentary by the director and the actors.".

Stephane is an observer of life not a participant. The film reveals the consequences of his emotional isolation of what he has to give up in order to maintain his solitude. Un Coeur en Hiver is as far from a typical Hollywood romance as Casablanca is from L'Avventura. The film is almost a revisionist portrayal of the usual debonair French romantic lover. While the lovely sonatas and trios of Maurice Ravel form a haunting background there is a lifeless quality to Stephane and ennui is a palpable presence throughout.Stephane seems ready to leap into a passionate relationship with a beautiful young violinist Camille Emmanuelle Beart after Maxim his partner for many years also in love with Camille introduces her to Stephane. Stephane however is unable to relate to Maxim's friendship or to his growing attraction to Camille and becomes distant and manipulative.Held back by his reluctance to take risks his relationship with Camille provides him with the forms of intimacy but without the substance. No pat psychological interpretation is provided but is left to the viewer to interpret. The camera is reserved and intimate. For the most part emotions are conveyed through glances expressions and silences rather than dialogue.The scene where Camille finally explodes out of frustration over Stephane's emotional distance however is powerful yet is not enough to shake the reluctant lover from his hiding place. At a restaurant Camille tells Stephanie He says he likes music because music is dreams. Poor jerk she blurts out You know nothing about dreams. Pointing to his heart she says There is nothing in there nothing. No imagination no heart no balls. Stephane simply sits there with a half grin on his face. I could really feel Camille's frustration in trying to pluck fruit from a barren tree.Auteuil's outstanding performance makes him a likable figure a really sweet guy but a very sad one. I felt repeatedly like shaking him from his lethargy and exposing him to joy and the rhythmic beauty of life perhaps adding a little Mozart to his Ravel.At the end however there is some character development. Stephane finally recognizes that there is something lifeless inside of me. As his friends depart he is left sitting alone at a restaurant table poignantly feeling his loneliness. Perhaps this insight is the beginning of his transformation. A very sad film but beautifully realized.".

These characters are tormented by a feeling of inadequacy by strong unresolved love and deep affection. It's a modern greek tragedy. It reminds us of the real human nature unlinear never simple. Forget the whiteblack type of hollywood movies. The real world is not like that. We are not just good we are not just bad we can be strong and weak at the same time.

Forget the whiteblack type of hollywood movies. The real world is not like that. We are not just good we are not just bad we can be strong and weak at the same time.

One of the many qualities to admire in this film is that what the characters do not say is more important that what they do and rather than being vague and ambiguous which is a polite way of often saying muddled and obscure in movies everything is confidently conveyed through expressions and actions. This is a film that knows exactly how much to say and what about. There are some brilliantly subtle clues to Auteil's character. Have you ever been in love? Beart asks.probably he replies and nothing more is said. yet despite it's casual nature we remember that comment and without any more help we conclude that this may be the real reason for his isolation now a desperate attempt at selfpreservation. The music is brilliantly chosen and the camera draws things out of the frame naturally...Auteil touching Beart for the first time when crossing the road the wonderful coffee shop scene that slap from Maxim. There is also some excellent humour especially in the argument between the old couple Auteil witnesses from outside their house. It is interesting to compare this film with Three Colours Blue which I saw the same evening a more explicit depiction of isolation equally powerful through different methods.".

From the start I was hooked and have not changed my opinion since then even though I have seen the film probably about 12 times. I have seen it with others and I respect their criticisms and dislike of the film esp of Stephane but all the same I still love the film. Not only is it my favorite it is also the most influential in my life. If I made or wrote films I would do one like this.About the film itself all the performances are wonderful not only Auteuil and Beart but also the smaller roles like Bourgine as Helene. The camera is simple but effective in this context. And the finale is superb a high moment in cinema history. Stephane trapped behind the painfully clean caf window each passersby caught in the icy glass but the camera caught on the resigned stare of Stephane until the picture freezes and fades slowly to black over the score of Ravel. Truly one of the most devastating scenes on film. Above all glass and windows play a huge role in this film maybe some sort of statement that Stephane leads a reflected life sees life only through glass or in reflection but never seems to be able to touch life itself. And all the glass is extremely clean reflecting every little detail.Sautet may not be one of the greatest French film makers but late in life he produced two remarkable films this and Nelly et M Arnaud.

For some reason either out of loyalty to his friend fear of commitment or a conviction that he does not deserve anything as perfect or maybe a mixture of all three Stephane pulls away. He not only pulls away he does it with such ruthlessness that comes in complete contradiction with his character. A character that holds a violin as if it were the most fragile item in the world and yet does not hesitate to shatter a woman's heart by simply saying I have decided to seduce you without loving you.

It's very moving.Although I think the director and screenwriter intend for us to sympathize primarily with Beart's inability to draw out Auteil in fact having so often been in her shoes myself I felt instead time and again leave him alone let him be who he is. It is Beart's character's immaturity and vanity that cause her to believe that there must be something terribly wrong with someone whose feelings toward her do not correspond to her own feelings toward him. As someone who has taken away a married father and within days apparently looks to betray him with another unattainable man I was not greatly sympathetic toward her plight.

SPOILERS I find deeply disturbing the movie's showing of Auteil's willingness to engage in a mercy killing as the sign of his love for someone. Pity is certainly different from love  and murder is different from selfsacrifice.I was also enraged by Maxim's slap of Auteil  it seemed absurd that his primary emotion  on leaving his family for someone and arranging for an apartment  on hearing that his paramour was in unreciprocated love with another would not be anger at her jealousy of the object of her affection desire that she change regret at his abandonment of his family for his lust. Instead he is absurdly angry that the unwilling object of her affection has embarrassed her by failing to return the feeling! This strikes me as a very untrue emotion.I found the ending that Maxim and Beart's character lived happily ever equally unbelievable. Clearly Beart will take up with whomever NEXT struck her fancy as unattainable! How could Maxim have so little selfregard as to deal with these outrages after he has abandoned his soul with his family?

In fact afterwards I rushed out and bought the music of Ravel as performed by the Britten String Quartet for the movie. This is that kind of good movie.

It's a love triangle of sorts between two friends a bachelor Maxime and his quiet friend Stephane who are business partners running a violin repair shop. Maxime begins a relationship with the beautiful violinist Camille who soon becomes attracted to Stefane who does not overtly return her advances. Stefane is really a voyeur who belongs in the same group as Harry Caul L.B. Jeffries and Damiel the angel all people who are flawed or broken in some way on the inside and feel compelled to look at others only from a distance refusing to become involved. They seem to understand from behaviorism the depths of other people but can barely conceal their own loneliness or broken relationshipsStefane correctly states that he can never give Camille or any normal woman what she deserves. He deliberately pushes her away when he feels pressured into intimacy. He loves music and handles his violins which can be argued are shaped like an ideal female body revealing Stephane's asexuality the way Maxime and other normal men handle women. Director Claude Sautet has a gift with letting human drama unfold and he carefully studies the behavior of his characters who come alive without force or question so much that the audience feels like a you're listening on close friends fighting. Then a reallife couple Emmanuel Beart and Daniel Auteuil are stunning such a great unique romance for a reallife coupleyou couldn't ever imagine Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ever tackling this together hitting all the right notes pun intended with the precision and understanding of great actors and even better human beings. Auteuil in particular is spectacular because of Stephane's deep introvert nature and Auteuil has to allude to so many conflicting emotions that are barely visible beneath the surface and he does so much just with his eyes which flutter with happiness and fall with regret with perfect grace.".

The plot deals with the central character's coldness in relationships with people around him. He is definitely gifted in what he does. He is sincere and hardworking. People around him tend to be friendly and caring. But it seems our guy has some intimacy issues  he can't go beyond a certain level. I am not really sure as to what message did the movie want to convey. It can't just be  if you are cold in nature you are a loser. I don't think Stphane was cold by choice  he couldn't just change his nature so as to make others happy. I found it odd that a person of such nature would speak with frankness and openness about these issues  the way Stphane tells Camille in the restaurant. His friendship with Hlne also seems unexplained  what was the basis  did they expect it to go further? What struck as peculiar was attention given to details on mundane activities  like the craftsmanship involved in making musical instruments or dealing with the restaurant manager. In some ways these elements helped in keeping one occupied and expectant of things to come. Daniel Auteuil's portrayal of Stphane was very natural. Always immaculately dressed the way he interacted sometimes with a smirk on his face  it made you empathize with his character. Also at times you felt like saying  what's wrong with this guy?  probably the kind of response director would have wanted to evoke from the audience. Emmanuelle Bart has acted brilliantly and looks amazingly beautiful. Andr Dussollier also put in a strong performance in his portrayal of Maxime. Dialogues are thoughtful  but at times their gravity made you feel that these are not the most natural of conversations. Cinematography is splendid  with close shots of characters and focus on eye and facial expressions.".

The director is very subtle in providing the viewer with plenty of little details about him but refraining from pointing the finger at a single explanation. Still the character is incredibly lifelike and we comes to see him as it was a real person.

And Daniel Auteuil what can I say his acting is so understated and expressive that you take his character to heart in spite of his seemingly heartless actions towards Camille.";

Confidential perhaps Bad Influence will be rediscovered for what it is a contemporary noir classic.  Michael played by James Spader is one step away from a nervous breakdown.  His fiancee is planning a wedding he is nonetothrilled about while his career is at a crossroads. Someone will get that key promotion but Michael won't unless he can find his schedule report which has mysteriously disappeared.  He suspects his work rival Patterson but is too much of a wimp to confront him.  He has been doubling up in pain from what he thinks is an ulcer from the stress. He leaves work for a fateful drink at a beach dive bar.  He lamely hits on a woman whose boyfriend Michael does not back down from.  Michael gets saved by Alex or Tony ? played by Rob Lowe who menacingly breaks a beer bottle and threatens the boyfriend.  Alex we see at the beginning of the movie as leaving a beautiful woman's bed stealthily.  The photo he destroys of him and the woman shooting guns together foreshadows the violence that comes later.  Alex leaves Michael at the bar and Michael discovers his wallet is gone but does not know how he lost it.  While jogging later Alex stops by the bar to leave his name for the wallet.  He finishes his run at one of the L.A. piers he sees Alex who of course is with a woman pleading with him to stay with her.  Alex blows off the woman and he and Michael have a drink together.  Alex starts teaching him how to use the side of him that didn't back down to the gorilla at the bar.  What ensues is a Freudian Cain and Abel story with Faustian overtones.  Alex becomes Michael's tutor in the art of becoming a badass while Michael becomes something Alex hasn't had in quite some time a friend.  When Michael's backbone becomes strong enough to stand up to the unpredictably violent Alex the movie becomes a cunning duel between two guys who know L.A. isn't big enough for both of them.  The scenes of L.A.'s sinister club life and the people like Alex who thrive in it serve as superb snapshots of the decadence of the late80s.  The conspicuous consumption of yuppies and the advent of the home video camera as a sexual metaphor are wickedly exposed.  This movie was simply ahead of its time.  It's Rob Lowe's best work and James Spader is awesome his transformation is expertly done.  Plus I'm eagerly awaiting Curtis Hanson's next movie.  Has anyone ever captured the evil that lurks underneath the surface of L.A. better?  Bad Influence is a mustsee for the serious film enthusiast.".

Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Robert Elswit.Michael Boll Spader is the ultimate milquetoast. Alex Lowe is something altogether different. When Alex introduces himself into Michael's life Michael finds from within a boldness he didn't know existed. But Alex's life lessons may just come at a cost...Tell me what you want more than anything else in the world.The 90s began in a neonorish haze for one time bratpackers Spader and Lowe. For Spader it was another chance to show after 1989's Sex Lies and Videotape that he could do drama very well. For Lowe it was a case of dusting off his off screen misdemeanours to self mockingly portray the bad boy playing the bad boy. With future L.A. Confidential helmer Hanson in the chair overseeing things Bad Influence rounded out as a sneaky bit of grit. It didn't make any great waves back on release but it's a film that holds up surprisingly well these days particularly as an 80s noir snapshot.Thematically picture asks us if everyone has the devil inside them if prompted or manipulated from outside sources? Alex's motives are intentionally left sketchy we are in no doubt from the opening credits that he's untrustworthy yet who he is or what he's really about are questions left hanging in the air. A good looking charmer without doubt and thanks to Spader's uber wimp beginnings we find ourselves urging Alex on as he slots a spine into Michael's back. There's a decidedly nasty edge to the Koepp screenplay that lets the actors excel in their respective transformations and with the mood set at simmer story unfolds and lets the Doppleganger motif kick in. From here on in it's now a question for the viewers of how it's going to resolve itself?Call me Mick.Hanson paints it in sweaty metallic strokes interiors of Michael's condo portray yuppie claustrophobia exteriors of nighttime L.A. are classic noir where the bright lights of the city are eyes observing Michael's transformation and the salty whiff of the pier and the sea hover over the telling periods of dialogue. True enough to say that Bad Influence and its director owe a huge debt to past masters notably something like Strangers on a Train but the update works very well particularly in the context of maintaining a continued sense of tension. The humour that lives and breathes in the picture is nicely placed adding a bit of salt to an already spicy broth and there's even the delicate hint of an old noir favourite potential man crush.The build up isn't matched by the pay off but even then there's enough of a bite to warrant respect. Far better than some internet ratings suggest it is and certainly undervalued in the neonoir pantheon Bad Influence is well worth reevaluating in this new age of cinema. 7.510".

Spader is one of these actors that seems to play very snotty unlikeable people.

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Influence is about an innocent person who's drawn into the control of a character who disguises his real nature by pretending to be motivated purely by a desire to help the hapless victim. The gullible male in this case suffers as a result of befriending a guy who initially seems to be a charismatic Good Samaritan but is later revealed to be a dangerous psychopath who takes great pleasure in doing all that he can to ruin his friend's life.Michael Boll James Spader is an ambitious marketing analyst who's doing well in his job but comes up against a problem when one of his colleagues sabotages his work by wiping one of his most important files off the company's computer system. Michael's a rather diffident person who has no idea how to deal with this predicament and also has an additional problem as he doesn't want to marry his posh fiance. When he goes to a nearby bar to console himself with a beer he gets caught up in an altercation with a violent customer who holds his head down against the bar but fortunately a goodlooking stranger comes to his rescue.The stranger who's called Alex Rob Lowe and Michael soon become friends and Alex makes it his business to show Michael how to overcome some of his problems. This results in Michael successfully turning the tables on his scheming work rival and freeing himself from his fiance. Michael's sense of liberation and empowerment is profound but doesn't stop there because through his new friendship he soon gets involved in nightclubbing doing drugs and enjoying some no commitment sex.Alex turns out to be a mystery man who uses a variety of names doesn't seem to have any commitments and adopts a number of different accents. The wild behaviour that he and Michael indulge in gets more serious when they rob a series of convenience stores. This makes Michael uncomfortable when he has time to reflect on his actions but when he tries to free himself from his friendship with Alex things turn ugly and he soon finds himself framed for a murder he didn't commit. The methods that Michael uses to restore some sanity to his life are both ironic in nature and entertaining to watch.This movie has a good sense of time and place as Michael is a typical 1980s style yuppie with an impressive apartment lots of expensive possessions and a strong appetite for improving his status. Alex on the other hand is a dedicated pleasure seeker who's manipulative and completely amoral. Whilst Michael is initially repressed and passive Alex is very confident and has no inhibitions whatsoever and the hedonistic and decadent behaviour that they indulge in is also symptomatic of 1980s affluence and excess.Bad Influence is an intriguing thriller which features a couple of interesting characters plenty of suspense and excellent performances from Rob Lowe and James Spader. Spader is particularly good at conveying Michael's anxiety naivety and discomfort in certain situations and Lowe conveys Alex's combination of charm and menace very effectively. The action is delivered at a good pace and there are also some humorous moments to enjoy.".

When he goes to a nearby bar to console himself with a beer he gets caught up in an altercation with a violent customer who holds his head down against the bar but fortunately a goodlooking stranger comes to his rescue.The stranger who's called Alex Rob Lowe and Michael soon become friends and Alex makes it his business to show Michael how to overcome some of his problems. This results in Michael successfully turning the tables on his scheming work rival and freeing himself from his fiance. Michael's sense of liberation and empowerment is profound but doesn't stop there because through his new friendship he soon gets involved in nightclubbing doing drugs and enjoying some no commitment sex.Alex turns out to be a mystery man who uses a variety of names doesn't seem to have any commitments and adopts a number of different accents. The wild behaviour that he and Michael indulge in gets more serious when they rob a series of convenience stores. This makes Michael uncomfortable when he has time to reflect on his actions but when he tries to free himself from his friendship with Alex things turn ugly and he soon finds himself framed for a murder he didn't commit. The methods that Michael uses to restore some sanity to his life are both ironic in nature and entertaining to watch.This movie has a good sense of time and place as Michael is a typical 1980s style yuppie with an impressive apartment lots of expensive possessions and a strong appetite for improving his status. Alex on the other hand is a dedicated pleasure seeker who's manipulative and completely amoral. Whilst Michael is initially repressed and passive Alex is very confident and has no inhibitions whatsoever and the hedonistic and decadent behaviour that they indulge in is also symptomatic of 1980s affluence and excess.Bad Influence is an intriguing thriller which features a couple of interesting characters plenty of suspense and excellent performances from Rob Lowe and James Spader. Spader is particularly good at conveying Michael's anxiety naivety and discomfort in certain situations and Lowe conveys Alex's combination of charm and menace very effectively. The action is delivered at a good pace and there are also some humorous moments to enjoy.";

It's a game on someone's life and Lowe's icy portrayal of the controlling puppeteer works effectively. Sure the fundamental storyline isn't anything new an old formula ala noir going contemporary and some plot avenues seem a little too glossed over and hard to fathom but Curtis Hanson's daringly sharp and tight direction cements intense empowerment and morbid curiosity in certain visual suspense. Using an almost voyeuristic approach he draws upon unearthing the violence drug habit and sleaze trying to hide behind a materialistic obsessive society. Fascinatingly slick and stylish and the cruiselike pace moves along well enough. The soundtrack has that steamy on edge kick that doesn't show its age. Also for one in this time period it's strangely underplayed and kept in the background. The support cast play trumps to Lowe and Spader but Lisa Zane titillates in her all too short of a role.

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Influence is an example of that subgenre of the thriller which I have come to think of as the . from Hell film. The basic plot of such films is that a stranger comes into the life of the hero. At first this stranger seems affable and friendly but quickly reveals himself or herself to be a dangerous criminal or psychopath and the hero finds that he is in danger. The genre is an old one this is for example the plot of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train. It was however given a new lease of life in the late 1980s and 1990s by the success of Fatal Attraction or OneNight Stand from Hell. Other examples include Pacific Heights Tenant from Hell Single White Female Flatmate from Hell and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle Nanny from Hell. This last film like Bad Influence was directed by Curtis Hanson. There are also elements of the . from Hell plot in The River Wild another Hanson film from the nineties.The plot of Bad Influence can be summarised as Blokeyoumeetinabar from Hell. The hero Michael is a young business executive the sort of person who in the eighties or nineties would have been described by the nowdated slang term yuppie. Yuppies during this period were normally characterised as pushy aggressive gogetting types but Michael is anything but. He is a wimp who lacks selfconfidence and allows himself to be pushed around at work by his unscrupulous colleague Patterson his rival for an important promotion and at home by his domineering fiance Ruth. Marcia Cross in the days before she became a desperate housewife.One evening Michael tries to chat up a girl in a bar and is saved from being beaten up by her jealous boyfriend by a mysterious stranger a young man named Alex. Interestingly enough the female antagonist in Fatal Attraction also bore this same unisex Christian name. Alex not only befriends Michael but also encourages him to be more selfassertive. Under Alex's tutelage Michael finds the courage to stand up to Patterson. Alex also engineers the breakup of Michael's relationship with Ruth something which does not unduly concern him partly because he was never really in love with her partly because Alex finds him a new girlfriend a sexy goodtime girl named Claire.And then of course it all starts to go wrong. It always does in films of this nature. Alex turns out to be not only a criminal but also completely mad. Under his influence Michael takes part in two armed robberies following which the two men break into Patterson's home and beat him up. Michael alarmed at the way things are developing tries to end his association with Alex only to find that Alex is not a man to take no for an answer. He not only steals all of Michael's possessions but also murders Claire and leaves her body in his apartment. Not that Alex has anything in particular against Claire he just wants her dead so that he can frame Michael for the murder.Well it's not just Michael's life that's going Pete Tong. The film itself has been teetering on the edge of absurdity for some time and it is around this point that it stops teetering and plunges in headfirst. Hanson and his scriptwriter have ignored two cardinal rules of the .. from Hell movie. The first is that the hero or heroine must be someone with whom the audience can identify. Michael Douglas's character in Fatal Attraction for example may have been guilty of a moral lapse when he cheated on his wife but he nevertheless remains an Everyman figure with whom we can sympathise someone being punished excessively for a single error of judgement. James Spader 's Michael by contrast is less an Everyman than a prize jerk. Someone who will happily participate in no fewer than three violent felonies as some sort of virility test suggested by a casual acquaintance can only be described as both mentally and morally defective.The second rule that the film ignores is that in the most successful .. from Hell movies the villain must also be someone whom the audience can at least understand even if they cannot identify or sympathise with him or her. Both Glenn Close's Alex in Fatal Attraction and Rebecca de Mornay's Peyton in The Hand that Rocks the Cradle commit evil deeds but both are motivated by very understandable and all too common human emotions sexual jealousy in the first example and desire for revenge in the second. Rob Lowe's Alex is not motivated by anything other than an insane urge to commit crimes at the behest of the scriptwriter in order to make the film as lurid and sensational as possible. Alex's character might have been more comprehensible had the film explored in greater depth the latent homosexual attraction which is implied between the two men in which case his villainy like that of his female namesake in Fatal Attraction could have been explained as the result of anger following rejection by a lover. Even in the nineties however Hollywood could often be coy about turning gay subtext into gay text see also The Talented Mr. Ripley etc and this angle was never pursued.I watched this film largely because it was directed by Hanson who also made the excellent L.A. Confidential perhaps the best neonoir of the nineties and was also responsible for good thrillers like The River Wild and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle. Bad Influence unfortunately is just not in the same class. It is an overthetop implausible thriller whose ostensible hero is nearly as unsympathetic as its villain. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie very much which is why it got seven stars from me but it's by no means a fantastic or transcendent experience. It does it's job as a thriller ably and it's worth watching. The good You do care about the characters and James Spader and Rob Lowe are both fantastic actors who are on the top of their game here. It's interesting to see Spader play a guy who isn't super cool and self assured for a change and he handles it well. Lowe channels a bit of Patrick Bateman and creates a great GQ sociopath. The supporting cast is quite good as well however this could very well have been a twoman film as you can fit the dialog of all the other characters in the movie combined onto maybe two sheets of paper. The director also had a great eye for style as the locations clothing and music were gorgeous and perfectly suited to the era and gave the film a great deal of authenticity. The bad I'm not entirely convinced why Spader was so quick to discard his fianc who was beautiful rich and from all indications a very nice person that cared for him a great deal. The film never really sets up any kind of conflict or apprehension between the couple to justify Spader's truly rash behavior. Yes I get that he wanted a taste of the badboy life that Lowe was a part of but he seemed to throw it all away far too easily and willingly. For the type of character that he was I'd expect a little more internal conflict moralizing and apprehension to go along with a decision like that. It just seems like his descent was inexplicably rapid and left a lot of questions unanswered. Beyond that I think the ending or last 30 minutes or so could have been done a little better. The good does really outweigh the bad and the movie is genuinely worth watching if you're a fan of the genre. Don't expect a Michael Mann film but you can definitely get some solid entertainment value out of it nonetheless.".

The film gets real intense.This is one of Rob Lowe's best acted films. In character Lowe is very similar to Tyrone Power's Stan Carlisle from Nightmare Alley. In fact Lowe is the closest thing we've seen to a reincarnation on the screen of Power when he does his heroheel thing. Rob's never played the straight out hero though the way Power did also. But he's sure got the bad aspect of Power's portfolio down.Lowe dominates Bad Influence completely but it's that kind of part.

I personally enjoy movies that feature psychopaths because then I can observe brash appalling behavior where nobody actually gets hurt and Bad Influence is a fine depiction of a psychopath. To those who complained that we don't get to understand Alex's motives I would say that one is not supposed to. Like that of any psychopath his life is a series of thrills  using and abandoning women robbing liquor stores torturing James Spader etc.Alex really does end up helping Michael by showing him how to outsmart his rival at work disentangling him from what would have surely been a horrendous marriage and inadvertently bringing him closer to his ne'erdowell brother. Naturally Michael has too much of a conscience to go all the way to the dark side but he does acquire some much needed assertiveness training in the hands of the villain.Like many movies of this ilk Bad Influence stops short of being brilliant when it chooses style over substance. Pismo did not really have to go into that underground bar to retrieve a beer bottle with Alex's prints did he? The scene is there so we can watch Michael's awkward brother amongst the beautiful people. But the movie is so stylish and attractively filmed that I do not particularly mind when the plot does not always make sense.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER The best scene is Michael returning to his apartment that had been cleaned out by Alex and seeing the television and VCR sitting ominously in his otherwise empty living room. I love the interplay of the horror on the television screen and the horror in the bedroom.".

Here he plays Alex although that might not be his name who convinces Michael James Spader to take a grip on his life although not in a conventional way and go after what he really wants.  Obviously we're meant to feel for Spader first as he's led through the LA underground scene that he doesn't understand or fit into and then as his life falls apart when Alex is angry that he's no longer wanted in Spader's yuppie life. However Spader plays his character so flat that its ever so much more fun to watch Lowe play the maniacal murderer and laugh along with him.  When his last lines are delivered just a touch cheesily they're true everyone has a dark side that they don't want to acknowledge.  This movie either tried to make you fear that side or get in touch with it but the makers weren't all that clear on what they wished you to do.  If it was to get in touch with it they pointed out rather blatantly what would happen if you do although to share that would be to give away the ending.  I'd like to point out one thing though.  This movie could have been made with less sex and nudity and probably have been just as effective were they making a psychological thriller or soft porn?

	schema:reviewBody "BAD INFLUENCE 1990 is an original dark disturbing tale starring of couple of very good actors Rob Lowe and James Spader. Lowe and Spader although both had ties or were directly affiliated in Lowe's case with the Brat Pack gang had not done a film together before this one. And this one's a keeper! I think this is the best work that either actor had done up to this point. For me this is the performance that showed that Rob Lowe could act. It really is his first challenging role. He does a good job of balancing charm sex appeal and menace throughout. Lowe's first bad guy role. I also think this is a groundbreaking film for Spader as well. Even though he had tackled more challenging roles than Lowe in the 80s this is really the first good guy role that Spader had played. The againsttype casting works to great effect as I don't think the film would have been as nearly effective had their roles been reversed.Spader is a nerdy shy underconfident stock broker named Michael who is engaged to an upper class girl Marcia Cross of Desperate Housewives fame. Life is good simple but very mundane and boring for Michael. In comes Alex Lowe's character who instills Michael with selfconfidence courage and even sex appeal molding him into his own image to a degree.The two men's accidental meeting early in the film at a seaside bar is a great setup for the rest of the film as it underscores the essence of each character. I also felt this scene was very realistic in the dialogue character reactions and outcome.Alex seems to be a drifter who doesn't stay in one place very long. In return for Michael putting him up for a while Alex mentors Michael on being more assertive confident and uninhibited. First Alex sets Michael up so that his fiance dumps him. They end up hanging out at bars and ecstasy parties then during one night they meet Claire played by the alluring Lisa Zane. A triangle forms as Alex compels Claire to sleep with Michael while he himself has designs on her and she seems to prefer his dangerous sex appeal but still is drawn to Michael's underlying sweet innocence. But one night things go a bit too far as Alex takes Michael along with him goes on a mini crime spree robbing a liquor store and beating up Michael's jerkish colleague but Michael doesn't remember. This is when Michael dumps Alex and tells him to get out of his life. Then things get deadly! BAD INFLUENCE was directed by Curtis Hanson who gained international fame years later with LA CONFIDENTIAL and his stylish touches and film noir mood and tone are evident throughout. This film was a sign that Hanson was going to become a major player in Hollywood. Lowe is very good at abandoning his Brat Pack persona and giving a real performance. He instills Alex with charm sex appeal and a sense of danger. Spader is equally excellent playing a genuine nice guy and conveys real vulnerability that he had never really displayed before this film. Highly recommended!".

If it wasn't for Alex coming to Michael's rescue with a broken beer glass the movie Bad Infulance would have been over almost as soon as it began.Taking the wimpy Michael under his wing Alex gets him involved after getting Michael stone cold drunk in a number of armed robberies that he later uses to blackmail him with.

Not that Patterson was an innocent party in his screwing Michael by erasing all the hard work on his personal computer that he did to get the job.It's later that Alex really gets to work on Michael in not only getting him in bed with hooker Claire Lisa Zane but video taping the sleazy and sordid event. Alex uses the incriminating video to destroy Michael's wedding plans to rich well beard and sweet Ruth Fielding Marcia Cross whom he was engaged to marry! Later in order to keep Michael in line Alex kills Claire with Michael's favorite golf clubin his apartment leaving him as the police's prime suspect in her murder!As it turns out Alex's plan to have Michael under his control backfired in Michael becoming almost as smart and manipulative as he is. In fact Alex in trying to make Michael into his personal slave created a Frankenstein monster instead. A monster who in the end with the help of his even more scared and wimpy older brother Pismo Christian Clemeron would put the arrogant and sure of himself Alex in his place! By having him take a long walk off the end of a short pier on the Pacific Ocean!You never get to know what Alex's fascination with Michael really was. Alex like the Lone Ranger just shows up at the bar and takes control of Michael's life as if Michael's confrontation with Willie was planned far in advance! Alex getting Michael involved in his murderous antics also didn't make much sense in that Michael can like Alex did to Michael implicate him in them as well!The only explication I can see in Alex's actions is that he just wanted to corrupt like the Devil a harmless and innocent person. And as it turned out it was that person Michael who used Alex's underhanded tactics in his own self preservation by having them boomerang on him!".

Reverse the roles as some posters here have suggested and Bad Influence turns into nothing more than an apologia with Rob Lowe as the wronged victim  both cinematically and in his personal life although I do think he may well have been more sinned against than sinning on the personal front. It takes more courage and ultimately shows more integrity on the actor's part that he chose the harder option of the two and went for the unsympathetic role.Top marks for James Spader too in a fairly weak and unforgiving role.".

Then he meets Alex Rob Lowe an impeccably dressed drifter with a fatal charm and an insatiable appetite for wine women and danger. Alex befriends Michael and takes him for a walk on the wild side  but Michael soon discovers that there's a terrible price to pay for life in the fast lane because hanging out with Alex can be murder according to the film's official synopsis. Don't touch that dial! Christian Clemenson's character is almost a PeptoBismol anagram.Director Curtis Hanson's Bad Influence has been compared to Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train 1951. The plot's comparison to Hitchcock's classic is justifiable but Mr. Hanson makes Bad Influence look much more like Psycho 1960. And this story is clearly Faustian Alex isn't merely psychopathic he's evil incarnate. The deal Mr. Spader makes with the Devil involves help in beating Tony Maggio as Patterson out of a promotion at work and weaseling out of a marriage with Marcia Cross as Ruth. Come on down! The only way Mick can defeat Alex is to send him plummeting back into the depths of Hell.It's always nice when watching old movies to stumble upon an undiscovered jewel or even a lost masterpiece. Bad Influence is one of those films. The film had a relatively unheralded reception when originally released and it received zero nominations from any of the major film awards groups. One of the problems may have been the media scandal erupting over the nearly simultaneous uncovering of a sex tape featuring Mr. Lowe. Presently this sort of publicity would be planned to help the film which includes Lowe's character in a similar situation but it was no publicity stunt.And if you see Lowe with Spader in a bunny mask that is a gun in his pocket.This was before celebrity Paris Hilton and FOX showed how to use the celebrity sex tape to their advantage  making Ms. Hilton and the network's The Simple Life hits. Lowe's appearance in a Snow White opening at the previous year's Academy Awards and his teen idol backlash didn't help. But Lowe is terrific in Bad Influence it should have established him as an Alist film actor. Ironically costar Spader had just received the same kind of career break in the recent sex lies and videotape 1989. Ah those were the camcorder days Does anybody want an espresso? With perfect performances and a dazzling display of light and shadows Bad Influence should have received six Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture it is absolutely one of the bestlooking films of its year and surfaces as one of the more stylish looks at MTV generation. Those most responsible director Hanson and cinematographer Robert Elswit received Oscars for work on subsequent films. Writer David Koepp's screenplay is also excellent to appreciate his story and understand the L.A. scene depicted in Bad Influence simply use the code words given to enter the film Dominant Athletic Female Gay White Male FunLoving Couple.

Julien can't decide to really go to the interview and he is procrastinating. This portion is hilarious.Next we have Michel Alexis Martin and his girlfriend. Michel has his grandfather's paintings in his living room and a mysterious stranger played by Gilbert Sicotte is a potential buyer. The stranger ends up being interested in only one painting but the couple lost it so they try frantically to remember where they stored it.Also there is a funny segment with a guy meeting his step dad for the first time in company of his girlfriend. His step dad played by Remy Girard is a wannabe boxer who think he can box but is actually old and has no skill at all. The step dad challenges the guy to a boxing match and what starts as play turns ugly.Then there is a segment with a couple with a infertile man Emmanuel Bilodeau who hired a sperm donor David La Haye to have sex with his wife and make her pregnant. The husband then discovers that the sperm donor and her wife were already having a affair since a certain time and that his wife was already pregnant.Then there is the very strange segment with two thieves breaking into the apartment but actually one of the thieves lives there and steal his own stuff. The other thief doesn't know about it. The reason why he does this is never really explained and I personally have no explanation for it. The thieves are played by Marc Messier and Nicolas Canuel.Finally this segment happens after the other ones when the apartment building is abandoned and about to be destroyed. A machinery operator then discovers something special in the apartment then him and the landlord played by Raymond Bouchard have a heated discussion about it.The audience is led to believe that there is actually a corpse or something else hidden in a trap in the apartment. Who could this be? We see all the other segments of the story take turns so the audience is left guessing until the end what really happened.Personally I think it was a very good movie. The movie had funny parts and has intelligent story and dialog. The acting was also very good and the right music was added at the right moment.I recommend this movie for anyone even if it has a small budget.".

	schema:headline " Great thriller they don't make 'em like this anymore";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching this with a friend of mine he commented I was just saying the other day even the 'B' movies from the 70s are better than the best movies today. Even allowing for the fact that this came out in 1983 that's an excellent point.They rarely make movies like this anymore. It's an exciting spy thriller but it's realistic and it's got some brains behind it as well. There are no idiotic Air Force One acrobatics no gigantic explosions with a character jumping towards the camera in the foreground and no snappy catchphrases. Just a good mystery and a boatload of great performances.One thing that's interesting about this film is that in the end the mystery turns out to be about commerce not politics which is unusual for this sort of coldwar Soviet thriller.Another exceptional feature is the great script by the legendary Dennis Potter. This sort of thing makes me wish he had done more movie scripts for hire. While it's certainly not a personal project like Pennies for Heaven or The Singing Detective Potter still turns in a topnotch script filled with typically Potterian touches like frequent references to losing your skin and the smart snappy hilarious dialogue in general.Another Potter touch also used in Christabel is the way all the characters except the Americans use British accents. This is a little disconcerting at first but once you're used to it it works really well. First an actor playing a Russian and speaking English with a British accent is hardly any more unrealistic than an actor speaking English with a Russian accent. More importantly the use of British accents as in Christabel allows Potter and the actors to indicate the characters' relative social status by the type of accent they have. Intellectually it doesn't make any sense to have the Soviet administrators talk in an upper class British accent and the regular cops speak with a Cockney accent but artistically it induces an immediate emotional response in the viewer that makes a real difference between the two characters instead of just presenting us with two indistinguishable Russian cops.All in all this is an underappreciated thriller that holds up extremely well over twenty years later.".

Hurt and Marvin do great jobs and are well matched.This is a tight very well constructed police procedural that is a little exotic with the cops and functionaries being Russians. It's also a bit gloomy with a bitter sweet ending but it still works as a very watchable film. A lot of the outdoor shots were filmed in Helsinki and the movie takes place in the winter. The atmosphere looks cold and oppressive. The contrast is striking with the scenes set in a prerevolutionary bath and an expensive restaurant both reserved for the use of privileged Soviet officials.

It is noteworthy that most of the socalled Russians are British Isles actors who maintain their native brogue while donning the usual Kossacklike apparel! Yet their histrionic adeptness suffers not and their characterizations come off well. After all we've seen this type of casting done before but I don't think we could pull this off in modern Russia.

Marvin is great as his adversary the corrupt American businessman.The primary complaint about this film is that it wasn't filmed in Russia. What people tend to forget is that it was made at the height of the cold war and Soviet Premier Chernenko and the Politburo would not have opened Moscow to an American film crew much less one that wanted to make a movie that depicts the various Russian agencies and beuraucrats as being as corrupt as Marvin.In the end they settled for Helsinki Finland which I guess is a fair tradeoff since Finland was technically a part of Russia for a few hundred years. Those who are familiar with Helsinki will probably mock this film as my Finnish girlfriend did but if you're not familiar or willing to look past that shortcoming then you will probably enjoy this movie quite a bit. They even went as far as to use Russian built Ladas a brand of car in the movie.Today this movie would have been made in Moscow or St. Petersburg and would probably be better.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason I almost always watch this when it appears on cable TV. The plot twisted and complicated as it is is a bit hard to follow at times although it does make sense if you pay attention. But I think it's the general milieu that is evoked by the location shooting wardrobe makeup and art direction that makes this interesting.Boy it looks cold! Everyone seems to dress in multilayered dark clothing and the men wear Pelzkappe those big furry caps. When characters speak in outdoor scenes their breath steams though not always so you can pretty much distinguish the scenes shot in the studio from those outside. Smith's novel was a bit more explicit about the material culture of Moscow than this movie is. Not only doesn't Chief Investigator Hurt's cheesy looking compact car have a heater but his shoes are made partly of cardboard. Viewers usually don't pay much attention to makeup unless it draws attention to itself but the makeup department should get a medal for this one. First off everyone is pale as they should be in the midst of a Russian winter. The usual tendency is to pile on the suntan and make everyone glamorous. If you want to see an example of what I mean watch A Time to Love and a Time to Die the scene in which John Gaving as a German soldier returns from months at the front during the winter and takes a bath naked so we can all admire his muscles and that tan he sports all over his body suggesting not November in Kursk but a summer at the beach in Zihuatanejo. Then there is Joanna Pacula's makeup. She's pale too but she's given just enough eyeshadow or kohl or whatever it is and her brows and lashes are emphasized just enough to make her look even more modelesque than she ordinarily would. If her eyebrows were any darker she'd look like Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina. As it is with her blue eyes framed by those orbital rings and her chestnut curls cascading around her cheeks she looks slightly predatory maybe like a sable. In some later movie she played a vampire I think and I can see why she was cast. William Hurt likewise pale even paler than usual come to think of it is likewise nicely handled. His thin stringy hair has been blackened for some reason. I don't know why. There are plenty of blond Russians. Look at Alexander Gudonov. Hurt's character is nobody's idea of a superhero. He's just an earnest cop who can be beaten up as he is several times. After he has killed a traitor who happened to be a man of considerable importance in the Soviet bureaucracy he next shows up on screen with a small shiner the color of a storm cloud on one of his eyelids and a slight scab on his lower lip. He's been clobbered by the KGB for the killing you see. But we don't see it on screen or hear it described. The bruises on his face tell the story. How tempting it must have been to make more of these possibilities. A Makeup Department could have gone ape here  one cheek stuffed with cotton bandages on his head his face a welter of bruises. But this is tastefully done giving you all the information you need in order to know what happened. Actually there is one tan face in the crowd  Lee Marvin's. But it suits him. And he's an American businessman who only visits the USSR from time to time so between visits for all we know he may be stretched out on the beach at Bora Bora. He even wears beige and dark browns that match his suntan and he's the only one in the bunch who actually looks spiffy. William Hurt may be chewed out by his superior for not having shaved closely enough but that would never happen to Marvin who looks like he just stepped out of fivehundreddollar a head hair salon. There isn't a line spoken by Marvin that doesn't ring with irony. Every pause every facial twitch every curious line reading tells us that this guy is very clever and he knows it. Pacula's performance is that of a model who's taken acting lessons. William Hurt a fine actor does some strange things here. He LOOKS the part of the determined militia detective relatively quiet rarely smiling seldom physical  but he drapes his speech in British locutions yore for your bean for been and so on. We can only guess why. The two Americans Dennehy and Marvin speak frank American. The actors playing Russians are all from the UK except Pacula who is Polish and kept help her Slavic accent. So by adopting a Brit accent Hurt places himself among the Russians. Dennehy by the way is at the top of his form. Marvin is absolutely magnetic as is Ian Bannon whose readings have the same ironic pitches and stress as Marvin's. You never believe a word he says. The film ends on a noble note. Pacula gets to go to America which as everyone knows is rich democratically pure and free of corruption. Hurt stays behind to save her from being followed and killed by KGB. The novel had a different ending. The hero follows the girl to New York City. They sit down to watch television. The program is one they have never seen before. It's title is The Price is Right. Come on DOWN! The hero says something like THIS is what it's all about? Money? And gets up and goes back to Russia leaving the girl flat.".

He LOOKS the part of the determined militia detective relatively quiet rarely smiling seldom physical  but he drapes his speech in British locutions yore for your bean for been and so on. We can only guess why. The two Americans Dennehy and Marvin speak frank American. The actors playing Russians are all from the UK except Pacula who is Polish and kept help her Slavic accent. So by adopting a Brit accent Hurt places himself among the Russians. Dennehy by the way is at the top of his form. Marvin is absolutely magnetic as is Ian Bannon whose readings have the same ironic pitches and stress as Marvin's. You never believe a word he says. The film ends on a noble note. Pacula gets to go to America which as everyone knows is rich democratically pure and free of corruption. Hurt stays behind to save her from being followed and killed by KGB. The novel had a different ending. The hero follows the girl to New York City. They sit down to watch television. The program is one they have never seen before. It's title is The Price is Right. Come on DOWN! The hero says something like THIS is what it's all about? Money? And gets up and goes back to Russia leaving the girl flat.";

	schema:reviewBody "To my amazement several IMDb reviewers seem to have problems with trivial issues such as Russians speaking BritishEnglish or Finland being used as a location in stead of Russia. What is the point of discussing something that was politically unavoidable at the time ? Which western spy movie actually took place in Russia before the Wall came down ? Generally Finland or Austria provided very good alternatives. This is true for Billion dollar brain or Enigma 1983 Wouldn't it be silly to write off every SF movie that is supposed to take place on Mars simply because it was actually filmed on Planet Earth ? Frankly the accentissue too is absurd and irrelevant. I have a feeling some reviewers just want to show the world how observant they are. Whatever the Russians might have spoken they would have found a reason to complain about it. If they would have used NY slang or English with a ridiculous Russian accent they would have made fun of it. And if the Russians actually would have spoken Russian probably the same people would be the first ones to have complained about the color of the subtitles on the snowy landscape or the simplified translations.SPOILER ALERT Curiously enough none of these observant observers seem to have been intrigued by some weak points in Gorky Park's plot. For those who already have seen the movie let's name a few ones 1 The corrupt American fur importer Osborne is supposed to have excellent connections with KGB and the brass of the Militia. So why didn't he ask them to take care of his little problem ? He might even have earned some extra praise by his KGB buddies for having been a finger man for such dangerously deviant individuals as they surely would have been called in those Cold War days. In stead he's doing the bloody work all by himself in a happyhappyHelloweenish way. 2 Osborne goes to great lengths to make identification of the bodies impossible. How he managed to do so without turning the white snow carpet in this remote spot of Gorky Park into a slaughterhouse scene remains a mystery. But OK let's accept he's some kind of artist in this kind of work all his prudence seems to have been superfluous as within a few days the 3 bodies are discovered. 3 Furthermorequite ironically this unusual way of skinning heads and fingers was like a Killroy was heresignature for Renko...4 To make matters even worse Osborne's KGB and militia friends seem to be completely unaware of Renko's stubbornness. They don't make him stop in time his inquiry. This at a time when numerous jokes were told about how tight KGBcontrol were. Or don't you know why the KGB always operated in teams of 3 agents one who could write one who could read and one to keep an eye on those two dangerous intellectuals Still hold on... This is a movie after all And as all reviewers know the rules of the game of watching movies is to be able to not analyze everything so rationally and to allow some part of silliness to pop up now and then. And if you're able to do this in Gorky Park you'll really enjoy this movie. marvelous ! Hurt did a top notch job as the stubborn and honest police man deliberately taking great risks to uncover the truth. Some people found his acting work quite wooden in this movie. Again I'm sure that would he have been more exuberant showing more emotions the same people would have wondered why he was clowning his way through this movie a la Robin Williams. Is it so difficult to understand that he's just portraying a very professional cop the only one with a 100  rate of resolving crimes he has been investigating. He's the son of an even more famous and respected Militia man who could afford frivolities as being not well shaved as Renko's superior complains. If he seems a somewhat 1dimensional character it is just because he's obsessed to do his job as good as his father would have done it. He's probably also very well aware that he's walking on eggs with his investigation. He's not at all sure his superiors will back him all the time and he's understandably tense. I don't know one could go on debating about it and still not convince everyone. To me Hurt found the right balance in playing his role of obstinate but also careful cop. Lee Marvin too was an excellent catch giving Osborne all the arrogance and selfconfidence he needed. The whole support cast too was fine nobody overacting in an irritant way nor anyone lacking flair or talent. The specific angle of the storyline too is special. Not the triple murder part but the fact that this is a US movie about an efficient Russian militia man hunting down a corrupt US business man and killer. See Telefon from 1977 for a similarly surprising plot. If you take into account that Gorky Park was filmed in the era of Reagan's Evil empire rhetoric one will understand how surprising this movie must have been at the time. Finally I was very pleased with the reviews on this movie pointing out to some special cosmetics aspects the special use of make up of it and the one making a link between the social status of the Russians and the different British accents they were using. The top brass indeed sounded somewhat snobbish as they probably would have too if they would have spoken Russian. Once more this underlines how efficient this movie uses whatever it can to lift the quality of it. 3  stars out of 4.".

Encouraged to continue by his superior his suspicions are eventually confirmed but he uncovers a larger plot involving the friend of one of the victims and an American furrier who trades in rare sable pelts.This is my favourite Cold War thriller  despite the fact that it's got nothing to do with the Cold War  based on a great book by Martin Cruz Smith filled with action and intrigue and with a firstrate script by Dennis Potter bursting with dramatic tension and character nuance. Its best feature is the marvellous casting by Mary Selway Hurt is sensational as Renko a brilliantly atypical hero gaunt and palefaced dogged and relentless drab but passionate doublecrossed and always on the receiving end of beatings but indefatigable in his pursuit. He's supported by three great actors the elfin amazinglooking Pacula as the key witness Irina the solid everreliable Dennehy as a New York cop whose brother was one of the victims and the iconic Marvin in one of his last great roles as the decadent furrier out to smash the Russian sable monopoly. The allBritish supporting cast is equally full of great players notably McDiarmid as a creepy professor and comedians Fulton and Sayle as a KGB Major and informant respectively. Made prior to the lifting of the ban on filming in Russia the movie was shot in Helsinki but Paul Sylbert's production design does a fantastic job of putting us in snowy Moscow filled with food lines little Lada cars and Romanov architecture. Even better is James Horner's fabulous driving score which ramps up the tension and batters the viewer into submission at all the key moments. Filled with quotable dialogue when Renko borrows his lawyer friend's gun the friend says It's a lawyer's special issue. It probably won't shoot straight. great scenes rich characters and mesmerising performances this a superb thriller from the sporadicallybrilliant Apted check out his Continental Divide and Gorillas In The Mist as well that is not to be missed.".

He's supported by three great actors the elfin amazinglooking Pacula as the key witness Irina the solid everreliable Dennehy as a New York cop whose brother was one of the victims and the iconic Marvin in one of his last great roles as the decadent furrier out to smash the Russian sable monopoly. The allBritish supporting cast is equally full of great players notably McDiarmid as a creepy professor and comedians Fulton and Sayle as a KGB Major and informant respectively. Made prior to the lifting of the ban on filming in Russia the movie was shot in Helsinki but Paul Sylbert's production design does a fantastic job of putting us in snowy Moscow filled with food lines little Lada cars and Romanov architecture. Even better is James Horner's fabulous driving score which ramps up the tension and batters the viewer into submission at all the key moments. Filled with quotable dialogue when Renko borrows his lawyer friend's gun the friend says It's a lawyer's special issue. It probably won't shoot straight. great scenes rich characters and mesmerising performances this a superb thriller from the sporadicallybrilliant Apted check out his Continental Divide and Gorillas In The Mist as well that is not to be missed.";

	schema:reviewBody "Gorky Park is one of my favorite political thriller and a film I watch regularly. I have never understood why it is not better known and better rated.As is often with Cold War Spy films the system is corrupt on both sides and it's the every day people who pay the price of the greed and dishonesty of those playing the games behind the scene. The only way to survive is to be invisible and never get mixed up in a case that has political ties. William Hurt plays Arkady Renko a Moscow police man who gets one of those cases. Three bodies are found in Gorky Park. Faces and fingertips have been removed and KGB seams to know something about this but they do not want the case. KGB does not like Arkady Renko very much since he has tried to prove their guilt once before and he is sure that they are now out for a revenge. The case is somehow connected to Jack Osborne an American business man played by Lee Marvin.The film does not shy away from criticizing both sides. Not only do the politics come off as hypocritical the whole world of espionage is shown as an inhuman and cruel game of greedy and power hungry opportunists.Some have criticized the film for not capturing the book well enough. It is rather unfair to expect a 2 hour long film to include everything from a 600 page book. A feature film of such a long book is always going to be a shortened version. I think Dennis Potter yes the one and only does a great job of capturing the moral bankruptcy of both systems communism and capitalism. How they are in fact the same. Just a way to keep the little man busy and blind so those in power can get rich by corrupting the system.Not perfect but not far from it.".

Russian is not an easy language to master and true Russians just laugh at their attempts. This movie was refreshing. No one attempted to use accents. In fact most of the actors except for William Hurt were English. Their accents were evident. Alexei Sayle a British comedian was very good as a KGB informant. William Hurt was very good. He played a Russian policeman with a lot of integrity. That was another thing I liked. It wasn't the usual anticommunist propaganda film. It showed things as they really were. People were afraid of the KGB but also looked down upon them. William Hurt was the good guy. The bad guy was an American. The movie was not about political ideology. It was about crime. It was about the corruption in the Soviet Union that led to it's demise. Brian Dennehy was excellent as an American father who at first is very Russophobic but discovers that the bad guys are both Russian and nonRussian. The mystery was very entertaining. The filmmaking was very good. You really thought that you were in eastern Europe. Everything looked so bleak. I think it is an underrated and underappreciated film.".

In the book the differences between the police forces the KGB and politicians were always present. And the worst thing was that the main characters didn't feel like real people at all. They were just like dolls moving and opening their mouths to read their lines from the script. Nobody seemed to have any kind of personality. I couldn't understand how a genius like Dennis Potter writer of the movie could have turned such a good book into garbage like this.The main reason I still bother to see this movie is the fact that the movie was filmed here in my home town Helsinki Finland. You know in 1983 it wasn't possible for an American film group just to go and shoot a movie behind the Iron Curtain. It's fun to see familiar places as parts of Moscow a red star on the top of the National Museum and so on. This is why I recommend this movie to other Finns.

	schema:reviewBody "Gorky Park 1983Wow this is a clunky movie. First of all where did William Hurt think he could pull off an English accent? And why since he's playing a Russian police detective does he need one? It'll make your skin crawl once you notice.The twist of a spy movie being shown from the RussianSoviet side is clever and the cold winter the Russian garb the lousy cars and great architecture on and on make for an interesting movie on some level. And the plot if you can give a hoot is a convoluted tale of the usual convoluted intrigues with these new Russian winter twists. Three bodies found under the snow have no faces this we learn in the first minutes. An American seems to be involved maybe two. Lee Marvin makes an appearance now and then and he has that Lee Marvin presence thankfully though this makes Hurt look especially weak. I usually like Hurt's laid back quality but it's badly placed here. So Michael Apted the director has some reason for going along with all these casting choices and he certainly is responsible for the filming routine and acting choppy and at times pathetic and emphasis on dull lighting banal camerawork and functional editing. There are sensations like faces being eaten away by maggots and lots of gloomy snowy scenes which are good but it's not enough. And the music and sound effects pound in with unusual volume as if to emphasize the lack of real drama in the plot. It's also ironic that the portion of Tchaikowsky's 1812 Overture used over and over is the French part not the Russian one. Indicative of the dull wits at play here.Beyond handing John Hurt badly a tiny but salient example of the awkward direction is when Hurt finishes looking at a picture 52 minutes in and then he doesn't just set it down he turns it around and sets it down so it's right side up for the camera. A few minutes later a couple of good bit actors scrape snow off the windshield and all the other cars in the lot don't have snow on them. Hmmm. Such is the movie in the plot motivations as well with people in dire situations doing improbable things. If logic matters to you.Gorky Park is not a miserable failure and it has some exciting espionage moments and some convincing acting on the edges a ravishing but lifeless love interest played by Joanna Pacula in her breakout role some glimpses of sables the animal but after all there are many more interesting movies of this kind better in every way. And without Hurt's perfectly terrible effort.".

The root of the film is about the desperacy of some communistimprisoned Russian citizen's to be free and going to great lengths to achieve the American dream even if it meant risking their lives for an empty promise. Three people who get murdered risk it all for the promise of a better tomorrow in the freedomland...even when Irina played well by beautiful Polish actress Joanna Pacula is told that her friends have been killed she continues to believe that they are out as she says. She admits that she would rather believe a fantasy lie promised by the murderer than the horrible truth that she might be stuck in her mother country for the rest of her life....where the biggest corruption sits in the government.

	schema:reviewBody "Blonde Venus unfortunately turned out to be the one and only collaboration of Marlene Dietrich and Cary Grant. Sad to say though Grant was not the lead here just the other man who comes between Marlene and husband Herbert Marshall. There's no real chemistry in this one between any of the principal players and the best scenes are with Marlene and little Dickie Moore playing her son with Marshall.The best thing about Blonde Venus are Marlene's musical numbers and they're memorable because of the inimitable way she puts over a song. All Dietrich fans should treasure her Hot Voodoo number where Marlene has a gorilla suit on and does a sexy strip out of that costume and gives us a look at voodoo can do to us.But when its not showing Dietrich's legs off and her husky singing the film is the story of a woman in love with two men. Husband Herbert Marshall is a research scientist who contracts 'radium poisoning' and needs money to go to Europe for a cure. Dietrich gets the money by doing some entertaining in a seedy dive where she comes to the attention of wealthy playboy Cary Grant. From there the plot progresses to the inevitable Hollywood conclusion with a script that was written by Joseph Von Sternberg who directed the film as well.Paramount was taking a shot in the dark here with radium poisoning gambit. The plain truth is they didn't know a whole lot about radioactivity then. The discoverer of radium Marie Curie did in fact die of cancer contracted from too much exposure to it. But one didn't just go somewhere for a miracle cure for that sort of thing.Herbert Marshall was always playing the injured party it seems in a whole lot of his films. He's well remembered for being Bette Davis's husband in The Little Foxes a much better film than Blonde Venus. I also remember him in When Ladies Meet where he was cheating on Greer Garson with Joan Crawford and he went through the film with an air of innocence that you would think he was the party offended. Marshall had these roles down pat but he had more to him in his acting repertoire.Even before The Code was put in place Paramount had a lot of trouble with the Hays Office in getting this one exhibited. Some changes were made that no doubt weakened the plot and the story. Marlene is basically in love with two guys at the same time and that was a no go back in the day.Blonde Venus didn't do that well at the box office it was quite a let down from her previous film Shanghai Express. After this one she and Joseph Von Sternberg were separated and she did her next film Song of Songs with Rouben Mamoulian.Blonde Venus is great Dietrich who's asked to carry a weak story.".

Cary Grant just on the cusp of becoming a major film star plays a powerful political boss whose arrogance mellows as he pursues Dietrich's affections.Little Dickie Moore one of the OUR GANG members is terrific as the infant son who is the bridge between Dietrich  Marshall.

The latter is handled in a very early 20s European style reminiscent of the heady days of Maurice Tourneur.  The modern American sequences are too static though and the story is just a superficial melodrama that doesn't involve me too much.  Cary Grant plays his early character type from the Mae West films with far less interesting results.  One thing that is cool is that the club sequences give one an idea of what Dietrich's famous cabaret style might have been like.".

All of the principals including the director were born in Europe. For some reason it is my personal favorite and the only one I enjoy watching repeatedly. Probably this is for the outrageous musical numbers which display Dietrich's incredibly selfassured command of her environment what can top Hot Voodoo but I really really love the glittering white tophat and tails number particularly. This would have been the only time during filming that von Sternberg could not totally exercise his robotic direction of her she gets to be more herself as a real performer and her energylevel comes way up. Also I'd venture that since the story is set in the U.S. it makes it more challenging to present her as exotic as opposed to say China. I love how von Sternberg plays her character's flight South into increasingly lurid rundown and crude environments. The technical side of moviemaking had made huge strides filmstock was becoming much more uniform and highcontrast and soundrecording had improved greatly in just a few years von Sternberg was able to make full use of this. The film feels snappy and tightlypaced and has mostly abandoned silentfilm mannerisms.In comparison to their next 2 films this one feels quite grounded. The subsequent Scarlett Empress and Devil is a Woman would be increasingly baroque and outrageous excursions into fantastic style excess and European decadence which kind of left their American audiences in the dust  and helped Dietrich land on the infamous boxoffice poison list.This is a preCode film and it routinely tweaks conventional morals. The nightclub in which Dietrich goes to work is clearly a highclass speakeasy Prohibition was still in effect at the time. Also its always a bit confusing for modern audiences when dollaramounts are mentioned in old films. The personal check which Dietrich receives from Cary Grant is for 200 as I recall in current dollars that would be something more like 2500 and was an amount which would have set Depressionera audiences reeling with its clear implication of what Grant had received in return!This is the first chance Cary Grant had to do a major costarring role and its the earliest of his films available on video. Another IMDb comment mentions Dietrich and Mae West supposedly falling in love with him which is a laugh! Dietrich in her daughter's bio referred to him as the shirtseller Grant was selling men's shirts at the studio as a sideline to make extra money West preferred to put it delicately men who were a little more red meat I think that Grant was already living with Randolph Scott at the time of filming they used to attend Hollywood Alist parties as a couple which Scott could get away with partially because of his very blueblood East Coast family connections.Originally available on LaserDisc as a 2disc set with Shanghai Express.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was captivated by this film and genuinely surprised. After having seen MOROCCO just before on a DVD set both films were part of I gained a great new appreciation for the magnetism and the acting prowess of Marlene Dietrich. The ape suit transformation scene was marvelous but I was disappointed in her lackluster singing efforts. Is this the woman who made such a mark in singing Falling in Love Again in THE BLUE ANGEL I wondered. The Little Rascal playing her son was winning and the nude swimming opener was a welcome surprise. I also gained a greater appreciation for the talents of the famed director. The segue way from her suitor's pick up line at the lake to marriage in New York City some five years later for example was sharp and impressive along with the many mood shots Josef von Sternberg was famous for such as the somewhat hitthevieweroverthehead close shots of the husband in silhouette reflecting his changed attitude as trouble brewed in the marriage.I wanted to concentrate more upon the bothersome ending however. Of course the need for a Hollywood happy ending might well have been the culprit for why the resolution turned out the way it did. But here we had Marlene in the form of her character Helen and her husband Herbert Marshall's Ned clearly in love throughout the film until he had to go away. Just before he goes away Marlene asks Ned if he loves her which perhaps displays doubtinsecurity in her a question which prompts shock from Ned as of course he loves her.Once Ned is away getting treatment in Europe Marlene admits it is hard not to like her new suitor Nick. What's not to like? He's a millionaire showering Marlene with generous gifts and he's the dashing Cary Grant. As we get to know his character it turns out that he is very genuine not at all the user type that we have come to expect from wealthy cads. And he's admirably upfront with her when the husband issue comes up. Do you still love him? he asks. He's my husband she replies. Not very convincing is it? She even elaborates that the reason why she must stay with the husband is that he is weak not strong like Nick. Again we get a strong confirmation that Marlene's heart no longer belongs as strongly to Ned.After Ned learns the bitter truth of her wife's indiscretions he is very cruel with her. He beats her over the head with comments such as I suppose I should thank you for saving my life. He doesn't know whether Marlene's feelings for Ned have shifted at this point of first revelation and yet he's so hurt and selfish it doesn't even occur to him to figure out the great sacrifice she has made for him. From this exchange we learn that his love for her had limits. Even if he felt hurt for Marlene's having cheated on him if he was so head over heels for her as first established the odds are he could not have stayed mad for long.After abducting the kid the wanted posters give her age as 2023 by the way which would have made her 1518 at the swimming hole and giving him up Marlene hits rock bottom odd for her not to have gone flying back into the arms of Nick at this point perhaps her feelings for him were superficial and builds her career up until the chance encounter with Ned in a Paris revue where she has once again become a sensation. Once again they hook up. Ned's love never wavered Marlene says at first she can't go on the boat with him obligated to the solid bookings as she is. At the last minute she changes her mind and an engagement is announced in the newspaper.Now Nick is such a beautiful guy  he already had developed a sincere affection for the kid as we witnessed in scenes past  he insists on Marlene's finally seeing her boy again. Husband Ned had forbidden it. It is at this point where we are faced with the deplorably sappy and unrealistic ending where husband and wife wind up with each other again.Not to say it couldn't happen in such a way. But given the strong evidence that husband and wife had lost their love for each other the ending was a huge letdown. What about poor Cary Grant's Nick who behaved as a true dream man with Marlene and whom Marlene left at the altar? What a strong parallel to the suitor in MOROCCO who also was tossed aside... but he was no compared to rival Gary Cooper in that film prize as a macho man and it was clearly established he worshipped Marlene a severe case of unrequited love.In MOROCCO Marlene's character boasted that she never changes her mind only to demonstrate a profound mindchange in that film's sensational finale. We all know it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind but does she ever do it in a particularly irrational and cruel manner at the end of BLONDE VENUS.".

How many times will God  and even the devil himself  his brow contracted a smile to hear men say This is mine She's mineHe's mine. When will we understand that all have diminishing the love? If it restricts your freedom not for your sake but because I need you... and so is my love. Who cares if you're not happy as long as I'm happy! I will compensate you somehow. What can I do if the world is full of interesting people! But as you're concerned the only only that may be interested is me. You leave or I'll kill you if you are unfaithful... but do you know? I too how many times I've wanted to tell you the infidel!... And I would confess that sometimes I have been thinking million times! word hundreds of times! and work a few times.On a planet with millions of beautiful and interesting beings how one person belong to? How do swear that I will be yours? Illusory promises! We are a couple standing in a bucket full of lies. Problems tantrums separation... raged in the day to day because of the possession. What is that you can own? Become well this question. Someone I can have? I would allow someone who owns me? Every time you flow and generate ideas feelings words actions... Can someone own have except occasionally all you are? Blonde Venus is a nice movie that I have moved to these reflections. It is the story of a woman who loves her husband but wanting to help she meets another man who is sexy gallant generous rich and no possessiveness. He gives all of himself and is happy to have her what she wants to give. And when he feels she wants to return to the other he walks away. No calls no require no charges... just accept.

How many times will God  and even the devil himself  his brow contracted a smile to hear men say This is mine She's mineHe's mine. When will we understand that all have diminishing the love? If it restricts your freedom not for your sake but because I need you... and so is my love. Who cares if you're not happy as long as I'm happy! I will compensate you somehow. What can I do if the world is full of interesting people! But as you're concerned the only only that may be interested is me. You leave or I'll kill you if you are unfaithful... but do you know? I too how many times I've wanted to tell you the infidel!... And I would confess that sometimes I have been thinking million times! word hundreds of times! and work a few times.On a planet with millions of beautiful and interesting beings how one person belong to? How do swear that I will be yours? Illusory promises! We are a couple standing in a bucket full of lies. Problems tantrums separation... raged in the day to day because of the possession. What is that you can own? Become well this question. Someone I can have? I would allow someone who owns me? Every time you flow and generate ideas feelings words actions... Can someone own have except occasionally all you are? Blonde Venus is a nice movie that I have moved to these reflections. It is the story of a woman who loves her husband but wanting to help she meets another man who is sexy gallant generous rich and no possessiveness. He gives all of himself and is happy to have her what she wants to give. And when he feels she wants to return to the other he walks away. No calls no require no charges... just accept. THIS IS CALLED LOVE! This is how he truly loves.Legitimate husband in contrast takes revenge on her leaves and stalks to remove your child you bitter and puts on a face an opportunistic world that becomes cold as an iceberg.

	schema:reviewBody "BLONDE VENUS Paramount 1932 is in no way a science fiction story nor an original screenplay remade as QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE 1958 but a melodrama starring Marlene Dietrich under the direction with original story by Josef Von Sternberg. A precode soap opera commonly found during the Depression era it revolves around a faithful wife sacrificing everything for the sake of her husband even to the point of an illicit affair prostitution and falling victim of circumstance through a series of misunderstandings. For Dietrich's fifth of her seven films under Von Sternberg's stern direction this was reportedly their first box office flop. In spite of that it's become one of their more interesting collaborations.Plot summary Edward Ned Faraday Herbert Marshall is a young chemist traveling in Germany with his students one of them the very familiar Sterling Holloway as Joe. After coming across a beautiful German girl Marlene Dietrich skinny dipping in the pond with her friends he takes such an interest in her that he returns to America with Helen as his wife. Settling in a New York City apartment their union produces a son named Johnny Dickie Moore. All goes well until Ned having worked years on his experiments discovers that he's been contaminated with radium poisoning with as much as eight months to live. Although advised by his doctor Morgan Wallace to seek immediate treatment from a specialist in Europe he's unable to come up with 1500 for his needed expenses but thanks to Helen she acquires a job through theatrical agent Ben Smith Gene Morgan returning to her former profession as a cabaret singer working at Dan O'Connor's Robert Emmett O'Connor night club where she's headlined as Helen Jones The Blonde Venus. An immediate success Helen attracts the attention of Nick Townsend Cary Grant a millionaire playboy who becomes her sole support. After bidding farewell to Ned as he leaves by boat for Europe Helen takes Johnny and moves in with Townsend becoming his mistress. When Ned returns home before time he discovers the truth about Helen and no longer wants any part of her. As Ned goes through the process of divorce demanding custody of their son Helen runs away with Johnny starting a long journey through various states landing odd jobs and being just one step ahead of of a detective Sidney Toler hot on her trail.Although Dietrich played cabaret singers and entertainers many times on screen to take advantage of her musical talents BLONDE VENUS offers her a rare opportunity playing both wife and mother. On the musical program however Dietrich gets to sing and perform in such numbers as Hot Voodoo You Little SoandSo both written by Sam Coslow and Ralph Rainger and I Couldn't Be Annoyed by Leo Robin and Richard Whiting. Of the three tunes Hot Voodoo is most memorable with bizarre touches with Dietrich entering center stage in gorilla suit surrounded by black natives then slipping out of her costume wearing a fuzzy blonde wig. As for I Couldn't Be Annoyed set in a Paris cabaret Dietrich wears a white tuxedo and top hot.When BLONDE VENUS was presented on commercial television from the 1960s to 1980s all circulating prints began abruptly following the opening credits with a ship docking New York harbor followed by Helen Dietrich bathing her little boy Moore and then husband Marshall entering a doctor's office notifying him of his serious condition with radium poisoning. It wasn't until the mid 1980s where the deleted fadein of Faraday's meeting with Helen in a suggestive skinny dipping sequence was restored to its original 94 minute length and shown intact for the first time in years on cable stations as The Movie Channel 1991 Turner Classic Movies 2001 as well as video cassette 1990s and finally DVD.With Dietrich supported by a couple of British actors it seemed odd for both Marshall and Grant playing Americans though their backgrounds are not really fully established. This matter might have been resolved had the plot been set in England. Other members of the cast include Rita LaRoy as Taxi Belle Hooper Cecil Cunningham and Louise Beavers.While portions of BLONDE VENUS may appear to be borrowing from Leo Tolstoy's literary novel ANNA KARENINA with the devoted wife losing both husband and custody of a son she so dearly loves for her involvement with another man it breaks away from Tolstoy moving to a different direction according to Von Sternberg that actually develops into a presentable story. Although the pacing is slow and repetitive with actors speaking in lowkey manner for example who could forget little Johnny repeatedly asking to hear the bedtime story on how his parents met in Germany before going to sleep as well as the Von Sternberg visual style of interesting camera shots super imposing montage effects dark images and closeups on the principles frequent underscoring complimemts of Oscar Potoker and most of all the Blonde Venus herself Dietrich.

	schema:reviewBody "Josef Von Sternberg's films of the 1930s are some of the most unique ever made. Sternberg was one of the most promising directors of the 1920s but of course there was a paradigm shift with the advent of sound near the end of the decade causing most filmmakers to abandon the experimental cinematic techniques so instrumental to the most successful silent films. Dialogue heavy films in which visuals took a backseat to plot and characterization became the norm. Sternberg seems to have been the only director to integrate sound successfully into his normal filmmaking routine without completely changing his style. Thus in a film like Blonde Venus Sternberg still employed his slick editing techniques and Impressionistic camera tricks such as superimpositions. As simple as this sounds it's quite offputting to see a film like this when expecting the relatively primitive filmmaking techniques of the popular films of the 1930s. While Sternberg naturally evolved his style and progressed through the '30s in his own way nearly every other filmmaker regressed to a more stagy film style. It's for this reason that Sternberg's films of the 1930s look so different this is an offshoot of film evolution that unfortunately didn't have much influence on contemporary films what you see when you watch Sternberg's films from this era is the style that films could have moved toward if the retreat to the old dramatic forms hadn't occurred. So what makes Blonde Venus offputting? Well in spite of its relative lack of length it's only ninetyminutes long a lot of ground is covered in this film. There's a love triangle established early on which is resolved almost before it's fully formed and the plot doesn't slow down as a character goes from riches to rags and becomes a fugitive from justice in just a few moments in fact things just speed up from there and in twenty minutes or so there's a manhunt that stretches across several states several close brushes with the law and a dramatic showdown about child custody before the character hits bottom heads to Europe and quickly vaults back to riches again. This is the sort of plot that would never be told in less than twice this amount of time today in fact I've seen entire seasons of television shows with less plot packed into them. Throughout all this Sternberg's visual panache guarantees the viewer's interest and at the same time narrative coherence is easily maintained. There's even some good thematic material here about selfsacrifice and women's roles in the period. Like most of Sternberg's films from this decade Blonde Venus offers an embarrassment of riches when compared to its contemporaries in spite of a pacing style that will be difficult for viewers used to non Sternberg films for this era to adjust to. For a viewer with a bit of context this is a wonderful glimpse at what film could have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "067 Blonde Venus 1932  released 9161932 viewed 61806.BIRTHS Patsy Cline.KEVIN This was a very interesting movie hence the lengthy review. Our third Von SternbergDietrich collaboration we missed 'Shanghai Express' is in a sense another step in Dietrich's screen persona. We've seen her go from indifferent seductress to romantic siren. Now we see her as a mother. Here she plays Helen a nightclub singer turned housewife to Ned Faraday Herbert Marshall. The deviously dysfunctional adventures begin when Ned becomes poisoned and must leave for a lengthy treatment while Helen goes back to work at the nightclubs to pay for his treatment and support their young son Johnny Dickie Moore. Things get really interesting when she develops an intense relationship with suave millionaire Nick Townsend 28yearold Cary Grant! who promises to pay for her husband's treatment. When Ned returns he soon learns of his wife's affair and demands that she leave him and her son. She immediately takes the boy and goes on the run doing everything possible to stay ahead of the Missing Persons Bureau and to keep her son oblivious to the impossibility of her life. The three main characters Dietrich Marshall and Grant are each heroic and villainous at the same time. Their actions can be construed as evil but their motivations suggest otherwise. Or vice versa. Ned pays for her husband's treatment but knowingly draws her away from her spouse. Helen kidnaps her son yet sacrifices her well being and her happiness to keep him safe. When her husband finally gets him back he does everything to make the boy forget his mother. The ending seems abrupt but I liked it. It's a shame we don't see which path these characters choose but I believe that the point is that their consciences have become clear along with the truth of their love. Whether they still truly love each other and can ever be happy together again is unclear and doubtful but the impact of the emotional event was such that I was not let down one bit when the film ended.DOUG I was looking forward to watching the more famous 'Shanghai Express' but that wasn't out on DVD. 'Blonde Venus' ended up on the list instead and I worried that it wouldn't end up being worth watching for the Marlene Dietrich experience. Good news It absolutely is. She's at the top of her game here in pretty much every scene and she plays the character beautifully varying between loving mother and sexy cabaret singer. The key is that while she is a great mother and a faithful wife she loves to perform something her husband and her benefactor can't quite understand about her. Which brings us to the debut of Cary Grant. Just as Gary Cooper made a splash for the more or less first time working with Dietrich in 'Morocco' so now does Grant here. He exudes most of the charm that made him famous with somewhat less of the virtue. This film is pure preCode An opening scene where Dietrich and some other girls are skinnydipping really! is especially memorable. The film contains some iconic scenes such as Dietrich in the white tailed coat in contrast to her black one from 'Morocco'. She is the very definition of charisma as she sings. In contrast to 'The Blue Angel' it is now Dietrich's turn to play a character in a downward spiral after her husband kicks her out of the house she is living on the street trying to make the best for her son without letting him know how hard it is to get it. Herbert Marshall plays the husband. His character is a tricky balance indeed at first he's the victim then he's kind of the villain he pulls this highwire act very well so we never really hate him for anything he does. He reminded me very much of Laurence Harvey with his voice and manner. We're seeing him in our very next movie 'Trouble in Paradise' where HE'S the star! Last film Love Me Tonight 1932. Next film Trouble in Paradise 1932.".

Our third Von SternbergDietrich collaboration we missed 'Shanghai Express' is in a sense another step in Dietrich's screen persona. We've seen her go from indifferent seductress to romantic siren. Now we see her as a mother. Here she plays Helen a nightclub singer turned housewife to Ned Faraday Herbert Marshall. The deviously dysfunctional adventures begin when Ned becomes poisoned and must leave for a lengthy treatment while Helen goes back to work at the nightclubs to pay for his treatment and support their young son Johnny Dickie Moore. Things get really interesting when she develops an intense relationship with suave millionaire Nick Townsend 28yearold Cary Grant! who promises to pay for her husband's treatment. When Ned returns he soon learns of his wife's affair and demands that she leave him and her son. She immediately takes the boy and goes on the run doing everything possible to stay ahead of the Missing Persons Bureau and to keep her son oblivious to the impossibility of her life. The three main characters Dietrich Marshall and Grant are each heroic and villainous at the same time. Their actions can be construed as evil but their motivations suggest otherwise. Or vice versa. Ned pays for her husband's treatment but knowingly draws her away from her spouse. Helen kidnaps her son yet sacrifices her well being and her happiness to keep him safe. When her husband finally gets him back he does everything to make the boy forget his mother. The ending seems abrupt but I liked it. It's a shame we don't see which path these characters choose but I believe that the point is that their consciences have become clear along with the truth of their love.

However because of a few very interesting moments which I'll soon talk about it's still worth seeingparticularly for lovers of old films and film historians.The modern aspects about the film occur all at the beginning. Despite a stereotype that sex was pretty much invented in movies in the 1960s raunchy and racy scenes were alive and well when BLONDE VENUS was filmed. These socalled PreCode films often reveled in nudity offcolor plots and violencethings that would be eliminated or sanitized when the mid1930s and the new Production Code was enacted mostly due to flagging ticket sales and an outcry about the content of these risqu films. Being PreCode the film starts with a lot of gratuitous nudityperhaps pretty tame by today's standards but pretty shocking nonetheless. Marlene Dietrich and her ladyfriends are skinnydipping when Herbert Marshall and his friends happen upon them. In the process the viewers are shown glimpses of breasts and buttocksas seen through strategicallyplaced tree branches. This really is a fascinating scene and oddly really doesn't fit into the rest of the film. In other words after this swimming scene the film abruptly changes and announces that Marshall and Dietrich were married. This lack of a decent transition is a minor problem but can be overlooked.From this point on the film really seems to creak with age! The plot is at times racy as Dietrich uses sex to pay for her husband's needed medical treatment abroad but also very very much grounded in extreme melodrama and occasional overactingsomething much more common in this era than with later films. The exact reasons and all are probably best left for you to learn yourselfI don't want to spoil the film.However there is one totally amazing scene you MUST see about 13 of the way into the film. Ms. Dietrich is forced to return to the stage because the family is practically bankrupt. As a result she sings and dances several times throughout the film. However the first dance number is amazingly bizarreso strange that it is a must see for movie historians. The night club has an African native dance scene where the girls are all dressed in silly costumes with HUGE afro wigs. Then in chains Marlene in a gorilla suit is led onto the stage!! The suit by the way was awfully realistic compared to those I've seen in many films. Anyways she then slowly does a partial striptease and dons here own blonde afro wig and begins singing HOT VOODOOa very silly song that is just too amazing to miss. Unfortunately though in this and all the other songs her voice is consistently drowned out by the musicthe balance just wasn't even close to being right.Overall for those who are not big fans of old films you should skip this oneit won't make you an instant fan and you may find it all very laughable. However there might just be enough of interest to PreCode fans and lovers of kitsch to merit seeing this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marlene Dietrich Cary Grant Herbert Marshall and director Josef von Sternberg ... it's really quite a heavyweight group contributing to 'Blonde Venus'. The film opens with Dietrich meeting Marshall after he happens upon her skinny dipping in a pond in Germany and the next thing you know they're married with a young son Dickie Moore and living in America. The trouble is Marshall needs medical treatment that can only be obtained in Germany and when she takes a job in a nightclub to help raise some money she catches the eye of a rich playboy Cary Grant. The two have an affair and when Marshall discovers it upon returning and threatens getting custody of their son Dietrich flees with the boy.There are several wonderful moments and despite the flaws in the film they carried the day for me. You have of course von Sternberg's tight shots on his actors and the effects with shadows he employs and with these stars you get that larger than life feeling. I loved Dietrich's conflicted conversations with Grant about still loving her husband and her remorse and honesty with him when he returns ending with the line I'm here if you'll have me which she delivers so perfectly with such power in her simplicity. She also has a wonderfully understated scene at the train station when she must give up the boy a heartbreaking and emotional moment which is amplified by her stillness. Of course he's right to consider divorcing her but we see the double standard in play  she's a loving mother a dutiful wife works to provide income but it seems it's more unforgiveable for her to have committed adultery than it would be for a man and to use her sexuality to help get by. Men are like wolves who circle  the owner of a diner who leers while saying You going to wash my dishes? with a lascivious hint and the policeman following her who she feels she must seduce What are you doing down here big boy?.It's great to see Cary Grant at 28 in his first year of filmmaking and he plays the bad guy well. Herbert Marshall has some nice moments too including the confrontation with Grant towards the end in which he says I can throw money around the same as you can with power in that fine polished accent of his. Lastly it was nice seeing Hattie McDaniel in a few scenes.The biggest problem with the film is the musical number 'Hot Voodoo' which opens with white women in blackface dancing out with a gorilla. The racism it represents is indefensible and my heart sank when I saw it. Dietrich of course emerges from the gorilla suit and sings lines that titillate Hot voodoo burn my clothes I want to start dancing just wearing a smile as well as make us cringe That African tempo has made me a slave. Any other criticism of the film pales in comparison to that but I thought the middle of it lost momentum as well and the ending was a little syrupy. I may be rounding up a bit here and I'd only recommend it with reservations but all in all I enjoyed it.".

She also has a wonderfully understated scene at the train station when she must give up the boy a heartbreaking and emotional moment which is amplified by her stillness. Of course he's right to consider divorcing her but we see the double standard in play  she's a loving mother a dutiful wife works to provide income but it seems it's more unforgiveable for her to have committed adultery than it would be for a man and to use her sexuality to help get by. Men are like wolves who circle  the owner of a diner who leers while saying You going to wash my dishes? with a lascivious hint and the policeman following her who she feels she must seduce What are you doing down here big boy?.It's great to see Cary Grant at 28 in his first year of filmmaking and he plays the bad guy well. Herbert Marshall has some nice moments too including the confrontation with Grant towards the end in which he says I can throw money around the same as you can with power in that fine polished accent of his. Lastly it was nice seeing Hattie McDaniel in a few scenes.The biggest problem with the film is the musical number 'Hot Voodoo' which opens with white women in blackface dancing out with a gorilla. The racism it represents is indefensible and my heart sank when I saw it. Dietrich of course emerges from the gorilla suit and sings lines that titillate Hot voodoo burn my clothes I want to start dancing just wearing a smile as well as make us cringe That African tempo has made me a slave. Any other criticism of the film pales in comparison to that but I thought the middle of it lost momentum as well and the ending was a little syrupy. I may be rounding up a bit here and I'd only recommend it with reservations but all in all I enjoyed it.";

Jumping between Manhattan and Fire Island vignettes carry us from the itcouldn'thappentome mentality of the early days of the disease to the invasive effect it has had on all of our lives today. The title of the film comes from the New York Times' refusal to acknowledge homosexual relationships in their obituary section during this period.

WRONG. I stuck with the film and probably have to rate this as one of my top 10 movies ever. WOW did this film floor me! It follows a group of gay friends and lovers and a hetero gal palthrough the AIDS plagued 80's decade. This film is truly written with insight and compassion. I found all the characters interesting and realistic with the actors portraying them excellently as well especially Campbell Scott and Bruce Davidson. The scene with Davidson bringing his lover to his death is heartfelt and emotional but the scene at the end with the 3 survivors walking now on a silent deserted Fire Island beach as all their friendsand others who died from AIDS milling about as they remembered them brought a lot of tears to my eyes. It is how all of us as humans try to remember those we love who have passed. I recommend this movie to all people both gay and straight because it is a film that transcends these labels and speaks to us as just humansall in this mystery called life as one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following in the footsteps of AN EARLY FROST here is yet another film with an AIDS theme to reckon with.  Unlike FORST which actually dealt with a gay couple and their parents this deals with the gay community and several lover relationships.   What I like about this film and I did like FROST was the honesty in telling the story of relationships. We are introduced to a group of gay friends and their mates who spend much time together in vacationing on Fire Island the gay resort and in the hospital visitng each other when stricken with the unknown disease that has become a plague amongst us today.  The actors brought their own individual depth to each character.  I couldn't find a bad performance in the lot. Notably Bruce Davison stands out.  He brings such an understanding and compassion to his work.  You really believe him as he becomes his partner's companion in the last days of his life. The scene when he tells him it's okay to leave was awesome.  How can you separate the good actors from acknowledgement.  Campbell Scott and Stephen Caffrey Patrick Cassidy and that famous kissing scene on the soap he was acting in gave such a wonderful scene when he's in his lover's hospital room and begins to break down.  The face of his lover as he listens to him cry broke my heart.  John Dossett Mark Lamos and Dermot Mulroney and I'm not sure what actor played what role all gave so much honesty to their work.

	onyx:emotionText "Following in the footsteps of AN EARLY FROST here is yet another film with an AIDS theme to reckon with.  Unlike FORST which actually dealt with a gay couple and their parents this deals with the gay community and several lover relationships.   What I like about this film and I did like FROST was the honesty in telling the story of relationships. We are introduced to a group of gay friends and their mates who spend much time together in vacationing on Fire Island the gay resort and in the hospital visitng each other when stricken with the unknown disease that has become a plague amongst us today.  The actors brought their own individual depth to each character.  I couldn't find a bad performance in the lot. Notably Bruce Davison stands out.  He brings such an understanding and compassion to his work.  You really believe him as he becomes his partner's companion in the last days of his life. The scene when he tells him it's okay to leave was awesome.  How can you separate the good actors from acknowledgement.  Campbell Scott and Stephen Caffrey Patrick Cassidy and that famous kissing scene on the soap he was acting in gave such a wonderful scene when he's in his lover's hospital room and begins to break down.  The face of his lover as he listens to him cry broke my heart.  John Dossett Mark Lamos and Dermot Mulroney and I'm not sure what actor played what role all gave so much honesty to their work.  A great ensemble of players a delicate and honest script about a controversial disease that has by this time taken the lives of millions of young people gay and straight excellent direction and well photographed I highly recommend this to everybody to see.  You'll come away with a different attitude about not only gay life but the killing disease.";

I had my sister watch this movie a devoted Pentecostal she said it was the sadist thing she had ever seen.

She like many never wanted to see past the homosexual thing.

I told her that was the way it I felt it was for many of us dealing with this disease that had taken so many of my friends and colleagues. I also liked how this movie didn't victimize or make a villain out of any of the characters nor did it make anyone a saint either. I felt the topic was handled with good taste considering how it was something most people didn't want to think about. With the majority of the audience being straight and secure in the fact that this only happened to other people who were deserving of what they got. I also felt that this movie showed the truth although a bit Hollywood and too polished not a docudrama definitely a movie it did a good job of making a difficult subject much more palatable and sympathetic to folks that had never had it happen to them or to those they love. The progression of the movie conveyed the feeling most had in regards to how fast things happened. One day someone was here the next they were gone. I also felt that the actors many non gay did brilliant performances not playing stereotype's but keeping it real as it should be. Since most gay men and women I know don't act all that different from everyone else. I for one am tired of gays being portrayed as only hair stylist and drag queens much as I am sure AfricanAmericans were tired of their stereotypes of only being the hired help or as ignorant simpletons. This was not the best movie I have ever seen but I feel it is one of the best dealing with this subject matter. The end of this movie still gets to me every time I see it if only that could happen like that I too just want to be there".

Like other American Playhouse productions the film is simple unpretentious and no less rewarding for being so straightforward. Ren and writer Craig Lucas have wisely resisted the temptation to make a 'Love Story'style terminal illness melodrama concentrating instead on the bittersweet pain and bravery of awkward hospital visitations and quiet deathbed encounters.

	schema:reviewBody "As the famous Blondie ballad The Tide Is High opens Longtime Companions the song got me thinking. The Tide was high for LGBT people in 1981 as we began winning more and more battles for civil rights ordinances in various municipalities across the country. Then life and the tide ebbed radically as a bisexual man brought a virus over from Africa that had been decimating population on that continent and it spread like a prairie fire amongst us. Longtime Companions focuses on the intertwining lives of several gay men and how the plague virus affected both the infected and those around them.I lost so many people in the next 15 or so years I feel like an Ishmael at times left alive to tell the tale. That's what Longtime Companions does it tells the tale of the loss of so much from the most famous names of all like Rock Hudson to the most insignificant in the cosmic scheme of things. How much art music science human freedom name the field could have advanced if these people had lived their allotted normal lifespan. Those who survived and especially those who worked in the field have a responsibility to be Ishmaels.Longtime Companions boasts a great ensemble cast that functions like a well tuned Rolex watch. Some of my favorites are Patrick Cassidy the soap opera hunk who loses his job and eventually his fight for life. Campbell Scott who throws himself into the fight after losing his Longtime Companion. Most of all lovers Bruce Davison and Mark Lamos and there will be no dry eyes as you see Davison guide Lamos from one world to the next.Two things standout for me in the Eighties which decade this film covers about AIDS. The first was in 1983 and my first exposure to someone with the virus. In my working life with New York State Crime Victims Board and after I had come out at work I got a call from a bedridden man in Tribeca whose home health attendant had just robbed him blind of everything and he called us because the cops at New York's 1st precinct refused to go to even take the report. As our office was downtown and my dear friend Ermano Stingo lived there as well we both went to this man's flat a rather dingy place overlooking the Hudson River that was pretty well emptied of most of what was there save this bedridden man with lesions going into his last stage of life. Sad to say both of us saw that sight a lot more over the next decade. I filled out my paper work for a claim witnessed his signature and Ermano went to the 1st precinct to file the report on the victim's behalf. To this day I wish I could recall his name but Ermano is also now in another world.The second thing was the hearings for the New York City gay civil rights law. At the many forums the City Council gave us and our opposition to testify for the bill I remember a lot of the homophobes walking in with surgical masks covering their faces as if that would prevent them from catching the disease from the opposition which they all assumed were sufferers or carriers. How ignorant they were and still are and worse how they did not want to be dissuaded from their firmly held beliefs. A frightening time for all.To understand AIDS and its impact on LGBT people and society as well you have to see Longtime Companions. And this review is dedicated to both my claimant in the Tribeca flat and to the first person that I knew that died of AIDS a bartender named Bobby Lynn who worked in a long since gone gay bar in Brooklyn Heights.".

	schema:headline " We owe them so much!";
	schema:reviewBody "A historical film from the time when AIDS struck New York City right in the core of the big apple its artistic community. It follows the plague from July 3 1981 to July 19 1889 and it shows how the community was disoriented and panicked by this unknown and unheard of disease.It took two years for the word AIDS to become common and to have the first gay kiss on a TV soap opera. They came out on the TV screen and caused more fear than surprise. Surprise would have been good in a way since people would have woken up without a hangover but fear was the hangover.The film concentrates on the gay community and people close to it not on the people around the rest of the society that did not behold but stigmatized. So we do not get the horrible rejection that the gay community lived through at the time. We only follow it from behind gay eyelids.Compassion at first meant there was some hope it could be stopped or cured with antibiotics or something. Then paranoia started settling in the minds like a real cancer in the psyche. It ate the souls and the thinking ability of everyone or nearly because it no longer was a disease but a disease that killed with certainty.The next stop was hypochondria. Gay men started checking themselves and believing they were every single one of them the next victims. They were the hosts of a morbid fascination that injected the death process of their friends into themselves. Morbid empathy that could kill the living spirit of anyone in no time. And yet little by little the tools of some resistance came up from the minds and hands of some volunteers. And It was needed because people with AIDS started being fired because they had no insurance and they found themselves in overcrowded hospitals that did not know how to cope with the problem and only checked more or less the insurance coverage every patient had or did not have and Medicaid was by far not enough even to accompany the beneficiaries to the end.And the absolute blank in which the gay community was for several years made most people unable to see how it was propagated made them believe it was some kind of punishment or curse on the gay community from  What did he say Ronald Reagan at the time? It is not quoted in the film. So they punished themselves with No sex please we may have AIDS. Or even worse No kiss please we may have the virus in our saliva. At this point the film goes down to rock bottom and touches it with the death of Sean slowly hypnotized into letting everything go and dying in peace with no cry without resisting though not without tears and suffering at the loss this death meant for him and for the one he left behind. And David who accompanied him through his last night is buried in his turn fifteen months later and his friends tell him good bye in the church of his affiliation. And we are in June 1987. What the friends say from the pulpit is the first step out of the quagmire the first step forward in the minds of the gay members of this gay community. And now they can start resisting and fighting back and requiring the treatment health care and that is necessary for the still living ones to be able to learn how to live with AIDS.Shows are organized to gather support for the sick people and the community demonstrations are set up targeting the health services and the city hall of New York the Mayor in particular. And they clash with the police and they demonstrate again. It seems inconceivable does it? That there was ever a time before all this. When you start forgetting what the past was you start becoming able to look at the future and they did. Remembering is important but certainly not to nostalgically regret what it was.Three survivors are on the Atlantic beach and they get ready for the next demonstration and they speak of a cure and they want to be there when it happens. Then a vision of the whole crowd they used to be runs down onto the beach and they are all there here with the three survivors. The ghosts of course of those who have gone away or maybe the three survivors are already ghosts meeting with those who went before them? A last shot comes back to the three survivors. They want to be there when a cure is found and 25 years later a cure is still not found but you can live with AIDS and rather quite many years now. Thanks to that first generation of pioneers.The film is from 1989. It was sad but also full of hope then and today it is still sad and still full of hope but we are convinced that even in catastrophic situations death is not the only one to win and it can even be defeated.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

It follows the plague from July 3 1981 to July 19 1889 and it shows how the community was disoriented and panicked by this unknown and unheard of disease.It took two years for the word AIDS to become common and to have the first gay kiss on a TV soap opera. They came out on the TV screen and caused more fear than surprise. Surprise would have been good in a way since people would have woken up without a hangover but fear was the hangover.The film concentrates on the gay community and people close to it not on the people around the rest of the society that did not behold but stigmatized. So we do not get the horrible rejection that the gay community lived through at the time. We only follow it from behind gay eyelids.Compassion at first meant there was some hope it could be stopped or cured with antibiotics or something. Then paranoia started settling in the minds like a real cancer in the psyche. It ate the souls and the thinking ability of everyone or nearly because it no longer was a disease but a disease that killed with certainty.The next stop was hypochondria. Gay men started checking themselves and believing they were every single one of them the next victims. They were the hosts of a morbid fascination that injected the death process of their friends into themselves. Morbid empathy that could kill the living spirit of anyone in no time. And yet little by little the tools of some resistance came up from the minds and hands of some volunteers. And It was needed because people with AIDS started being fired because they had no insurance and they found themselves in overcrowded hospitals that did not know how to cope with the problem and only checked more or less the insurance coverage every patient had or did not have and Medicaid was by far not enough even to accompany the beneficiaries to the end.And the absolute blank in which the gay community was for several years made most people unable to see how it was propagated made them believe it was some kind of punishment or curse on the gay community from  What did he say Ronald Reagan at the time? It is not quoted in the film. So they punished themselves with No sex please we may have AIDS. Or even worse No kiss please we may have the virus in our saliva. At this point the film goes down to rock bottom and touches it with the death of Sean slowly hypnotized into letting everything go and dying in peace with no cry without resisting though not without tears and suffering at the loss this death meant for him and for the one he left behind. And David who accompanied him through his last night is buried in his turn fifteen months later and his friends tell him good bye in the church of his affiliation. And we are in June 1987. What the friends say from the pulpit is the first step out of the quagmire the first step forward in the minds of the gay members of this gay community. And now they can start resisting and fighting back and requiring the treatment health care and that is necessary for the still living ones to be able to learn how to live with AIDS.Shows are organized to gather support for the sick people and the community demonstrations are set up targeting the health services and the city hall of New York the Mayor in particular. And they clash with the police and they demonstrate again. It seems inconceivable does it? That there was ever a time before all this. When you start forgetting what the past was you start becoming able to look at the future and they did. Remembering is important but certainly not to nostalgically regret what it was.Three survivors are on the Atlantic beach and they get ready for the next demonstration and they speak of a cure and they want to be there when it happens. Then a vision of the whole crowd they used to be runs down onto the beach and they are all there here with the three survivors. The ghosts of course of those who have gone away or maybe the three survivors are already ghosts meeting with those who went before them? A last shot comes back to the three survivors. They want to be there when a cure is found and 25 years later a cure is still not found but you can live with AIDS and rather quite many years now. Thanks to that first generation of pioneers.The film is from 1989. It was sad but also full of hope then and today it is still sad and still full of hope but we are convinced that even in catastrophic situations death is not the only one to win and it can even be defeated.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU";

I will mention that other than the film The Band Played On this film addresses the human issues involved with AIDS or any illness. It has a message without being trite or preachy or melodramatic. This is difficult to pull off if you watch other movies of this genre they often do not ring true or the performances are over the top. This movie makes the audience feel part of it those of us who grew up in the 80's remember the Reagan jokes the first Dynasty episode to address the AIDS issue and so on. There was a lot of denial at this time and I am not so sure there still isn't in some sectors of society.At any rate you should rent or buy this movie if you haven't been able to catch it on cable. I am hard pressed to think of other movies which have addressed this issue in a sensitive realistic way Torch Song Trilogy with Harvey Fierstein and Matthew Broderick was an excellent film but did not address the AIDS issue directly.

	schema:reviewBody "Longtime Companion the title of which is derived from the term used in the obituary columns by man men to describe their relationship with their partners who died of an HIV related illness back in the 1980s. The term many were forced to use as either they didn't want it to be known they were gay or that their relationship simply wasn't recognised in any other way.The story revolves around a group of gay men from interconnecting social circles who frequent Fire Island in New York on the weekends and socialise together. Some of them are in secure relationships others are more promiscuous while others are single and looking for love. When you consider it really no different from your average social group of heterosexuals. In the 1980s of course HIV struck initially very much in the gay community and that's how its effects are felt here as various characters become ill or realise they have friends who are in the same boat. Some handle it better than others offering their friends the love and support they need to get through it while some find the issue harder to cope with.This film is very much the impact of HIV seen through a microscope on just one group of people it doesn't have the scale of And The Band Played On but it's not covering those issues. It concerns itself with the direct impact on the gay community and one group of friends. It's hard not to feel their pain and helplessness and the shadow is cast over them while they struggle to cope with events and an illness they don't understand. In many ways its also a love story among the events that are going on  Campbell Scott starts a relationship with Fuzzy Stephen Caffrey while their community is unravelling. The patriarchs of their group David and Shaun played by Bruce Davidson and Mark Lamos try to make sense of it and reassure their friends only to realise they too may have been at risk. The film quickly jumps into 1982 demonstrating how ineffectual the confusing and limited information was for the gay community at the time. As they story develops some people die others get involved and others try and effect change by speaking out but at its heart its still a drama about a group of friends trying to deal with something they cannot comprehend or understand.Acting plaudits should be levelled all round but special mention goes to Bruce Davidson this being the first film I ever saw him in. Dermot Mulroney makes appropriate impact as John one of the first to fall while Michael Schoeffling an actor who was always underrated is in his prime here.As one of the first films to deal with HIV remembering it was made in 1989 this film holds up remarkably well now with a few exceptions a side. Its brave and effecting and is the companion piece to And The Band Played On which gives the wider perspective on the epidemic. In many ways Longtime is the East Coast section that And The Band didn't have the running time for.It shouldn't be viewed as a 'Gay' film even though its about a gay circle of friends And their heterosexual friends because this is as Roger Gail Lyon said  a human issue not a gay issue. An issue that everyone should have knowledge of.".

It was just one of a few heart wrenching scenes. Try not to cry when Bruce Davison always fantastic tells his years sick lover to let go. Oof! I rate any movie by its ability to make me cry. I don't cry easily and so when I do it was some damn fine story telling. No one directly in my life has ever suffered from or died of AIDS. And yet I felt like it was all happening to me. If that isn't the mark of good story telling... well then I don't know what is. Give it a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.";

	schema:headline " Sheds light on the remake but much better";
	schema:reviewBody "I found the remake with Richard Gere and Diane Lane Unfaithful intriguing in the way it explored the erotic pull the woman feels to her lover. It was very good at that. Most of the early scenes especially any with Diane Lane were very well done. Where Gere dominated a scene on the other hand  whether because of his acting or flawed script or direction I couldn't tell  the movie felt phony and forced. Now I know why. Unfaithful tries to exploit Chabrol's powerful storyline but wants to go in its own direction too. For instance the woman in the story is not nearly as central in Chabrol's movie. The story there is really about her husband and his predicament at discovering that his perfect wife is having an affair. The wounded husband is much more believable here and thus the murder scene does not feel as lurid as when Gere bludgeons Martinez in the remake. The method of striking blows to the head is the same yet we understand the meaning of the blows perfectly in Chabrol's original and the scene immediately previous when the rivals meet and discuss the affair in the lover's apartment feels very real and organic in Chabrol though it is still surprising to find that the husband has come to confront the lover. By contrast in the remake Olivier Martinez plays that scene as part civilized troglodyte and part insouciant brat Gere comes off as bordering on schizophrenia or about to suffer a conniption  a cuckold who's so deeroticized that his sudden rage reads more as psychopathy. In a movie that purports to be about a crime of passion the quality of passion feels more like a horror that has gone off kilter somehow. The scene is jarring but not in ways that move the film along.Having seen both movies now I do feel like I at least understand how the story might have seemed a good candidate for a remake. La femme Infidele is so good...It's so good I hardly thought I was watching a movie at all but living in this story right along with the characters albeit as troubled observer. It's a movie about the private conclusions that we come to perhaps selfishly that we don't share even with the people closest to us perhaps because we are ashamed of our darkest feelings those too taboo to admit.There is a sense that the story's protagonists do feel shame somehow even in the embarrassingly relieved way the lover welcomes the visit from the husband but are all too human in the end. There is a sense of desire that emanates from all the characters who all happen to be pretending at playing one game or another while keeping secrets from one another. Even the perfect little boy is shown to be caught up in his own storms to the extent that his role in the movie is as more than a signifier of a healthy prosperous family's bourgeois pride. At one point he explodes at his parents during a tense evening yelling at them that he hates them both.This reading of the self in the throes of a very deep selfish passion  while at the same time trying to maintain appearances  is masterful in Chabrol's movie and I came away from it believing in the reality of these characters completely.I can't seem to put it into words too well but I was very impressed with the understated way this movie examines the tensions that simmer under the surface of family relationships. This is the first movie I have seen by Chabrol and I have to say as someone who's seen my fair share of movies touted as masterpieces that turn out to be middling  my faith in the power of film as a storytelling medium is renewed by this piece.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Versailles the upper class Hlne Stphane Audran and Charles Desvallees Michel Bouquet live a boring and detached life in their comfortable house and their only common interest is their beloved son Michel. Every other day Hlne commutes to Paris and Charles suspects that she might be cheating on him. He hires a private eye and a couple of days later his suspicion is confirmed and the investigator tells that Hlne is having a love affair with the writer Victor Pgala Maurice Ronet and delivers a picture of her lover with his address to him. Charles visits Victor in his apartment in Paris and introduces himself as Hlne's husband and lures him telling that he has an agreement with his wife that tells details of her encounters. Out of the blue Charles hits Victor's head with a statue and kills him. Then he dumps the body in a dirty lake and comes back home. Sooner detectives Duval Michel Duchaussoy and Gobet Guy Marly interview Hlne explaining that Victor is missing and her name is in her address book. When Hlne finds the picture of Victor in the pocket of Charles's jacket she destroys the evidence and learns that her husband loves her. But the police inspectors are coming to their house again to talk to Charles. La Femme Infidle a.k.a. The Unfaithful Wife is another magnificent thriller by the master of suspense Claude Chabrol. The story of a couple with a routine life lacking passion and sex that is revitalized by the adultery of the wife and the murder of her lover by her husband is sort of ironical and tragic. The open conclusion is left to the interpretation of the viewer and is also a trademark of Chabrol. In 2002 Adrian Lyne remade this film without the ambiguity of the original film and including an inexistent moral dilemma as the usual pitiful practice of Hollywood industry. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Not Available".

	schema:headline " Brooding and meditative piece exploring trouble in proposed upperclass paradise as love disenchantment and illfelt notions spawn chaos and frayed morals.";
	schema:reviewBody "The two characters primarily involved in Claude Chabrol's 1969 French thriller The Unfaithful Wife have at least at the beginning rather an idyllic and somewhat pleasant set up in their lives. When we first encounter them we see both the husband and titular wife with their rather extended family in a large garden on a warm sunny and welcoming day the tone of the exchanges polite the activity nothing out of the ordinary nor needlessly extravagant. The opening shots of such imagery are quite crudely broken up by a blurred effect which drowns the screen of its focus the ideal family unit itself thus becoming difficult to firmly latch one's eyes onto the credits begin some rather harsh and somewhat official looking credits that scroll upwards in a military manner whilst some distorting piano music plays overhead. It's a fleeting few minutes or so of idealism inbetween such a sequence the film going on to form a superior mediation on human behaviour masquerading as a causality thriller as paradise is rendered corrupt and peeking beneath the surface of the upperclasses reveals deception and titular unfaithfulness.The film is unrelentingly fascinating a piece never for more than a few seconds ever in the slightest bit uninteresting a grim and somewhat bleak study how love anger and victimisation brew together to create a cocktail of violence and anguish and how that in itself can come to forge a relationship which was never initially set in stone. The film's methodical lead is Michel Bouquet's Charles Desvallees a lawyer with his own office located in a small enough building amidst the bustling Parisian streets away from the large more ruralised country house in which he lives with his family. The family of which is made up of the titular wife a certain Hlne Audran who's about the same age as her husband and is the mother to young son Michel Di Napoli. The warm and welcoming day in the garden spent with Charles' mother and Hlne's inlaw turns into evening Charles' verbal illustrating of various plans he would like to have happen the following day involving both he and Hlne out and about doing things are shot down with casual reasons which excuse Hlne from attending. As they sit and observe a television broadcast later on during the evening the signal begins to break up and the machine ceases to function as well as it might thus further insinuating a breaking down of communication of an operative item and echoing their marriage.At work and aside from Charles' rich circle of friends and busy schedule he observes through young female secretary Brigitte Turri the very essence of temptation. His suspicion brought about by his wife's behaviour and Chabrol's own channelling onto the audience of signs and notions towards an upsetting of a paradiselike set up or the malfunctioning of a working order beginning to resonate. Desperate as thoughts feelings and drama all at once clinically escalate Charles darts to the nearest payphone to call a place of business Hlne said she'd be the piano music from earlier only suggesting at something seriously wrong with what idealism we were seeing beginning to pipe up again to form the overlying soundtrack to the news she is not where she said she'd be.The painful inevitable is confirmed when a private detective Charles hires reveals to him the truth that Hlne is in fact having an affair and with a writer named Victor Pgala Ronet based not so far away. The film allows Charles a moment you sparsely see in today's age of thrillers a moment of contemplation that has him stand beside a river flowing through the urbanised locale in which the reveal was announced so as to merely look across to the other side of it digesting what it is has been exposed to him. It is around about here in the film that Chabrol applies a gear change so dramatic and so effective that it propels the piece beyond its combined brooding roots of paranoia and suspicion and into an echelon of unpredictability horror and human emotion in its some of its rawest forms. In short the switch in tone and content works remarkably the film coming to have Charles journey to the man and see him.The film's causality infused thrills and scares following the venturing into the territory it goes near does nothing to distract the film from its overall tract it is a film that is able to evoke just as much an onedge reaction from its audience following a character's glance or nervous facial reaction as it can from a minor car accident. Chabrol's capturing of some of the interplay towards the conclusion as two people are forced into hiding varying secrets from both one another and the police is fascinating and the film does not loose sight of son Michel's role as the picturesque representative of innocence caught up amidst all this and made to suffer out of others' illgotten decisions. Chabrol's overall ending is decidedly bleak but his conclusion that the two we examine whom previously appeared to fall away from each other only to reconnect when some sort of duality was established is dangerously uplifting given the sorts of events which aided in this and the actions the lovebirds undertook all of it combining to form a superior thriller of an immensely sophisticated ilk.".

Many different things are going on in this movie and one of the reasons Chabrol is admired is his skill in creating and using ambiguity which lures the viewer in requires him to make his own interpretation and thus involves him in the movie much more deeply than would happen with a clear obvious story line.To me what happens between the husband and wife is they both have become disinterested with each other sexually and emotionally the wife takes a lover and as she and we find out the purpose of this later teststaunts her husband to reignite her love for him he must prove that he loves her by doing something outrageous difficult dangerous etc. She might or might not have had this in mind at a conscious level it appears that she did not which makes it even more interesting. He does it  again probably unintentionally  and thus recreates his love and passion for her and hers for him. By accident they have successfully recourted and reconquered each other.This is what it's about and would be regardless of the ending  which Chabrol has againleft ambiguous. Unfortunately the crucial deed that saved the marriage turned out to be a murder so there has to be at least a strong hint that they won't get away scot free.An irritatingly slow movie for quite a while but ultimately very well done and rewarding for the viewer.".

	schema:headline " An excellent showcase of suspense cinema!";
	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol is sometimes known as 'The French Hitchcock' and while the two didn't exactly make the same type of thriller it's easy to see where the comparisons come from and both of these great directors are masters of their crafts! This is only the third Chabrol film I've seen but once again I'm extremely impressed and looking forward to seeing more! Though I have limited experience of his films Chabrol's thrillers to me are more brooding and personal than Hitchcock's and while they lack the brazen thriller element that made most of Hitchcock's oeuvre so good to watch it's made up for in panache and intrigue! The Unfaithful Wife puts its focus on an upper class French family in a big mansion somewhere just outside of a big city. We follow them for a short while until it becomes obvious to the husband that his wife's constant trips into town are a clue that she is having an affair. The husband then decides to hire a private detective to investigate his wife and after having his fears concerned the husband turns up at the lover's house with murder in mind...The film appears to be so relaxed that at times you may wonder whether you are actually watching a thriller. But that is what makes this film so effective Chabrol often lets his film settle but there is always tension bubbling beneath the surface and the film is always intriguing even when there is little going on. I won't spend too long talking about the acting and production values as obviously both are thoroughly professional and give the film infinite amounts of credibility. Most of the action focuses on the couple inside their big house and this benefits the film greatly as we soon get to know the characters. The central scene is clearly the murder sequence although again Chabrol focuses on the build up rather than the actual pay off and the murder is as cold and brutal as it was obviously intended to be. The Unfaithful Wife is clearly a lesson in how suspense cinema should be even more subtle than Hitchcock this film manages to be constantly fascinating in spite of the fact that not a great deal transpires over the course of the film and once again it's another great film on Chabrol's resume!".

	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol is a director who has a vast and reputedly hit or miss career as one of the Cashiers du cinema alumni and his film La Femme Infidele could possibly be counted as one of the top crop of his work. There's a control over misenscene as might be expected as he puts forth unexpectedly and hilariously in a song that plays from a car stereo at one point it's French that is precise observant but also never overtly manipulative it's almost so heldback emotionally that whenever a character seems to emote it's either through deception or by just the tip of the iceberg seeping through. This makes it all the more powerful particularly because of how the ending doesn't really resolve anything except that these characters are doomed with each other. I'm in love with you like mad says the husband Charles Michel Bouguet perfect at that very understated sincere and almost sinister approach to relating to people even when seeming to be kidding as there seems to be a sense of total disaster heading for both of them. But it's more of an existential sort the law is left most ambiguous of all and it's that which usually makes the best of dramas in lockstep with cuckolded and cuckolds and the like.If one's already seen Unfaithful the Adrian Lyne 2002 Hollywood adaptation not so much remake of this film then one already knows certain big pieces of the plot. The important thing though in comparison with that film which is still very good in its own right is that this time we get only suggestions as to why Helene Stephane Audran maybe her best performance is cheating on her bourgeois husband with writer Victor Pegala Maurice Ronet and this is something that irks at Charles most of all. Idyllic comfort broken to pieces and shoved underneath is the context here and it's with this that we see as opposed to Lyne's film a look not so much at the supersexual and eventually melodramatic side of infidelity and the aftermath albeit just seeing Audran's legs is enough to get some men watching panting but at complacency in the marriage and parenthood of their only child. Even if the child actor isn't very good at expression he says I Hate You and I Love You in the same note there's always the level of discomfort in seeing the unspoken tension in the scenes with the three of them.And if for nothing else La Femme Infidele is a masterpiece of technique. So many shots and angles had me glued to the screen knowing that there could be no other way to get it right. Surely the script leads much of Chabrol along his paths the actual moment of murder however is an ingenious editing trick and what isn't there under the surface on screen is assuredly there on the page. But it's safe to put Chabrol on the level of artistry with his newwave counterparts for shots like the one with Audran lying down on the bed creeping up ever so slowly and then cutting to a closeup the one moment when we see just a slice of conscience. Or when Chabrol gets the emphasis of violence with a quick simple shot of blood trickling down. Or how he balances out perspective at the house look as the husband is watching out in the backyard at his wife her out of focus yet still walking forward as the camera zooms a little more forward. And the last shot following up on what has been many a decidedly Hitchcokian angle or note put forward with a contemplative 'Vertigo' shot of mother and son in longview out of focus. It's one of the saddest ending shots in the history of French movies.It might sound like I'm hyping up this film up a little but considering how underrated Chabol can be in comparison to Truffaut and Godard and even Rohmer to an extent who by the way he cowrote a book about Hitchcock with La Femme Infidele deserves to be seen and reevaluated not just in the context of ah it's French and it's romance and tragedy. To say that it's better than Unfaithful is an understatement and it's only fault is that if anything it could be a little longer.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are at least two ways of describing this entry Early Chabrol andor Vintage Chabrol. Depends on what you mean by love. Chronologically it dates from his early days as writerdirector and if you are moved to describe those days as vintage then who am I to argue. Certainly it has Chabrol's signature all over it the cool almost passionless behaviour of the principals the affluent lifestyles usually on the fringes of large cities in this case Versailles and Neuilly which could be read by those who have nothing better to do as a metaphor for the leading characters who could be said to exist on the fringes of civilised behaviour. This time around Michel Bouquet is in a well established marriage with Stephane Audran  at one point Audran remarks to their son that he will soon be ten years old  and although he seems to have little interest in sleeping with her witness his polite rejection of her sexual overtures he doesn't take too kindly to Maurice Ronet pinchhitting for him. Having acquired Ronet's address via private heat he pays a social call on his wife's lover and almost as an afterthought brutally kills him whilst discussing the situation as one civilised man to another. Naturally Audran is in the frame yet soon enough the attention switches to Bouquet at which point Audran realising what has happened destroys evidence that could help convict Bouquet. Like I said civilised to a faretheewell. Lots of quality on offer here Writing Direction Acting Photography all up to snuff and beyond. Highly enjoyable.".

Having acquired Ronet's address via private heat he pays a social call on his wife's lover and almost as an afterthought brutally kills him whilst discussing the situation as one civilised man to another. Naturally Audran is in the frame yet soon enough the attention switches to Bouquet at which point Audran realising what has happened destroys evidence that could help convict Bouquet. Like I said civilised to a faretheewell. Lots of quality on offer here Writing Direction Acting Photography all up to snuff and beyond. Highly enjoyable.";

Bouquet is superb in this film  he maintains a friendly calm exterior most of the time but you can see that there's a whole range of emotions hidden behind it. Stphane Audran looks great those legs! but her best scene comes near the very end a long tracking shot that follows her and focuses on her face as it takes a Mona Lisatype expression with just a hint of a smile. I do have three objections about the film 1 The title leaves little doubt as to how fidele la femme really is the first 30 minutes might have played even better if we were less certain that Bouquet's suspicions weren't mere paranoia 2 Audran's affair is not very developed and her marriage does not look dysfunctional enough for her continued infidelity to be in some way justified 3 The last shot is technically beautiful but very inconclusive personally I think the film should have ended one scene earlier. For an even more twistyturny variation on a similar scenario check out Chabrol's Innocents With Dirty Hands.  out of 4.P.S Brigitte the secretary is hot as hell!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "La Femme Infidele aka The Unfaithful Wife is a psychological thriller that charts the course of events that follow after the passion is lost from an otherwise happy elevenyearold marriage. Suspicion betrayal and jealousy create a cocktail of emotions which eventually become totally uncontrollable and lead to a violent incident that changes the couple's lives forever. The fact that their feelings are constrained within certain parameters which are imposed on them by their middleclass sensibilities creates the powerful tension which is such a strong and consistent feature of this movie.Charles Desvallees Michel Bouquet is a wealthy businessman who lives in a beautiful chteau near Versailles with his wife Helene Stephane Audran and their son Michel Stephane Di Napoli. Outwardly they appear to be a happy family but some of Helene's actions lead Charles to suspect that she may be having an affair and so he employs a private detective to investigate. After the detective reports that Helene is involved with a divorced writer called Victor Pegala Maurice Ronet Charles decides to visit his wife's lover at his apartment. The two men initially converse in a very calm and friendly manner but as the evidence of his wife's infidelity becomes increasingly vivid Charles' emotions overwhelm him and he strikes Pegala with a heavy ornament and kills him.Following the incident at Pegala's apartment Charles and Helene maintain their appearance of normality but there's also some evidence that they're beginning to unravel.

Helene never actually mentions her frustration her adultery or the fact that she finds evidence of Charles' crime and Charles never talks about his suspicions his crime or the depth of the pain that he obviously experiences as a result of being betrayed by his wife. Similarly all the emotional turmoil is routinely masked by an air of tranquillity because maintaining a veneer of normality is so important to people of their social standing.In a film that's as subtle and cerebral as La Femme Infidele the demands on the actors are considerable and the fact that Bouquet and Audran convey so much so successfully without being able to talk about their thoughts and feelings emphasises just how talented they are. A real high point comes in a scene close to the end where Stephane Audran's subtle smile very economically speaks volumes about what she's thinking and feeling at that time. This is just one example of the top class acting that contributes so much to the success of this movie which really needs to be seen more than once in order to fully appreciate it.".

	onyx:emotionText "La Femme Infidele aka The Unfaithful Wife is a psychological thriller that charts the course of events that follow after the passion is lost from an otherwise happy elevenyearold marriage. Suspicion betrayal and jealousy create a cocktail of emotions which eventually become totally uncontrollable and lead to a violent incident that changes the couple's lives forever. The fact that their feelings are constrained within certain parameters which are imposed on them by their middleclass sensibilities creates the powerful tension which is such a strong and consistent feature of this movie.Charles Desvallees Michel Bouquet is a wealthy businessman who lives in a beautiful chteau near Versailles with his wife Helene Stephane Audran and their son Michel Stephane Di Napoli. Outwardly they appear to be a happy family but some of Helene's actions lead Charles to suspect that she may be having an affair and so he employs a private detective to investigate. After the detective reports that Helene is involved with a divorced writer called Victor Pegala Maurice Ronet Charles decides to visit his wife's lover at his apartment. The two men initially converse in a very calm and friendly manner but as the evidence of his wife's infidelity becomes increasingly vivid Charles' emotions overwhelm him and he strikes Pegala with a heavy ornament and kills him.Following the incident at Pegala's apartment Charles and Helene maintain their appearance of normality but there's also some evidence that they're beginning to unravel.

	schema:headline " Another fascinating lowkey crime drama from Claude Chabrol";
	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol is known affectionately as 'the French Hitchcock'. And while I can see why he is labelled as such it isn't a terribly accurate description. His films are ostensibly thrillers but the difference between Chabrol and Hitchcock is that the former is only superficially interested in suspense. His films effectively use the thriller framework in order to explore issues of human psychology morality and sexuality. While pivotal the crimes depicted in his films are almost incidental they are merely catalysts that lead to the human dramas that truly interest him. Its the psychological aftermath of crime and the complex human emotions that it unleashes that drives his films.La Femme Infidle is no different in this regard. Its about a love triangle that ends in the murder of the secret lover. The married couple's relationship actually strengthens on account of this homicide. This atypical approach to human relationships is common in Chabrol's universe. I wouldn't necessarily say that characters in his movies act in particularly realistic ways. They always seem to be somewhat emotionally detached. In this case it is no different. The married couple seem to navigate through these moments of heightened tension with little more than a Gallic shrug. But this is the style of the director and his familiar ensemble of actors. Once again his muse Stphane Audran is radiant as the unhappy wife while Michel Bouquet impresses as her husband. Visually the film is typical in its lowkey look which fits the psychological mood. Its pastel colours reflect the detached feeling too.Its one of the directors best films. Everyone is on the top of their game and the deceptively simple plot line is never less than engaging. Like most other Chabrol there is a lot going on under the surface here. It ends on a very ambiguous note. One than can be interpreted in different ways. The final camera pan is strangely compelling and mysterious. It makes you want to watch the movie again.".

The premise is divided France's socially passive nes'pas attitude and fundamental acceptance of extramarital affairs contrasted with one parties fundamental and conventional recognition of fidelity.The center piece of cohesion in the film is the married couple have a child. wife learns illegitimate lover also has offspring. This seems to create a divisive consternation within her. The lover distances himself from attentive loyalty to his progeny to which the unfaithful wife cannot accede. There is a specific statement made by the unfaithful wife that is the recognition of true separateness from lover back to husband. The end is a surprise.SUMMARY AND SUGGESTIONS Overall the themes are humanly dense and rich. But one must repeatedly watch this movie to ascertain the potential motives of each character. This movie is closer to a GREAT DRAWING PROMO or TRAILER THAN A COMPLETE MOVIE.

The story is a coming to age and an Italian family drama in the good Italian tradition to the same extent that it is an immigrant drama. The film is beautifully filmed the director and the cameraman obviously love the sea and the landscape of the Mediterranean and make the best of these in a few sequences to remember.

A beautiful engrossing film with heart soul humor and a powerful humanistic vision.";

All of them make their share of mistakes and yet all three characters are worth caring for and their mistakes are understandable ones. The doublelife situation and its consequences for all concerned is set up so as to go against some of the usual preconceptions. O'Brien's character is lonely but by no means illintentioned and the situation is sad never sordid.The tone is somber almost from the beginning and except for a couple of amusing references to Edmund Gwenn's earlier role in Miracle on 34th Street there are few or no moments of humor to break the tension. Thus you can feel the unending sense of foreboding that O'Brien's character feels in regard to the complications he has caused.Lupino and the script also manage to provide an honest look at the situation with few hindrances from the strict production code of the era. Only at a couple of odd moments can you tell that they had to shift gears slightly so as to placate the censors. Although the movie is lowkey and straightforward it's a commendable effort and it makes for good drama.".

Mr. Jordan explains that he will have to investigate both of their backgrounds and Mr. Jordan begins to have his doubts about Harry. It is at this point in the film when it gets very interesting.

Here she is directing and costarring in a tight little film about a man who gets himself in hot water with two wives one baby and an adoption agency investigator who looks like Santa Claus!.Edmond O'Brien the everyman of film portrays the bigamist of the title who just can't seem to help himself.....so he helps himself to both Lupino and Joan Fontaine. All goes well for a while but circumstances catch up with him and then it hits the fan. The ending leaves the unanswered question Who do you love? and leaves the viewer wondering which one will take him back. My money is on Lupino.Joan Fontaine plays the rather elegant business woman first wife in her usual cool and detached manner. She was coming off of a glorious career but was starting the descent that was inevitable for female stars of the 1940s. O'Brien does a yeoman's job as the man with the wedding bell blues and Edmund Gwenn the real Santa Claus of 34th Street is a little less jolly as the investigator. Jane Darwell a staple of the 30s and 40s has a bit part as the cleaning lady.Lupino was directing Fontaine who was the wife of her exhusband Collier Young who was the producer. Got that? All they needed was Howard Duff Lupino's next husband to pop up as a detective!....or maybe Brian Aherne Fontaine's former husband to be the judge. All that aside this is not a bad film and it did receive some good reviews when released. It's worth a watch.".

Meant as a light injoke it ends up as a distancing ploy when O'Brien and Lupino start chatting about Miracle on 34th Street. But closer to the bone The Bigamist treats O'Brien with lavish sympathy. To be sure there are the ritualistic mentions of the moral laws we all live by' and the like but on the whole he's portrayed as a victim of circumstance.  For every  victim however there's usually a villain.  In this case the finger wags at Fontaine who can't bear a child and who takes her husband's work more seriously than she takes his ego. Much is made justifiably of Lupino's bucking the maledominated system by daring to direct movies.  Yet The Bigamist demonstrates how hard it must have been to buck the social outlook of America in the early Eisenhower era.Gossipy note Writerproducer of The Bigamist was Collier Young Lupino's second husband.  They divorced in 1951 two years before they collaborated on this movie. She went on to marry Howard Duff he to wed none other than Joan Fontaine.  It must have made for an interesting production.".

Yet The Bigamist demonstrates how hard it must have been to buck the social outlook of America in the early Eisenhower era.Gossipy note Writerproducer of The Bigamist was Collier Young Lupino's second husband.  They divorced in 1951 two years before they collaborated on this movie. She went on to marry Howard Duff he to wed none other than Joan Fontaine.  It must have made for an interesting production.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the strangest films I have ever seen coming from Hollywood in the 1950s. It is a very engaging film about Edmond O'Brien and his doublelife. He is married to Joan Fontaine and loves her but there marriage is very distantboth emotionally and because O'Brien is on the road so much as a traveling salesman. Eventually he is driven by loneliness to another woman in another town. Over and over he vows to break it off but eventually this other woman becomes pregnant and he just can bring himself to either leave her or his wife! The movie is shown through flashbacks. And despite the sensational plot the movie is actually done very sedately and avoids sensationalism. Instead it tries to portray O'Brien in a pretty sympathetic lightwhile not excusing his actions. And by doing so the movie really gets you thinking. An excellent job of acting by all but the star of this picture is Ida Lupino who plays the second wife and so deftly directed this little film. It's well worth a watch.PSone very cute little inside joke was when O'Brien and Lupino were on a bus going past homes of the stars. Among the many stars' homes that were pointed out by the tour guide was that of Edmund Gwennwho actually plays a major role in the film as an adoption agency investigator!".

For the first couple of reels the investigation is the story as Jordan discovers several rather suspicious items about the husband a traveling salesman who makes quite regular trips to Los Angeles. Suspecting that all is not as it seems Jordan eventually follows Graham to L.A. and discovers that he goes under a different name and doesn't seem to register at any of the typical hotels. We know from the title what is going to happen and sure enough when Jordan tracks Graham to a small house out in the suburbs a baby cries and Graham's big lie unravels....Yes Graham has another wife Phyllis Martin Ida Lupino a waitress and the mother of his baby boy. He admits it all to Jordan admits that he fell in love with Martin because she offered something that his careerwoman wife and partner Eve could not  real love need romance. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback detailing the last year or so of Graham's life probably the best part of the film lies in the next couple of reels O'Brien showing real pathos as the lonely husband the romantic and wouldbe lover whose marriage has become a business arrangement wandering a large and unfriendly alien city  Lupino does a beautiful job of conveying the desolation and unfriendliness of Los Angeles  and finally striking up a tentative friendship and wouldbe romance with a tartmouthed waitress from Pennsylvania who's still dreaming of a better life. Eventually that friendship becomes a onenight stand on Graham's birthday that results in the unexpected but not unwanted child and when back in San Francisco Eve decides to finally look into adopting after 8 years of childlessness Graham realizes that difficult choices are closing in though he avoids them until caught.What's most striking about The Bigamist to me is how it avoids taking an easy way out avoids making any of the characters into villains or clichs though Fontaine's Eve is a little scantily fleshed out and is probably the least likable character of the trio the film really comes off as an indictment of the career and capitalistbased world of the conflicts between money and real joy that we face in this society and it nearly achieves mastery in its exploration of these themes through the great location work and fine acting especially by O'Brien  until a weak and fairly slapdash moralizing courtroom ending which boils it down all too simply. Still for the most part this is a beautifully worked out look at the challenges people face alone and together and a bravely realistic portrait of a crime that was barely talked about in an era where even divorce was often taboo. Though I haven't yet seen all of her films I suspect this is Lupino's best and though stylistically it couldn't be more different in theme and feeling it is rivaled in its era in American film only by Douglas Sirk.

Lupino a rare female director working in the 1950's made a number of cheaply budgeted but highly interesting films in that era. The plot of The Bigamist is probably the most intriguing of them all but Lupino doesn't let the sensational subject matter slide into pure melodrama. This is a sad quiet and painfully honest look at the lives of the three central characters and the tragic situation they find themselves in.Joan Fontaine gives the film's best performance as Eve who is married to Harry Edmond O'Brien and can't conceive a child. So she turns her energies into trying to become the perfect wife and business partner to O'Brien. Fontaine's portrait of a woman outwardly confident but desperate for approval and the completeness of motherhood is subtle and highly affecting. Lupino is almost equally good as Phyllis the woman lonely O'Brien working in a city away from Fontaine turns to ad falls in love with. In a way Phyllis is very similar to Eve. Both of them seem to not need anyone but inwardly there is a huge gap in their lives. Phyllis becomes pregnant with a child and to protect her Harry marries her.This sad tale is told is flashback to adoption agency head Edmund Gwenn who at the beginning sense's Harry's deception of the desperate Eve. I haven't mentioned O'Brien much yet so I will now. While we are drawn to sympathise and connect more with the two women involved O'Brien's character is hardly a villain. In the affecting courtroom scene where looks say a thousand words we are asked to question our own morals. Harry cheated on his wife yes but he actually married Phyllis instead of abandoning her and the child. It is a terribly complex situation and as the judge says the result result is nothing compared to the damning effect on all their lives.".

It stars Lupino herself with Edmund O'Brien Joan Fontaine Edmund Gwenn and Kenneth Tobey. Music is scored by Leith Stevens and cinematography by George Diskant.Harry Graham O'Brien tells adoption agency inspector Mr. Jordan Gwenn how he came to have two wives. One in Los Angeles Lupino the other in San Francisco Fontaine.Initially released as part a double bill with Lupino's The HitchHiker The Bigamist is the lesser known film and the lesser thought of picture at that. Where The HitchHiker is a more aggressive and claustrophobic noir picture The Bigamist is more a Sirkian melodrama with noir touches. What transpires in the gifted hands of noir darling Lupino is a film examining a complex male protagonist a guy suffering desperately from loneliness and alienation his only moments of happiness comes in the arms of two women. If this sounds like Lupino is taking a sympathetic approach to Harry Graham? Then yes that is true but he is portrayed as being morally ambiguous and weak with the deft insertion of fate's deadly hand into the story as Harry tries on occasions to do the legal and right thing.I can't figure out my feelings towards you I despise you and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand and yet I almost wish you luck. Once the story reaches the pinnacle female parties are left dislocated hurt and confused about their emotions Harry is crushed and we believe his pain because he is not a selfish bastard. Some of the most telling passages of dialogue come from other men Gwenn's agency inspector and the Judge John Maxwell presiding over the court case these helping to not stereotype the Graham character. The finale also refuses to take an easy way out it's left deliberately ambiguous the final shot open ended. Shot at real L.A. and Frisco locations film has some nice visual touches. Harry in shadowy hotel rooms his lonely walks down town while venetian blinds feature and a shadowed bathed staircase banister showcases the talents of Diskant On Dangerous GroundThe Narrow MarginKansas City Confidential. It's not an overtly film noir picture visually but there are snatches in the mix. Cast are bang on form with O'Brien particularly impressive when portraying conflicted emotions.It's not perfect strong characters the lead trio may be but they are all so nice there's no edge there. There's an inside joke that comes off as flat and misplaced while Stevens' score is often intrusive in desperately trying to set up emotional impact. But these are small complaints that don't stop the picture's great strengths from storming through to hold the attention. It's an interesting picture a cautionary tale choosing to analyse rather than point the finger. It deserves to be more well known these days and certainly shouldn't be viewed as an apology for Bigamy. 7.510".

Some of the most telling passages of dialogue come from other men Gwenn's agency inspector and the Judge John Maxwell presiding over the court case these helping to not stereotype the Graham character. The finale also refuses to take an easy way out it's left deliberately ambiguous the final shot open ended. Shot at real L.A. and Frisco locations film has some nice visual touches. Harry in shadowy hotel rooms his lonely walks down town while venetian blinds feature and a shadowed bathed staircase banister showcases the talents of Diskant On Dangerous GroundThe Narrow MarginKansas City Confidential. It's not an overtly film noir picture visually but there are snatches in the mix. Cast are bang on form with O'Brien particularly impressive when portraying conflicted emotions.It's not perfect strong characters the lead trio may be but they are all so nice there's no edge there. There's an inside joke that comes off as flat and misplaced while Stevens' score is often intrusive in desperately trying to set up emotional impact. But these are small complaints that don't stop the picture's great strengths from storming through to hold the attention. It's an interesting picture a cautionary tale choosing to analyse rather than point the finger. It deserves to be more well known these days and certainly shouldn't be viewed as an apology for Bigamy. 7.510";

Harry has another wife Phyliss Ida Lupino  he also has a baby boy.He and Eve had been drifting apart. After finding she couldn't have children she concentrated on building up their business and Harry felt unwanted. He meets Phyliss on a bus tour of movie stars' homes and they start to see each other every time he is in Los Angeles. When he finds out Phyliss is having a baby he has to decide whether to be a man get a divorce and stand by her  he decides to be a mouse not confront Eve and marry Phyliss while he is still married to Eve!!! Eve surprises him with a visit to his Los Angeles office and while out with her is seen by a neighbour who wastes no time in telling Phyliss. Things come to a head in a court case where the judge amazingly is very sympathetic to all parties concerned. He says something like it is not which woman you want but which woman will want you!!!Joan Fontaine is good playing what she did best  a brittle woman who yearns for sympathy. Ida Lupino comes across as the most likable of the trio. You get the feeling she will end up with him at the end. Even though Edmond O'Brien gets sympathetic treatment as Harry  he is so stern and wooden it is hard to believe he could charm any woman.Recommended.".

O'Brien and Fontaine play a married San Francisco couple Harry and Eve Graham who are unable to have children and are planning to adopt. Eve is a very successful businesswoman Harry is a traveling salesman with a big territory in Los Angeles. Harry becomes quite nervous when he realizes that a thorough background check must be done before the adoption can take place. Mr. Jordan Gwenn who works for the adoption agency knows something is wrong but can't quite put his finger on it. Eventually he finds out  Harry Graham is Harrison Graham in Los Angeles and there he has another wife Lupino and a new baby. Harry tells Jordan the whole story of meeting Eve Lupino in Los Angeles drifting into an affair with her learning she was pregnant and being unable to abandon her.Well directed by Lupino the film pushes the sympathy toward Harry and his dilemma and keeps a good pace and interest throughout. Fontaine was no longer a big movie star having passed the magic age of 30 several years before and she can be seen often in these black and white B movies of the '50s. She does a good job and looks quite glamorous but Lupino's role is the showier one. Edmond O'Brien does an excellent job as the beleaguered Harry.This film truly was a family affair  this screenplay about a man with two wives was written by Collier Young the exhusband of Lupino and at that time the current husband of Fontaine and Fontaine's mother Lillian Fontaine plays Lupino's landlady. Worth seeing if only to wonder what went on during the filming.".

In some ways the story seems like a clever reworking of Hawthorne's 'The Scarlet Letter.' Only this time the adulterer is male and nicely played by Edmond O'Brien and the indiscretions are not made public but kept private. As the plot unfolds we watch the ramifications of his actions play out. We quickly learn that he has married two women in two different towns with each one unaware that the other wife exists. They gradually come to the realization that their husband is a bigamist and evolve from naive to more knowledgeable perhaps emerging stronger because of it. Lupino and costar Joan Fontaine give impressive performances as the wives and it is not easy to decide which one deserves to keep O'Brien before the final fade out. It's that kind of triangle. Enlivening the proceedings are some of the era's best character actors Jane Darwell as a cleaning lady and Edmund Gwenn as a social worker who catches on to O'Brien's duplicitous ways.".

It is not unique among production code dramas in that it displays some very old fashioned ideas primarily that a woman will go somewhat bonkers if she finds out she cannot have children and a symptom of a married woman gone bonkers is for her to take a deep interest in big business.In this film Eve Graham Joan Fontaine discovers about six years into her marriage to Harry Graham Edmond OBrien that she cannot have children. As a result she plunges herself into her husband's business and is always telling him that she trusts him completely while he is on the road in Los Angeles  something Harry actually takes as a bit of a rebuke. While on one of his many long business trips in L.A. Harry meets waitress Phyllis Martin Ida Lupino. Harry intends just to keep it friendly between the two of them but on the road and alone on his birthday things go too far and Phyllis becomes pregnant as a result. Phyllis is alone in the world and having a rather difficult pregnancy so Harry feels needed by her. He decides to call Eve make a clean breast of it and ask for a divorce so he can marry Phyllis. Unfortunately the recent death of Eve's father has shocked her out of big business mode and the conversation Harry was going to have with Eve that was going to end it between them winds up being a conversation about adoption. So his new plan is this  marry Phyllis  who does not know Harry is already married  and stay married to Eve long enough for the adoption to go through because he doesn't want to leave Eve with nothing.The film paints Harry as a sympathetic albeit a somewhat weak character. He is torn between the sweetheart of his youth and the mother of his child who unfortunately are two different people. In more simplistic directorial production code era hands Phyllis would have conveniently died in childbirth after producing Harry the son he always wanted Harry would have confessed all to Eve who would have forgiven him and the two would have lived happily ever after raising Harry's biological child. In this film things don't work out that tidily and how Harry society  and the wives for that matter handle this situation and its complete resolution are left somewhat up in the air.".

In my view it is anything but.As some other reviewers have noted the hapless Harry played by Edmond O'Brien is treated somewhat sympathetically. He's hangdog he's lonely and he just wants a little attention from his careerist wife.Everything that happens in The Bigamist stems it seems from the failures of Harry's first wifecalled significantly enough Eve the first woman from whom original sin and all the woes of humanity flow in the common view. This Eve leads her man to the sin of adultery.Not only is Eve unfailingly careerist she's infertile to boot. We're to understand that it's her insufficiency as a woman that drives Harry to infidelity. That hardly seems feminist to me.I realize that this argument applies a current standard to a work from a halfcentury ago but calling it feminist would be making the same kind of judgment. Lupino was certainly a path breaker as one of the first women to direct films in Hollywood. And it's typical of the times that she made women's picturesfilms whose stories would address women's concerns.But to call this film feministwith its cold and ultimately condemning portrayal of a successful and infertile womanseems really to miss the point. The film affirms everything about the role that women were expected to adopt after World War II. No longer working on assembly lines as Rosie the Riveter women were expected to step aside in the workplace to make room for returning veterans. Women had a job to do to make happy homes for their husbands. When Eve fails to take her rightful place the most terrible of consequences ensue.I find this a fairly typical film of the 1950s affirming in a rather sordid and unappealing way the mores of the time. Harry is a far from likable character and the women are hardly better. Lupino is the most interesting because she shows a bit of spunk. Fontaine's character vacillates between hardbitten businesswoman and expectant mother who goes all girlie at the sight of a mechanical soldier. Really? A mechanical SOLDIER??? This is not a feminist film.".

	schema:headline " Pretty good little movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Considering its resources and it's rather small budget this is a pretty good movie from directoractress Ida Lupino. It was made without the backing of any big studios but yet it starred some capable and big name actors in it no doubt thanks to Lupino's connections in Hollywood. Ida Lupino was quite a big name actress at the time thanks to roles she played in High Sierra They Drive by Night and The Sea Wolf among others. But due to her age good acting roles were becoming more hard and hard to get by. She then decided to do a not so common thing for a female at the time she decided to direct and also write movies on her own. Not that she ever became much successful with it though but that seems hardly her fault. There were simply no big studios or producers at the time who dared to back a female director up at time despite of her good reputation as an established actress. Therefor she got mostly stuck to directing low budget films that never got big releases. This is a real shame since she definitely had some directing qualities and knew how to bring a good story to the screen.Perhaps with this movie Lupino also tried to make a social statement and address the issue of bigamy which supposedly was happening on quite a large scale at the time but was of course not much talked about. So seems to me that this movie was handling a quite delicate matter though the movie doesn't ever try to make a big issue out of it or try to be preachy about it. You don't really know whether you should hate or care for this man and the situation that he got into as the Edmund Gwenn character also says in the movie. You don't like him at first or what he is doing but yet you can also grow some understanding for him and hope things will work out for the good of him in the long run.It's pretty obvious that this movie was low budget especially when you compare it to the other stuff that got done in 1953. It has a simplistic and cheap look over it but the movie sort of overcomes this all thanks to its good story and the overall handling of it by the director and actor.This movie has quite some big names in it next to Ida Lupino herself of course. Edmond O'Brien plays the real main and not so grateful role of the movie. He does handle his character and manages to be unlikeable in the beginning but likely toward the end. Joan Fontaine also stars as does her mother Lillian Fontaine in a much smaller role. Definitely a good movie also especially when consider its limited resources and the fact that a female directed it in a time when this wasn't really socially accepted in Hollywood.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The presiding judge also passes comment that seems to suggest society is somewhat to blame for what happened.Summing up A strange film that really avoids taking a stand on the issues involved and leaves the viewer feeling as remote from the events on screen as O'Brien's attitude toward his loving wife Fontaine.Trivia note Ida's landlady Miss Higgins is played by none other than Lilian Fontaine mother of Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland.".

	schema:headline " Spaghetti with Paella Western coproduced between Spain and Italy  filled with violence and shootouts";
	schema:reviewBody "Finished Civil War and after fighting in the North side  officer Jeff Donovan Alan Steel or Sergio Ciani returns home . A gang of former confederates led by Machedo William Berger and his hoodlums  Frank Braa Fernando Bilbao lay siege to a Cavalry fort killing everyone except for Jeff whom they torture mercilessly . Blinded by revenge exUnion captain Donovan and now dressed in black loses all confidence in the law and gradually becomes a deranged outlaw . Jeff doesn't hesitate to prosecute to hell Machedo  being only helped by an Union veteran Francisco Sanz and an Indian girl . He takes the path to a little town where resides Machedo and his band harassing them until a final fight .It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Alan Steel or Sergio Ciani and his enemy  William Berger and underlings  Frank Braa and Fernando Bilbao . There is plenty of action and crossfire in the movie  guaranteeing a shootout or stunt every few minutes along with a lot of violence  including killings in cold blood . This is a mediocre Spaghetti Western with some moment entertaining if you can avoid thinking too much . Director Mario Bianchi achieved in Mi Chiamavano 'Requiescat' or Fast hand is still my name possibly his best work of a modest career  with some memorable scenes and regular camera movement  such as the ending duel with surprise included and that makes only can say that this movie seems to be a passable story . Sergio Ciani is the tough revenger and although he doesn't reaches the level of William Berger  as he is also quite restrained and a little wooden . He played assorted mythological demigods in cheaplymade but highly popular spectacles of the early 1960s the actor also occasionally went by his birth name . Steel started off his beefcake run off as a body double for Reeves in both the Hercules and sequel Hercules Unchained and in The battle of Marathn 1959 or Giant of Marathon  in which he also had bit roles . Within a couple of years Steel was posing frontandcenter in Sansone 1961 opposite another physiqueminded American import Brad Harris in the title role. On numerous occasions Steel was asked to play the legendary Greek hero as well as the equally wellbuilt demigods Samson and Ursus even though the film titles often fused or confused them in their titles . Steel starred as Hercules in Hercules Against Rome Hercules Against the Moon Men  Hercules and the Black Pirate and Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas  the second movie mentioned being one of the only spectacles to actually incorporate science fiction into the genre . In contrast his Hercules serves as a mere sidekick in the Zorrolike Hercules and the Masked Rider . He subsequently made Ursus the Rebel Gladiator opposite Dan Vadis  The Fury of Hercules and Samson and the Mighty Challenge. In the late 1960s he and fellow movie Musclemen Kirk Morris and Gordon Mitchell served up spaghetti western genre . In 1976 Steel starred in and cowrote a Robin Hood movie and in 1979 ended his oncamera appearances with the Italian comedy Baby Love .William Berger as a cruelly baddie role is terrific former and subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters . His performance is astonishing  above average to level of these films . Furthermore appears usual secondary actors from SpaghettiChorizo Western as Spanish actors  Francisco Sanz  Fernando Bilbao  Frank Braa and Lorenzo Robledo as a hearse driver  as Italian secondary players as Karin Well. Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets with lousy cinematography by Emilio Foriscot  in Eastmancolor with negative badly processed  being necessary a right remastering . Being filmed on location in Colmenar Viejo Hoyo De Manzanares Madrid and Sesea Toledo Spain . Anticlimatic musical score by Gianni Ferrio  adding modern jazzy music along with inappropriate songs . Quentin Tarantino would take Spaghetti scores composed by Gianni Ferrio for his Inglorious bastards . The motion picture was written and produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero who started producing Il Coyote and The Jiusticia De Coyote by Joaquin Romero Marchent with Abel Salazar and Gloria Marin . After that  he produced with his company Copercines Vengeance of Zorro and L'Ombra Di Zorro 1962 by Joaquin Marchent with Frank Latimore . Eduardo Manzanos built a Western little town in Hoyo De Manzanares Madrid with sets by Jaime Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia  today sadly disappeared just like is well shown in Fast hand in which the village appears old and almost scrawny  the village was called Golden City where filmed several Western as the classic Fistful of dollars and For a fistful of dollars more  furthermore there was shot  Welcome Padre Murray  Brandy  various Zorros and this one . Manzanos Brochero produced various films for Marchent brothers as Joaquin Romero Marchent  Cabalgando Hacia Muerte  Three good men and Rafael Marchent  Quien Grita vengeance Two crosses in Danger Pass  and for Italian directors as Sabor Odio by Umberto Lenzi  Winchester 1 between 1000 by Primo Zeglio  At the end of the rainbow by Aldo Florio and Taste for vengeance or Cowards Don't Pray . Fast Hand was middlingly realized by Mario Bianchi OR Frank Bronston  son of director Roberto B. Montero . Mario Bianchi realized all kind of genres as Terror  Softcore  Hardcore and Spaghetti Western such as Pi forte Sorelle  Kill the Poker Player  The Masked Thief and this Fast hand  most of them written and produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero.".

Within a couple of years Steel was posing frontandcenter in Sansone 1961 opposite another physiqueminded American import Brad Harris in the title role. On numerous occasions Steel was asked to play the legendary Greek hero as well as the equally wellbuilt demigods Samson and Ursus even though the film titles often fused or confused them in their titles . Steel starred as Hercules in Hercules Against Rome Hercules Against the Moon Men  Hercules and the Black Pirate and Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas  the second movie mentioned being one of the only spectacles to actually incorporate science fiction into the genre . In contrast his Hercules serves as a mere sidekick in the Zorrolike Hercules and the Masked Rider . He subsequently made Ursus the Rebel Gladiator opposite Dan Vadis  The Fury of Hercules and Samson and the Mighty Challenge. In the late 1960s he and fellow movie Musclemen Kirk Morris and Gordon Mitchell served up spaghetti western genre . In 1976 Steel starred in and cowrote a Robin Hood movie and in 1979 ended his oncamera appearances with the Italian comedy Baby Love .William Berger as a cruelly baddie role is terrific former and subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters . His performance is astonishing  above average to level of these films . Furthermore appears usual secondary actors from SpaghettiChorizo Western as Spanish actors  Francisco Sanz  Fernando Bilbao  Frank Braa and Lorenzo Robledo as a hearse driver  as Italian secondary players as Karin Well. Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets with lousy cinematography by Emilio Foriscot  in Eastmancolor with negative badly processed  being necessary a right remastering . Being filmed on location in Colmenar Viejo Hoyo De Manzanares Madrid and Sesea Toledo Spain . Anticlimatic musical score by Gianni Ferrio  adding modern jazzy music along with inappropriate songs . Quentin Tarantino would take Spaghetti scores composed by Gianni Ferrio for his Inglorious bastards . The motion picture was written and produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero who started producing Il Coyote and The Jiusticia De Coyote by Joaquin Romero Marchent with Abel Salazar and Gloria Marin . After that  he produced with his company Copercines Vengeance of Zorro and L'Ombra Di Zorro 1962 by Joaquin Marchent with Frank Latimore . Eduardo Manzanos built a Western little town in Hoyo De Manzanares Madrid with sets by Jaime Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia  today sadly disappeared just like is well shown in Fast hand in which the village appears old and almost scrawny  the village was called Golden City where filmed several Western as the classic Fistful of dollars and For a fistful of dollars more  furthermore there was shot  Welcome Padre Murray  Brandy  various Zorros and this one . Manzanos Brochero produced various films for Marchent brothers as Joaquin Romero Marchent  Cabalgando Hacia Muerte  Three good men and Rafael Marchent  Quien Grita vengeance Two crosses in Danger Pass  and for Italian directors as Sabor Odio by Umberto Lenzi  Winchester 1 between 1000 by Primo Zeglio  At the end of the rainbow by Aldo Florio and Taste for vengeance or Cowards Don't Pray . Fast Hand was middlingly realized by Mario Bianchi OR Frank Bronston  son of director Roberto B. Montero . Mario Bianchi realized all kind of genres as Terror  Softcore  Hardcore and Spaghetti Western such as Pi forte Sorelle  Kill the Poker Player  The Masked Thief and this Fast hand  most of them written and produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was made in 1972 but seems more like it came from the mid to late 60's when spaghetti westerns generally had a more serious tone.It is a typical but very good revenge tale about an exunion officer whose hand was crippled by an exconfederate who leads a band of guerrillas who continue to terrorize people after the war is over. It's fun to watch as the now cladinblack hero seems to come back from the dead and hunts down and kills his enemies one by one.Sergio Ciani plays the protagonist in a performance that is horrible even by spaghetti western standards. In all fairness though there may be another person dubbing his voice who can be blamed in whole or in part for the wooden performance. I don't know but it's pretty bad. Fortunately William Berger makes up for it. He is excellent in the role of Machedo the leader of the confederate gang. This is definitely Berger's movie. It's probably the best performance I've seen from him.The music score by Ferrio is also very good.If you are into Eurowesterns this ones worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mean spirited grim unremittingly violent later period spaghetti western from Mario Bianchi best known for his horrorporn hybrid films from the 1980s. This is probably the most brutal and sadistic Italian western I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of them. Your typical SW almost always has an elaborate torture sequence in it's formula where the bad guys string up or strap down the hero humiliate the guy and make him suffer usually just for the hell of it. The archetypal torture scene is still the delightful interlude in FISTFUL OF DOLLARS where the greasy pistolero gang relentlessly beat  maim Clint Eastwood while the crazy guy giggles with glee. The point of the torture scene is to prove how tough the hero is as he walks it off learns how to use his gun hand again even with his fingers crushed see DJANGO and kills them all. Tony Anthony made it into an art form but the point is that the torture sequence is typically just one scene amidst an adventure. It's usually over at some point.FAST HAND IS STILL MY NAME by contrast to almost every other spaghetti western I have seen plays out as one extended torture sequence with a final shootout tacked on for good measure. Former Hercules star Alan Steele  unable to project emotion under an absurd looking mass of facial hair  is cast as a Union soldier who runs afoul of insane William Berger and his band of drooling Confederate hicks and they basically spend the entire film taking turns beating the living crap out of him. Between beatings they murder innocent homesteaders rape Injun women terrorize children set things on fire and at one point even rip one of those DO NOT REMOVE UNDER PENALTY OF LAW tags from a mattress before being sold. They are not nice people and for whatever reason Alan Steele's character pursues them across the frontier determined to repeatedly give them another chance to beat the road tar out of him one more time. They oblige him.While priding myself for having a pretty strong stomach for movie violence even I started to feel a bit sickened by how much suffering is packed into this movie. Which may have been the point  as another commenter here points out by 1972 spaghetti westerns were pretty much either Trinity inspired comedies or drawn out languid studies on violence. This one's a torture show by comparison. Sure there's some gunplay and intrigue about a gold robbery but after watching seven guys gob all over Alan Steele and his mutton chop beard  then cripple his gun hand I was sort of wondering what the hell I had gotten myself into. There's an interesting photographic atmosphere to the film that wallows in cheapness and sleaze William Berger goes crazier than you've ever seen him go before and it's always fun to see the giant Ferdinando Bilbao getting some decent screen time.I also didn't have a problem with the modern jazzrock musical score which is delightfully out of place especially given the content of the film. Worked just fine by juxtaposing against the brutality making it seem even more perverse ala CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The bit with the shooting of the gun hand the face concealing mask of a beard and the emotionless mechanical way that Alan Steele seeks  dishes out his vengeance may have suggested Peter Weller's fate in ROBOCOP ... which makes sense given that film's use of a TV western quick draw as a recurring motif. Inspiration can come from the damndest places. And the payoff climactic revenge killing sequence where Steele springs his trap on the gang is a worthy release for all of the film's built up tension. But this was the paranoid 70s and the film is so paranoid and unrelentingly grim that the hero doesn't even take the foxy Injun girl away with him at the end as he rides out of the very familiar looking and by 1972 very decrepit dilapidated spaghetti western movie set town. It had indeed seen better days I think Richard Harrison and Giacomo RossiStuart had their final showdown in front of the same big hotel back in 1963 at the end of GUNFIGHT AT RED SANDS. Which may have been just as violent amoral and brutal as FASTHAND but was ten times more fun. Here is a spaghetti western for fans who aren't necessarily looking for a good time which I suspect may have been exactly what Mario Bianchi was getting at. How many times can you watch Bud Spencer get hit in the face with a pie before you decide it's time for something else?510 The original Italian title translates out to They Told Him To Rest In Peace ... But They Were Mistaken. Just in case you were wondering.".

	schema:headline " Fasthand is one of the most brutal violent Spaghetti Western films I have ever saw. Still the movie is too fast  messy in production value!";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie is widely regarded as one of among the most violent Spaghetti Westerns of all time and the movie directed by Mario Biachi under the pseudonym name of Frank Broston does live up to its reputation with scenes of torture of branding irons bloody gun fights and clever deaths scenes. It was nice for once to see a movie not fill with oneshot bloodless kills. Still there were some hilarious over the top action that were bothersome like the weird sound effects for the axe fight and the dummy getting run over scene. For the most part Fasthand is still my name has an alright plot. While the plot isn't anything new as it seem to be recycle from the same tiresome revenge plot where the protagonist fought in the Civil War only to get betrayed or left for death by a group of outlaws. Years later he returns to that group of outlaws to seek revenge on them by killing all of them or making their lives a living hell. Yeah this is that plot. A plot that been done time after time before and after this movie. This time our protagonist is Captain Jeff Madison or Mulligan or Morrison or Donovan depending on what version you watched. He's played by Alan Steel AKA Sergio Ciani whom looks like the Brawny Towel Man logo here. His large build makes him looks like the hero that we should be rooting for in a Swordandsandal film than a western. It doesn't help that his 1970s moustache makes him look more like a 1970s porn star. It doesn't help his manly image when he always being taken prisoner by the villains than fighting it out. You'd think with such a bulky guy the movie wouldn't make him such a wimp. His line delivering is pretty damn wooden. William Berger plays Madison's archenemy the sadistic and violent Machedo. His performance is a bit over the top but stand outs. I like that he can't stand killing people that's looking at him. You always see him trying to cover his victim's faces with blankets or clothing. I like how they say Machedo kill a lot of people in the film but he only kill a few person. While Madison the hero killed a lot more. Honestly I don't even see Madison as the hero anyways. The supporting cast is alright for the most part. I like the Frank Brana as Quincy. There is a great fight scene with him and Madison. I love the old Union veteran Smart Francisco Sanz that helps Madison on his way. Great gun fight worth seeing with him in the film. I really can't buy the actress that played the NativeAmerican in the film that helps Madison. She's has to be one of the whitest NativeAmericans I ever saw. Her character really comes out of nowhere. The limited locations they used was alright. You really see the decay of old Westerns sets that hasn't been used in years. It got down and dirty. It set the mood of the film and one thing that help the film. I couldn't say the camera motion was great because the way the film was shot sucks. It felt like every scene in the movie was filmed during an earthquake. The shaking camera makes this movie nearly unwatchable. I hate how the film would jump zoom and out and then get stuck. I hate how the night scenes are too dark that you can barely see anything. The Fight scene in the sun with the bad lighting is another blunder. It's so blinding. I didn't like the gold flashback scenes. It made the hero look like he's having a wet dream than a nightmare. The opening credit could need a better opening if it was pace right. It would be great to see the opening credit after all the opening massacre rather than before it. It was make more sense with the bloodtone coloring. I hate the pacing. Indeed the civil war part in the beginning went a little too long. 20 minutes it took for the revenge plot to kick in. I hate the sex scene. It was shot so awkwardly as if the camera was in the way of the couple making love. It was amateurish as hell. I really didn't like how the movie had this newsreel narration by a voice actor that's sounds like something out of a National Geographic documentary. It really wasn't needed. Show don't tell. The music is pretty weird as well. Gianni Ferrio had this inappropriately jazzy lodge score that didn't fit the film. I did like the 'That Man' Theme song by Ann Collin. Still it did sounds like something out of a James Bond movie than a western. It was also hard to hear. I thought many times that they were saying 'Batman like 1960s Batman. Due to the movie having international releases and multicopies. Finding this movie might be a challenge. The movie falls under a lot of names. Fast Hand Is Still My Name is the most famous one but the film goes under They Told Him To Rest In Peace ... But They Were Mistaken Sing me the song of Vengeance and etc. etc. Overall The 85 minute was made probably way too fast. If it took its time being made. Maybe this time would had been better but as of right now. It's pretty bad.".

Mario Bianchi's story is sufficiently bloody and shocking to work it's not one of the most memorable spaghetti westerns in existence but it does the job ably enough. The excellent supporting cast includes genre regulars Frank Brana and William Berger as members of the aforementioned bandit gang";

Inspiredthis word has been given a whole new dimension by Anu Mallik by the Seven Samurais this is a story about 10 men disgraced in war out to redeem their glory. Great till here. Enter the likes of Om Puri Danny Amrish Puri and Naserruddin Shah and u think its going to be a cracker. Enter Viju Khote Sameer Soni and some others whom I can't even name and this movie becomes absolutely unwatchable. Mamta Kulkarni is in a totally unglamorous role and we all know about those accusations which are being thrown around thick and fast. Though she does give a emotional and certain sense to the movie which goes absolutely berserk at times. U have very bad background music which rings in your ears and horrible cinematography which fails to capture the better shots. The shot in which vultures hover around waiting for the corpse is great but it is highly overdone and occurs at least 15 times with all those irritating loud noises in the background. And u have a completely hopeless Sameer Soni who is forever hovering around Mamta trying to get a peek into her u know what. The action sequences r also trite with the same things being done repeatedly. Twice in the movie u see horsemen after being shot moving back thru the air as their horses move forward. Though this is the normal trick it is rarely possible to discern it in the movie. The movie is salvaged by the excellent 'Chamma Chamma' dance number by Urmila. The proof of this is the poster outside Plaza which has Urmila covering the maximum amount of area in the poster as compared to any other single person. The choreography and music is excellent though the lyrics hardly mean a thingdoes it really matter anyway. The other saving graces are Danny with his great diction and Nasseruddin Shah with his extraordinary dialog delivery specially the one that he tells Amrish Puri after saving his life. Om Puri fails to impress as much though he is passable. The others make a downright ass of themselves and makes u wonder if such people can ever be in the Army. A great military movie has been hog washed to a typical Bollywood mirch masala. I think Rajkumar Santoshi was sleeping during this movie. Said to be the costliest movie with an estimated budget of Rs. 20 crores you wonder at the end of the 3 hr ordeal as to where the money was spent. Disappointing fare on the whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sad. No I'm really sad. How come a potentially super movie like this goes wrong like that ?!! Well it didn't go so wrong but sure it wasn't that right either ! It's a Seven Samurais story yet with 11 fighters being old ones having a dishonor they want to wipe as a salvation. It has a Bmovie gold however the movie insists on being not that shiny. Review with me not all the 11 are being spotted on so why the big number from the start? We didn't go through the already cared about characters appropriately it goes like this one drunk one rich one mouthy...etc namely hasty without much writing to utilize the stereotype or make it less tacky. And most of them weren't even done appropriately in the first place Naseeruddin Shah loves children while having a child of his own and not being a lost child himself !. The matter of the girl calling the police to forbid the leads of continuing the mission just for feeling afraid that they may die is so idiot it's unbelievable. How the corrupted police officer would collect the handsome financial award for capturing the criminal while he'd let him escape ?! And that rich man of the team he just approved to spend his money financing the mission building a school so easily. Rather every time these men have a problem with each other it solves itself so easily for instance they disagreed and half of them is about to leave then they suddenly unsay and stay ??!!.The music is another electronic hell with no taste but to disparage everything and annoy us. The editing was utterly nerves it deprived the movie of any specialty and turned the whole thing into accelerated hubbub. Then the guy who played the villain OH MY GOD he wasn't the worst of this movie he was the worst Indian actor I have ever seen yet ! What the heck is that? At one point I said to myself why they didn't hire the American comedian Chris Rock instead? He would have been at least funnier and in a comic sense as well ! While being supposedly scary his scenes came to be laughable due to his flamboyant makeup and imbecile performance. That turned me off before devastating the power of the conflict. The reputation of holding the record for the highest number of extras and the biggest action sequences filmed in a Hindi film IS shamefully false. The action sequences aren't expensive or excellently made. Average or in best cases decent is the word for it. And finally Urmila Matondkar as a cameo in the singing sequence was massively silly and instead of looking sexy she looked like a freaking robot ! In fact the dance was nerves just like the movie itself. So as you see it was generally between average and nerves.I only loved the different format for the Samurais this round the satire against the police as helpless but colluding which's something unusual in a story of that sort the way the script handled the storyline of the village people from absolute cowards or peaceloving to brave solders who take their usurped rights by war and the loose performance of the charismatic Amrish Puri as nearly the opposite of anything he used to be before stealing the show from the movie's lead Om Puri. However I don't think Akira Kurosawa the director of the original Seven Samurais is so happy with this remake. The movie's makers should have made what could equal such a valuable director and movie. Otherwise why to regard him at the start with a special board ? It's something the makers of the much better and more successful remake Sholay  1975 didn't do ! This unprecedented gesture of nostalgia and respect promised of more but the result was less !China Gate is a clear case of Bgrade moviemaking that ate up Agrade stuff. And the potentially super movie which you know and have seen many times in many versions had been disappointed. That's why I'm pretty sad. It reminded me of the story of the handsome prince who was witched into something else his self. Apparently the magic of Bollywood this time was more like evil voodoo transforming the prince intoHmmmnot a prince at the least !".

However I don't think Akira Kurosawa the director of the original Seven Samurais is so happy with this remake. The movie's makers should have made what could equal such a valuable director and movie. Otherwise why to regard him at the start with a special board ? It's something the makers of the much better and more successful remake Sholay  1975 didn't do ! This unprecedented gesture of nostalgia and respect promised of more but the result was less !China Gate is a clear case of Bgrade moviemaking that ate up Agrade stuff. And the potentially super movie which you know and have seen many times in many versions had been disappointed. That's why I'm pretty sad. It reminded me of the story of the handsome prince who was witched into something else his self. Apparently the magic of Bollywood this time was more like evil voodoo transforming the prince intoHmmmnot a prince at the least !";

Because nothing at all happened in the first half except the fantastic belly dance show of Urmila that has also nothing to do with the film in any way. Believe me many of the audience was just there to see only this part. The entire first part of the movie was full of silly dialogs and keep dragging scenes.One of the fallbacks of the movie is the cast also. One dozen of so called action heroes are actually at their 70'ies who need a stick to be able to walk properly! Seeing bunch of Alzheimer driven heroes trying to figth a notorious gang just make me sick. Anyway since nothing significant happened in the first half I walked off. Do not think I troughly watch the first half. I slept most of the time. Most of the Indian movies have good scores even though the plot is stupid. However in this movie there is not much belly dance show except the one in which Urmila shows her talent. Maybe the movie picks up in the second half I do not know. But looking at the lame direction in the first half I can imagine how idiotic the second half with the action scenes the old men in it. A huge waste of three plus some hours. Do not come even any close.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the '80s Hungarian director Istvn Szab made a loose trilogy with celebrated Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer. Colonel Redl is the second movie in the trilogy and although it is not as well known as the Oscarwinning Mephisto it is nevertheless as interesting and well made.The movie is a fictionalised biopic of Alfred Redl Brandauer who is born to a poor Ukrainian family and in normal circumstances would have been condemned to a life of insignificance but blessed with patriotic fervour for the Emperor and influential people who take him under their wing he's sent to military school where he refines the talents that will be useful to him all his life namely knowing the right answers to his superiors' questions being fanatically devoted to the monarchy and having little moral qualms about betraying friends and comrades. It's no surprise then that he has a steady rise in ranks until he becomes the head of the counterintelligence services. And that's when his perfect efficient career starts crumbling.The AustroHungarian Empire is a tense place bubbling with treason and revolutionary plans devoid of national identity a mishmash of dozens of peoples  Hungarians Ukrainians Czechs Serbians Austrians not to mention Jews  all hating each other. One's background can decide what one's life will be or even get one killed. It's in this atmosphere of subdued terror lies and paranoia that Redl a Ukrainian hiding his Jewish ancestry and ashamed of his poor background operates a network of espionage to ferret out traitors and criminals in the army for the army is all that sustains the Emperor's power in an Empire that has no reason to know the concept of patriotism.One day he's brought to the presence of Archduke Ferdinand and ordered to find a patsy to alleviate interethnic tensions. World War I is just around the corner and the Archduke wants a sensational public case of treason that will unify the Empire against a common enemy. When Redl's first victim a Hungarian nobleman backfires on him a plot is hatched to make him look like a spy for the Russians.Based on a play by John Osborne the movie shows Redl as a Kafkaesque antihero an innocent man caught in the paralysing faceless world of bureaucracy unable to extricate himself from it because it operates under an incomprehensible logic. It's a far cry from the real Redl though who was blackmailed by Russians into spying for them lest his homosexuality be exposed. I'm not one to judge quality by historical faithfulness but I can't help thinking Redl's real story could make an equally remarkable movie one day.The movie is consistently interesting although it develops slowly covering many years in Redl's life from childhood to adulthood. Brandauer plays a cold reserved callous man who nevertheless draws sympathy for his devotion and work ethic. Although the viewer is left wondering whether Redl didn't just waste his life being too loyal to the Emperor it is impossible not to feel sorry for him when the Empire he lives for betrays him.Armin MuellerStahl's performance as the Archduke isn't less spectacular. Showing ruthlessness control and a sharp mind this political strategist does what he has to do to keep the Empire together.Although the facts are fictionalised the movie shows Szab's eye for historical details and no scene fails to produce wonder at the way a dress or piece of furniture looks or at the magnificence of the historical sites used for locations.Istvn Szab and Klaus Maria Brandauer don't get enough credit nowadays but in the '80s they were an unstoppable duo and Colonel Redl is one of their masterpieces.".

However in spite of the similar aspects that both movies share the latter appears to attract in a different way.Is it history depiction that attracts? While MEPHISTO was a story of an actor who desired appreciation and acceptance from the Nazis and by means of compromise and adjustment hoped to survive being at the same time a very realistic insight into historical reality OBERST REDL based upon John Osborne's play A Patriot for Me is a story of a soldier devoted to the AustroHungarian Empire. Living in its fading period he gets through promotion and degradation. Yet unfortunately history is poorly executed. The depiction of the empire does not appear convincing. The Habsburgs are overly cruel and cold. As a result relating Redl to Mephisto and the background power the both characters serve would surely harm the Habsburgs since Mephisto cannot be understood without the Nazis and Redl without the Habsburgs. So what attracts in the movie and involves the viewer? This is the story of a life...a very unique insight into the main character's feelings and experience. His fanatical devotion that leads to a personal tragedy a son of the emperor as called once by a priest in church that turns into a traitor an ambitious soldier that becomes an indefatigable spy. Brandauer does a perfect job in the role and I dare claim that in the matter of the lead role Redl is much more appealing than Mephisto. He represents a blind service of anyone who absolutely believes in political systems governing bodies and who places all his hope in military career when war is more likely to break out. Redl is not a particular history but history in general that so often experiences enthusiasm devotion trust success but also disappointment disillusion fear despair and madness. History personified in human being. I am aware that this aspect was also present in MEPHISTO but here the character can be analyzed within history or outside history.But from this clearly psychological analysis of the movie we can easily switch to general political aspect. I hate politics says Redl after unpleasant events and disillusions. Why? Because politics leads him to do the things he would probably never do out of his free will. These are searches imprisonments investigations where people commit desperate acts including suicide where friends turn into enemies where one becomes Judas and where there is no room for humanity and forgiveness. It's important to mention the disturbing search at Victor Ullman's.A lot of thought provoking moments will draw your attention. First consider Schorn's plot and the fatal duel. Who was guilty? Is death so easy to accept? I also reflected on the case of the Jews. Redl announces that contacting Jewish people will be unwelcome or in most extreme cases punished yet it is him who in the following scene writes a letter to Dr Sonnenschein a Jew. Aren't we brutally masked among other people? Doesn't political correctness blind our selves? The famous mask ball in which Redl takes part clearly says for itself...As for performances they are very good. As I have already mentioned Klaus Maria Brandauer does a great job portraying a man who is not that easy to be discovered or interpreted. On the one hand he is so desirous of personal military career on the other hand he doubts... I also loved Jan Niklas as Kristof Kubinyi Alfred Redl's friend whose fate occurs so unexpected. Gudrun Landgrebe gives a memorable performance as Katalin Kubinyi for whom Redl seems to care and whom Redl really loves. And marvelous presence of Armin MuellerStahl as the Crown Prince  he supplies the role with a sense of royalty.Except for the cast the film's strong point is the excellent use of visual effects like locations wardrobe and sets. It's magnificent luxurious elegant and very subtle. In one little moment Redl sees his emperor Franz Josef standing at the lake and is absolutely overwhelmed by seeing his Kaiser. The scene is as if a moving picture from the old photos that can be found in Austria and that remind us of the charming but lonely years of the late emperor.OBERST REDL is indeed an important movie to be seen by film fans. Yet not for the sake of history whatsoever but for the sake of great thought provoking content. Does the world judge our lives justly?".

	schema:reviewBody "The film traces the military and romantic careers of Colonel Alfred Redl from his humble beginnings through a military academy into the AustroHungarian army to the guileful environment of high political intrigue to his ultimate altruistic suicide in 1913. It's supposedly based on a true story but since so little seems to be known about the true story the epistemology of the plot is questionable. Nobody really knows what happened.Brandauer delivers a remarkable performance displaying great range especially for a man with a face of such ordinariness. He looks like a guy who should be managing the produce section of a supermarket. Yet for all the talent of Brandauer and director Szabo we don't get to know too much about what's going on inside Colonel Redl's head. The role doesn't give him a chance to pour out his soul to anyone and indeed it's improbably that the real Redl would have done any such thing. His marriage to a goodlooking babe who loved him was a matter of convenience. His friendships with his colleagues was constrained out of necessity because of Redl's latent homosexuality and because after all real men don't talk about their feelings  they blow their brains out but they don't talk about their feelings. Example How does Redl feel about his early youth in the provinces? Well while passing through his home town he instructs the driver to pass the old house in which he spent his childhood and he rubs a vacancy in the frosted window so that he can stare at it without expression for about five seconds. What's going on? What wheels and gears are turning in his memory if any? It's anyone's guess.Nice score. Nice period decor and wardrobe. Nice performances from the other players especially Armin MuellerStahl as ruthless Archduke Franz Ferdinand. He has such handsomely clear blue eyes and he's soft spoken reasonable and as treacherous as a rattlesnake. Not that it does him much good if you remember what started World War I. Elegant music  Strauss and Chopin. Great marches full of traps and whistling piccolos and irony. Makes you want to become an officer in the army in 1913 so you can shoot yourself.The film is paced kind of slowly and the intrigue is never overstated so a certain amount of patience and attention is required. If anyone has a mind adjusted to the lightningfast editing of a modern action movie he's unlikely to find this film satisfying. The rest of us will find it interesting and in the end rather tragic.".

But some histrionics might be expected from a man alone in a room who has been ordered to shoot himself and be quick about it.This is as much a political movie as a biographical one. It takes many liberties with the historical record. The generally accepted version is that Alfred Redl was being blackmailed by the Russian secret service which had learned of his homosexuality. There are NO Russians in this movie. That Redl was homosexual is only obliquely stated until the final thirty minutes. Indeed before that he has relations with several women a Vienna prostitute who acts the Happy Hooker indeed and the married sister of a fellow officer.In this film the poor performance of the Austrian armies in World War I is explained by an officer corps more concerned with drinking card playing and skirt chasing than with military matters. Redl's handing over to his Russian controllers the troop dispositions for the Austrian armies is generally believed to be the cause of the losses during the opening stage of the War. The doomed Archduke Franz Ferdinand's only fault supposedly was that he lacked charm. Here the veteran German actor MuellerStahl portrays the Thronfolger as a political schemer a shabby little man he always appears unshaven trying to hold the Monarchy together through trumpedup conspiracies and the playing off of one nationality against another.What this picture does best is portray the hollow grandeur of Habsburg Austria during its final years. The sets are magnificent. In one telling scene early in the picture the boy Alfred invited to an aristocratic home spills some coffee and four servants come to clean up the spill.One minor quibble this Germanlanguage movie is set in the Austrian Empire much of it in Vienna the capital yet no one sounds Austrian. The accent is very different from High German Americans may compare Kissinger and Schwartzenegger. It would be like Gone With the Wind with all the Southerners speaking a kind of Oxford English.".

	schema:headline " Szabo's unique revisionist vision";
	schema:reviewBody "I believe Colonel Redl to be Istvan Szabo's best film a few degrees better than his more celebrated collaboration with the great Brandauer Mephisto. Redl is in fact the middle part of a trilogy made by Hungarian director Szabo and starring Klaus Maria Brandauer in the title roles. Colonel Redl is a revisionist view of the events surrounding the downfall and eventual suicide of AustroHungarian counterintelligence chief Colonel Redl during the early months of WWI.Redl was of mixed UkrainianHungarian stock but rose impressively through the ranks of the AustroHungarian despite his Jewish ancestry and nonaristocratic background. Redl revolutionized AustroHungarian espionage and was eventually succeeded by his subordinate Maximilian Ronge. Shortly thereafter in a spy operation worthy of a Hitchcock film Redl was found to have been secretly spying for the Russians and had given them considerable information on Russian spies and more damagingly the plans for the disastrous attack on Serbia. He committed suicide shortly shortly thereafter and it was revealed that he was a homosexual who was being blackmailed by the Russians.Szabo's film has a revisionist view on the entire affair and its a film steeped in the politics of the AustroHungarian empire. Redl comes out as perhaps the most patriotic man left in the Empire who had to be a fall guy to set an example for the army. His homosexuality while broached is not the central theme of the film. The first and most noticeable thing about the film is the superb use of locations. A lot of time seems to have been invested in sourcing the best locations and the authenticity of period detail makes this an instant classic.Then there is Brandauer's performance as Redl. His Redl is similar to Mephisto in his blind ambition and loyalty to self. But there is a great change in the acting. Where in Mephisto he was pure energy and physicality here he is a restrained Army officer and acts the part perfectly. Brandauer is one of the most talented actors of the twentieth century  the German Olivier  and the DVD extra has an interview with him that is very interesting. His view is that acting on stage requires a lot of ability and understanding. However a person from any background can act in film because it requires no skill and isn't challenging. That is why he avoids working in films. Only an actor with his obvious ability could have the nerve to say such a thing!Szabo has obvious strengths in extracting brilliant performances from all actors. He is also very good at handling epic historic subjects in an intelligent manner concentrating on the period and political themes rather than cheap spectacle. What I found to be his weakness in this film and Mephisto are a poor background score. The music just doesn't blend well with the action. Also his narrative is typically choppy and the editing is poor as always. Without these weaknesses I would certainly have rated Redl 10 out of 10.NB There is an autobiographical scene from Szabo's youth towards the beginning of Redl where he saves his own and his best friends skin by informing on fellow cadets. On 26 Jan 2006 the Hungarian weekly 'Life and Literature' revealed that Szabo has worked as an informant of the Communist authorities after the 1956 Hungarian uprising and made reports on classmates in University.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike most people who know both films there aren't many! I've always preferred this 1985 film to Klaus Maria Brandauer's  and director Istvn Szab's Oscar winning 'Mephisto' from 1981.'Mephisto' won an Oscar for Foreign language film and as such Istvn Szab remains Hungary's only ever Academy Award recipient. The two films have similarities with Brandauer giving superbly nuanced yet powerful performances and both as high ranking Military Officers German in Mephisto and AustroHungarian in this.Colonel Redl is a made up character that is drawn from historical records and the story that ensues is based on John Osborne's play 'A Patriot for Me' and we follow Redl as boy all the way through to his highranking officer just before the onset of the Great War. It's a compelling study of the decaying Empire that so dominated turnofthe century Europe and the bubbling resentments and labelling of ethnic groups within that start to make us feel us uncomfortable as the recognisable Monster that was to become becomes apparent.It is Brandauer's calm and chilly persona that is both compelling and slightly disturbing. In Mephisto in comparison he is far more dramatic even overthetop though the critics might say otherwise. As Redl coolly bulldozes his way through the ranks craftily getting on the right side of everyone he needs to his feelings toward a younger officer let slip and after the affair his decimation from power is calculatingly abrupt and shocking revealing a paranoid State.There is excellent support from Armin MuellerStahl recognisable from many English speaking films usually as a German SS officer as the doomed but supremely powerful and influential Archduke Franz Ferdinand.The period detail is perfect as is the cinematography looking radiantly splendid in the great halls and ballrooms beautifully evocative in the snowy wastelands and suitably grim in the film's darker moments.As I said Colonel Redl certainly deserves to be as known as Mephisto  and of course both far more than just specialist films for Art House lovers that they seem to be casually categorised as.My DVD was a Korean release that once the subtitles were changed to English from the default Korean played like just like a 'normal' one.".

I've always preferred this 1985 film to Klaus Maria Brandauer's  and director Istvn Szab's Oscar winning 'Mephisto' from 1981.'Mephisto' won an Oscar for Foreign language film and as such Istvn Szab remains Hungary's only ever Academy Award recipient.

	schema:headline " Wonderful film but preposterous history";
	schema:reviewBody "Reviewers who emphasize the cinematic excellence of this film  superb casting and acting subtle dramatics beautiful cinematography  are absolutely correct. But and this is a very big but those who see the film for the first time or watch it repeatedly as I do should be aware that as a presentation of the Colonel Redl espionage case it is preposterous.The best starting point for evaluating the film's historical quotient is to go back to E. E. Kisch's reporting on the case. Kisch a colorful Prague journalist for the Germanlanguage newspaper Bohemia broke the case in 1913 several days after Redl's compulsory suicide and a misleading report put out by the General Staff in a Viennese newspaper. Within days the efforts of the General Staff to mislead the public about what had happened was undermined by Kisch and then by other reporting within Austria Hungary and abroad. Kisch came back to the story after WWI in which he served as a corporal in the infantry then after being wounded as a lieutenant in the army's press service examined documents and interviewed Redl's colleagues and participants in the case. This resulted in a short book published in Berlin in 1924 the 1931 CzechGerman film in the IMDb list credits Kisch as a screenwriter and uses the title of his book for the film's title.There is an English translation of this book in a 1997 bioanthology of Kisch and his work as the star of reportage by the American writer Harold B. Segel. The other English source for information about Redl's life and career is a 1959 interpretive biography by Robert Asprey The Panther's FeastAsprey managed to get access to ministerial archives with information on the case that had never been seen by journalists or outsiders before. John Osborne cited Asprey's book as a source of information for his Redl play A Patriot for Me which though totally fanciful gives a more credible psychological portrait of Redl than Szabo does. And there are halfadozen books about the case written in German between the 1920s and just a few years ago to Austrians Redl is the spy of the 20th century. The consequences of Redl's years of very well paid espionage on behalf of Russia were assumed by his contemporaries to have been devastating at the outset of WWI though historians argue about just how damaging his treachery was.Szabo creates a portrait of a selfconflicted man destroyed by an opportunistic and selfcentered dynasty and government  a man set up for false charges. This is the complete opposite of the truth. While the General Staff was remiss in its opportunity to investigate while Redl was still alive demanding honorcode suicide instead and went out of its way to suppress the truth it eventually got out and the man at the center of the real story should arouse neither sympathy nor admiration he was venal crafty and icecold during his approximately 10 years of espionage betraying classified military information and selling out numerous Austrian agents to Russian intelligence. He did it to fund an extravagant lifestyle whether or not he was originally blackmailed into spying by the Russians. Historically he ranks with other highranking moles within a nation's intelligence service akin to Kim Philby for instance.Szabo's portrait of Archduke Franz Ferdinand the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to ensnare Redl is also ridiculous. As unlikable and prejudiced as he was the Successor like his uncle the Emperor dreaded military scandals and would hardly have created a plan to publicize a very demoralizing one given Redl's high position and glorious reputation within the General Staff. In response to the discovery of Redl's treason he went after the General Staff with a vengeance though for practical and political reasons he could not have its Chief General Conrad von Hoetzendorf dismissed at the time. But Franz Ferdinand who thought that Hungarians were the major internal threat to the monarchy's stability has always been a popular villain in Hungary.Reviewers who comment on the betrayal theme in the movie are also right. Szabo's version presents a fictionalized Redl story that reflects the repressive Hungarian state and its obnoxious secret political police in the 1950s the period of his coming to age and his entry into filmmaking when he too was compromised by the system. The Kubinyi family connection of the film is also fictional possibly based on novels by Robert Musil or Sandor Marai both wellknown in the Hungary of Szabo's youth. In life Redl had been through a series of homosexual dalliances with both civilians and other military men and one of the factors in his downfall was a rash decision he made during a romantic crisis with his protg and former paramour  Lieutenant Stefan Horinka of the 7th Uhlan Regiment. Though different names are used this relationship is at least depicted in the 1931 and 1955 Redl films.The events of Redl's fatal day May 24th25th 1913 are an exciting crime and detective story completely missing in Szabo's film where Kubinyi is sent as a messenger demanding suicide and Redl agonizes because he knows he is not guilty of treason. In reality hours after his detection as a spy Redl was confronted by a commission of four officers who supplied him with a pistol which he used within several hours to blow his brains out. That's the Redl story though more recent historians have discovered many flaws in Kisch's version and there are still some unknowns due to destroyed files done in order to protect General Staff officer reputations and though Kisch went to his grave in 1948 without fully revealing his inside sources of information on the case.So viewers beware. While Oberst Redl is truly a wonderful film it strays so far from the record that its presentation of the case is historically meaningless. The meaning comes from Szabo's experience not Redl's.".

It follows the life of Alfred Redl Klaus Maria Brandauer who rose from humble origins to become a spymaster for Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand but struggled to repress his homosexuality and eventually betrayed his country.The movie makes Redl less treasonous than he seems to have been in reality and Brandauer's performance keeps him sympathetic too. We see how Redl's extreme loyalty to the army destroys his humanity and fills him with selfloathing thus when he finally stops lying to himself it comes as a relief even though this now means that he is lying to everybody else.Colonel Redl is probably too long 2 hours 20 minutes for the story it wants to tell and yet it still sometimes glosses over its characters' motivations. For instance Redl claims he has no interest in marrying then the very next scene depicts his wedding and his wife never gets sufficiently characterized. Sometimes the scene transitions are subtly clever other times they are abrupt and choppy.Colonel Redl is thus neither accurate history nor fully engaging drama but it is a good portrait of the declining AustroHungarian empire. It shows many of the factors that led to World War I pervasive ethnic tensions the belief that war was necessary and proper and a military command more concerned with preserving archaic ideals than with investigating actual pressing threats. In the end they paid for this when discontented Serbians assassinated Franz Ferdinand and started World War Ithe war that caused the world of Colonel Redl to disappear for good.".

	schema:headline " Little memorable beyond Brandauer and the ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Oberst Redl or Colonel Redl is an Oscarnominated movie from 1985 so this one already had its 30th anniversary last year. It is a collaboration by four European countries and the language spoken in here is German. This is a bit surprising as Hungary one of the four countries submitted it to the Academy Awards were it got in but lost to the Argentinian entry eventually just like at the Golden Globes. A BAFTA win isn't too shabby either though. The reason why it got in for Hungary is probably writer and director Istvn Szab one of the mostrespected European filmmakers at this time. He also directed the Oscarwinning Mephisto 4 years earlier another collaboration with actor Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer an Austrianborn actor like Szab was among the finest Europe had to offer back then and he was also a success at Hollywood.But sadly I cannot really share the praise all these awards bodies had for Oberst Redl. This may however also have to do with the time in which this film plays a historic era that I personally never had the biggest interest in. This film easily makes it past the 2hour mark and if you don't manage to appreciate it quickly it will drag on several occasions. I would not say that the actors are to blame here. Armin MuellerStahl and Landgrebe are still somewhat known in Germany today but I am mostly referring to lead actor Brandauer with this statement. I am sure this movie would have been considerably worse without him as he is pretty convincing like always and this is definitely one of his career defining roles. I think you can say that now that he in his 70s. The ending especially was one brilliant moment of acting for Brandauer. I will not go into detail about the exact scene but you will definitely know what I mean when I say it's difficult to find a better portrayal of involuntary closure. Certainly a contender for best film scene of the entire year and Brandauer brings his Agame there. But it is still not worth to set through everything else before that in this period piece. I wish Szab would have kept it at least 35 minutes preferrably more shorter and would have included much more focus and better more interesting character development aside from the title character. This way there is really no reason to see it other than Brandauer. I do not recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".
