	schema:reviewBody "Audie Murphy's screen autobiography is a much better film than it has any right to be... The Army provides a Depressionera kid from East Texas with a strong family structure that he has never really experienced...In 1937 a young Audie Murphy played by Gordon Gebert as a boy by Murphy himself later is forced to become the head of a family with an ailing mother and an absent father... He drops out of grade school and goes to work full time to provide for his younger siblings until at roughly the same time World War II starts and his mother dies... By enlisting in Murphy can provide more money for his brothers but neither the Navy nor the Marines were interested in the small guy...In the Army Murphy is promoted to Corporal on the troop ship carrying him overseas where he joins the 3rd Infantry Division B Company 15th Regiment... It soon becomes apparent that the likable 'baby face kid' hardly old enough to shave has a genuine aptitude for soldiering...After North Africa his outfit takes part in the invasions of Sicily Anzio and Southern France... In every engagement Murphy steps up and excels as a soldier... At the same time he becomes friends with Brandon Charles Drake Johnson Marshall Thompson and Kerrigan Jack Kelly. He sees himself as part of a unit and everything that he does is meant to advance the unit not the individual... Murphy liked to work alone putting only himself at risk...The one long scene that moves away from the Militaryan interlude in an Italian town where he meets Maria Susan Kohner and her family is embarrassingly bad... As long as the focus stays on the platoon's activities on the battlefield the film is in fine shape... Director Jesse Hibbs makes the cold mud and rain of the Italian campaign believably real especially a series of scenes revolving around a farmhouse and a burning tank...One might assume that Murphy's indomitable courage would be described as Rambolike heroics but in comparing the film with the official combat reports it is clear that Murphy became an astounding soldier by skill training intelligence and luck... He was an equal opportunity soldier doing everything the front line combatant is required to do in order to take and hold ground through Sicily Italy France and into Germany...All of the events recounted in the film take place before Murphy was 19 years old... In that brief military career Audie L. Murphy becomes one of the best fighting combat soldiers of the last century... He never really seemed to care about the medals or glory just the men of his unit and friends who fall down in the European Theater of Operations... Murphy died tragically on May 28 1971 when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into a mountain near Roanoke Virginia... He was 46.His last film role was earlier that year playing Jesse James in 'A Time for Dying.'".

As much as Saving Private Ryan introduced a new generation to horrors and heroism of World War II To Hell and Back introduces you to one of the men who lived through it.  It doesn't attempt to glorify the War it simply relates what happened to America's most decorated soldier based on his own story and actually staring him.  While it's amazing that the baby faced Murphy still looks young enough in 1955 for the story to work 15 years after the fact the truly amazing thing is that from most accounts Murphy understates his own role in many of the events described in the movie. The final war scene for instance shows him holding off an entire German regiment using artilery and the machine gun of a burning tank.  The fact is that he held that ground alone for well over an hour before the germans finally gave up.  All the while the tank was burning and could have exploded at any time. Like many great soldiers however he had trouble adjusting to life after the war even with a semisuccessful acting career aided by James Cagney after the war.  Still it's men like this who risked and often gave their lives on the fields of Europe and Africa and in the waters and islands of the pacific that we have to thank for the Freedoms we enjoy in the United States today.

What makes this movie very special is the fact that the most ever to date decorated US soldier two dozen of the highest medals and a Congressional Medal of Honor receiver not only lived through the war but in fact played himself ! after being talked into it seems he didn't want to play himself he thought it would degrade the Medal of Honor. I watched a run of this movie on the History Channel it was a show called is it 'History or Hollywood' where by at the end of the show 3 Historians discuss a movie for Historic correctness every one said if anything this movie was under stated of what Audie Murphy truly did in Europe during WWII one said it was down played because of Audie Murphy himself because his Army recorded as witness by others has him doing lots more but that was the personality of Audie Murphy imagine watching a movie were the battle's and the deeds are true they called out a seen where Audie's best friend gets shot he really did go ballistic charging at the German machine gun nest that killed him picks up a German Machine gun then proceeds to take out 2 or 3 more gun sites by using the German gun it didn't give a warning to the Germans he saved countless American lives coming up that mountain a brilliant movie.

	schema:headline " Liked it should know Audie's History first";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie not so much because it is a great movie  it is an average war movie of this era but because it made me reflect about reality versus perception and how you can be very wrong about something by taking it at face value. Let me explain. My perception If I had to pick a platoon for battle I would never pick Audie Murphy. At 5'5 maybe 110 lbs a high tinny voice and hyperkinetic motion he seems more like someone that would get killed early and easily or worse get you killed. The reality he was the man you wanted in your platoon when the battle started. He was made of heroic stuff. He wasn't a tough talking braggart. He was just a soldier that would do anything to save his brothers and get home alive. He of course isn't the only example of this. He just got his own movie. It was a good thing that he was an actor because John Wayne would have played his part if he hadn't been which would have been a real shame because you would have lost the true meaning behind the story. Hollywood prefers style over substance. It would have been a truedisservice to all of the short underweight chirpy men in the world.Think about Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne who would you want in your platoon. John Wayne is your probable choice. Now compare Jimmy Stewart's military career with John Wayne's. John Wayne avoided WWII instead using it to advance his career when many of his contemporaries went to war. Jimmy Stewart on the other hand joined the Air Force 9 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor. He had to force the Air Force to let him in because he was under weight. He was a bomber pilot that flew 20 missions. His wartime decorations included the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster four Air Medals and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. Now who do you want on your side. I'll take the battle hardened frail looking stuttering veteran over the tough talking strapping strutting Hollywood pretender any day.So when I watch the movie I think about the reality of Audie Murphy. Which leaves me with the feeling that if you put your heart into it you can do anything. So when you watch the movie think about the reality. You have a 5'5 war hero that actually became a Hollywood action hero which is improbable in itself.".

	onyx:emotionText "I liked this movie not so much because it is a great movie  it is an average war movie of this era but because it made me reflect about reality versus perception and how you can be very wrong about something by taking it at face value. Let me explain. My perception If I had to pick a platoon for battle I would never pick Audie Murphy. At 5'5 maybe 110 lbs a high tinny voice and hyperkinetic motion he seems more like someone that would get killed early and easily or worse get you killed. The reality he was the man you wanted in your platoon when the battle started. He was made of heroic stuff. He wasn't a tough talking braggart. He was just a soldier that would do anything to save his brothers and get home alive. He of course isn't the only example of this. He just got his own movie. It was a good thing that he was an actor because John Wayne would have played his part if he hadn't been which would have been a real shame because you would have lost the true meaning behind the story.

	schema:headline " A story that really deserved a better movie";
	schema:reviewBody "To Hell And Back is based on the autobiography of Audie Murphy the most decorated American soldier of the second world war with Murphy playing himself. The film begins by establishing Murphy's humble beginnings as the eldest of several children abandoned by their father in rural northeastern Texas. After their mother dies Audie's siblings are put into an orphanage and he joins the armed forces. After being turned down by the Marine Corps and the Navy he joins the Army and soon arrives up in North Africa as a replacement with B Baker Company 15th Infantry Regiment 3rd Infantry Division. Given how susceptible Murphy is to seasickness it was probably for the best that the more nautical services rejected him. He is too late to see action in Africa but he gets plenty as the division proceeds to fight its way through Sicily the Salerno and Anzio bridgeheads in Sicily lands in southern France and fights its way up to the German border. Along the way Murphy rises through the ranks from private to lieutenant and is leading B Company before his military career is cut short by a piece of shrapnel just a few months before VEDay. A number of episodes also touch on his background such as when discovers that one of his squadmates abandoned his wife and child much like Murphy's dad and when he meets an Italian family where the father similarly disappeared.It's a spectacular story I should note I read the book before seeing the movie and the film's main failing is that it really doesn't do the story justice. The combat scenes are too few and too sparse given all Murphy went through but the real problem is that Universal was too stingy with funds for extras and locations. The action takes place in the Mediterranean and France in a variety of terrain and seasons but none of the locations look like Europe there's not a paved road village or church steeple in sight and the vegetation screams western United States. I would guess that the combat sequences were all filmed on the training grounds of the Fort Lewis Military Reservation just up the road from where I live in Washington state in the space of a couple of weeks in late springearly summer. All the sequences of naval vessels amphibious landings and aircraft are all plainly stock footage. Naples looks suspiciously like a generic southern European town set on a Hollywood backlot and there are too few people on the street for such a major city. Similarly the battle scenes seem to have way too few people in them causing the front line to look about 30 meters long. The Big Red One had similar problems being mostly shot in Israel though that location at least looks Mediterranean. Furthermore the film suffers from being too sanitized and I don't just mean the language. Murphy and his fellow dogfaces look freshly shaved and showered at all times with the creases still visible in their pants. Any mud on their clothing looks like the costume department painted it on. Rather than a harrowing ordeal To Hell And Back feels like a day trip to the nearest National Park with the enemy presenting only a minor and brief annoyance. Bill Mauldin's Willie and Joe cartoons did an infinitely better job of conveying the miserable conditions under which the infantryman did his job.To Hell And Back is a perfectly adequate 1950s war movie but it falls far short of the lofty goal it sets itself.".

Murphy still in his teens won about every decoration for valor that the human mind can dream up  and he earned them too. The experience wrecked him. He made movies later in his life always boyish looking and modest sounding. But he suffered from PTSD. He was tormented by nightmares of firing an M1 at attacking Germans and having his rifle fall apart piece by piece. He slept with a Colt pistol under his pillow and attacked another man with a baseball bat. His many medals were stashed in disarray in a drawer. He died in a plane crash.Hollywood has taken this man's remarkable story lifting pieces of it from his memoirs left out the most poignant passages and twisted Murphy's remaining heroics into pablum. An example of what I mean. In the book written in the present tense Murphy describes his first encounter with the enemy and sees one of his targets fall. Now I have killed he writes and goes on to explain his emotions.No room for any such ruminations in the movie. We see Murphy rejected by the other services for being too young or too short. In the Third Infantry Division he is ridiculed in a goodnatured way by the usual stereotypes from other war movies  the guy who brags about his sexual exploits the stoic Indian the ambitious Pole the reckless good friend. The musical score suits the film a high school marching band plays On Wisconsin or something.Murphy's achievements provide a peg to hang a formulaic war movie on. No clich is avoided. On leave at last with his fellow troopers in Rome they all head off to get drunk and get laid leaving the bashful hero behind. The shy Murphy winds up spending the night with an accommodating young woman while the others are either satisfied with finding someone to talk to or find themselves in some other sort of dead end. The next morning all the men brag about their conquests while the reticent Murphy says nothing about his night of romance.The battle scenes are pretty good though again they fit the Hollywood mold. The writers even are forced  get this  they are forced to downplay or skip over Murphy's boldest actions  because they are UNBELIEVABLE. The guy's military achievements are so extravagant that the writers must have figured no one would believe them although to be sure what's left in is heroic enough.It isn't a bad movie or rather it wouldn't be if it were fictional from beginning to end. It would just be a standard genre effort from the 1950s inferior to say Battleground or The Story of G. I. Joe. But it pretends to be a true story and it is simply not.What a tragic waste  of the rest of what life remained to Murphy and of an historically accurate narrative that was never told.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of course this movie sanitizes WWII look at the year it was made the Hollywood censors would NEVER have allowed a Saving Private Ryan film to be released. That said this is a true story starring the man who actually lived through everything it shows and much much more besides. I knew Audie personally and I can tell you that he was and could really do anything you saw him do on the screen. He actually did kill 283 German soldiers not as a unit action but he himself with his own guns! If anything this movie down plays his real life heroics to a large extent. Audie's book tells a lot more detail about what happened during the War. When I knew him Audie suffered from severe PTSD but the VA had not recognized that as a real medical problem so he never got treatment for it. He did sleep with a pistol under his pillow every night of his life and he carried a loaded gun on his person everywhere he went every day of his life I do the same thing btw...and the VA treated me for PTSD after 'Nam. Finally this is a wonderful movie about all the brave heroes who fought in those campaigns dying maimed or just lucky enough to come home at the end. Audie was a much better actor than he was ever allowed to be by Universal Studios. His Westerns made money and that was the studio's bottom line. BTW...To Hell and Back was the BIGGEST money maker for Universal until Jaws was released...that's not a bad record for Hollywood...20 yrs. worth of Dollars in the bank.".

	onyx:emotionText "Of course this movie sanitizes WWII look at the year it was made the Hollywood censors would NEVER have allowed a Saving Private Ryan film to be released. That said this is a true story starring the man who actually lived through everything it shows and much much more besides. I knew Audie personally and I can tell you that he was and could really do anything you saw him do on the screen. He actually did kill 283 German soldiers not as a unit action but he himself with his own guns! If anything this movie down plays his real life heroics to a large extent. Audie's book tells a lot more detail about what happened during the War. When I knew him Audie suffered from severe PTSD but the VA had not recognized that as a real medical problem so he never got treatment for it. He did sleep with a pistol under his pillow every night of his life and he carried a loaded gun on his person everywhere he went every day of his life I do the same thing btw...and the VA treated me for PTSD after 'Nam.

Like many other Medal of Honor winners he like the others are not the movie RAMBO hero. They Are THE REAL McCOYS It's ironic though. His last movie in 1971 was called A time for dyingA Jesse James movie. In that same year he died in a small plane crash.

To Hell and Back is his story but it's also the story of the men who served with him those who came back from hell and those who remained.What I liked best about To Hell and Back was the camaraderie and spirit and the relationships between Murphy and the men of his outfit. The story starts in North Africa where his company arrives too late for the fighting there but just in time to be part of the offensive to take Sicily. Then it's Salerno up the western Italian coast and into France with the landings in Southern France until Germany. At each stop Murphy grows in admiration and respect from those over and around him. Such players as Jack Kelly Paul Picerni Marshall Thompson and Charles Drake support Murphy very well.To Hell and Back also shows what a roll of the dice combat is. It could just as easily been Murphy as any of the cast that is killed and doesn't make it to the end of the film. Staying alive is a singular accomplishment. All of these guys are heroes. A lot of the fame and glory Murphy won was due to luck and opportunity and he would have been the first to admit it.When do you get a film with 100 perfect casting for the lead? you get it in To Hell and Back with Audie Murphy playing the man his comrades called Little Texas. A nice film about the greatest soldier of the greatest generation.".

The film is not only about Murphy's exploits in the war but the people he met and became great friends with. It also shows the sorrow and tragedy of war very well throwing in some romantic moments here and there which is nice relief from all the action. What you'll realize about Murphy's performance is how real it is because it's a rare moment in movies when someone plays themselves in an actual moment that changed their lives.Go watch this great war movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I was moved by this autobiography based film about the most decorated soldier of WWII Audie Murphy. The actor deserved another medal for reliving his heroic but traumatizing life as a combat soldier. The film begins in 1937 with Murphy's very humble beginnings as a young boy in northeast Texas. His father has abandoned the family and twelve yearold Audie is supporting his ill mother and seven younger brothers and sisters by working for a neighbouring farmer. Four years later just as the attack on Pearl Harbor happens Audie's mother dies and painfully he is forced to remand his siblings to the state orphanage. In desperate need to raise enough money to support them Audie turns to the military and the film takes you on his journey through the war. The battle sequences depicting Murphy's astounding heroic exploits are excellent and Audie Murphy's performance and delivery is very eventempered which helps to maintain the reality of the story. The supporting cast is strong with reliable performances delivered from actors Marshall Thompson Charles Drake Jack Kelly and David Janssen. Yes in today's film world of superior special effects and high definition and if this film was made today they probably would of went to Europe to film right on location but I found this 1955 film hits the mark adequately. This truly touching picture is well worth a look.".

I'm an ex marine who's a huge war movie buff I watched pretty much everything so I started getting into the classics Id never even heard of this movie just bought it buying some other war films and after watching it it's definitely become one of my absolute favorites. Although it was made over 50 years ago watching it was greatly entertaining and then after finding out it starred the actual person who went through and did all of this made it even more intriguing and fascinating for me I think it's better than Saving Private Ryan. I think one of the other reasons it's so good is because it's basically non stop real life action there's no time to get bored with it like you do with some action films and it's all quality mad even for it's age no cheap photography and video tricks. I would highly recommend this movie to any war film lovers old or young I'm 24 and absolutely loved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Audie Murphy was never much of an actor. The only movie he starred in that is worth watching is To Hell and Back in which he does a decent job of acting though one suspects that other actors could have done much better. And yet the movie just would not have been the same without him.In the book on which this movie was based Murphy referred to his thin frame and cursed baby face which made his commanding officer want to keep him away from the front giving him light duty but Murphy kept sneaking off with patrols and scouting parties. Eventually the company commander gave up and put Murphy back in the front lines. Because our idea of a hero is someone who looks like Rambo Murphy would never have been cast in this part had the movie been fictional. Even knowing that the movie was based on a true story the audience might still have been incredulous had a little man with a baby face other than Murphy played the part. Imagine Elisha Cook Jr. in that role. But by having Murphy play the part himself we are forced to accept the fact that the kind of actor who plays the hero in a typical movie and the kind of man who is a real hero can be two very different things. And when we reflect on the fact that Murphy was thirty years old when he made the movie we realize he must have really looked like a baby when he enlisted at the age of seventeen.We all know that movies often diverge from the books they are based on and so we usually just assess the movie on its own terms. There is one event described in the book however that is worth calling attention to especially since almost no one has read it. Early in the war when Murphy's company is in Sicily they come across a couple of Italian officers. Murphy describes the magnificent white horses the Italians mount and on which they ride away. Murphy raises his rifle fires twice killing them both. The lieutenant is appalled. He asks Murphy why he did that saying he should not have shot them. Murphy argues back telling the lieutenant that that killing the enemy is our job. Murphy notes that new men are trained to talk tough and act tough but it takes a while before they accept the fact that they are supposed to deal out death and that the lieutenant had not yet accepted that fact.The Italian officers were the first two men Murphy killed and it is the most unforgettable passage in the book but there is no mystery why it never made its way into the movie. Generally speaking we do not like to see our heroes shoot retreating men in the back in cold blood. In most war movies bullets are flying back and forth and so it is kill or be killed. But Murphy's life was not in danger when he pulled the trigger. Better still we like it when something happens that makes the war personal. Later in the movie in the scene where Murphy charges up a hill and singlehandedly takes out two machine gun nests what precipitates his heroism is the death of his friend which makes him angry. But Murphy was not angry when he killed the Italian officers.There is another reason why that event never made it into the movie. There is an unwritten law that in any movie set during World War II under no circumstances will an American soldier be seen killing Italians just as there must be no scene of Italian soldiers killing Americans. Granted the early surrender of the Italians made the occasion for killing or being killed by Italians infrequent but not so infrequent that the occasion did not occur in Murphy's case. The Italians did not sneak attack us at Pearl Harbor and the Italians did not run camps like Auschwitz. They were a pipsqueak nation that never had much of a chance to do anything to us and so we suppress combat scenes between American and Italian soldiers.Along these lines in the typical combat movie made during World War II there is the obligatory ethnic diversity an AngloSaxon officer a Mexican a Pole an Irishman an American Indian and always an Italian. We never see GermanAmericans or JapaneseAmericans as part of the mix. Though a lot of JapaneseAmericans were sent to concentration camps euphemistically referred to as relocation centers some still did serve in the American armed forces. But we don't see them so much in the movies though reference is made to one having done so in Bad Day at Black Rock 1955. But no combat movie is complete without an Italian as part of the company America's way of saying that the Italians were really not evil they just got tricked by Mussolini.Even if there is a remake of this movie I doubt that Murphy's killing the Italian officers would be depicted in it either. In fact such a remake would undoubtedly have a scene showing Murphy suffering from PTSD after the war was over regardless of whether that was true or not. In the 1950s we were perfectly comfortable with the idea that soldiers fought World War II with a clean conscience. Today that might disturb us especially after seeing him kill in cold blood.".

During the opening sequence Martin watches a breakin on the other side of the street. In the morning his friend Henry forces him to report it to the police yet Martin gets bored with the cops and flees. The two of them spent the rest of the day escaping the law in the Munich zoo and a public bath were Martin meets Barbara. Block the record company executive needs Martin's new song lyrics right away and Martin who continually cranks out mad random remarks comes up with a ridiculous sailor song. In the end Martin's playful ness collides with the authority the police represents. The movie is certainly not plot based it draws its superior humor from oneliners and the hilarious carefree insanity of its protagonist.";

And the film is also a contender for Uschi Glas' most known work as she was nominated for a German Film Award too. She was in her early 20s here and almost half a century later she is still really famous in Germany and a successful actress. And some German film fans may find other familiar faces. The film is in blackandwhite and runs for 75 minutes only. To me it seemed a bit similar to the French artistic blackandwhite films from back then even if I must say I was not really convinced. It is always tough if a film lacks a plot completely and is basically a collection of impressions only almost a road movie to some extent. I must say Enke definitely elevates the material and it would have been worse without. But all in all I still found it too bland and uninteresting and the tense final scene did not save it but seemed almost a bit desperate so people would still remember it despite all the boredom from previously. And I always thought Glas was not a very talented actress but really more charismatic than with lots of range and this film cannot alter my opinion. She is clearly inferior to her male colead. I did not find it a good watch and give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

Having said that if you fit the description above or like two of the film's main character you are a foreigner immersed in Berlin's recent and present position as Europe's edgiest capital city this drama is a feast.The plot crams in many aspects of contemporary unorthodox Eastern Berlin Prenzlauer Berg life East German nostalgia its 70s  80s music attitude architecture the local gayalternative scene and Berlin's cabaret tradition.But the film focuses on the deeper issues of living with HIVAIDS in the present postantiviral cocktail era rampant alcoholism among twenty and thirty something young adults not to mention the fragile and transitory nature of friendships and relationships these days. The latter two are the themes I believe most audiences will identify with. The ensemble cast is outstanding and the film has an unusual gritty realism.

It's a pretty straight forward story that could have been lifeless but struck an emotional chord with me due to the acting and the sentimental value of the whole thing. It's also a great fatherson story done from a different and original take.Bobby is your typical badass black leather jacket wearing cigarette smoking drag racing babe magnet who is killed in a game of chicken.  This happens within the first five minutes of the movie and the next thing you know Bobby is on the train to heaven.  Upon getting there he's presented with a small problem.  They won't let him in unless he plays guardian angel and gets his wings.  So it's back to earth for Bobby. He's sent back approximately seventeen years later to help a young geek get his life straight and to give the kid a little selfesteem. This is a wholly enjoyable film that anyone can enjoy.

I cant tell you how Bobby got there as it would spoil one of the films more dramatic moments but I can say you should enjoy all the scenes dealing with his tutoring of Gedrick.  He gives him a better look hot wheels and a little toughness to stand up to the jerks at school.  Its executed pretty well and the pair make a good mismatch.  The film also does a nice job when it has to be dramatic as when Bobby has to deal with a few surprises.  The ending is perfectly heartfelt without going over the line into sappiness as well.  Great soundtrack too with a lot of nicely placed though all unknown songs to accentuate the scenes.  A teen 80s film that got lost in the mix of so many of them this belongs on the list of the good ones.".

	onyx:emotionText "Bobby a hotshot highschooler from the 60s ends up in the 80s to coach a dweebie kid into being a more confident popular guy.  I cant tell you how Bobby got there as it would spoil one of the films more dramatic moments but I can say you should enjoy all the scenes dealing with his tutoring of Gedrick.  He gives him a better look hot wheels and a little toughness to stand up to the jerks at school.  Its executed pretty well and the pair make a good mismatch.  The film also does a nice job when it has to be dramatic as when Bobby has to deal with a few surprises.  The ending is perfectly heartfelt without going over the line into sappiness as well.  Great soundtrack too with a lot of nicely placed though all unknown songs to accentuate the scenes.  A teen 80s film that got lost in the mix of so many of them this belongs on the list of the good ones.";

	schema:headline " Goodhearted rainyday teen flick";
	schema:reviewBody "It is unfortunate that The Heavenly Kid became lost under the vast muddle of slick teen comedies that were so rampant during the mid 1980's. This film which has a preMalcolm In The Middle Jane Kaczmarek Animal House's Mark Metcalf Backdraft's Jason Gedrick and veteran actor Richard Mulligan really shined through for me as an entertaining yet predictable dramedy on guardian angels.It is the story of a brash 1960's greaser named Bobby Fantana amiably played by TV actor Lewis Smith who meets an untimely demise in a drag race accident. Once transported into the Afterlife Bobby teams up with his roguish motorcycledriving spectral mentor Rafferty Mulligan and discovers from him that he hasn't quite earned his right into Paradise and the only way he can redeem himself is to undertake an earthly assignment in assisting the mortals. Fast forwarding to the 1980's Bobby is given the dubious task of coaching Lenny Barnes Gedrick a gifted gawky teen who is a popular target for the class bullies. It's up to him to befriend and guide the boy through his little life crisis and he decides to transform Lenny into a cool confident splittingimage of himself that soon gains the attention of his peers. All is fine until Lenny's newfound cockiness butts heads with his family and with two of his old tormentors who finally challenge him to a drag race of their own. It's then up to Bobby to rectify the damage he has unintentionally done and save Lenny from repeating history while hopefully garnering his wings at last.Although many critics have scathed this film for a rather shallow loopholed storyline The Heavenly Kid does exude some attributes that I have come to enjoy over the years. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard for an 80's teen flick just love Out on the Edge during Bobby's fatal racing scene. Lewis Smith's performance gives a uniquely genial quality to his loner character that makes a sometimes funny OddCouplesque persona with both Gedrick and Mulligan. Seeing Bobby acclimate to the radically different 80's pop culture brings a laugh or two to myself! Finally even though the ending is entirely predictable it always leaves me feeling good inside even on a bleak rainy Saturday.It is also unfortunate that The Heavenly Kid has gone outofprint in recent years! I was lucky enough to record it off of HBO this past summer for my collection but I think it does deserve a chance for a VHSDVD rerelease. This is one comedy that the entire family can enjoy provided there's no objection to some PG13 based language and adult humor.".

At least he got the girl who really means so much to him which was Melissa. They were so totally meant for each other. It was too bad his father isn't with Emily in the end but at least it was a happy ending that the lovebirds reunited!I love the fact this movie is a 50's80's crosser and that it was genuinely funny. This will definitely become an absolute favorite of mine!".

	schema:headline " Corny Clich and Cheesy 80's Comedy with a timeless message";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an 80's comedy that was released exactly the same time Back To The Future was released in the summer of 1985. Back to the Future was enormously more successful than Heavenly Kid not for conceptual reasons but Back to the Future had better supporting cast better lead characters and was gifted with a better screenplay. In fact you can ask anyone over 40 today about Back to the Future and 910 would remember the popularity of Back to the Future while I am certain that 110 of them would recall The Heavenly Kid. It was basically a Box Office bomb.Although Heavenly Kid suffers from corny and cheesy clichs whilst having an inferior cast of actors I cannot help but have a strong sentiment attached to it. It has a very sweet and altruistic message of love and sacrifice while earning salvation through the main character. The theme here is actually more deep and profound than Back to the Future so I think it's inferior popularity begs the question as to why this is so. Heavenly Kid suffers from a lack elementary directing skills a satisfying script and perhaps some realistic twists. Technical merit and acting is not top notch here and these few deficiencies contribute to its inferiority compared to its better contemporary. It is important for every serious movie reviewer to analyze movies with similar themes in order to decode what went wrong for the poorer of the two. The story begins in the early 1960's where a group of youths are meeting near a cliff to watch two adversaries duel in a game of chicken to settle their differences. As we think our hero Bobby has won the match he gets his jacket sleeve caught in the gear shifter  In typical fashion reminiscent of Rebel without a Cause. His car plunges down a cliff where it explodes into his demise. The following scenes are set in a Limboesque environment where he is unsure where he is. He meets with Rafferty perfectly played by Richard Mulligan. Rafferty is sort of his Liaison who will guide him from Limbo to heaven. This is sort of a meetcute where we have an experienced and crusty old man teaching the young and rebellious kid about how to earn his wings and seek redemption. Richard Mulligan has never been better and he is perfectly comfortable in this role as a no nonsense mentor. He explains to Bobby that his job is to help another person. But Bobby is not very sophisticated or intelligent to understand what this entails. At first this gets over his greasy haired head. Bobby is to help a weak and wimpy teenager named Lenny who gets picked on by a couple of bullies at school. Lenny has that typical aggravating existence of insecurity where he gets little respect and cannot muster enough selfconfidence to defend himself. Bobby is the polar opposite of Lenny in Character. He's slimy confident tough as nails stronger than an ox and is as manly as they come. When Bobby observes Lenny and learns that this will be his assignment he is not too keen on the idea but would rather go through than settle for the alternative. While Lenny is reading a poem near a cliff he unexpectedly loses his balance and the clumsy kid plummets about a 100 feet until this strange guy Bobby catches the clumsy Lenny in his arms. Bobby makes a wry comment about how the kid should be careful. As Lenny's limp body is cradled in Bobby's arms he precariously opens his eyes to see what has happened. Befuddled by this stranger's sudden appearance and incredible strength he regains composure. Bobby plants Lenny back on his feet and walks off as the kid thanks him. Bobby thinks this is the extent of his assignment but Rafferty doesn't let Bobby earn the prize so easily. His job is to inspire confidence in this insecure and wimpy teenager. You can pretty much guess at this point where the movie is headed. The rest of the film combines a mixture of mildly crude and scatological humor while also being corny. The parents always appear to be your typical parents of 80's movies. The cute girls are always flirtatious and suggest a propensity to sex more than girls in reality are. The Heavenly Kid is actually pretty stupid at times with its silly themes but the story redeems itself in the final 20 minutes where our lead character chooses to save his friend's life instead of saving his soul  the ultimate expression of loyalty and friendship.Lenny does become more popular with the girls as a result of changing his dress and attitude courtesy of Bobby's mentoring. But Lenny only changes his faade. He lacks the toughness and strength to defend himself against physical fights. He relies on Bobby's toughness and fighting strengths to save his life and protect him in fights. Bobby in essence acts as his Guardian angel bodyguard mentor and fiend. In the climax it's Bobby who learns the most about himself and that sometimes being tough and acting cool is not enough in life.".

That good deed just happens to be taking a dork Jason Gedrick and turning him into a winner. Everything about this film is rather campy and corny but I've been a fan of this film since I was a little kid and caught it on some station that I can't remember now. This was my first time watching the movie in at least ten years and I must say it did contain that nostalgic feel and I still enjoyed it. The film has some of the dumbest lines but they made me laugh. The story is stupid but it's still funny. The performances are all one note but I've always felt Lewis Smith was very funny because he's playing someone cool yet he really doesn't come off too cool.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truly terrible 80s teen flick about a greaser from the 60s Lewis Smith dying in a car crash.  To get into heaven he has to help this total nerd Jason Gedrick in the 80s to become a stud.The plot is totally predictable the humor is either childish or PG13 raunchy and the acting truly sucks.  But...this movie was so incredibly bad I couldn't stop watching!  Smith's acting is so terrible it's actually fascinating to watch.  Gedrick a very good actor is totally miscast and the poor guy looks embarrassed for most of the movie.  In small roles Jane Kaczmarek and Richard Mulligan shine...but it's not enough to save this. The script is beyond beliefit has such ridiculous twists and turns that I actually thought they were kidding!  Cliches that were being laughed out of theatres in the 1950s are dredged up and presented with straightfaced sincerity.  Seriously did the screenwriters REALLY think this was a clever funny little movie?  Did they really think throwing old hoary cliched situations at the audience was a good idea?  SPOILER AHEAD!!!!  I almost stopped watching when it was revealed that Gedrick's mother was Smith's lover in the past.  Come on!  We're really supposed to take that seriously? It's just a prime example of lazy script writing.  SPOILER OVER!!!!Worth seeing as a prime example of how NOT to do a teen comedy.  This was a huge bomb in 1985it's easy to see why.  I'd love to know what Gedrick and Smith think of this film now.".

	onyx:emotionText "Truly terrible 80s teen flick about a greaser from the 60s Lewis Smith dying in a car crash.  To get into heaven he has to help this total nerd Jason Gedrick in the 80s to become a stud.The plot is totally predictable the humor is either childish or PG13 raunchy and the acting truly sucks.  But...this movie was so incredibly bad I couldn't stop watching!  Smith's acting is so terrible it's actually fascinating to watch.  Gedrick a very good actor is totally miscast and the poor guy looks embarrassed for most of the movie.  In small roles Jane Kaczmarek and Richard Mulligan shine...but it's not enough to save this. The script is beyond beliefit has such ridiculous twists and turns that I actually thought they were kidding!  Cliches that were being laughed out of theatres in the 1950s are dredged up and presented with straightfaced sincerity.

It is instead a quiet maybe too slowmoving film about a teenage girl at the cusp of womanhood trying to learn about what Vietnam had been like for her father who was killed there. She also begins to see her exG.I. uncle clearly for the first time as a survivor of something terrible. In Country is about the Vietnam War only as in the sense that it's also about a family's history whose impact bridges the generations. It's less about events than it is about becoming a grownup in an America that has a sixtysecond attention span and a fifteenminute memory. Emily Lloyd who you'd never guess is English does a beautifully sensitive job in the starring role and Bruce Willis as her uncle turns in a very fine very dignified performance.".

This is a touching movie from the perspective of the daughter of a Vietnam soldier killed in the line of duty. The use of flashbacks was done well in this movie as some movies make flashbacks too often and in unrelated order. The relationships among the characters were believable.

	schema:headline " Willis and ending make up for Emily Lloyd";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked two main things about the movie adaptation of In Country. One was Bruce Willis' performance. I'd read a bit about it beforehand but I was quite impressed with the way he held his pain just under the surface for most of the film. We could almost see the wall he had put up for himself and against himself. His meeting with Sam in the swamp fascinated me. I'm really interested in the gradual changes that occur in people and in the swamp his wall finally breaks a bit and he lets Sam in. It's a very powerful scene by an underrated actor. I believe he won a Golden Globe nomination for this film for what that's worth.The other thing I really liked was the final sequence at the Vietnam Memorial. The director and screenwriter realized that they didn't need to spoil it with a lot of philosophical junk about the tragedy of war. They show us using the darkness and slow decent of the wall the people's reactions and the characters' reactions. As much as I disliked Sam I nearly got teary when she climbed up the ladder and kissed her daddy's name. Emmitt's scene where he leaves his awards there with his friends is another great onehardly any possibly no words simply the act of giving part of his past to his friends who didn't make it back.I noticed several changes in the movie and the discussion afterwards showed me more. The most obvious was the structure the movie is a straight linear story while the book is a framed story. I don't think the frame wouldn't have worked too well as a film because I don't think most audiences want the bulk of a movie to be a flashbacklook back type portrayal. I guess it seems too slow. One of the ones that bothered me the most was the change in Tom's character. In the book Tom has some kind of impotence or relationship problem because of the war. This prevents him from following his lust and taking Sam to bed. In the movie it is implied that they do sleep together and that Tom ends the relationship because he feels guilty or because of her age not because of impotence or relationship issues. Many aspects of the book and storyline are understandably simplified to save time. Thankfully the Agent Orange obsession that Sam has in the book is largely absent in the movie. For example Sam's two sets of grandparents are combined into her father's parents. She also spends less time with Dawn and she goes directly from her grandparents' house to the swamp to read Dwayne's diary. We also don't see as much that she's out there to relate to the soldiers instead she seems more like a little girl camping in her backyard.This brings me to my final point.  Emily Lloyd's performance was annoying. Everything about herher voice her accent her appearance her actions the way she ran especially the way she ranno trained runner would ever run like that during a racewas annoying. Sure part of it was simply because her character is like that. She begs and begs everyone to tell her about Vietnam but when Emmitt finally does a bit she can't handle it and she decides briefly that she doesn't like her father anymore because of what he did in the war. What did she expect? She just seems nave and annoying and that's not a fun combination. However I must admit she did make some progress and at the end of the movie when she leaves the photo of herself at Dwayne's grave she has gained an idea of what war was like and the effects it has on veterans.If you like the movie you might like the book even more. If you liked the book but haven't seen the movie watch it simply to see Willis as Emmitt.".

Sure Emily Lloyd's character had an annoying voice but at least she wasn't that bad to look at. I was very impressed at Bruce's acting ability in this movie. He can actually do dramatic roles!

Opening in late September 1989 this film was touted in all the major newspapers as Bruce Willis' Oscar role though he was overlooked by the Academy when the time came. Seen today the picture doesn't seem to have any purpose except to showcase the actor's range limited as it is and also to squeeze dry the remaining emotions left behind by the Vietnam experienceHollywood style. Emily Lloyd as the kid in question and Peggy Rea as Mamaw are tiresome copies of distinctly oldfashioned archetypesthe wise juvenile and the salty matriarchused over and over in similar movie scenarios since WWII and probably beyond. Norman Jewison directed without an ounce of honest inspiration. Whatever discussions or suspicions are addressed in the script they're pretty much forgotten by the finalewhich does everything just shy of saluting. 12 from ".

Opening in late September 1989 this film was touted in all the major newspapers as Bruce Willis' Oscar role though he was overlooked by the Academy when the time came. Seen today the picture doesn't seem to have any purpose except to showcase the actor's range limited as it is and also to squeeze dry the remaining emotions left behind by the Vietnam experienceHollywood style. Emily Lloyd as the kid in question and Peggy Rea as Mamaw are tiresome copies of distinctly oldfashioned archetypesthe wise juvenile and the salty matriarchused over and over in similar movie scenarios since WWII and probably beyond. Norman Jewison directed without an ounce of honest inspiration. Whatever discussions or suspicions are addressed in the script they're pretty much forgotten by the finalewhich does everything just shy of saluting. 12 from ";

The story here is primarily that of Samantha Hughes a flamboyant and somewhat overconfident young woman played well by Emily Lloyd and her jaded or hardened? uncle Emmett Smith Bruce Willis. This movie to some extent reminded me of the uneasy relationship between Randy Quaid and IlanMitchell Smith's characters in The Wild Life where Smith's character misunderstood the war and idolized his veteran buddy played by Randy Quaid who apparently desperately wanted to forget it. Emily Lloyd's character is not quite as naive but in reminiscing about her late father wondering what kind of soldier he was she does display a certain degree of similar tendencies. The ending of the film on the other hand is more like a slight tribute to those who died as the family visit the Vietnam memorial the events in this movie are somewhat nonlinear and scattered.Not an overall bad movie but not a great one either simply for lack of a clear story and probably not such great development of characters though I do commend Lloyd's performance.".

Bruce Willis was pretty good considering the bad writing he had to deal with but that goes without saying despite any of his roles. The girl ws not a very intersting dynamic character and either needed to express her thoughts about what was going on around her or get naked to make her interesting. I will say that the country lifestyle was pretty realistically portrayed but it was hard to believe that there were this many vets 20 years after the war still hopping up in trees from lighting because they thought the V.C was coming. Not worth watching there are so many other movies in the Vietnam genre that were better that this movie just has no role.".

	schema:reviewBody "The cast alone makes this film worth viewing at least once. It is always pleasing to see distinguished veteran prayers get together for an effort such as this one. In this sense it reminds me of 1982's House of the Long Shadows. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Melvyn Douglas John Houseman and Fred Astaire are the aforementioned players and Craig Wasson Alice Krige and Patricia Neal are among others in a first rate cast. Taken from a novel by Peter Straub Ghost Story suffers the fate that many ghost stories put to film do in that it has lost much of the mood and nuance of the written word. Still Ghost Story is a fine film and very enjoyable if you remember that it is not a masterpiece and do not expect more than it can deliver. Four elderly gentleman the entire membership of the Chowder Society get together periodically to share ghost stories. It is indicated early on that these gents have been doing this for a long time and quickly we learn there is a sinister reason why. We do not learn until well into the film what that reason is and the leading up to it is the meat of the story. Set against a wonderfully atmospheric New England backdrop it is revealed too late for the distinguished membership of the Chowder Society the four had accidentally murdered a young girl they were all smitten with 50 years earlier. The girl brilliantly played by the enigmatic Alice Krige has come back in the form of a ghost to exact terrible revenge. Ghost Story ends with several of the Chowder Society members dead and the secret of her death revealed.It is a pity that this film cannot be viewed as Straub wrote the story but that is the chance one takes when producing a ghost film the main reason why there are precious few truly good ones. Ms. Krige more than any woman I have ever seen on screen or indeed known personally combines an earthiness and elegance in her being that is fascinating. It is she that establishes the mood of this film and that is saying a lot considering who she was cast against. Ghost Story is almost biblical in it's vengeance to the second generation Craig Wasson as the son of one of the society members. It is interesting to note the presence of Melvyn Douglas who starred in horror films such as The Old Dark House and The Vampire Bat in the early 1930's and in 1979's The Changeling in addition to Ghost Story. What a way to bookend a rich career! We didn't get to see enough of Doug Fairbanks as his character died early and John Houseman added his usual solid performance. Fred Astaire had the most screen time and his character added much needed touches of light comic relief. Patricia Neal as his wife had little screen time. It was Ms. Krige who carried the film and if you are not familiar with her or her body of work you should be. She is unique and vastly underrated.Catch this one on video late on a cold snowy night best with a tumbler of brandy in hand. Expect an interesting if not great film and savor the screen presence of the performers. When a group such as this comes together for any kind of film it is worth viewing at least once. Ms. Krige makes many of the scenes truly frightening but mainly Ghost Story is to be appreciated for what is a tribute and last hurrah for several screen legends.".

Ms. Krige makes many of the scenes truly frightening but mainly Ghost Story is to be appreciated for what is a tribute and last hurrah for several screen legends.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film with a friend who described it as one of the scariest movies he had ever seen.'  I will agree with this assessment because the thrills are not cheap ones  they are genuine scares.  Ghost Story stars Fred Astaire John Houseman Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Melvyn Douglas as members of the Chowder Society' a group that gathers around the fireplace to drink brandy and tell ghost stories.  The problem lies in the fact that they also share a longkept secret that is now coming back to haunt them. While it was novel to see these great actors in action particularly in a genre where they are not normally known this film is great because it does not rely on gore or special effects to scare the pants off the viewer.  The horrors come from lower scale thrill like a spooky house an eerie soundtrack and quick flashes of horrific images that are sudden and impactful enough to make your heart leap into your throat. This is a small fun movie that isn't without its faults you can see the secret' coming from a mile away but the buildup to the unveiling of this secret is pure fun.  Shelly".

They are all great men of the world cinema and the pull off the story with great aplomb. The movie is about something someone does in his or her youth and then must live with forever. In a good ghost story the characters get no points for being once youthful and reckless. The fact that they meet and share their stories means that they never seem to intend closure. They never allow themselves to face the music and hence the revenge of the spirit is acceptable in the world where they find themselves. I just thought that a society devoted to the telling of ghost stories was a great idea. Anyway while the plot does wander around a bit and it takes time to get to the point it still works great. It was nice to see that Fred Astaire could still act because he was such a great dancer we forget that he had a great comic talent and in this case a dramatic talent. The others are equally formidable. There are also some pretty slimy putrid visions that appear and make for a pretty good rank on the jump scale. The actually scene that explains everything I won't spoil it is both sad and revealing. While not the greatest movie it works very well and I would recommend it.".

That is when a series of horrifying events begin to unfold forcing the men of the Chowder Society to come to terms with the shocking and dreadful event that has haunted them for the past 50 years.I personally love these types of stories. They do not feature masked maniacs hunting down unsuspecting teenagers and hacking them to death. Although there are a few good ones in that category!

The cinemaphotography is excellent. The film's musical score is excellent. Performances are often brilliant as only seasoned actors can be. It must have been fun to work on this project. The new actors are equally great especially Alice who plays Alma the starring role.The young man who is the male lead went on to become famous as you will see in the famous faces of the other young men as well. What a great break for them all to work with such seasoned legends. Alice is a rare flower English actor who is now a major star.This film was a work of love and you can feel it. The camera angles make the film spooky and scary. Even after five times I was still surprised and jumped again. Bravo. Worth buying this film as a classic for your collections. The Haunting of Hill House comes to mind here.The music is first rate and added so much to the plot and its eerie story. With the camera work clever original shots the story takes on a great level of artistry. BRAVO on the little jewel. SARGE IN Colorado".

	schema:reviewBody "A condensing of Peter Straubs' more complex more intriguing novel the film adaptation is no great shakes but it's certainly not bad at all either. It does have the appeal of a spooky yarn one might spin by a fireplace in the dead of winter. The simplified story deals with four elderly New England gentlemen who get together and tell horror stories but who in fact share a tragedy from their longago past. Now a revengeminded spirit is out to make their lives miserable  and strike out at the two sons of one of them to boot. The film does speak of quality  Jack Cardiff did the cinematography Albert Whitlock and his team supply some beautiful matte shots Philippe Sarde composed the stirring music score and Dick Smith creates the plentiful hideous apparition effects  but the powerful main attraction is the assemblage of talent in the four main roles  Fred Astaire Melvyn Douglas Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and John Houseman  who are a delight although Fairbanks exits the story much too soon. Craig Wasson plays the twin sons and is likable as usual and manages to hold his own opposite his legendary costars. Patricia Neal is utterly wasted as Astaires' wife but making up for that is the showcase given to the beautiful South African actress Alice Krige who's extremely alluring and enigmatic as the mystery woman to whom both sons become attracted. There's a real sexual charge in her scenes with Wasson. This is one element that may concern some viewers when they think about Astaire Douglas Fairbanks and Houseman acting in a film that has violence and nudity male as well as female but for other horror fans a sufficient amount of atmosphere is built up and there are definitely some memorable scenes. Things are sometimes told in a flashback style as first Wasson tells of his association with the notsosubtly creepy Krige or Astaire and Houseman finally break down and tell Wasson their whole sordid story. Overall it's just compelling enough to work and it does have some mighty fine moments especially an iconic one involving a lake and a sinking car. It manages to be pretty eerie on a fairly consistent basis if never very scary. It marked the final feature film appearance for Astaire Fairbanks and Douglas. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I initially wanted to rate Ghost Story a fine 710 but I figured since I voluntarily had to endure watching such heavy rubbish earlier this week I'd just chip in an extra point. I feel no shame about this as the film is actually very good. At the start of the '80s the horror landscape was changing. Films got a lot crazier partly due to many great sfx artists rising to the scene and otherwise because of the mindset of that era fashion trends etc. Often filmmakers cared less about telling a coherent story and more about making their films go overthetop in any way they'd see fit. So in a way Ghost Story really feels like if it was one of the last 'classic' horror movies at the time. From the orchestrated soundtrack over the slow pace of the film relying more on mood tension and atmosphere to the splendid performances of our veteran foursome Fred Astaire Melvin Douglas John Houseman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. The film is ingeniously structured with various stories within the main story nightmarish dream sequences and a great flashback story to the 1930's era. The settings provide some classic horror elements too like the isolated snowy town grisly frozen lakes and an old ramshackle haunted mansion. Sporadically the film is also injected with some amusing scares provided by ghostly rotting appearances and the special visual effects by master matte artist Albert Whitlock are outstanding. Gorgeous actress Alice Krige has that icy cold mysteriousness over her that is fitting for her role. On top of that she has more scenes with her clothes off then on. There are a couple subplots that could have been altered to make it an even better movie but these are only minor problems. If you want a decent scary movie double bill with a classy feel to it for a dark  stormy night I think teaming up John Irvin's Ghost Story 1981 with Peter Medak's The Changeling 1980 might work wonders.".

They did a passable job here and the movie stands on its own as an entertaining and chill inducing work. In fact this movie contains two scenes that I've never forgotten since I saw it in the theatre and that still scare me whenever I see them the hem of Alice Krige's wedding dress slowly swishing down the hallway toward her next victim and her turning to look at Fred Astaire as he opens the door to the car after it's pulled from the lake turning to look at him from the back seat where she's sat dead festering brooding plotting and haunting for the past 50 years.It also keeps some of the great lines from the book I will show you things you have never seen... and Dance with me you little toad.It has some faults and if you're a huge fan of the novel you may want to just pass on it but it's still one of the best scary movies I've ever seen. If you like a good ghost story I highly recommend it watch it on a dark winters night while the wind howls around the eaves of your house.".

The first time I saw this movie was on TV and after I watched it I had to buy it. I thought it was a great horror story without all the gore. It had a great cast with a few of the classic actor's as the Chowder Society. I don't know what it is about revenge movie's but some make great movies that are hard to stay away from.This is not you typical horror flick in fact it has a plot. I liked the fact how the story was told it takes place somewhere in the northeast with beautiful Winter scenery. The Chowder Society getting together in their 70's and telling spooky stories. They never discuss don't discuss what happened in the thirties until Don finds them. After the death of his brother and father from the hand's of this woman he know's is not who she appears to be.Don finds the rest of the Chowder Society were his father was once a member and tells them he thinks this is a ghost story and the woman is back for revenge. He explains what has happened when he met her and the story begins to unfold with more of the Chowder Society meeting their fates with Alma Moberley the woman back for her revenge.The truth eventually comes out with the story going back to the times where the Chodwer Society was in their prime. We discover who they were and what the did so wrong to Alma. To save the last remaining member of the Chowder Society. Don with the help of Fred Astaire's character begin to unravel the mystery and unlock the crime they were responsible for back in the 1930's.This movie is a great thrill without all the blood and guts that come with some horror stories. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under age ten though but it is still a great story. It's a great movie to rent and one that you can watch over and over again especially around FallHalloween.".

The story in itself is not very original there are many ghost stories on the same theme for example Stir of Echoes. A group of friends young men kill a young woman by mistake. They do not want to go to jail  especially as they have so much going for them. So they hide the body and try not to think of it anymore. Although in this movie Ghost Story there is another twist to the hiding and the actual killing. But in time the dead woman who also has a couple of living people as her helpers comes back to get her revenge...Ghost Story contains everything. Immensely good scares. Exciting plot development that keeps you on edge all the time  there are no dull moments! Also I think it is so good because there are several different things to be scared of in the same movie at the same time as they are all well entwined. The ghost itself of course her human helpers who are very unpleasant lunatics on the run from a mental asylum the horrible way in which the woman dies and last but not least the now old men who have lived a good life and enjoyed good careers family beautiful homes etc. while their young victim has been lying in her wet grave deprived of everything...I think the movie was also psychologically excellent. Because one understands how a thing that this can happen in reality not the haunting of course!. When young men are sexually frustrated and at the same time attracted to and shy in the company of a young woman that they do not really respect... And the alcohol and peer pressure make them do things they would never do alone being nice and wellbehaved boys normally....Last but not least I must mention the cast. All of the actors are VERY good real character actors. Even those in small supporting roles such as the wives of the old men. That is very unusual in horror movies I believe and that is one of the reasons that it turned out so good. Not only because these actors act well but because they give more credibility to the movie. By the way I had no idea before that Fred Astaire did real straight character roles  I mean without any singing and dancing  when he was old. I now admire him even more!".

Unlike The Shining however Ghost story doesn't even manage to be a good scary movie on its own. Whoever composed the musical score should be shot. It's overbearing and loud in scenes that call for a low key to enhance suspense making all the tense scenes appear comical or inappropriate like playing polka at a funeral. The acting is competent but since I'm not made to care about any of them the movie plays like a trailer instead of an actual film. The makeup and special effects were definitely the work of talent but a lousy substitute for what it should have been. The only thing about it I really liked was Fred Astaire because I couldn't have picked a better Ricky Hawthorne myself. Basically this movie replaced one of the most intriguing villains I've ever read about with a sloppy ghost woman sacrificed suspense for an incoherent slaptogether plot and some nudity. The scariest thing about this movie was Craig Wasson's full frontal nude scene less than ten minutes in and Alice Krige's soggy boobies for the remainder of the film. The book isn't the greatest thing you'll ever read but it is still a good book and didn't deserve this canker sore of a film. Why can't they remake stuff like this instead of the karate kid?".

It is great to see the veterans Fred Astaire Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Melvyn Douglas and John Houseman together in one of their last works. Craig Wasson was in evidence in the 80's and has also good performance.

The acting is good overall though some of the older cast feel a bit underused I think that may have to do with some wonky editing in the film which is one of its few downfalls.

Dark dismal weather in the form of downpours and never ending snow. The weather was the perfect backdrop for the mysterious Eva Galli. Houseman Astaire Douglasand Fairbanks Jr. slip effortlessly into their roles as small town figureheads and Chowder Society members steeling their nerves with brandy in the coziness of their studies trying to hold back the cold the darkness and Eva Galli's pentup fury. Choate Chamberlin Johnson and Olin play the Chowder Society's younger selves in the sweetness of their youth. Eva Krige plays the dual roles or are they? of Alma Mobley and Eva Galli exhibiting a perfect blend of innocence and sensuality. The tragedy of Krige's Eva is inescapable. Craig Wasson also has a dual role as twin brothers Don and David Wanderly who become the avenue of attack for Eva Galli's vengeance against the Chowder Society. Ghost Story has few inyourface shocks. Instead it is a slow simmering of genuinely creepy moments climaxing with Galli's rustling walk down the hall of her decrepit house to meet the trapped Don Wanderly. Will Eva have her revenge?".

They're played by legendary movie veterans Melvyn Douglas Fred Astaire and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. it was the last film for all three of them and John Houseman who despite being in his sixties had only started acting several years earlier making him a relative newcomer. Fifty years earlier when they were young proud and arrogant they'd befriended a freespirited and independently wealthy heiress named Eva Galli played by South African actress Alice Krige who was spending the summer in the town. However after drunkenly inviting themselves to her house late one night they accidentally killed her then panicked and dumped her body in a lake.In the five decades since all four have been riddled with guilt their sleep constantly interrupted by vivid dreams in which Eva's death is endlessly repeated. Their lives also effectively ended that night one of them was a highflying medical student who planned to become a surgeon while another had political ambitions and hoped to eventually run for senator and perhaps even president. But the two of them achieved no more than respectively becoming the local G.P. and the town's mayor. All four men are trapped in the town by their own consciences unable to leave the scene of the crime.And then half a century after she died Eva Galli returns...The most chilling part of the movie that Eva has waited fifty years before seeking her revenge. Her killers have grown old and frail and are already close to death themselves. They've had long miserable wasted lives and the only possible single luxury they have left is dying peacefully in their beds. But Eva is going to make sure they don't even get that...Despite fine performances from her elderly costars it's Krige who steals the film as the vengeful spectre. Although highly talented and breathtakingly beautiful Krige never subsequently had the career she deserved. There's an undefinable otherworldly quality about her and therefore Hollywood never quite knew what to do with her. She's kept working but unsurprisingly her best known roles have been in other fantasy projects  Sleepwalkers the Silent Hill movie and playing the Borg Queen in Star Trek First Contact the final feature length episode of Star Trek Voyager and several Star Trek computer games.Ghost Story is mostly forgotten now but was a strong influence on films such as What Lies Beneath 2000 and practically the entire wave of JHorror movies. The female phantoms of The Ring The Grudge and their various sequels remakes and imitators all owe a debt to Eva Galli.".

	schema:reviewBody "While this is not considered one of the better horror films ever made it none the less is a fun one to watch and it's because of the great actors that lend their craft and screen persona. Story is about four elderly gentlemen in the New England area and they share a 50 year old secret that continues to haunt them. The four of them have formed a private club called the Chowder Society and they have known each other most of their lives. The four are Sears James John Houseman John Jaffrey Melvyn Douglas Ricky Hawthorne Fred Astaire and Edward Wanderley Douglas Fairbanks jr. and Edward has a son named David Craig Wasson who mysteriously has died from falling out a window. Edward's other son Don Wasson again comes to the funeral and he thinks his brothers death is too strange to be an accident and he heard that David was involved with a woman that Don also knew. One day Edward dies from falling off of a bridge and now Don is convinced that the woman is responsible. Don gets with Ricky and tells him of his affair in Florida with a woman named Alma Mobley Alice Krige who acted very strange and this was why he would not marry her. Ricky gets John and Sears and the three of them tell Don of what happened 50 years ago. The four of them met a woman named Eva Galli Krige again and they would all get together and have fun. Eva and Edward have a more intimate relationship but one night they have a fight and Edward pushes Eva who falls and hits her head. They all think she's dead and decide to hide the evidence. They put her body in a car and push it into a lake but as the car starts to sink they see Eva still alive and trapped in the backseat. None of them can swim and are too drunk to save her so she dies trapped underwater. After Don hears this and presents a locket from Alma the four of them are sure its Eva who has come back for revenge. SPOILER ALERTThis film was directed by John Irvin who is a competent director but he doesn't lend much to this film in terms of style. There are some genuinely spooky moments but these scenes only come sporadically during the course of the film. The big asset for this film of course is the great cast. But not only are the big four wonderful to watch it's also a great opportunity to view a very young Alice Krige in a very good performance. There are some gratuitous nude scenes required of her and she exhibits some terrific raw sexuality with Wasson. We understand completely his attraction to her. She's mysterious and wild but we also understand why he won't marry her. She refuses to tell him about herself and he walks away. Krige has always been a terrific actress but she never really had another big role that made people stand up and take notice. The closest she came was in Star Trek First Contact where she played the Borg Queen. One of the reasons this isn't considered a great horror film is that it's hard to swallow the fact that four of the great and sophisticated actors in history are in a film where there is a great amount of nudity. Fred Astaire and nudity Houseman and nudity...they don't seem to belong in the same film. Another part of the film that was hard to figure was why AlmaEva pops up in Florida to seduce Wasson. Why does she go all the way there? Why not just kill him? Why not just pop up in New England and get her revenge? And why does her ghost recruit the two lowlifes to help her? It's never really explained and this hurts the film in the way it tells it's story. But I do think there are some effective scenes and it's hard to shake the image at the end of the film where the car is dragged out of the lake and Astaire opening the car door where the corpse of Eva slowly emerges seemingly on it's own and falls to the ground. It's a chilling scene and there are enough of those moments to give this film an eerie atmosphere. Also actor Tim Choate The First Time plays young Ricky in the flashback scenes. Not a classic but with this cast it probably doesn't need to be. Well worth a look by all.".

Pieces are simply missing we are informed that the original version is 122 minutes while this version is only 89 minutes and it is likely that in the missing 33 minutes many of the unresolved and very confusing elements of time and place and character development and perplexing moments existed. WriterDirector Dennis Lee obviously had a fine story to share and a brilliant cast to offer it but so much of it is missing that we are left frustrated.Successful Romance novelist Michael Taylor Ryan Reynolds has completed his latest novel a work of serious memoir literature in which he has recounted his childhood in an attempt to free himself from the influence of his demonic father English professor Charles Taylor William Dafoe who seriously abused Michael as a child and for whom he holds little emotion but disdain. Michael has returned home for the college graduation of his sister Ryne Shannon Lucio as well as his mother's  Lisa Julia Roberts  deferred graduation. But the celebration is altered by an accident Charles swerved to not hit his nephew Christopher Chase Ellison hit a pole resulting in a crash that killed Lisa and injured Charles and leaves Christopher with a dark cloud of guilt that he caused the trauma.We gradually meet the family Lisa's sister Jane Emily Watson is the mother of Christopher and his little sister and has always been the closest friend of Michael when they were children as children Michael is portrayed by Cayden Boyd and Jane by Hayden Panettiere  At Lisa's funeral Michael's 'exwife' AA reformed Kelly CarrieAnne Moss shows up to add to Michael's angst. From here the film jumps back and forth between the childhood of Michael and Jane and the suffering and abuse Michael endured at the hands of his grotesquely diabolical father and the secrets of that failed family life are gradually exposed and the traumatic present. In cleaning out Lisa's things Michael discovers some information that alters his view of his past and those discoveries lead to a change in the way Michael views his father and Jane's children and most significantly the demons that have burdened him through his life. In addition to the fine work by Reynolds Watson Dafoe Roberts and all the other cast members there is an important cameo for Ioan Gruffudd that opens the murk of the story well. Though this journey through the progress of a dysfunctional family has been done many times before and even frequently using the protagonist as a novelist about to open the secrets of the family's lives to the world this story take some significant alternative routes that make it more tender. The uses of flashbacks could have been better edited so that the audience is aware of when the character changes occur and there are many unanswered questions about how each of these characters came to inhabit the human roles they present here. But given the fact that the audience must stay completely alert during this film in order to follow this at times meandering story this is a worthy film. One wonders why the missing 33 minutes were not included in the American release the film was made in 2007 and it seems as though it never played the theaters going instead directly to DVD. With a cast of this caliber this should have been a popular film. But where did those missing pages take us? Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Fireflies in The Garden was panned by basically everyone. The dysfunctional family story took three years to be released on DVD which is astounding considering the enormous strength of this cast. Many reviewers all say the same thing that movies like this are a dime a dozen and that might be true. That doesn't this cast and this film any less captivating. Perhaps part of the issue that many see in this movie is that it is in no way packaged in a neat little box with sunshine and rainbows. This is a very dark drama about a very messed up family and there isn't a happily ever after for them. If you can handle a dark drama then you will be rewarded with some terrific performances. Ryan Reynolds shines in his role as the grown up son who has many emotional problems because of a verbally abusive father. That father is played with excellent force by Willem Dafoe. Obviously playing a villain type character is not new for Dafoe but his character is so pathetic with so much depth you will just despise him and beg for his redemption much like his family does. Emily Watson is sort of hohum compared to the rest of the cast. Once you've accepted that Hayden Panettiere somehow grew up to look like Emily Watson...she also loses all her passion for the role. Panettiere is much better as the younger Jane in the movie. Julia Roberts is good in her role though she isn't used all that much and sort of takes a more ceremonious role in the movie. People are always clamouring for Hollywood to do something unique and I give a lot of credit to first time writer and director Dennis Lee for not making everything neat and tidy. Sometimes you can be in the mood for a dark drama and some solid performances makes this one captivating. Ignore the harsh reviews and give it a chance! 810".

Even though William DeFoe usually plays dramatic roles his ability to be the villain abusive to his son I thought did need to be refined a little more. I enjoyed the movie allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions with regards to the secrets that these characters each held along with the realistic display of a fractured family and how they start to repair the past wrongs.

I am really surprise with Ryan Reynolds performance also the young Michael with play Cayden Boyd. The whole story in one way or another turn around the problem of relationship between both. The movie uses well the flashback resource to show the problems of this family and especially the problems between Michael and his father. Naturally there are good interpretations of the rest of the cast especially for Emily WatsonMichael's Aunt. A movie that really is worth watching.".

We've seen variations done better in other movies. The music is sometimes OK folksy but sometimes cruddy folksy and annoyingly maudlin.

	schema:headline " Dysfunctional Fireflies and the Case of the Exploding Fish";
	schema:reviewBody "Fireflies in the Garden 2008 12The problem with movies about dysfunctional families is the same one that spy movies have they're a dime a dozen and rarely offer anything new. Wes Anderson has made dysfunction his specialty. Noah Baumbach's Squid and the Whale was also a very good film about dysfunctional families as is Jonathan Demme's new film Rachael Getting Married. Dennis Lee's feature length debut Fireflies in the Garden is a technically well made film. It looks good it sounds good. Lee is a sound director. But good direction can't always save a flat script. That's the problem with the movie. It offers nothing new into an already crowded genre.I suspect that the film's script must have looked quite good. After all it netted a slew of stars  Ryan Reynolds Emily Watson Willem Defoe Hayden Panettiere Iaon Gruffud and Julia Roberts. Reynolds stars as as Michael Waechter the son of a self absorbed intellectual jerk Charles Dafoe. His mother is Lisa Roberts. The film goes back and forth in time between Michael's childhood and present day. While on the way to Rhyne the daughter's graduation party Charles and Lisa get into a car accident while trying to avoid Christopher Lisa's nephew. Lisa is killed.This sets up situations and complications to bring everyone together so they can argue and bicker and of course eventually reconcile. As the family gathers at the old family home where Jane Watson in the present Panattiere in the past now lives old feelings are drudged over and while going through their mother's things Michael discovers a secret about his mother.Robert's and Watson play caring mothers. Lisa is passive maybe too passive. Why she allows Charles to get away with some of the cruel things he does to the young Michael are confounding.Meanwhile the film also glosses over the relationship between Jane and Michael who are roughly the same age. That relationship is almost incestuous although Lee never dares to fully delve into it. Everyone does solid work with their roles. Again a part of the technical solidity of the film. It's just that the story is too familiar too flat. In the end Dafoe has some moments of depth and Reynolds gives a strong and layered performance. Otherwise the script doesn't take enough time to flesh out its characters.Sure Michael has every reason to hate his father. He's a jerk unabashedly so. The story needs to be maybe flushed out more or maybe way less. There are stories enough for about three movies here. The plot line regarding young Christopher who feels tremendous guilt over Lisa's death is enough for a film of this length. But there are so many other stories going on that it gets only limited time.There are some other small nitpicks that can be made. First none of the kids look like their adult counterparts. That would be fine in a better movie but here it's something you pick out. Second although the film is set somewhere outside Chicago it feels like somewhere in the south. Probably because it was shot in and around Texas.Based on a script that floated around Hollywood for sometime before getting financed Fireflies in the Garden has floated around looking for a release since its debut back at the Berlin Film Festival. It's reported that the film will get a release come November. I suspect it will be limited and suspect that it won't stick around theaters for long. Robert's might attract a few patrons to the multiplexes but I wouldn't count on this one to make a big splash with anyone. I'm sure Lee has better in him.".

It's not that the acting was bad in my opinion but there was no reason to make the story so difficult to follow. It wasn't until I had finished watching the show that I looked at commentaries and at IMDb to find out who was who and who was related to whom and by what connection.OK we all have a past and many of us have complaints about our parents but most of us do not air them because we are far from perfect ourselves. We also learn as we grow older hopefully and our misbehavior toward our children was not with the intention of hurting them  mostly it was because of personal anxieties about life and how to protect our children from many destructive mistakes.By contrast to this movie about family dysfunction and the processes of remembering the past another screenplay which uses some of the same techniques and which is possibly my favorite teleplay of all time is the original version of Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective. Never have I seen a screenplay so perfectly written and directed and cast and acted as this one. It is a marvel and it contains a lot of ironic humor too.The Robert Frost poem of the same name is a very good analogy. There are some few who are true stars and there ore others who would like to be stars but are like the fireflies.

It is a well executed film. Danny Moder's cinematography is breathtaking and Javier Navarrete's score is superb. The story has an interesting premise but it needed fleshing out. It looks patchy at times. The casting is also a little awkward. Emily Watson and Hayden Panettiere are too different to play the same character convincingly and this was difficult for me to overlook. That said Panettiere was quite decent and Watson is first rate but she deserved more screen time and her character the older Jane needed more fleshing out. Ditto for Julia Roberts who despite of a small role has a strong presence throughout the entire film. I find her character's actions questionable. For example why does she choose to leave her husband when he cheats on her while all those years she stays with him when he's abusing their son? Ryan Reynolds shows growth as an actor. He displayed maturity in 'Definitely Maybe' and seems to be going the right way as an actor. Willem Dafoe too does a terrific job from being the hateful father to being the softer old man but I would have liked to see more of the transformation in Charles because on the one hand he is shown to be a loving father as shown in the home video but on the other hand he doesn't seem to have changed much the scene in the car when they're on their way to visit Jane and his temper at the dinner table. The director could have shown more of Lisa and Charles during their later years. I also liked Cayden Boyd's performance. Ioan Gruffudd and CarrieAnne Moss do not have more than a couple of scenes. 'Fireflies in the Garden' seems like a well intentioned movie but it appears too rushed and patchy to fully involve the viewer. It needed more than 95 minutes of screen time. The visuals soundtrack and performances make it a decent watch.".

Normally that means the film is junk and they want to make some money back before word gets around. I read the 2 other IMDb reviews and thought maybe it's not too bad. I then read the Hollywood Reporter and Variety's reviews which were not as kind. But I decided to take a drive over to Maastricht Holland to form my own opinion of FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN. The first 15 minutes I thought okay maybe this cast can rise above the seemingly Lifetime special material. But in the end it was clear they couldn't. I've seen much finer Lifetime movies because of my wife. I can't understand WHY the cast agreed to making this movie. The characters were inconsistent and the script was sloppy. It seemed as though a reel had gone missing some footage had been erased or maybe they had forgotten to film 30 pages of the script. Characters make huge changes for no apparent reason. Plot points are mentioned but never followed through. I could go on forever but I'm not sure about what. There is no substance to FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN. It's a pure waste of your time and it's talent. Clearly they thought they were making a solid family drama like ORDINARY PEOPLE or IN THE BEDROOM but they certainly did not succeed on any level. So unfortunately my theory about the US dumping its cinematic junk on the rest of the world for a quick buck has proved true again.".

I then read the Hollywood Reporter and Variety's reviews which were not as kind. But I decided to take a drive over to Maastricht Holland to form my own opinion of FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN. The first 15 minutes I thought okay maybe this cast can rise above the seemingly Lifetime special material. But in the end it was clear they couldn't. I've seen much finer Lifetime movies because of my wife. I can't understand WHY the cast agreed to making this movie. The characters were inconsistent and the script was sloppy. It seemed as though a reel had gone missing some footage had been erased or maybe they had forgotten to film 30 pages of the script. Characters make huge changes for no apparent reason. Plot points are mentioned but never followed through. I could go on forever but I'm not sure about what. There is no substance to FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN. It's a pure waste of your time and it's talent. Clearly they thought they were making a solid family drama like ORDINARY PEOPLE or IN THE BEDROOM but they certainly did not succeed on any level. So unfortunately my theory about the US dumping its cinematic junk on the rest of the world for a quick buck has proved true again.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fireflies in the Garden is one of those rare movies where a stellar cast and script based on a Robert Frost poem ! could not get itself a release. Four years later it got a straighttoDVD release. And for good reason it's really bad. It's a dysfunctional family drama where the characters are messed up from beginning to middle to end. There is no relief comedy or otherwise from the dysfunction.It starts with the guise that perhaps it's not dysfunctional from the very beginning but no it is. I made the mistake of reading the back of the DVD case where I was informed that the Taylors are the very picture of a happy and successful American family. I wonder what constitutes a successful family Is it the father emotionally and physically abusing his son? Or the husband emotionally and physically abusing his wife? Or the inappropriate relationship between aunt and nephew? Because all of that was conveyed to us in the first two scenes. Not from the very first minute did I confuse this family as a happy and successful one.The film also implies that the family wants to get out from their past and start afresh. Whether they want to or not that's not going to happen because they don't even know what a happy and successful family looks like let alone how to be one.The now grown up son Michael Ryan Reynolds has returned home along with his sister and aunt and father Willem Dafoe. Michael is a writer because it's the classic profession to be able to rid yourself of past demons. I was expecting a sort of mystery to develop as the film certainly did imply that each character was hiding something. Of course they were hiding things  repressed emotions. Which doesn't build to a mystery but melodrama.The title refers to the Frost poem but also one of their childhood activities. Along with everyone I know on warm summer evenings when the fireflies would be out in their brilliant glory we would catch them in jars keep them in our bedrooms trying to savour the magic of the night. But not the Taylor kids. On warm summer evenings when the glowing fireflies were out they would go and kill them. Any sympathy was instantly lost never to be regained.".

	schema:reviewBody "In recent years Hollywood has been consumed with big budget comic book action spectacles that present a healthy dose of the implausible and if you're lucky at least a small amount of the nuances found in the human experience. The problem is that those nuances are mostly seen through the eyes of CGI artists. In the family drama FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN the nuances are seen through the eyes of writerdirector Dennis Lee a courageous new artist who treats his audience as if they have the two pivotal ingredients needed to enjoy his film patience and a brain. FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN is not your mother's family drama dripping with sentimentality and moments of levity so overblown they border on caricature. FIREFLIES is an illumination of a family dynamic so subtly perverse at times that you soon realize that the Taylor Family is not just your neighbors but in oneway or another a representation of some aspect of yourself. This makes for unsettling and emotionally rewarding cinema. And by the end of writerdirector Dennis Lee's beautifully realized film FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN we've left the Taylor Clan in a place that may not be enough of an astronomical shift for the comic book movie crowd or even some critics but a place of authenticity and simplicity that speaks volumes.".

It's funny it's tragic it's compelling and most of all it's a slice of Swedish small town life. It crushes the clichs and dwells deeper. It makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters.Big city girl tracing back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her father's 70th birthday crossing paths with people she hasn't met in several years. Although the story itself isn't unique it offers a fresh approach. The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who aren't very close. Or at least don't realize how close they are.One key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast. First I'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no socalled 'Alist' Swedish actors in this film. Usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in Sweden. This time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Rse to prove that you don't need words to convey an emotion.The writing is also very appealing. The dialogue is more than believable and compared with other Swedish films from the past year or two it's ahead by miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning and if you didn't know you would never guess that this is her first time writing AND directing a feature length film. I can't wait for her next one.Once you start watching this you really want to see it through.".

The dysfunctional family theme as presented here isn't anything new and the film does tend to border on clichs at times but there's a sincerity with which Blom tells her story. For example all the scenes of Mia finding herself a stranger in her own home town while at the same time making judgements about others and as it would turn out no one is who she thought them to be are narrated very well. Anyone who has returned to their hometown after a very long time will be able to relate to those scenes.The subtle performance by lead actress Sofia Helin is also very effective and brings out the depth of Mia making her struggle more convincing. Kajsa Ernst and Ann Petren are equally wonderful as the two older sisters who couldn't be any more different. The rest of the cast do a fine job bringing in some humour.The execution is quite ordinary but the pleasant snowy Swedish landscape is refreshing to look at. The soundtrack is used smoothely. The birthday party track especially stands out as it's filmed beautifully and so many things happen in that scene both on the surface and within the characters portrayed very well by the actors.'Masjvlar' may not be one of its kind and even though it tells a familiar story that has been witnessed various times on screen there is a freshness about the way its treated and told.".

This move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along. No loss though since the humor that is there is not funny. The performances from the cast are good I guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. I had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none. To conclude there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this.310";

Still to this day I cannot resist watching this film and I still laugh keep my eyes glued to the screen and I cannot help but cry. I always have to have a major box of tissues next to me when I watch this movie. It has such a soul and is a great story with wonderful characters. All of us as children had pets who were like our best friends and they were just as loyal back and Homeward Bound shows us the love that animals could have for their owners.Chance an American Bulldog explains that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford but expresses no interest in his owner or having a home. He shares his home with Shadow an older Golden Retriever owned by Jamie's brother Peter and Sassy a Himalayan cat owned by their sister Hope. Bob Seaver is marrying Laura Burnford joining the family. Shortly after the wedding the family goes on a trip to San Francisco leaving the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate a family friend. Kate later goes on a cattle drive leaving the animals at the ranch to be looked after by one of her ranch hands. However the animals think they have been abandoned and Shadow begins to worry about Peter so he decides to go find them. Sassy and a reluctant Chance follow. They head into the rocky mountainous wilderness with Shadow leading by instinct but of course the road is a bumpy one and it's not an easy journey coming back home.I'm going to give a few spoilers here so don't read on if you haven't seen this movie. There are some absolute great laughs with Sally Field as Sassy you just couldn't go wrong. Her leading the vet security guard around was so cute and very funny. Plus when Chance is curious about a porcupine Shadow and Sassy warn him to get away but being a dog he can't help but wonder and BAM it bit me with it's butt! he's stung with the needles poor Chance but what a funny scene! Then there are some very touching moments where Chance is learning how wonderful life could be having a home. The scene where Sassy is reunited with Chance and Shadow was wonderful. Then there are the tear jerker moments that are killer. Shadow falls into a muddy pit where he hurts his leg and can't get out Chance tries to help him but Shadow thinks he's too old and can't move and says to Chance I've taught you everything you needed to know now all you need to learn is how to say goodbye I'm actually tearing up as I'm writing it seriously. Then Shadow makes a triumphant return into Peter's arms and seeing him act like a puppy was so wonderful. I adore this movie the voices the setting the story it's just a touching family movie that is perfect to watch. I have no complaints about this movie and could go on but trust me when I say it's more than worth the watch.1010".

	schema:headline " A film you can watch when your feeling down. ''A story about courage adventure and friendship.''";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later. For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago now being 15 I dug out the VHS of homeward bound. After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground something that you all need. The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog with sassy the clever vulnerable but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy painfully are told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later. For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago now being 15 I dug out the VHS of homeward bound. After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground something that you all need. The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog with sassy the clever vulnerable but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy painfully are told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It's a real pleaser to anyone. It'll make you laugh it'll make you cry and it'll put you into suspense.Basically what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on and desperately wanting to go home they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow the old wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy the Himalayan cat. But seriously what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox my alltime favorite actor Chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog lovable playful energetic and goofy and every time I crack up when watching this movie it's because of Chance it's like the comedy never ends! This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.Overall it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!".

It has beautiful wellwritten musical that fits the scenes perfectly with rousing fastpaced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favorite actor Michael J. Fox. Based on a book this is the story of three house pets an intelligent overlytrusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow a witty and vain  but still smart  cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a streetsmart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it isn't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters and for anyone else that ... yeah everyone go watch it.".

Of course Shadow doesn't want to go anywhere else and so he decides to go off on an adventure to find his owner. Chance and Sassy also agree and they go off in their little cute heartwarming adventure together. The last time I seen this movie was when I was a kid and it was a pleasure to pick it up for a bargain on Sunday in HMV. The story is really nice and I like the part where Sassy goes missing and the two dogs mess around with a leopard and the part near the end where Shadow falls down a wrecked train railing and Chance won't leave without him.You have to be the biggest cynic not to love this movie and its now one of my all time favourite movies. It was as a kid and it is now at the age of 23.".

	schema:reviewBody "My sister had a VHS copy years and years ago but our mom got rid of it feeling we had outgrown it. Maybe in adolescence she was right. Fast forward to 10 years later and I decide to check a DVD copy out of the library just for old times' sake for no real reason. Prior to now I'm a 27yearold single man I have discovered lots of movies I was too young to see circa 1993...A Clockwork Orange Reservoir Dogs The Terminator Road Trip...OK that movie didn't come out 'til 2000 and it's not an absolute classic like the first three but you get the idea! I popped the movie into my player this evening to see if the movie held up. And wouldn't you know it...it does! In fact I cried so much at the end my ears are still moist half an hour after it ended.Truth be told however the first few minutes are pretty stupid but it does show Chance and Sassy's resentment to one another which is important to the story. The real magic comes when the three animals especially Chance realize what home and family really means when their child owners leave them on a farm. That's when they decide to make their escape and from there it's an adventure that may be dangerous but in the words of Sassy I laugh at danger. The most touching scenes are Sassy finding her way back to Chance and Shadow after she was rescued from being drowned and Shadow finding the lost Molly in the woods. The touching musical score from Bruce Broughton is also a major factor.I'd like to note I work with pets sometimes so I know how it would feel if one of them or even all of them just disappeared. My family's favourite cat died of old age in July 2011. As you can imagine I was heartbroken but at that time I was sharing a house with a middleaged couple who had two shihtzus so before I went out to do my errands that day I made sure to say hello to the two little dogs because although one of my family pets was gone I had two other ones who could be a beacon of hope for me.No matter how old you are or what your tastes are or if you generally can't stand anything that comes from Disney you seriously must see this film and you'll feel redeemed that way. And as piece of advice don't be afraid to let a song or a movie or a TV show turn on the waterworks for you it means you have a soul.".

Elisabeth is neither a socialist feminist or into the green movement but ends up loving living in the community where they all learn from eachother. The film makes a little fun of people with strong ideals and square minds whether they be vegans communists or people who absolutely disgust vegans or socialists in the end the message of the film is that people can grow and gain from bonding with eachother. It also shows how we need to shape up a little for this to work either through working with own behaviour that affects other people badly like alcoholism or abuse or the need to set up own boundaries and not let other people walk all over oneself.";

	schema:headline " Possibly my new favorite film...";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this film on an import DVD it hasn't been released on DVD here in the states yet after missing its small theatrical run here a couple of years ago. I think perhaps Ingmar Bergman is right about Moodyson. He is a young master. Though I have yet see Moodyson's other films I was overwhelmed by the power of this film.The film is about a group of counterculture types who live in a collective household called Together in 1975 Stockholm Sweden. But they often struggle to get along because they have trouble finding and living with shared values and in some cases just don't like each other. Goran the de facto head of the household wants to please everyone. He wishes everyone would just get along. Any obstacle to group harmony is any obstacle to him as well. Elisabeth the working class sister of Goran one day is forced to move in to the household with her two children Eva and Stefan due to the breakdown of her marriage. Meanwhile Rolf her harddrinking abusive husband struggles to overcome his devastation and loneliness over their leaving. Moreover a boy who lives in a proper middleclass home next door to Together becomes attracted to Eva. This is the setup of a simple story with complex interactions. The story unfolds simply too but in ways you don't expect because it is so unforced and natural. Like most great works of art literature or filmmaking it progresses and unfolds with a feeling of simplicity  organic and lifelike.Don't be fooled by the specifics on the surface. On the surface this film seems to be little more than a survey of the amusing antics of hippies from the 1970s. But this film is so much more than that for many reasons.First of all this film is a commentary on the adults of today as much as it is of the adults 1975. The reason I say this is because the emotional center of the story is with the two children of Elisabeth and Rolf Eva and Stefan. By allowing us the audience to see most of the action through the eyes of two impressionable children suffering through the breakup of their parents' marriage in 1975 and struggling to adjust to their new environment of a collective it soon becomes clear that this film is about us  the children of the 1970s  who are now in their late 20s up through the early 40s. The film is a look back through the eyes of a then child now adult director of a time where nearly every value held by middleclass western society and culture was challenged if not in some settings entirely uprooted. We are the children who grew up in this age of fantastic turmoil and upheaval  which in Europe by the mid 1970s was probably even more tumultuous and radicalized than in the U.S. But of course it is also about the older generations who were young adults when all of this was happening.Perhaps most importantly however it is for the younger generations who weren't even born at that time. I say this because the direction the world seems to be headed for today seems to demand a response of a sense of some type community that began to disappear in the late 70s and 1980s. Many kids and young people only know about a couple kinds of communities and families gangs and stepfamilies. A film like this provides a very modest hope but at least some kind of hope.The main characters who are children Evan and Stefan are looking for love security and comfort at home as all children do but really can't find any of it save love because the security and comfort of bourgeois middleclass life was under this continual assault during the time period in which the film is set  and continues to be assaulted to this day though today often for different reasons. But meanwhile next door another child I can't remember the character's name must undergo a struggle of a different kind. He must endure the hypocrisy of his parents' loveless marriage which carries on possibly out of habit or possibly for the sake of appearances or possibly a fear of loneliness  or possibly all of these. The boy next door is aware and intrigued by the energy and liveliness of his strange next door hippie neighbors but he is mainly drawn to Eva who is as much a misfit in her environment as he is alienated in his.If Eva's struggle is to find a new identity away from the failure of her parents' marriage her brother Stefan's is to find a new way to reconnect to his mother and his father  especially his mother Elisabeth. She is now free to live again away from her hard drinking abusive husband but this new experimentation with a new life is at least initially a threat to Stefan who early on fears that his mother may be on the verge of abandoning him and his sister whom he is not very close with for this new lifestyle. Moodyson has a remarkable talent of rendering characters who on are the verge of losing everything  who are suffering devastating ruptures in their lives but somehow find the strength to adjust adapt and move on. The emotional core of these themes of great change struggle and moving on are with the children in this film. But all of the adults struggle with major changes too. Moodyson focuses the camera most on the most heartwrenched of the group of adults Elisabeth and Rolf and also Elisabeth's brother Goran whose girlfriend is recklessly and desperately promiscuous. Thus the emotional core of the film is basic to human emotional desires and needs the desire and need for love and the fallout of loneliness anguish and craziness when love goes awry and loved ones becomes irresponsible reckless or even dangerous.But from the perspective of the collective this film takes on another ambitious theme the interests of the individuals versus the interests of the group. We see this almost immediately in the film when we are introduced to the characters who inhabit Together and this is where much of the comedy in the film comes from. Early on all of the housemates squabble not only about whose turn it is to do the dishes but also whether doing dishes is even too bourgeois to bother with. Also the tension of integrating Elisabeth and her children in to the group  a tension which arises simply out of a reluctance to give up any more space to any newcomers  is important to the underlying themes in the film. Elisabeth and her children badly need comfort and acceptance but the children resist this new space of hippie sharing  as though they believe it's a fraud in its weirdness for the sake of weirdness. And another area this film explores well within the theme of the individual vs. the group is that of sexual experimentation and promiscuity. Vital to preserving the group is tolerance of homosexuality and sexual openness yet sexuality in a group setting can be as diverse as each individual that inhabits the group. And those who are most sexually predatory can leave lasting scars and bitter resentments. Homosexuality for some of the members in the group has lost its instinctual drive and instead as Lasse irreverently jests about toward his exwife becomes just another form of political expression  but also ultimately sex serves up a form of individual expression too. Sex gives the individual a greater sense of identity to the degree that that individual's sex life is so different from everyone else's  whether it's a certain kind of homosexuality a large number of sex partners an odd choice of sex partners etc. In other words sexuality can define the group but it often can threaten it too in that it too greatly exalts the conquests and exploitations of the individual.But then again so can many other values can define or threaten a group  many of which are shared and others which are not  such as vegetarianism television consumerism Marxism etc. Tension is there throughout over various doings or lack thereof within the household and these different areas are discussed and battled over through the characters to explore how the group succeeds or fails to define itself according to any given value. Erik leaves because he can not stand the group's softness when it comes to concern for the proletariat against the bourgeoisie enemy. Lasse makes fun of Erik to no end over what he sees as Erik's fundamental hypocrisy. Two other housemates finally leave when the children are allowed to bring hot dogs in to the house. Fundamentalism the film suggests destroys diversity and therefore is a threat to preserving a successful group dynamic even though fundamentalism may have the best interests of all at heart.Tolerance with some debate and disagreement is the key to long term togetherness and diversity. Togetherness and diversity is a key component to happiness and a functioning group the film strongly and convincingly suggests  especially through its wonderfully simple games in the November snow.This film also spoke to me in how it seemed to also evoke the countercultural revival of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Something about these hippies seemed neo rather than old school but that's understandable in that total period authenticity just isn't possible. Political correctness vs. creative and individualistic irony and drive also felt like a major theme at work here  even though no one in the film ever utters the term politically correct as it was not a term that was coined in the 70s. As a theme as much as a term such tensions are of the 1980s and 1990s as much as the 1970s  if not a little bit more. Maybe this is more in my head than it is in the film but I have to think that the countercultural aspects and themes in this film connect to a 21st century audience so strongly still not just because so many of us lived through the time period in which this film was set but also because we continued to live out these kinds of issues up until the present day  especially many of us who were kids in the 70s.Interestingly one thing the film really stays away from was central to the 60s and 70s counterculture drug use and experimentation  as though exploring this theme might infringe upon or distort the theme of drug and alcohol abuse  which one of the characters Rolf battles in the film. But nearly everyone else in the film drinks too so I'm not so sure. If drug experimentation at Together had been more explored in this film it could have provided some more lively and funny scenes but perhaps Moodyson didn't see the need either in terms of character or of theme. Instead everyone pretty much drinks alcohol. Maybe drugs weren't as big in 1975 Sweden as they were in 1975 America. They were  and for much of the population still are  a religion in America.If this film had been only about Elisabeth's dilemma with her children and her husband or only about the collective itself it would not have been nearly so strong. But Moodyson joins the two main stories and sets of characters masterfully to illustrate his themes. Moodyson introduces us to dysfunction in the family realm with Elisabeth and Rolf and then moves us over to difficulties in the community realm with the collective Together. By joining the two groups  the family and the community  in his narrative with such skill wit and simplicity Moodyson shows how the two need one another can threaten and damage one another but can also fill in for one where the other could be failing. In this film it seems to be the community rescuing souls from the dysfunction of family more so than vice versa. Families break down but the community can help restore some sense of order  and can occasionally help restore families. Togetherness in the community arises where a lack of togetherness in the family is most needed yet togetherness in the community requires a sense of shared responsibility and industry to go along with the friendship and nurturing.The film suggests that not all forms of togetherness are ideal but togetherness in general is essential  and that debate and discord are an important part of maintaining and discovering what makes the group work. The film also strongly suggests that intolerance and recklessness in the long run leads to loneliness anguish and despair. It's been so long since I have seen a film I could relate to with such ease. My sincere thanks to Moodyson for such a heartfelt hilarious painful genuine film.".

A film like this provides a very modest hope but at least some kind of hope.The main characters who are children Evan and Stefan are looking for love security and comfort at home as all children do but really can't find any of it save love because the security and comfort of bourgeois middleclass life was under this continual assault during the time period in which the film is set  and continues to be assaulted to this day though today often for different reasons. But meanwhile next door another child I can't remember the character's name must undergo a struggle of a different kind. He must endure the hypocrisy of his parents' loveless marriage which carries on possibly out of habit or possibly for the sake of appearances or possibly a fear of loneliness  or possibly all of these. The boy next door is aware and intrigued by the energy and liveliness of his strange next door hippie neighbors but he is mainly drawn to Eva who is as much a misfit in her environment as he is alienated in his.If Eva's struggle is to find a new identity away from the failure of her parents' marriage her brother Stefan's is to find a new way to reconnect to his mother and his father  especially his mother Elisabeth. She is now free to live again away from her hard drinking abusive husband but this new experimentation with a new life is at least initially a threat to Stefan who early on fears that his mother may be on the verge of abandoning him and his sister whom he is not very close with for this new lifestyle. Moodyson has a remarkable talent of rendering characters who on are the verge of losing everything  who are suffering devastating ruptures in their lives but somehow find the strength to adjust adapt and move on. The emotional core of these themes of great change struggle and moving on are with the children in this film. But all of the adults struggle with major changes too. Moodyson focuses the camera most on the most heartwrenched of the group of adults Elisabeth and Rolf and also Elisabeth's brother Goran whose girlfriend is recklessly and desperately promiscuous. Thus the emotional core of the film is basic to human emotional desires and needs the desire and need for love and the fallout of loneliness anguish and craziness when love goes awry and loved ones becomes irresponsible reckless or even dangerous.But from the perspective of the collective this film takes on another ambitious theme the interests of the individuals versus the interests of the group. We see this almost immediately in the film when we are introduced to the characters who inhabit Together and this is where much of the comedy in the film comes from. Early on all of the housemates squabble not only about whose turn it is to do the dishes but also whether doing dishes is even too bourgeois to bother with. Also the tension of integrating Elisabeth and her children in to the group  a tension which arises simply out of a reluctance to give up any more space to any newcomers  is important to the underlying themes in the film. Elisabeth and her children badly need comfort and acceptance but the children resist this new space of hippie sharing  as though they believe it's a fraud in its weirdness for the sake of weirdness. And another area this film explores well within the theme of the individual vs. the group is that of sexual experimentation and promiscuity. Vital to preserving the group is tolerance of homosexuality and sexual openness yet sexuality in a group setting can be as diverse as each individual that inhabits the group. And those who are most sexually predatory can leave lasting scars and bitter resentments. Homosexuality for some of the members in the group has lost its instinctual drive and instead as Lasse irreverently jests about toward his exwife becomes just another form of political expression  but also ultimately sex serves up a form of individual expression too. Sex gives the individual a greater sense of identity to the degree that that individual's sex life is so different from everyone else's  whether it's a certain kind of homosexuality a large number of sex partners an odd choice of sex partners etc. In other words sexuality can define the group but it often can threaten it too in that it too greatly exalts the conquests and exploitations of the individual.But then again so can many other values can define or threaten a group  many of which are shared and others which are not  such as vegetarianism television consumerism Marxism etc. Tension is there throughout over various doings or lack thereof within the household and these different areas are discussed and battled over through the characters to explore how the group succeeds or fails to define itself according to any given value. Erik leaves because he can not stand the group's softness when it comes to concern for the proletariat against the bourgeoisie enemy. Lasse makes fun of Erik to no end over what he sees as Erik's fundamental hypocrisy. Two other housemates finally leave when the children are allowed to bring hot dogs in to the house. Fundamentalism the film suggests destroys diversity and therefore is a threat to preserving a successful group dynamic even though fundamentalism may have the best interests of all at heart.Tolerance with some debate and disagreement is the key to long term togetherness and diversity. Togetherness and diversity is a key component to happiness and a functioning group the film strongly and convincingly suggests  especially through its wonderfully simple games in the November snow.This film also spoke to me in how it seemed to also evoke the countercultural revival of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Something about these hippies seemed neo rather than old school but that's understandable in that total period authenticity just isn't possible. Political correctness vs. creative and individualistic irony and drive also felt like a major theme at work here  even though no one in the film ever utters the term politically correct as it was not a term that was coined in the 70s. As a theme as much as a term such tensions are of the 1980s and 1990s as much as the 1970s  if not a little bit more. Maybe this is more in my head than it is in the film but I have to think that the countercultural aspects and themes in this film connect to a 21st century audience so strongly still not just because so many of us lived through the time period in which this film was set but also because we continued to live out these kinds of issues up until the present day  especially many of us who were kids in the 70s.Interestingly one thing the film really stays away from was central to the 60s and 70s counterculture drug use and experimentation  as though exploring this theme might infringe upon or distort the theme of drug and alcohol abuse  which one of the characters Rolf battles in the film. But nearly everyone else in the film drinks too so I'm not so sure. If drug experimentation at Together had been more explored in this film it could have provided some more lively and funny scenes but perhaps Moodyson didn't see the need either in terms of character or of theme. Instead everyone pretty much drinks alcohol. Maybe drugs weren't as big in 1975 Sweden as they were in 1975 America. They were  and for much of the population still are  a religion in America.If this film had been only about Elisabeth's dilemma with her children and her husband or only about the collective itself it would not have been nearly so strong. But Moodyson joins the two main stories and sets of characters masterfully to illustrate his themes. Moodyson introduces us to dysfunction in the family realm with Elisabeth and Rolf and then moves us over to difficulties in the community realm with the collective Together. By joining the two groups  the family and the community  in his narrative with such skill wit and simplicity Moodyson shows how the two need one another can threaten and damage one another but can also fill in for one where the other could be failing. In this film it seems to be the community rescuing souls from the dysfunction of family more so than vice versa. Families break down but the community can help restore some sense of order  and can occasionally help restore families. Togetherness in the community arises where a lack of togetherness in the family is most needed yet togetherness in the community requires a sense of shared responsibility and industry to go along with the friendship and nurturing.The film suggests that not all forms of togetherness are ideal but togetherness in general is essential  and that debate and discord are an important part of maintaining and discovering what makes the group work. The film also strongly suggests that intolerance and recklessness in the long run leads to loneliness anguish and despair. It's been so long since I have seen a film I could relate to with such ease. My sincere thanks to Moodyson for such a heartfelt hilarious painful genuine film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Together is a story of human relationship. As one character says at one point in the film I'd rather eat porridge together than pork chops alone and that is the recurring message throughout the film. Our story takes place in a commune in 1975 which is called you guessed it 'Together'. The commune serves as the crux of the movie it's the centre of the film and the people that inhabit it are what surrounds the central habitat. The film really starts when Elisabeth has a fight with her husband and leaves him with the kids to live at the commune which is owned by her brother the far too kind Goran. From there the film just takes off the multiple personalities that inhabit the commune are each allowed to grow and be nurtured by the audience no one character is similar to another and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Just like he did in his masterpiece Show Me Love Lukas Moodysson creates characters here that are real and that we therefore are able to feel for and like for being people as opposed to just because they're the central characters. It's this realism that gives Together its edge over most other human dramas such as In America or Whale Rider.Lukas Moodysson delivers a film here that works on a multitude of levels. The moments of drama are spot on and because each of the characters gets to develop and we get to know them it makes the drama more powerful than it would have been if this were not true. It's amazing actually just how many characters Moodysson is able to juggle in this film. In many films with a lot of characters some end up being left by the wayside and not having a chance to shine but all the ones here do and that is a testament to Moodysson's writing abilities. The acting on display here is an exhibition in excellence and nothing that the actors do in the film feels odd or out of place. It's almost like watching a real commune. Just like he did with Show Me Love Moodysson has opted for a gritty style to his film which doesn't make the film look nice but it does give it a very rough edge which is what the film needs it wouldn't have been the same with an aesthetically pleasing feel. Moodysson's direction in the film is very detached and it almost feels like a documentary. This is a good thing as with this Moodysson allows the audience to make their own mind up about what is happening on the screen. He never piles on the sentiment or condones or discourages any of the acts in the film they're just they're and you can choose whether they are moral or amoral which is exactly how a drama of this ilk should be.Overall Together is an excellent piece of film. The character development and the way that the characters are handled alone makes it a must see but the excellence doesn't end there. Moodysson has created a film here that is as entertaining as anything you're likely to see and with a definite message. Moodysson can make rubbish for the rest of his life and still be warmly remembered for this and Show Me Love.".

Naturally the socialist utopia begins to break down as the reality of the traditional conventions of human nature creep in.Goran a leading member of the collective brings his sister Elisabeth and her two children to stay at the commune when she leaves her abusive and alcoholic husband.  Initally pretty bewildered by the bizarre environment she finds herself in she begins to enjoy her new life after being befriended by Anna a member of the commune who according to her exhusband Lasse has decided to become a lesbian for 'political reasons'.Lasse is in turn being pursued by Klas a naive homosexual and Lena Goran's girlfriend is also sleeping with Erik the rich man's son who has rejected his background to become a welder   a job at which he does not excel  and is the most ardently political member of the collective. Whilst Goran and Lena practice an 'open relationship' Goran ultimately struggles and finally cracks in one of the most climactic scenes of the film.Director Moodysson shows his brilliant understanding of childhood in his portrayal of the budding relationship between Eva the teenage daughter of Elisabeth and Frederik the son of an uptight middle class family who live across the street.  Both loners who don't have any friends at school they bond through the discovery that they both have bad eyesight and slowly become friends.  The  pain of adolescence sexual naivety and acute awkardness is captured here perfectly.Conflict in the house soon ensues when the rejected conventions begin to creep in   Goran and Lasse buy a TV for the kids to watch the kids picket for meat and begin to play with Lego.  Two members leave in disgust to join the rival commune ' Mother Earth' and Erik leaves full of disappointment with what he sees as the political apathy of the house.Despite the problems at the collective it's warmth and love is illustrated in the contrast with the loneliness of Elisabeth's abandoned husband.  He initially drowns his sorrows with yet more alcohol but is shocked into repentance after a disastrous night out with his children when he gets drunk and is eventually arrested. A plumber he meets another man who's wife has also left him and is so lonely he calls him out to fix a nonexistent toilet purely for someone to talk to.Eventually the film ends on a feelgood note but of course as viewers from the 21st century we know that this particular brand of idealism is approaching it's sell by date.  However while this is really a film about the conflict of individuality versus the complexity of family and community it never judges or damns it simply observes.Moodysson treats the era with a wry sense of humour without actually laughing at it and lets the plot gently unfold with a deft hand.  An extremely intelligent piece the acting is impeccable throughout.Highly recommended.".

It has no plot to speak of but hey plots are overrated anyway especially as most of them have so many holes it's impossible to make sense Together bypasses this by not having one. But instead what we have is a beautifully observed and a very subtle intelligent comedy. Together initially ironic follows the discordant inhabitants of a hippie commune in the midseventies. It begins with them all literally jumping for joy at the news of Franco's death so yeah they have their beliefs where much of the comedy is derived coming as we do from an apathetic cynical newmillennium perspective. Well I laughed an example one of the children is called Tet after the Tet offensive during Vietnam!!. And there's the free love the radical politics and the ostracisation towards them by their neighbours. All the clichs but clichs do happen and as with Show Me Love the writerdirector Lukas Moodysson manages to somehow freshen and make them no longer clichd at all a very good skill he has.Coming from the position of being a very big fan of Lukas' first and better film Show Me Love Fucking ml it's easy to see the similarities between the two. The similarities are what make Together less impressive that and the story is less interesting it's not dull but there are just too many characters it's hard to connect with any one of them. I've seen Show Me Love perhaps too many times what keeps me coming back again and again is that I really connect with and love the main characters it's like they are versions of who I once was. Additionally there are essentially only two of them for Lukas to focus on whereas with Together there are at least ten. I don't think it's the age thing either as I'm closer to those in Together than Show Me Love depressingly. There are just too many characters and he can't focus on them all the film is essentially a snapshot of their lives over the space of a turbulent few weeks. Similar to Show Me Love only with the same duration Together needed to be longer. However at the close it does all come together you begin to feel for the characters. You come to understand and witness some growth in them they lose some of their radicalism and begin to actually like each other becoming more synergistic as the staunchly dogmatic members leave for more idealistic communes or the Baader Meinhof! I think the point is that the remaining characters may be similar to me I may have found a connection only there is no time to show this as they only get a few moments of focus each.There are also some annoying directorial techniques the same ones as in Show Me Love like the fastzoom to closeup where sometimes a static shot would have been better I hoped he'd learnt to use it sparingly but obviously he loves it too much to ever part. But this is a tiny point the biggest drawback is that I can see all the characters from Show Me Love transposed onto this film different ages different settings but essentially the same it's like we're watching the parents of the kids in his earlier film. It's not enough to annoy me but it does detract it's what makes this film only a nine rather than the definite ten that Show Me Love deserves. Finally I hope Lukas will make a film better than Show Me Love so he'll not have it like a millstone but first he has to find different voices for his characters. I hope everything he does will not be compared to that film but it is a very good film indeed. However Together as it stands is just too similar not to compare it with his earlier film.After seeing Together I left the cinema smiling and if nothing else it managed to make me sing ABBA's SOS all the way home and I hate ABBA being a man and all! And I'm still deciding about seeing it again so it is a good film and I did enjoy it the difference being that I wanted to see Show Me Love again immediately and then over and over and over and do. Maybe after a second viewing I'll feel something more for the characters? I'll let you know!".

Goran is a good man who has an open relationship with his mate Lena Anja Lundqvist but does not feel comfortable with the situation. They are welcomed by the group composed of a newlesbian Anna Jessica Liedberg her almost gay husband and their children a gay and an idealist communist. Eva becomes friend of her neighbor Fredrik and with the newarrivals in the commune lives of the members change. Meanwhile Rolf misses Elizabeth and his family stops drinking and tries to approach to Elizabeth again.Tillsammans is a delightful dramatic comedy of this great Swedish director Lukas Moodysson. The story is very human and engaging with many characters very welldeveloped that find themselves in a world of freedom and without repression changing their behaviors and improving as human beings. Very hilarious at least for SouthAmericans the two boys playing of torture as if one of them was the Chilean General Augusto Pinochet. The integration promoted by the soccer game is fantastic. The soundtrack with hits of the 70's is wonderful and another attraction. My vote is seven.Title Brazil BemVindos Welcome".

	schema:reviewBody "It is so rare in these times to find a film so utterly bereft of cynicism and so warmly sympathetic to people in all their variety and flaws that it would be churlish to do anything but celebrate.  Some critics have complained that 'Together' has adopted a sneering tone towards its subject matter a collective living in 70s Stockholm in which more hackneyed emphasis is put on rows about washingup and petty ideological points than the genuine spirit of goodwill that made them set up a collective in the first place.  They must have been watching a different film to the one I saw  not only is the portrait of the collective affirmative but it is made into a kind of magical space with transformative powers  it protects the weak gives refuge to outsiders opens the minds of the closed but essentially decent outsiders.  It is a magnet which drags towards it those in need of spiritual change those for whom the social grind of 70s Sweden supposedly the most liberated and liberal in the world is too much.  It manages the difficult trick of celebrating alternative communities and dropping out while retaining the integrity of the individual and the family. This collective is a magical space in the Shakespearean sense a kind of Forest of Arden with its own special glow surrounded by the grey oppressiveness of normal society.  It has no place for false freedoms austere puritanism selfish sexual promiscuity narrow ideological nitpicking.  Although it effects change on outsiders its power comes from its ability to change within to adapt  its power is not destroyed by the introduction of TV or meat it is strengthened because their introduction respects the freedom of others.  Again like Shakespeare it is not just a magical space but a testing ground a spiritual test for those of essentially good faith.  This is where I got a little queasy and could sympathise with the critics.  With any test some people must pass some must fail to allow someone to enter someone must be thrown out.  It's a fair enough satiric point that en essentially decent man is turned by a soulless society into a spiritually empty drunken wifebeater.  And it's completely lovable that Moodysson should take this potential monster and make his spiritual progress the heart of the movie. But to make this possible somebody must be expelled.  And this is Lena whose nymphomania is demonised as destructive even paedophiliac.  The scene where she is thrown out is dangerously close to Lester Burnam's throwing a plate in 'American Beauty'  where a weak man finally puts a strong overbearing woman in her place.  We are meant to cheer I found it uncomfortable.  It seems Moodysson's big inclusive heart wasn't big or inclusive enough.I found 'Together' very watchable and likeable but something of a disappointment after 'Show me love'.  Maybe the jokes weren't funny enough. Maybe the multicharacter format is more suited to ironic distance e.g. Altman than warmth although Edward Yang pulled it off.  Maybe the characters through amiable aren't distinctive enough  with the exception of introverted Lisa Simpson prototype Eva with whom I worryingly identified it was hard to care about the characters. The use of Abba to add a builtin melancholy for the overall optimism was inspired  I loved the fact that the 70s recreation was less in the period detail than in the zoomheavy darkcolour style  even the genitalia was filmed in 70s porn murkiness.".

Few movies successfully allow such freedom at least in still giving us an overall picture. So totally unHollywood with as much natural everything including refreshingly these days body hair  and I mean ALL body hair that it's impossible to get embarrassed by any of the open and frank attitudes to sex the now ridiculous clothes and the Communist lifestyle of the 'Collective' as it prefers to be termed not commune.Battered housewife Elisabeth leaves her husband Rolf with her children and is promptly thrown into the very strange but comforting cushion as is the Collective as Rolf pours all the alcohol down the drain and attempts to contact his wife. Slowly through reunions with the children they paint their view on their new life which as you can imagine is often hilarious. Whether they get back together as a family unit is definitely not for me to say though and the varying shades of this aspect is yet another of the film's delights.Because everyone is so natural nothing is surprising yet individually in another film and with a different director many scenes would just be too wayout and offbeam. Similarly we almost want to join them as commonsense is painlessly drawn from us and we are enveloped by these rather strange but peculiarly likable people.Moodysson extracts enormously natural and relaxed performances  you'd swear much of it is a documentary yet the camera always expertly follows and ends up just where it should be swiftly but gently. The children in particular especially when playing is a wondrously warm treat they're just like all kids everywhere totally oblivious to the camera.Together is an offbeat gem it might not be for everyone but for anyone with a heart and soul and a wholesome attitude to life it definitely will be.".

That would have been a big mistake.In the early part of the film it is often difficult to sympathise with some of the characters who live in the Tillsammans Commune even though their antics are frequently funny. It doesn't take long to figure out that you aren't necessarily supposed to like some of the characters or what they get up to. The title is very clever inasmuch as it describes the film perfectly on a number of levels. The commune is called Together and the subplots within the film are all about how people live together. This could easily be trivial if not downright icky if it was an American film but there's very little of the sentimental cloying stuff you find in mainstream films. It strikes me in some ways as being very like the situation you find in the bestwritten fantasy and science fiction books and thrillers and many other novels but not serious novels having a real family is not about blood and relationships it's about finding your family of choice. And that's what the characters in this film manage and it's all down with a great deal of humour and affection for the 70s the period in which it's set.I believe that in this film Moodysson has achieved the task he seems to claim he often attempts  that is to both defend and attack something with equal vigour. So even though you can see the satire of the wilder political and feminist viewpoints explored here you can also see how seriously the director has taken the ideas and shown how they positively influence the family that coalesces by the end of the film.But beyond the analysis of what the film may or may not be about it has to be said that this is a joyous film. You would have to be dead not to enjoy the jokes and always perfect use of music. By the end you can't help but have a silly grin all over your face and you may well find yourself questioning as I did why you waste so much time watching so many inferior American films".

Too bad Wes Anderson didn't see this one before he made the Royal Tenebaums. The family in Together is disfuntional in more ways than one and the family goes two ways  one communal and another by blood. All the characters are flawed but like most people in real life but unlike in the recent spate of hateful American films  we can see that people are basically good and stuggling to get better. Subjects such as alcoholism pediphilia and abuse are brought up and treated in a very real way and with a lot of humor.Real humor  side splitting  roll on the floor  pee your pants humor. That above all makes me recommend this film strongly. I like to laugh  and when you can tell that people are trying to find the humor  you know when a few people laugh here  and then a few people there  and then afterwards everyone ties to explain the joke to one another  I just get angry. No one should feel obligated to laugh when something just isn't funny  ala the Royal Tennenbaums and happiness and all those other so called comedies that are around these days.So.

	schema:headline " An engaging and amusing film that works on several levels and is well worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "When Elisabeth's husband Rolf hits her she packs her bags and takes the children to go and stay with her brother Gran. Gran lives in communal house called the Together commune and as such things are a bit different from what Elisabeth Eva and Stefan are used to. Elisabeth seems to take to the fun adult lifestyle easily but with no TV and no normal structure Eva and Stefan struggle with Eva spending a lot of her time sitting outside in the van while Stefan seems determined to get back to his father. However as time goes by the dynamics of the commune start to shift due to the presence of the family.Although I wasn't sure what this film was going to be about at first I found myself drawn into it on the grounds of it being nicely comic without mocking its characters to the degree that the audience loses the ability to take them seriously or have an interest in them. As such the film works well because it treads this fine line and finds things to like and mock on both sides of the society that we see being formed within the house. Parts of it are funny but generally it is comic and engaging at the same time. If there is a moral then I suppose it is that no one group is right and that happiness and peace is easiest found in the middle ground rather than in the extremes no matter how worthy they seem this message is clear and it is nicely woven into the story that sees both extremes comically picked away to leave a final scene of simple pleasure and togetherness. It sound corny but I was surprised by how expertly Moodysson delivered it  keeping the emotional core while also producing laughs and characters that if you met them in the street you would hit! The cast do well to work within this and I was impressed by the fact that they mostly avoided caricature. It is hard to pick out one performance because the whole film is very much an ensemble piece but if only for avoiding the horrid cute kid performances so beloved by Hollywood Samuelsson and Kessel deserve praise. Generally everyone gets the tone of the film and produces performances that are comic without hating themselves. Moodysson's direction took a second to get the hang of with its zooms and movement but I quickly got into it and it did suit the material by drawing the audience into the house even on my small TV it worked!.Overall this is a slight but enjoyable film that is as comic as it is engaging. It is not hilarious and it is not dramatic suitably enough it sits somewhere in the middle ground but works well by doing so. The plot is simple but the writing makes it more than it seems as it charmingly delivers a solid moral. It may frustrate some viewers looking for a nice traditional narrative but this is an engaging and amusing film that works on several levels and is well worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Elisabeth's husband Rolf hits her she packs her bags and takes the children to go and stay with her brother Gran. Gran lives in communal house called the Together commune and as such things are a bit different from what Elisabeth Eva and Stefan are used to. Elisabeth seems to take to the fun adult lifestyle easily but with no TV and no normal structure Eva and Stefan struggle with Eva spending a lot of her time sitting outside in the van while Stefan seems determined to get back to his father. However as time goes by the dynamics of the commune start to shift due to the presence of the family.Although I wasn't sure what this film was going to be about at first I found myself drawn into it on the grounds of it being nicely comic without mocking its characters to the degree that the audience loses the ability to take them seriously or have an interest in them.

A boy moves into his uncle's midseventies Stockhom commune. That's it. But the joys and aggravations of collective living are exposed thru a series of events that are not the type of lifechanging things that characterize American movies. Rather it's the small things couples trying to stay together. Couples breaking up.

	schema:headline " the French do romance differently";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked this film. The French formula for romantic comedy doesn't depend on the characters being rich young and handsome an opulent setting  and no old people except for very minor characters. French directors find romance in the humbler areas of Paris as well as the flashier parts. Camille Audrey Tautou an art school dropout works as a cleaner or surface engineer as she likes to be called. She lives in a garret in the same old apartment building as Philibert Laurent Stocker who is young and goodlooking but is the French equivalent of a dim gentleman. Philibert sells postcards for a living. Notwithstanding a stutter he aspires to a career on the stage. He shares his rather grand but dowdy apartment his grandmother's former home with the gruff Franck Guillaume Canet a womanizing chef. Franck is preoccupied with looking after his elderly grandmother Paulette Francoise Bertin who is hospitalized after a fall. When Camille falls ill Philibert invites Camille to convalesce at his place. Soon she is striking sparks off grumpy old Franck.Philibert isn't gay it's just that his romantic interests lie elsewhere. It is Pauline who draws Franck and Camille together. The French title Ensemble C'est Tout Together That's All says it all really. I haven't a clue what this film has to do with hunting and gathering.Audrey Tautou has just about got the market for sexy French waifs sewn up. I've seen her in several other films and her performances are similar. Guillaume Canet lets us see his gruff chef's soft side and Francoise Bertin also evokes sympathy for someone made tiresome by old age. The part of Philibert's love interest Aurelia is severely truncated the result of putting a 600 page novel into 100 minutes of film. This also tends to sideline Philibert later in the film.I very much liked Jean de Floriet and Manon des Sources directed by Claude Berri 20 years ago two other literary adaptations. He is a very conservative straightforward director but he can produce some very vivid work. One very touching scene here is when Philibert goes to a speech therapist to cure his stutter. The therapist Phillipe van Eeckhout is one in real life and treated Berri after a recent stroke damaged his speaking ability.So we have no glamorous stars though Audrey Tautou is big in France and no shimmering background. But it's a warmhearted story with some real emotion and dare I say it a happy ending. And here's something for the nitpickers. Franck would never have got to London from the Gare du Lyon except via the connecting suburban RER line. Paris  London trains leave from the magnificent Gare du Nord. But who cares?".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Hunting and Gathering";
	schema:reviewBody "It's Audrey Tautou and ever since Amelie I am of the opinion that Singaporeans have an affinity for the pint sized actress and her box office draw here is fairly strong. Count me in as one of the fans who will lap up her cinematic outings good or bad so long as our heroine gets the opportunity to shine on screen.Hunting and Gathering is based on a novel by Anna Gavalda and tells the story of four individuals whose lives converge in an apartment. In this movie directed by Claude Berri I thought that it was split into 3 acts with story arcs focused on the challenges faced by each of the characters. Tautou stars as Camille Fauque a near anorexic surface engineer who smokes a lot guzzles alcohol but eats very little. Living alone in a small attic of an apartment block she meets Philibert Laurent Stocker a fellow neighbour who suffers from bouts of anxiety. Philibert's housemate Franck Guillaume Canet is a chef who lives hard and fast whose only worry is the welfare of his grandmother Paulette Francoise Bertin a senior citizen who fears being tossed aside by kin and makes life quite difficult for her caretakers.The narrative is quite plain actually with every conceivable development being very predictable. That means no quirky twists and turns for the sake of it and it actually allows you to shift to lower gears to enjoy this outing. It's a story about having dreams fulfilling them and helping others to fulfill theirs too through encouragement and support rendered. Having all four characters together under one roof though brief it might be did seem like an episode of Friends gone all French and all whacked with the age grouping and proving correct the adage that two's a company and three's a crowd.It did try to cover a lot of ground given that there are a number of characters here but it did so at the expense of depth. The romance entanglements between characters did seem rather superficial bland trivial and predictable while Philibert's quest to stem out his stammering through stage acting unfortunately had to take the backseat and thus having his character fade away somewhat for the last act of the movie. The most meaningful and beautiful arc here belongs to Francoise Bertin's Paulette as her tale of fear of abandonment rings through very honestly and somehow you'll start to wonder when you're of old age whether you will have companions whom you can get along with or be forgotten and tossed to some old folks' home to spend your twilight years in. I felt that it was superiorly poignant without which there would be no emotional anchor for this movie.Somehow movies that feature food and classy restaurants Ratatouille Mostly Martha and No Reservations anyone? of late that I've watched always have fallen into the clichd ending. I'm unsure if it's an unwritten rule to have it done so or if it's a formula that has proved to work every time. But in all earnestness I thought it ended quite nicely with that happily ever after feel. In summary definitely worth a watch for the eye candy cast but it plays like a generic romantic  friendship tale that possesses potential that was hardly scratched.".

The character's central conflict is not firmly established and watching the plot develop was equivalent to swimming in an open sea directionless. The happy ending was completely expected but heartwarming all the same I just wished they had brought out the narrative motive more convincingly for me to feel like there was a point to this whole movie. The pacing was also a little too slow and the nondescript dialog emphasized the lengthy duration of the movie.On a whole I felt the director could have done a lot better with the movie by giving it greater focus faster pacing wittier dialog there were quite a few moments in the film between Tautou and Canet's characters that could have done better with wittier dialog.A mustwatch only for the actors' fans.".

Philibert shares his apartment with Franck Guillaume Canet the motorcyclechef and eventually Franck's ailing grandmother Paulette Franoise Bertin moves in as well.From there things proceed mostly how you'd expect with the requisite mixture of comedy and drama. The scenes between Franck and Paulette are the least original the other plot lines at least have a few amusing incidents to liven them up. And the movie is so concerned with the romance between Camille and Franck that Philibertwho also finds love during the course of the storygets short shrift. We never see him interact with his girlfriend which severely limits his character arc. Also in an American movie a character who looks and acts like Philibert shy bookish wearing velvet suits and bow ties would almost certainly be gay so it comes as a bit of a surprise to learn that he isn't.

	schema:headline " Hunting the Elf and Picking a Berri";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent but relatively littleknown film scripted and directed by Claude Berri. The original French title of the film is ENSEMBLE C'EST TOUT. It is based on a novel by Anna Gavalda. It offers yet another opportunity for the Elf Audrey Tautou to shine which is always welcome to tautouologists. Her eyes are just as big as usual. Indeed the behaviour of this rare mammal never disappoints and is as interesting as the meerkats especially with her great big eyes. Elves also have the advantage of being related to humans so that they are even more endearing. Here the Elf pretends to be difficult and disturbed which we tautouologists know is only acting. Equally difficult and disturbed is Guillaume Canet who for a long time does not fully appreciate the Elf and is apparently blind to her merits. Indeed there is even initial hostility between them. But then something called Love enters the story and the two creatures discover the joys of cuddling and other such intimacies which mammals enjoy. Dancing round these two creatures is a splendid one called Laurent Stocker who plays the character called Philibert an aristocrat with many more grand names after that including also the necessary 'de' without which no French aristocrat is complete. He is what is known as 'effete' but in the most charming and delightful and scatty way. They all end up living together in a gigantic flat in Paris which is full of antiques and family portraits of the 'de' family. As for the Elf and the Canet they are not aristocrats and the Canet has boorish habits such as living in an untidy nest with things all over the floor. This is a very charming romantic comedy directed with the flair which we normally associate with the Berri and which suits all films starring the irresistible Elf. All animal lovers and Francophiles will love this film. And even the French who are so hard to please must enthusiastically enjoy such an ensemble and believe that c'est tout. Of course this all happened a very long time ago in 2007. But its warm glow persists in the sky of celluloid heaven.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is an excellent but relatively littleknown film scripted and directed by Claude Berri. The original French title of the film is ENSEMBLE C'EST TOUT. It is based on a novel by Anna Gavalda. It offers yet another opportunity for the Elf Audrey Tautou to shine which is always welcome to tautouologists. Her eyes are just as big as usual. Indeed the behaviour of this rare mammal never disappoints and is as interesting as the meerkats especially with her great big eyes. Elves also have the advantage of being related to humans so that they are even more endearing. Here the Elf pretends to be difficult and disturbed which we tautouologists know is only acting. Equally difficult and disturbed is Guillaume Canet who for a long time does not fully appreciate the Elf and is apparently blind to her merits. Indeed there is even initial hostility between them. But then something called Love enters the story and the two creatures discover the joys of cuddling and other such intimacies which mammals enjoy. Dancing round these two creatures is a splendid one called Laurent Stocker who plays the character called Philibert an aristocrat with many more grand names after that including also the necessary 'de' without which no French aristocrat is complete. He is what is known as 'effete' but in the most charming and delightful and scatty way. They all end up living together in a gigantic flat in Paris which is full of antiques and family portraits of the 'de' family. As for the Elf and the Canet they are not aristocrats and the Canet has boorish habits such as living in an untidy nest with things all over the floor.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts almost with a scene of an old woman collapsing at home from a stroke and her neighbour calling her grandson Franck a cook whose job dictates that he lives a life of constantly trying to catch up on his sleep after long working hours. Before that we see Camille a woman with artistic talents getting a job at the lowest of the social rung a cleaning lady for offices. Through a chance encounter with Camille we meet Philibert a poor aristocrat aspiring to be a professional actor. The three of them live in the same house the men roommates and the women in an atticlike room that cannot even accommodate a table. The movie shows how these three strangers while the men are roommates it doesn't look as if they are lifelong buddies get to know appreciate care for and help each other.While we see character development for all the three characters we are not given complete backgrounds. This is the way it should be for this movie which is a crosssectional slice of a certain point in their lives.Through a brief scene lunching with her mother we understand that Camille is raised in a single parent family father deserting them and the relationship between mother and daughter has never been good. It is never explained why a girl with considerable talent good practical sense a warm heart and a healthy sense of humour should settle for a menial job. Is that deliberately to spite the mother? We can only guess.Franck seems not unhappy working as a cook where he seems to be on good terms with his boss and coworkers. His predicament is long hours and the need to take care of his ailing grandmother. After her stroke his only day off each week is written off as the nursing home he can afford to put her in is a long ride away. While we are touched by Franck's kindness to his grandmother we tend to frown upon his customary gruff temper particularly towards Camille. But his hidden tenderness and sense of humor gradually surface.Stuttering Philibert on the other hand is likable from beginning to end kind caring mild and gentle. Again not much is given by way of his background although we see that he does have a family which he visits occasionally. With Philibert the focus is on his dream of becoming a stage performer which he eventually achieves through training from a good teacher introduced by his girlfriend.The movie revolves around these three people. The main event if there's one is when Camille at her own initiative takes up the job of nursing Franck's grandma by having her moved to live with them. This is the happiest time of the old woman's life. During a brief visit back in her own home she dies peacefully sitting on her own rocking chair. Her creamed ashes are scattered in her own garden.One would almost wish that there is no romance to make this Paris movie really unique. But that will be too much of a disappointment for most audience to contemplate. The romance is fine though  light unsentimental and consistent with the characters of Camille and Franck. And there is something unique about the Paris shown in this movie  neighborhood unassuming scenes that do not have tourist attraction written all over the frame.".

The basic theme here is forgiveness over and over again  and how the kindness displayed to them eventually changes them but not  without many trials. These trials make up the rest of the movie and fill in where the musical numbers are not there.  I would have liked to see the English subtitles in place during the music just so I could understand instead of guessing what they were singing about but this isn't the fault of the movie just those who distributed it to English speaking audiences.  If there is a copy with this added I'll watch the movie again and enjoy it that much more.

It was one of the most naturalreal and effusive show of affection shown on the big screen that I had seen and the scene immediately made me remember the people in my grandfather's village.V.Shantaram has used a simple screenplay without complex reactions to show the pathos and feelings experienced by the convicts. Still certain scenes such as the one showing the Barberconvict requesting the Jailor to have a shave are very natural.To put it in a nutshell Do Aankhen Barah Haath is an extremely optimistic movie that can endure beyond eras and times.".

Plot is simple and filled with surprises and mythological grandiose. At times movie becomes sheer art and work of genius when V Shantaram through his spectacular framing and simple screenplay details talk about the psychology of a common man or uncommon man in dynamic society. Scenes like grandmother Shankar walking out first night sleep etc are just mind blowing. My favorite scene is when Jailer drags the barbed wire woods. Making of the film is extremely artistic. All the scenes are thoroughly conceived. You can make out each and every actor moves from spot to spot. Camera moves in spots. Every single frame is detailed to its last frame. Acting is extremely animated but works in favor in a film like this. Background music is extremely provocative as lots of drums are used. Very entertaining drama. 910.".

Their individual captures were directly or indirectly associated with the work of Aidan McRory a treasure and big game hunter whose main goal is to make as much money for himself by selling his largely illegally obtained artifacts and animal parts at auction in Europe. Through the process he has an emotional connection with one of the cubs who is eventually named Kumal but of who he eventually loses track.

Though far from perfect I found this movie to be exceptionally entertaining on all accounts. Sarah claims there's no story no characters no moral ... on and on. Well what she says is a complete crock there is a story it's about the two tiger brothers who are taken from their jungle home. The two main characters are not human and I guess the fact that they don't have dialogue presented quite an obstacle for Sarah because she doesn't seem to have followed their story and its moralethical significance. Since the movie plays out like a fairy tale realism here is not the point hence the broad human characterizations. Rather the most successful parts of the film allows us to view the world from the animals' eyes and in doing so we experience their feelings memories and needs. I found this to be entertaining and at times quite moving. The film makers ennoble these tiger characters with such power and respect I find it utterly mystifying that anyone could miss this as being the major point of the film. Please do not let negative comments like the ones from Sarah keep you from watching this terrific movie.".

Though far from perfect I found this movie to be exceptionally entertaining on all accounts. Sarah claims there's no story no characters no moral ... on and on. Well what she says is a complete crock there is a story it's about the two tiger brothers who are taken from their jungle home. The two main characters are not human and I guess the fact that they don't have dialogue presented quite an obstacle for Sarah because she doesn't seem to have followed their story and its moralethical significance. Since the movie plays out like a fairy tale realism here is not the point hence the broad human characterizations. Rather the most successful parts of the film allows us to view the world from the animals' eyes and in doing so we experience their feelings memories and needs. I found this to be entertaining and at times quite moving. The film makers ennoble these tiger characters with such power and respect I find it utterly mystifying that anyone could miss this as being the major point of the film. Please do not let negative comments like the ones from Sarah keep you from watching this terrific movie.";

	schema:headline " See some awesome film work which had to be some difficulties considering they are tigers";
	schema:reviewBody "WOW!!!! OK I will confess up front that I am prejudiced. I am a wildlife artist with a lifetime love of tigers and have even had the awesome opportunity to play with 3 10week old tiger brothers. I loved this movie not just for the obvious reasons of being a tiger loving artist that loves all animal films anyway. This movie was making a statement regarding how these beautiful creatures are being hunted to extinction!How sad to have to hunt down and kill an animal to prove your manhood or to use them for mistaken ancient beliefs where their bodyparts are used for medicine. Granted they aren't harmless but men continue to encroach on the wild areas all over the world without thought of the animals and ecosystems of the beauty they destroy. No I'm not an overzealous environmentalist belonging to Greenpeace or PETA though they have the right idea...just a little too far left for me. Still looking at the awesome beautiful world God has given us its sad to see animals hunted to extinction for no reason other than to show everyone that you can pull a trigger. Ooooooooooo big amount of talent for that.This movie besides its message of the dwindling numbers of tigers left in the wild and why they are endangered was an absolute joy. How some of these shots of the tigers as they grew were obtained I have no idea. But it was great in fact I love it the tigers got billing over the human actors!It's the story of 2 tiger cubs that are captured when a hunter kills their father and they become separated from their mother. They then become separated from each other one going to a hunter and eventually ending up in a circus run by people that seem to think animal cruelty is the only way to train an animal. The other winds up in a family with a loving little boy but eventually outgrows his welcome and ends up in a private zoo also being mistreated. The tigers meet again when for some sick idea of sport the 2 tigers are set against each other in a fight to the death. Then the brothers recognize each other. I won't ruin it for you. Just know that it does have a good ending! I was impressed that there is a tag at the end of the movie one that is quite true. In the early 1900's there were over 100000 tigers in the wild now there are less than 400200. Three species are already extinct. See the information from a websiteBengal Tiger  Panthera tigris tigris Siberian Amurian Tiger  Panthera tigris altaica Sumatran Tiger  Panthera tigris sumatrae IndoChinese Tiger  Panthera tigris corbetti South China Tiger  Panthera tigris amoyensis Javan Tiger  Panthera tigris sondaica  extinct since early 1980'sBali Tiger  Panthera tigris balica  extinct since the 1940'sCaspian Tiger  Panthera tigris virgata  extinct since the early 1970'sWatch the movie it will warm your heart make you smile and perhaps even shed a tear. If you would like to help save tigers in the wild or aid the ones that needlessly wind up in rescue organizations. Thank God for them! People seem to think it would be cool to have a tiger or other big cat for a pet then seem surprised that they grow into 500700 pound meat eaters! I own several house cats...these smaller guys have a whole lot in common with their 'big' brothers and I have the scars to prove it. Not that they are mean I just get in the way of their racetrack sometimes Still tigers are wild animals and not meant to be pets! If nothing else even if you have raised one they don't know their own strength...just ask Roy Horn of Siefried and Roy fame. I doubt that tiger meant any harm to Roy but the tiger sensed Roy was in danger and tried to carry him to safety the same way she would carry a cub...by the scruff of the neck. That being said...don't try to raise one but please try to help the ones in rescue shelters that desperately need the funds to care for these tigers that can't be released back into the wild. Or help the remaining few in the wild.".

The movie isn't an insult to our species it tells us and shows us how we have wronged nature in the past and promotes us to fix our past transgressions. By seeing the cute EXTREMELY cute tigers harassed on screen kids will definitely develop a passion for the conservation of wildlife and will develop a general humaneness towards other creatures. Although some scenes are disturbing and could scare children the movie does a good job of keeping them interested worried and warmed in the end. Even though Guy Pearce delivers another subpar performance adults are not the stars of the film. This movie will definitely play with your emotions and some may not be able to handle it but be assured the movie may leave you spent but it'll leave you blissful.

Honestly I've never expected anymore to see a movie of that class. What do I mean? These days there are so much new movies which is so wonderful because so many people now have the chance to express themselves and do a movie but not many of them know how to do it. There are people who do know and there are people which do have talent.I still remember when I saw The Bear. Not much but I do remember it really got me with it. Years ago there were really movies that had what to offer to the spectator. I still prefer more the commercial movies but do miss the real good cinema.And so few days back I was just watching around the rentavideo club when I saw the title. At first though it is yet another action movie until I saw the front cover. These days adventure movies are rare. The director's name immediately grabbed my attention and really threw me thinking. JeanJacques Annaud did another adventure? I did not read the text on the cover just was thinking to myself... These tigers really reminded me of The Bear... Was it a little nostalgia? Whatever it was it is wonderful. I do not remember myself enjoying so much for a long time. The movie is appropriate for most ages with good plot. Very slight mixture of this specific oldschool fragrance and modern computer graphic effects. It is so precisely mixed that at the beginning You will never realize is it real You are watching or computermade.In fact the movie I think I may say so is sort of a masterpiece but since I am not very competent of the technical details will not discuss them except mentioning just in brief.Wonderful graphics exotic views well mixed sound good music great story interesting point of views... remarkable.A thing to notice here is that it did not made me remember just of The Bear. Actually in the beginning I was thinking of Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes. Annaud spend big amount of time exploring the relationships of the tigers the tigers and the people the people the people and tigers. There are some very precisely dosed moments showing the two tigers in perspectives You would really love to explore. I just love the way he did it!You will never realize how these 109 minutes will pass around You so better stop reading this and go see it!Have a good time!".

Don't make me go off on chickens that live boxed existences till their heads are lopped off. And take house cats they are not like dogs. Man has never quite bred all their instinct from them. That's why they still hunt mice and birds. The difference with lions and tigers which are smarter than house cats is that we don't eat them. We can't ride them. They are no good for pulling machinery. They can only be used to do tricks or to watch. And as tame as they might become from being raised from cubs they cannot understand their own strength nor the fact that humans do not have thick enough skin to withstand their teeth the same as their kind. When Roy of Siegfried and Roy was mauled by his pet tiger everyone thought it had attacked him. Rather it was trying to protect him by carrying him off stage. It just could not understand that what would work for one of its cubs would kill a human being. The bottom line is that it is not about lions or tigers being left to their own in the wild it's all about real estate and the fact that we are not willing to allow them free reign as hunters over our planet. In the end the only lions or tigers that survive will be the ones kept in zoos. But the truth is that a lion or tiger that grows up in a human environment is no more or less happy or unhappy than a horse that is raised on a ranch or a farm. The life that it has grown up into is all that it knows. What is cruel on the other hand is taking an intelligent wild animal and forcing it to live in a cage.".

Don't make me go off on chickens that live boxed existences till their heads are lopped off. And take house cats they are not like dogs. Man has never quite bred all their instinct from them. That's why they still hunt mice and birds. The difference with lions and tigers which are smarter than house cats is that we don't eat them. We can't ride them. They are no good for pulling machinery. They can only be used to do tricks or to watch. And as tame as they might become from being raised from cubs they cannot understand their own strength nor the fact that humans do not have thick enough skin to withstand their teeth the same as their kind.

While the film does not show any direct shots of lives being taken it's very implicit and the movie does show carcasses and furs afterwards. I loved the story of the tiger family even though I'm not so sure how realistic this is but I honestly considered walking out of the theater due to the violence portrayed. That said I think this film is VERY difficult for animal lovers particularly those against hunting to watch. Also I think I would have appreciated a simple one line introduction regarding time and setting unless I missed this or it was cut out of the EU version. I only knew it was set in Cambodia after reading the plot summary and I assume it was circa 192030's based on the costumes. Some background would have given the film a little more context in my opinion Why were the French in Cambodia and what was the this road they were trying to build?".

It now had the taste of blood and was no longer safe to be in the company of humans.As both tigers became adults they had led a less than extraordinary life both with cruel owners and both ending up in a cockfighting environment where they were forced to fight one another.To me the only enjoyable part of this movie were the tigers themselves. The people only made it boring and wishing for the movie to either end or cut back to the tiger footage. I assume the tigers were trained to do certain things and then pieced together to form a cohesive story for them. Other footage seemed to be just film of the tigers acting naturally which was important for the movie.Two Brothers was a great children's movie.

	schema:headline " Visually Attractive and An Above Average Family Film As Well";
	schema:reviewBody "Two Brothers is a nice family film to watch but it becomes to cheesy to take by the end. Two brother tiger cubs are separated at an early age when their mother is killed by a hunter Guy Pearce. The bolder one is sold to a circus where his spirit is broken while the gentler one fights for his survival becoming wilder and more fierce. When they meet again as adults they are pitted against each other as enemies. The plot is something different then the average kids film yet this film will probably be more liked by adults. The story may bore kids too much as its not action packed nor is it an animated film. Granted there were some boring spots but those were few and far in between. The kids may be turned off by the fact that a tiger gets shot in this film. Only one actually dies from a gunshot but another one is hit in the ear. The baby tigers are very cute and are fun to watch. The only human actor worth mentioning is Guy Pearce. He is overshadowed by the tigers but still does a good job. JeanJacques Annaud directs and he does a pretty good job. Two Brothers has amazing cinematography probably some of the best I have seen all year. There's not a whole lot of dialog so kids may not like that. While it's a beautiful film to watch sometimes I felt like I was watching the discovery channel or something. The running time of 108 minutes could have been cut down as not all was needed. I was enjoying the film until the end then it became too cheesy to like. The brothers managed to met up with each other and they both manage to escape from the circus. When they successfully escaped they met up with their mom again and became one happy family. I thought this was a little too much but it's a kids film so they wanted a happy ending. I didn't like it though as it could have been a different type of family film if it had ended a little differently. In the end this is a nice film to look at and its slightly above average as well. Rating 710 better then the most recent family film.".

Would she not have found a new mate and more cubs by then??The direction and cinematography involving the massive felines was beautiful they were so convincing they almost looked as though they were talking e.g. when Sangha dragged on the tigernet and his Mom cuffed him for making a ruckus or when Kumar encouraged Sangha to leap over the wall of fire...So if you do take kids to this either before after or both... explain the true story of taming wild animals to keep as pets!".

He tried to be what he was not and that is why he failed to kill the 2 bros' mother!While it was noble for the two brothers to recognise each other after all that time  which for a semiferal creature is a while indeed  I doubt that that really would be the case in reality more's the pity!The end was rather sweet but fanciful again  would Mom know them after all this time? Would she not have found a new mate and more cubs by then??The direction and cinematography involving the massive felines was beautiful they were so convincing they almost looked as though they were talking e.g. when Sangha dragged on the tigernet and his Mom cuffed him for making a ruckus or when Kumar encouraged Sangha to leap over the wall of fire...So if you do take kids to this either before after or both... explain the true story of taming wild animals to keep as pets!";

It shows mans' cruelty to animals either for sport or for no good reason at all. It has good camera work fantastic scenery. And they did a real nice job of minimizing the animal violence that we see.Unfortunately it does not have an interesting story. Yes it is predictable with absolutely no surprises along the way. There are the requisite bad guys some who of course become good guys somewhere along the way. The mandatory precocious child is on hand as well as the fumbling incompetent government official. You understand what all this is building up to right? Not much. None of the characters are particularly interesting. Even Guy Pearce who is usually very good isn't given enough to do with his role.This is a movie that could have and should have been much better than it was. It was just not that interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I instinctively recoil at any attempt by filmmakers to convert majestic animals into little more than furry fourlegged human beings I had hoped that director JeanJacques Annaud would be able to avoid that pitfall in Two Brothers a tale of two tiger cubs who become separated for a year only to be reunited when they are each fully grown. Instead Annaud goes for broke in making these two magnificent creatures as human as is humanly possible rendering them far less interesting in the process.Upon their separation one of the little ones gets carted off to a local circus where he is mistreated by his sadistic handlers while the other is adopted as a pet by a young boy the son of a local administrator. Then once the tiger gets to be too big and too difficult to handle he is sent to be part of a menagerie belonging to a spoiled prince who wants to turn him into a fearsome fighting beast. Guy Pearce plays a pragmatic but tenderhearted hunterblack marketeer whose life path intersects with those of the cubs throughout the course of the story and whose character transformation is one of the least believable aspects of a film that is not all that rooted in credibility to begin with.Admittedly Annaud does an impressive job getting up close and personal with the tigers and he certainly has an amazing ability to get these wild beasts to do what he wants them to do on camera. Unfortunately just about everything he has them do smacks of anthropomorphic phoniness essentially depriving them of their true nature as creatures of instinct and not calculation. As this is a familyoriented film we get none of that National Geographic unpleasantness of the tigers tracking down and devouring their helpless prey. In fact we wonder just what these animals eat in the course of a day to keep themselves so fit and healthy. The director also lays it on a bit thick with all his soulful closeups of the tigers particularly when they are cubs looking just too sadeyed and adorable for words. In addition Annaud simply can't resist throwing in numerous scenes of lowbrow slapstick to show just what funloving roustabouts these dear little tigers are.The film also suffers from a serious technical problem. I'm not sure what kind of camera Annaud used to film his scenes but the picture tends to become very blurry every time either the camera moves or a figure moves in the frame. Given the number of shots of tigers racing across the screen this visual imperfection becomes a serious detriment indeed.I guess that if one views Two Brothers as a fantasy film of sorts it makes the whole enterprise somehow easier to swallow. For me I think I'll stick to National Geographic and the Discovery Channel and leave the animal fantasy stuff to Disney.".

They are parted and brought up very differently one having a life of hardships and cruelty at the hands of circus people while the other is pampered at the hands of a rich family serving as an exotic pet.Two Brothers is a movie that is fully wholesome and watchable for the entire family kids and adults alike. It is the type of movie that has a bit of something for just about everybody. There is action there is sadness there is joy there is excitement there are majestic animals there are friendships between different species.I was especially impressed with how they had trained the tigers because they were performing quite well.This was a nice surprise of a movie that actually proved worth sitting down to watch.

It is a great look at two likeable outlaws full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.Butch Cassidy Paul Newman and The Sundance Kid Robert Redford are two bank robbers chased by the law.  The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do.  The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them.  There is really no connection all the way through for the most part.The story isn't about the plot however.  It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It is a close look at two criminals the talented Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy the one who does all the thinking.  The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest westerns ever made although much of the movie takes place in South America.  It is a great look at two likeable outlaws full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.Butch Cassidy Paul Newman and The Sundance Kid Robert Redford are two bank robbers chased by the law.  The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do.  The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them.  There is really no connection all the way through for the most part.The story isn't about the plot however.  It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It is a close look at two criminals the talented Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy the one who does all the thinking.  The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film.  Watching the two interact with a superb script full of great dialogue is what makes this movie so exciting.See this movie if you are a fan of westerns or just a fan of good movies.

Few if any were better than him.One remembers this western for several things the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there Paul Newman riding a bicycle to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head the beautiful Katharine Ross the chemistry of Newman and Robert Redford as a twoman team on and on. Those three lead actors with the repartee between them and the likability of each make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture. It's just solid entertainment and another example of good filmmaking that doesn't need a lot of Rrated material to make it successful. Photographywise the western scenery was great there were some wonderful closeup shots and I really liked the tinted oldtime footage inserted in here. So when you combine all the elements it's no surprise this film won so many awards and endures so well.".

They rob trains and take big scores later the Pacific railroad gets together the best tracker and lawmen in the entire Western United States to track and kill Butch and Sundance. They must manage to evade their elite counterparts the movie is 100 percent entertainment especially during the chases. The movie is based on true events and is spectacular.This movie won Best Score Best Song Raindrops which was very good untraditional music in a western it fit good in this movie Best Cinematography shot by Conrad L. Hall who also did Road To Perdition arguably the best cinematography done to this very day and Adapated Screenplay all for the right reasons. George Roy Hill Paul Newman and Robert Redford all went on to create The Sting in 1973 which is possibly one of the best movies ever made. I praise this movie 1010".

Watching this movie my only wish is that Redford and Newman would have done more movies together.The writing was great and creative. I have never witnessed a movie that was so serious and yet so funny. The writing totally propelled this movie forward. The fact that Butch and Sundance went to Bolivia trying to outrun the law was hilarious. This has got to be some of the best writing ever.The directing by George Roy Hill was as well amazing displaying the chase scenes and just sitting back and letting the writing and directing take over. But most of all he let Robert Redford and Paul Newman do their thing. You could see that they were both feeding off each other and George Roy Hill never seemed to interrupt their chemistry.

However with a smart story and great direction by George Roy Hill Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the smashhit of 1969 as it achieved box office dominance and won more Oscars four than any other film that year. It did not win the Best Picture or Best Director Oscars as Midnight Cowboy and its director John Schlesinger took home those honors but it has stood the test of time and is right up there with the other imperative films of that important year Midnight Cowboy Easy Rider and The Wild Bunch. The two titled characters are two shrewd outlaws who love to rob trains and banks. However the law has about had it with the outlaws and the two decide that Bolivia is the place they need to be. Also along for the ride is schoolteacher Katharine Ross who obviously has feelings for both men. They both want to go straight in Bolivia but temptation is too big for them and in the end tragedy will occur for the titled characters. Of course this film is based on real people but so little is known about them that the filmmakers were able to take many liberties with the tale. The filmmakers went for comedy and action but it is the drama and the likable characters that make Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid one of the best films produced in the 1960s. 5 stars out of 5.".

First it holds up well for a movie so redolent of a particular time the 1960s of course not the 1890s. Second whether the filmmakers fully intended it this way or not it's really a very good film about a topic Westerns don't tackle often arrested adolescence.Most great Westerns  My Darling Clementine'' Rio Bravo'' The Wild Bunch'' Unforgiven''  are about adults. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' is about two guys who physically are pushing 40 but whose mental age is stuck somewhere around 16. They may be charming but their whole lives revolve around their narcissistic palship. For them being outlaws doesn't seem to be about expressing antisocial impulses or even getting money they haven't earned but merely about hanging out with each other. Their talk with each other is mainly brittle ritualized patter and stock jokes mixed with Butch's pipe dreams. They can't talk about anything serious even at the end when they must realize  at some level  that they're about to die. Screenwriter William Goldman emphasizes the oddly callow adolescent tone of their relationship by repeatedly having them express surprise when they stumble over some bit of biography  their real names or the fact that Sundance is from New Jersey  that you'd think real friends would have known about decades ago.The movie's whole point is that Butch and Sundance can't develop any type of dramatic arc. Harshly changing times demand they change with the times or die  and they can't change and ultimately choose by default to die. They do get a huge lucky break when they get away from the Superposse  but all they can think to do with it is change not what they're doing but merely where they're doing it. They can't even change enough to keep Etta Place with them even though both Butch and Sundance really do love her in their way. Etta in contrast to Butch and Sundance is harshly realistic about her life and her limits  she knows she isn't strong enough to die with them or to see them die. Butch and Sundance as far as we can see don't care about much outside themselves and Etta. This is why the movie's ending  that famous freeze frame  is so perfect. Butch and Sundance are secure together in their niche in history. They don't have to worry about changing times or the baffling world outside themselves any longer. They've won out over time and change  the only way anybody ever can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It is my favorite film of all time and the biggest reason for that is because of its script by William Goldman.  It's very rare in film that a script has perfect lines in it from beginning to end but this film is an example of what can be achieved by Hollywood screenwriters. It was William Goldman's script of this movie that sparked my passion for the American cinema.  Though most Westerns of the cinema past have serious and gritty tones to them this film has just the right mix of comedy wit and adventure.  The greatest team in Hollywood history arguably is the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford.  The presence by these two Hollywood legends has help cement this film as one of the greatest movies ever made  according to organizations like the American Film Institute.  The direction by George Roy Hill is first rate and much credit also has to be given to cinematographer Conrad Hall who did a great job giving this film the superior look of the Old West.    Katherine Ross adds to this film in the role as the beautiful Etta Place as does the score which makes us feel good about going to the movies.  This was the film that for the first time got audiences to root for the bad guys.  This film should be shown in every film school to show film students how to make a theatrical film.  I will always love this movie and indeed this movie is something special.  It is also special to me because the REAL Sundance Kid was born in my hometown of Phoenixville Pennsylvania.".

In reading the reviews submitted about this movie it makes me happy to see that most of the people agree with my opinion. How could you not like these characters along with Etta those guys following them and eventually Strother who will always be remembered for his what we have here is a failure to communicate in Cool Hand Luke Martin? Not to mention the scenes where Etta enters the picture when Butch has to fight Logan when they have to jump in the water and of course the ending sequence of events. I won't say they don't make them like they used to but this one is a keeper.

	schema:reviewBody "Usually if you find that you don't like a film which has been deemed a classic you can at least see what it may be that leads people to think so highly of the film. That is not the case with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I don't get it. I'm not seeing what so many others apparently are seeing. I see an incredibly overrated film that is not even remotely worthy of the near mythical status it has attained. Whatever it is that supposedly makes this film a classic is well and truly lost on me.The biggest problem with the film is that nobody involved apparently could decide what kind of film it was they were making. Was it a serious Western or a comedy Western? The film ends up stuck in some sort of netherworld in between. It's much too jokey to take very seriously but not nearly funny enough to be labeled a comedy. The film tries to be multiple things and ends up not being much of anything at all. It's a film that never really convinces things always seem a bit off. Just the very concept that the good guys the guys we're meant to sympathize with and root for are actually the bad guys was always going to be a little jarring. Hooray for the train robbers! It could have worked but it really doesn't. No fault of the actors as Paul Newman and Robert Redford Newman especially make the characters of Butch and Sundance respectively easy to like. And Sundance's girl played by Katharine Ross certainly has her charms as well. But even if you end up liking these characters it's still hard to like the movie.You would think it would be hard to make a boring movie based on the exploits of notorious bank and train robbers. But that's pretty much what we have here. This film moves at a snail's pace moments of excitement are few and far between. The interminable chase sequence dropped into the middle of the film surely doesn't help. If I had to watch Butch peer into the distance and say Who are those guys? one more time I'd scream. Get on with it already. Honestly for much of its running time this movie has you desperately trying to stifle yawns. And when the movie tries to have a little fun it generally doesn't work. So many jokes which fall flat. And that famous yet exceedingly dopey bicycle sequence. Hard to take the movie seriously after that. Good song though. I just have no idea what in the world it's doing in this movie. One thing you can say for the movie is that it is beautifully photographed. Cinematographer Conrad Hall's Oscar was well earned. And Newman and Redford both of course terrific actors do have very good chemistry and Ross fits in well also. The interactions among the three lead performers provide some good moments. But there are not nearly enough of those moments to salvage the film. It's dull and drawn out it's neither serious enough to work as a real Western or funny enough to get by on comedic value. The film just doesn't work. But it's a classic. I don't get it.".

It is simply a bad movie that does not hold up well. What makes it bad? The one attribute I would give this movie is boring. Really boring. The scenes just dragged on and on and it got so that I just wanted it to end. Like the bicycleRaindropskeepfallin'onmyhead scene. What was Hill thinking? If he wanted to establish a relationship between Newman and Ross the length of that scene could have been cut by about two thirds. Likewise later on when the camera was panning across sepia photographs of the three main characters to illustrate them making their way down to Bolivia. Again way too long. We already got the point but still the sequence dragged on interminably. I actually hit the FF button on my DVD remote at one point and even at 2X I was surprised how long it took to get to the end of that sequence.And the chemistry between Redford and Newman was almost lifeless like a glass of soda left out overnight. I don't why but all the lines like who ARE those guys? I remember as being funny just fell mostly flat. Also a good actress can light up the screen but Katherine Ross was about as incandescent as an sick firefly. True she was not given much to do in this film but what she did get she did poorly reciting her lines mostly in a dull monotone. It's as if she was anticipating her later role in The Stepford Wives which incidentally was a much better movie than this one.So I don't know why everybody thinks this movie is so wonderful I did not find it so and I guess I will have to be in the minority.".

I watched this movie for the first timeyes really!! recently and it left me disappointed and underwhelmed. The partnership between Paul Newman and Robert Redford works very well and you could tell that the actor's liked each other. The cinematography is good too but that is about all I liked.It is boring with not a lot happening a lot of the time. The music doesn't fit the western feel of the movie at all and even 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' makes no sense at all given the fact that the whole of the song takes place during glorious sunshine! It is a buddy movie I get that but the wisecracking wore a bit thin and even the acting was very hit and miss. I just couldn't engage with the story at all even though the two leads were likeable enough.This is a movie of it's time and seemed very dated to me.

	onyx:emotionText "Well here goes as I know the vast majority of people won't agree with this review. I watched this movie for the first timeyes really!! recently and it left me disappointed and underwhelmed. The partnership between Paul Newman and Robert Redford works very well and you could tell that the actor's liked each other. The cinematography is good too but that is about all I liked.It is boring with not a lot happening a lot of the time. The music doesn't fit the western feel of the movie at all and even 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' makes no sense at all given the fact that the whole of the song takes place during glorious sunshine! It is a buddy movie I get that but the wisecracking wore a bit thin and even the acting was very hit and miss. I just couldn't engage with the story at all even though the two leads were likeable enough.This is a movie of it's time and seemed very dated to me. I really like the western genre but this is nowhere near my favourites. I did look forward to watching it but was left wondering why so many people love it.";

	schema:headline " The Last of the Old Western Gangs Also Bonus Information about the Real Wild Bunch and the Pursuing Detective";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me state right now that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the greatest westerns of all time. It even deserves its place in the top 100 of America's best movies 73. This writer even rated the film nine stars. It deserves all of them. On the other hand its heroes are really antiheroes. Yes they are the criminals but because they are goodlooking and likable and charming and humorous we root for them. But this is not the message of the traditional westerns that were about the noble guys who won in the end played by William S. Hart Tom Mix Gene Autry John Wayne etc. and the dastardly dudes who got what they deserved real folks like Bill Longley Black Jack Ketchum John Wesley Hardin Ike Clanton etc.. These bad guys were so unabashedly immoral that people booed them in movie theaters. But for several years before 1969 the framework of the original American Western was transforming. Perhaps movie audiences became bored with the good guys winning. Then there were the attitudes of the counterculture. So characters of ambiguous morality began to become central if they still lost at film's end they at least got sympathy. Our movie is about the Wild Bunch last of the outlaw gangs of the old American West. Its specialty was robbing banks and trains on horseback. But the frontier had closed in 1890 and even the remaining wild western pockets were becoming less of a haven. Not only was the telegraph expanding but the telephone and automobile were already invented. Civilization and technology were making the old time gunslingers obsolete. The Pinkerton detectives and the Union Pacific Railroad were becoming more resourceful. There were less and less places of refuge although Butch Cassidy's band did well enough at HoleintheWall pass north of Casper in Wyoming.The feature is finely crafted although it probably gathers more from the legend rather than from historical fact. There are many wonderful things to enjoy The gorgeous cinematography of Conrad Hall filmed in USAMexico and fine Western settings the music by Burt Bacharach the script by William Goldman the direction of George Roy Hill. The film gathered four Academy awards Cinematography score song Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head and original screenplay. There are quite a few memorable scenes Opening Thomas Edison Company silent movie that features The HoleintheWall Gang fancy gunwork by the Sundance Kid in the sepiatoned vignette Butch and Logan in the knife fight during the gang rebellion the blownup express car with flying dollar bills continuous posse chases the NewmanRoss bicycle scene an angry bull the cliff jump on horseback the nearbotched bank robbery in Bolivia where the two men clumsily attempt to speak Spanish the ending freeze frame shootout. Although folks get shot in this film we are spared the endless gore that characterized some filmmakers like Sam Peckinpah.The Chemistry between Paul Newman already a big star and upcoming Robert Redford is masterful. Butch Cassidy Paul Newman is the talker the planner the brains of the outfit the Sundance Kid Robert Redford is silent and brooding but also quick with a gun. Wittily the two leads play off against one another in a sardonic manner. A third important lead the lovely Katherine Ross Etta Place plays a delightful foil between the two men. By the way two surviving photographs confirm that the real Etta Ethel Place was one of the most attractive females of the Old West. Some of the real gang members are also characters Harvey Logan Ted Cassidy FlatNose Curry Charles Dierkop and News Carver Timothy Scott. Bonus Information Butch Cassidy ne Robert Leroy Parker born in 1866 called his gang The Wild Bunch not TheHoleintheWall Gang. As befitting the grandson of a Mormon bishop he was affable and eschewed excessive gunplay. I have never killed a man he claimed. Butch Cassidy really did blow up a United Pacific railroad express car to smithereens near Wilcox Wyoming on 2 June 1899. Employee E.C. Woodcock was staggered but survived. Pinkerton agent Charles Angelo Siringo was already hot on the trail. Siringo's name was not used in the movie. Instead we hear Lord Baltimore and Joe Lefors and the United Pacific posse. But it was Charlie Siringo Siringo knew Lefors who trailed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ne Harry Alonzo Longabaugh for 25000 miles as he wrote in one of his books. Because of an error by another Siringo just missed capturing Butch and Sundance. By the way Siringo tracked desperadoes from Alaska to Mexico. In 1900 an attempt at amnesty between Butch and Utah Governor Wells failed. Nevertheless the Old West was dying and Butch Sundance and Etta Place after visiting New York City 1901 relocated to South America in Argentina. Sundance may have married Etta in December 1900. More than once Sundance and Etta returned to the USA apparently they attended the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. Pinkerton agent Frank Di Maio who took over from Charlie Siringo in Argentina had discovered the exact location of Sundance and Etta but either a tip or the rainy season ruined his chances of capture. Etta Place returned to the USA for good in 19061907 her subsequent history is largely unknown. Butch and Sundance met their eventual demise at San Vincente Bolivia in November 1908 or at Montevideo Uruguay in 1912. Flat Nose Curry News Carver and Harvey Logan were already dead. Curry was shot to death by a sheriff in 1900 Carver was killed by lawmen in 1901. To escape capture in 1904 after he had escaped from jail Logan shot himself. Not mentioned in the movie was William Ellsworth Elzy Lay last of the Wild Bunch. Although he was captured tried and sent to prison in 1899 he did a very good deed in jail. So he was pardoned by New Mexico Governor Otero in 1906. Thereafter Lay went straight for the rest of his life he died in 1934.".

There's so much clever banter throughout between the two stars it borders on comedy so much we become oblivious to the scores of people we see killed during the story's unfolding.

	schema:reviewBody "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman. It stars Paul Newman Robert Redford Katharine Ross and Strother Martin. A PanavisionDe Luxe production with music by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Conrad Hall.Not exactly a hit with the critics of the time Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had no such problems at the box office or with longevity of popularity. It is still today one of the few Western films that none Western fans enjoy immensely. Much of this can be attributed to the wonderful buddy buddy chemistry between Newman and Redford and of course the general blending of ragamuffin drama with cheeky chappy comedy.The casting as finished was not exactly set in stone Newman was always in but was originally going to play the part of Sundance. McQueen was pencilled in for Cassidy as was Lemmon while Beatty was mooted as well but eventually a chance was taken on Redford and Newman switched to the role of Cassidy. On such things can a movie be made or broken as it turned out it was the ace in the pack as legendary characters were brought joyously to life.Only based on the basic real life facts of the HoleintheWall gang led by Butch Cassidy the film follows the simple formula of two lovable rogue entrepreneurs being chased by a Pinkerton posse whilst robbing their way to a new life in Bolivia. A gorgeous sepia opening sets the standard for the visual treats to follow with over a quarter of the film being an extended chase sequence through the landscapes. As Hill and Goldman Academy Award Best StoryScreenplay provide the tension in the sequences Conrad Hall Academy Award Best Cinematography brings clarity of beauty and dust strewn sweat.The music by Burt Bacharach Academy Award Best Music has not always gone down well with critics and fans alike especially the pivotal Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head song by country singer B.J. Thomas. But in the context of the scenes and the changing of the West even the Western movie in fact the music works. Yes Raindrops is a touch corny in essence but the accompanying sequences as the bicycle replaces the horse in major metaphor  and the warmth of the Etta Place Ross a little bland and Cassidy friendship is born out  it's hardly a film killer. In fact it's a daring move by the makers.Hugely influential on Westerns that would follow and spawning further tales of the exploits of Butch and Sundance Hill's movie has earned its much loved reputation. With the constant byplay between Redford and Newman always engaging who are those guys? a number of iconic scenes firmly ensconced in movie folklore and technical smarts to cherish Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid never takes its foot of the pedal or its grip on your heart. Because as the freeze frame sepia ending passes muster as a blaze of glory it's indeed true Hill Hall Goldman Newman and Redford have made a true Western classic. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is in my all time top ten movies and has been for quite awhile. At the same time I can't say that it's my favorite Western as the film almost transcends the genre to become the quintessential buddy movie. In their respective roles as Butch and The Kid Paul Newman and Robert Redford develop a magnetism and charisma that give the movie it's tremendous appeal.I recall the first time I saw this movie upon it's release in 1969 and how original many of the scenes and concepts played out from Butch's put down of Harvey Logan's Ted Cassidy challenge at Hole in the Wall Sundance's gunpoint strip by Etta Katharine Ross and the humorous exchanges between the bandits and E.L. Harriman's trusted train guard Woodcock George Furth. Life on the run never seemed as glamorous as Butch and the Kid attempting to outwit those guys. Even the final scene with the Mexican troops encircling the yanquis bandidos location I kept wondering how they were going to get out of this one.The film also cleverly introduces one of the year's top hit tunes with Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head though if you want to be critical it wasn't raining during the segment in which it runs which on reflection doesn't seem to make sense. But the upbeat tempo of the tune does support the light hearted action on screen and just works.Some veteran character actors perform admirably here as well. Of particular note is Jeff Corey as Sheriff Ray who carefully orchestrates his own bondage by the boys lest he be considered in cahoots with them and Strother Martin as the Bolivian paymaster who hires Butch and Sundance as the proverbial foxes in the hen house to guard the company payroll. The scene with the Mexican bandits was reminiscent of an earlier era's treatment in Treasure of the Sierra Madre though with dire consequences for the banditos this time around.At just under two hours the film seems to fly by a testament to intriguing and involved story telling. Even when you know it's over for Butch and Sundance you're hoping for one more exchange before lights out such is the camaraderie one feels for the film's protagonists. This is a movie I return to at least once yearly for a good old dose of action and humor and it still delivers time after time.".

Paul Newman and Robert Redford shine as the title characters  I could not take my eyes off of them on the screen. The supporting cast plays off them wonderfully and the screenplay full of wit and charisma is the best I've ever seen. There are some wonderful filming sequences in this movie used innovatively to compliment the scenes and plot. The score is memorable  not just sweeping soundtrack stuck into the frames of a western it is really music beautiful and creative in of itself.

To all intents and purposes it's a comedy regardless of the period it is set in.  The plot does little but provide some funny chases and ample oppourtunity for the two stars to play off each other to great effect.Ross is good but really this is only Newman and Redford's film and they play it well.  Both have a great rapport with the other and it adds to the bickering etc.  Their lines are all great and the film lives and dies with them.  It has slow portions and bits that don't really work too well but as long as Newman and Redford are on screen then fun is never too far away.Overall this is not a great western but as a classic buddy comedy it's bang on.

	schema:reviewBody "Vamos a Matar Companeros! is an authentic made in Italy Spaghetti Western film classic and is a must see movie for anyone who wants to discover the very best of the Spaghetti Western film genre. This WesternComedy film was directed by Sergio Corbucci the number 2 Italian director of all time for Spaghetti Westerns after of course Sergio Leone for the entire Spaghetti Western genre which is saying a lot because there were hundreds of films in that genre alone! This film is just plain fun and entertaining to watch! All the actors are charismatic comical and professional. The all star cast in the film are Jack Palance Franco Nero and Thomas Milian. The story is basically about the Mexican Revolution of 1910 where a mercenary Nero and rebels lead by rebel leader Milian must rescue a idealist professor to lead the revolution who is held hostage in Texas. This film was made during the height of student protests to the Vietnam War in the late 1960's and early 1970's which may explain the political theme. There are many good scenes too many to list here but the best scenes and most surreal in my opinion are the ones with the pet falcon and the strange one woodenhanded and marijuana smoking villain Palance. The cinematography is beautifully filmed by cinematographer Alejandro Ulloa who also filmed other excellent Spaghetti Westerns. The music in the film is by the maestro of Spaghetti Western music and film music in general Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Companeros includes a theme song and the beautiful classic acoustic and twangy electric guitar riffs invented by Morricone.".

It's a true masterpiece and arguably Corbucci's finest.Sergio Leone will always be the name everyone associates with spaghetti westerns but Sergio Corbucci's contribution to the genre deserves great recognition. People usually always mention Django and The Great Silence when talking about Corbucci's westerns but Companeros is perhaps his best work.Companeros is a much lighter film than the aforementioned. Like most Corbucci westerns there is a political undertone to the film and the plot revolves around the Mexican revolution similar to A Professional Gun which Corbucci directed 2 years earlier. Che Guevara lookalike Thomas Milian is superb as the comical revolutionary Vasco and Corbucci regular Franco Nero is excellent as his ultracool Swedish mercenary partner. Add to the mix a marijuanasmoking psychopath played by Jack Palance and you have one explosive concoction of a western. Pulling all this together is another masterful score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. I guarantee you will still be singing the theme tune a week later!I rate this as one of the best Westerns of all time. It's a really fun film and an absolute must for fans of the Spaghetti genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a dream cast of Franco Nero as Swedish mercenary Yod Peterson aka penguin and Tomas Milian Mexican rebel Vasco a soundtrack by Ennio Morricone and Sergio Corbucci at the Directors helm this film was always likely to deliver. And it delivers 100.The story centres around the town of San Bernardino and a fight for power between General Mongo Bodalo and Professor Xantos Fernando Rey. Xantos a pacifist with a young and dedicated following has been imprisoned at Fort Yuma by the Americans. His absence has left the town and its safe at the mercy of Mongo. However without the combination for the lock he is unable to access the wealth of the town.Mongo enlists the help of Peterson to rescue Xantos for both the combination code and probable execution. Vascos is sent to accompany him having already suffered much humiliation as a result of an earlier confrontation with the Swede. This makes for a very uneasy relationship.A brief fracas with Xantos' followers at a holdup on a train enables Peterson to escape from Vacos' close watch. However he is soon relying on his companion to rescue him after he is captured by a former partner John Jack Palance  who he had previously betrayed some years ago to save his own skin. This betrayal had resulted in John being nailed to a tree and relying on his faithful pet falcon Marsha to rescue him by biting off his hand. Not surprisingly John holds a grudge as well as a wooden hand!.On escaping John's grasp the two make an assault on Fort Yuma in an attempt to free Xantos from the Americans. As the adventure really heats up they're paths will soon cross with the American army General Mongo Xantos' followers and of course John and Marsha.The first third of the film is perhaps a little slow and episodic but does successfully reveal the characters of Peterson and Vasco to the viewer with fantastic character play by Nero and Milian respectively. Once the background is established the film soon explodes into action with a series of exciting and highly effective chases and battle sequences. Corbucci at his best.Probably the strongest element of this movie however is its subtle use of humour. Much of this is provided by the chemistry between the two leading roles but the laughs really reach a crescendo with Peterson and Vasco's final liaison with Jack's falcon Marsha. Just one great scene in a film full of them.It is no doubt a crime to have got so far into my review without mentioning Jack Palance's performance in much detail because his performance as the unhinged marijuana smoking John is scene stealing. Quite possibly one of the greatest villains of all the Spaghetti Westerns I have seen.Music is provided by Morricone and as always the score is a perfect accompaniment to the action  both memorable and rousing. In fact it always amazes me how the man could be so consistent! In summary this is a must view film from the ever reliable Corbucci. And my mouth waters at the prospect of watching his other Mexican revolutionary movies 'A Professional Gun' and 'What Am I Doing in the Middle of a Revolution'..... very shortly hopefully!".

May he live to compose forever... and always assisted by the great Bruno Nicolai an accomplished composer in his own right.Franco Nero is wonderful as always as The Swede Jack Palance is charismaplus as John Tomas Milian is roughedged and likable despite his total lack of morals as El Vasco. Too many great thespian turns to single out but you get the point.Terrific location work stupendously good shootouts stunts explosions poetic action... all lathered in baked painfully evocative cinematography.And that final image to red freeze frame...Bella!

Meanwhile the arms trader Yolaf Swedish Peterson Franco Nero arrives in the village to deal with Mongo however the money to buy the weapons is locked in a bank safe.

The twosome is chased by the followers of Xantos led by the beautiful Lola Iris Berben that want to convince the duo to join the revolution and by the mercenary John Jack Palance that lost one of his hands in a betrayal of Yolaf to save his life and uses his smart hawk Marsha to get Xantos to deal with Mongo.Vamos a Matar Compaeros is a funny spaghettiwestern of Sergio Corbutti that has a story very similar to Sergio Leone's Duck You Sucker of 1971 and plays with Blood for a Silver Dollar. Franco Nero Tomas Milian and Jack Palance are hilarious and I laughed a lot with the scene when Marsha becomes a toasted barbecue. The music of Ennio Morricone is excellent as usual.

I can still remember the first time I saw it as a child in a summer time cinema in my town and not only it left a mark in my subconsciousness about the kind of films I was watching at that time but the music never left my memory and easily comes back without me ask for it. And I don't mind at all. But enough about me!!! Like so many other Italian western films it actually is... a political film. Yes! And a very obvious one. The Mexican revolution as pictured here has little in common with the real stuff. Also the basis of the Mexican food is corn! But that's not important. What matters is the hope that so many Europeans had in that time for some kind of revolution here also. So Mexico is just an excuse.The movie plays with the sentiments of the viewer who slowly finds that he wants to be a part of it even if he is a money loving European like Yolaf Peterson. In the incredible end when everything about this wonderful crazy song you hear all the time makes sense you are so captivated that you would never forgive Yolaf for making any other choice than the one that you also would have made given the chance. When can I see this film again?".

Actually I might still put those two films ahead of this one. Hell there was an explosion of excitement ringing from this this highly competent and vivid outing. The cheeky style dripping from the fascinating material was well placed and delivered. Even from the action the grand state of it feels like something out of a comic strip and how can't you love the flatout bloodthirsty machine gun activity towards the finale. What a sensational climax it builds up to! The trio of Franco Nero Tomas Milian and Jack Palance were nothing but marvellous and the chemistry between the former two was a blast. But Palance's sophisticatedly leering menace was the real drawcard. Fernando Rey makes for a solid turn too. Ennio Morricone plucks in with a gleefully passionate and killer music score which is one of his best and the rugged location was captured by Alejandro Ulloa's freeflowing and expressive cinematography that had plenty of poignant scope and detail. Corbucci stews up some inventive directorial flushes amongst the grit chaos and exuberance. The atmospheric setting hit's the spot and sets up many potboiler and comedic scenes. It can lull at times and might feel somewhat overlong.The hardboiled story sticks to something rather stable and less than flashy but can be thoughtful in its wide arrange of antics and tactics. It's gusty political subtext on the treatment of the poor and use of violence to get your point across can get a bit wishywashy and preachy however it definitely makes up for it in other areas like the chewy script with its constant wit and surprises.Overthetop entertainment equals a totally baroque and enjoyable Corbucci spaghetti western.".

It is a little of a slowstarter and a touch episodic at first and it's less than original but when the rest of the film is so much fun and so well put together they don't seem to matter.Companeros is a brilliantly made film with gorgeously evocative scenery and costumes and stylish cinematography that give off a dreamlike quality and harsh realism. Sergio Corbucci's direction as to be expected is exemplary it's technically faultless while never getting in the way of the storytelling. Ennio Morricone's music score will not disappoint any fans of his and is one of the film's best assets it's not quite one of his alltime greats but it's haunting and stirring and the theme song is one of the catchiest theme songs for any film. Like almost all his work it really gives the film soul. Companeros is smartly scripted filled with subtle witty humour it has blistering action especially one of the most suspenseful and entertaining shootout scenes I've ever seen for a film and the story is exciting tense and funfilled with a truly sensational and quite emotional ending.The cast is a talented one and Companeros in no way wastes the actors. Particularly good is Jack Palance here he has one of his most loathsome characters and Palance's performance is devilishly enjoyable clearly looking like he was having a ball. While he is a scenestealer Franco Nero and Tomas Milian do wonderfully in the lead roles too in performances filled with charisma and likability and work like dynamite together in a film where their chemistry ties it together. Overall a great film and a huge lot of fun to watch. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1970 the initial gold rush of the spaghetti western was over and directors were seeking new ways to push the genre forward. Trinita opted for a satirical approach while Sabata brought James Bond sensibilities to the classic antihero. Others chose to use the Mexican revolution as the backdrop for the escapades of their heroes. That is the case for Sergio Corbucci's Companeros.It is essentially a remake or a reimagining of Corbucci's The Mercenary using much of the same cast and swapping Tony Musante as the Mexican revolutionary for the great Thomas Milian. Franco Nero plays once again the European this time a Swede and Jack Palance returns to the fold as the ruthless if not semiinsane baddie. All of them hit all the right notes and Nero and Milian's interactions are a joy to behold. The story opens with a duel between the two in a dusty Mexican village and the whole movie is a flashback that leads us to the events at the start of the movie again as in The Mercenary two years earlier. Nero and Milian are employed by corrupt Mexican General Mongo to travel to the US and free the Mexican professor Xantos that is held captive in Fort Yuma. Xantos is the leader of another small group of student revolutionaries but General Mongo wants him for more practical reasons. Xantos knows the code to a safe that is impossible to open and with the gold General Mongo hopes to finance the revolution against Porfirio Diaz. Or does he? Each one has his own personal agenda of course. As they make their way back to Mexico a semiinsane Jack Palance with a wooden hand do I sense a small Son of Frankenstein tribute here? and a hawk will hunt them down and the two companeros will slowly begin to take to the more noble attitude of the professor.Here Corbucci goes for a more Leoneesquire approach leaving the dark and brooding nature of his previous westerns like Django and The Great Silence behind. As Leone used to say this is a fairytale for grown ups. The story takes us from the Mexican revolution to the Fort Yuma prison to the Rio Grande to a spectacular showdown in the end with comedic touches wild shootouts explosions a typically great Morricone score and excellent performances and cinematography. This is more of an adventure spaghetti western in the Leone tradition. It's considerably lighthearted but fused with the same political undertones one could find in Sergio Sollima's work and brilliant pacing. Above all this is A grade entertainment like only the Italians can deliver.Sergio Corbucci is not considered only second to Leone in the spaghetti western realm for no reason. His attention to detail from the sets camera angles props costumes and cinematography is impeccable and he manages to convey that iconic aspect of the west only the Europeans were able to capture. Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not really a comedy western perse but it doesn't take itself too seriously either.Takes place in revolutionary Mexico during WWI. The Swede Franco Nero agrees to sell guns to guerrilla general Gen. Mongo but first they have to break into a safe in order for him to get paid and only the professor Fernando Rey knows the combination. Or so we are led to believe.The professor also leads a rival ragtag army of students who are fighting both the Mexican Army as well as Mongo's men with Lola Iris Berben as the professor's second in command. It turns out the professor is being held by the Americans in Texas and the Swede and El Vasco Tomas Milian Mongo's right hand man has to accompany him north to free him. However an expartner of the Swede's John Jack Palance show up and has other plans for the Swede. The psychotic John like to smoke a lot of dope and has a pet falcon named Marsha ? who lands on John's prosthetic hand after every scouting mission.This is one of Corbucci's better westerns in spite of the ridiculous political overtones he gives it. The story is entertaining and moves swiftly along for 2hrs. without me getting bored by any of it. I don't rate it as highly as the Leone's similarly themed DUCK YOU SUCKER 1971 but it's well worth watching all the same. The standout here for me is Jack Palance and I wish his part was bigger. He really does chew up the scenery and the part where he tortures Milian with a rat in a basket tied around his stomach is a hoot. Ever notice how one of Palance's sidekick the little oriental guy has an old telephone receiver strapped onto his ear as a hearing aid? Nice touch. And the ending where Nero throws a large cross under the boxcar filled with explosives and a detonator blowing up Palance in the process is a welcome end to one of the main baddies of the film. The lighthearted Morricone score fits this film very well and I like the musical cues that are sprinkled throughout that alternate between that familiar fuzz guitar and whistling banjo playing that happens while the action has quieted down.Anchor Bay is up to it's usual standards using an excellent widescreen anamorphic print with nary a hair or scratch through it. It looks like it was made yesterday. Some of the dialog is in Italian with subtitles because it was taken from a Euro print and was never dubbed into English. However the transitions between Euro and American versions are seamless. There's also a fairly interesting 15 minute interview with Franco Nero Tomas Milian and Ennio Morricone where they recount their experiences while they were involved in this film. 7 out of 10".

Starting out on opposite sides of the conflict and butting heads at every turn they soon develop a mutual respect and team up to save the day... or die trying. It's the same old plot yeah really what is the difference between this film's story and say Duck You Sucker or A Bullet For The General?... but the story is wellconstructed the direction assured and the performances are fantastic. Milian is in especially fine form... apparently he felt a bit threatened by his costar's screen presence and sought to steal scenes from him at every opportunity. Nero trying to hide his youthful good looks with some prosthetic wrinkles may be stuck playing the straight man but he still gets his share of screen moments. Another great score by Ennio Morricone... the reprise of the title track at key moments always fills me with delight. Director Sergio Corbucci's work may not match the visual poetry of Sergio Leone but he created a fine body of work as well and this is one of his best!".

A story about two terminally ill women in a hospital ward for cancer patients  well there is probably not a good way of avoiding clichs though I must admit they overdid it with the sex talk. If you want and can read the book  fine for the ones who prefer the movie and this review is about the movie I think it is a great sensitive movie about hope despair friendship loss and of course about strong women! I liked that many aspects of terminal illnesses were addressed. I really loved Marta Plimpton's always a great actress character. I liked Bruce Payne's character although I must agree with the critics calling him unrealistic but nevertheless a good character filmwise and if one has to check in into a hospital one can only hope for doctors like that  I would always prefer to have and watch a doctor like this as compared to the disgusting selfish sexobsessed irresponsible doctors from Grey's Anatomy. So if you are looking for some intelligent entertainment that makes you think has some great classical music and beautiful ballet scenes a wonderful friendship and also may make you cry a bit  this is a movie you should give a shot. Especially for women worth a try surely a better chick flick and of higher quality than those always repeating romance flicks or the mentioned Grey's Anatomy BS.".

	schema:headline " Good Movie But a Disappointing  Unsatisfying End to the series...";
	schema:reviewBody "Overall it may be said that the movie was good. The direction cinematography  the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.But this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book. I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy as all great movies are made like 'The Godfather Trilogy' 'The LOTR Trilogy' original 'Star Wars Trilogy' The Bourne Trilogy' etc. or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??Every part of LOTR is over 312 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it. .  SPOILERS THE GOOD Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.Throughout the series Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous.

I thought it would be cut.THE BAD  I have to mention these because I was disappointed as hellMy Biggest Disappointment  Snape's Memories. They showed the whole thing within a minute. They're some of the most interesting  touching scenes of the story. They just rushed through it even excluding many of the memories. Fred's death. They don't even show it.

I always imagined it while reading the books. But I badly wanted to see them in the movie.They don't show Harry using the Cruciatus Curse on the one of the Carrows.They wasted time in Nagini's chase.They don't mention about Teddy Lupin and that Harry was his Godfather. They don't mention the names of Harry's other two kids.No mention about the significance of the horcruxes.No mention of Bloody Baron and his link with Ravenclaw's diadem.No mention about how the Invisibility Cloak came into the possession of the Potters how Harry and Voldemort are related through the Peverell brothers.They don't show how Dumbledore communicated with Snape after he died.Harry doesn't even mend is wand. He directly snaps the Elder Wand into two pieces...In the future scene all the funny and cheerful dialogues are excluded. Everyone's just smiling and staring at each other. And moreover none of the them seemed in their late thirties. Didn't the filmmakers have enough money to hire good makeup artists.THE UGLY Dumbledore's Story. He's my most favourite character in the book. There's nothing about him in the movie. They just say he had secrets what secrets??. They don't even tell the story of Dumbledore sister Ariana. They don't show him getting emotional at King's Cross.The use of ridiculous oneliners and humourless jokes when the situation is so intense and sad.Harry  Voldemort had their final fight in the middle of nowhere. No one was even around to watch it. In the book they were in the middle of the whole crowd.Bellatrix and Voldemort die bursting into confetti!ALL IN ALL it wasn't the sendoff the series deserved. Someone who has grown up reading the books and watching the movies in the series will understand my woes...".

	onyx:emotionText "Overall it may be said that the movie was good. The direction cinematography  the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.But this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book. I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy as all great movies are made like 'The Godfather Trilogy' 'The LOTR Trilogy' original 'Star Wars Trilogy' The Bourne Trilogy' etc. or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??Every part of LOTR is over 312 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it. .  SPOILERS THE GOOD Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.Throughout the series Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous. But in the pensieve we see a refreshingly new emotional side of him.Gringott's scene was nicely shown.They added the scene where Hermione  Ron destroy Hufflepuff's cup.They show the future 19 years later scene.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all but they were still great movies. With that I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. The cast of the film was pretty much perfect they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film he did unbelievable job as the evil crazy Lord Voldemort I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.We all grew up overtime with the series we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II is not only the best film in the series but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.".

Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far in my opinion the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off all of the characters get the closure they deserve and the story just comes full circle!BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at a preview screening in London.Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that no point its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory though a slightly rushed conclusion. There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. I have to say that despite the woes we book readers have when elements big chunks of it too are omitted from the movies much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen cleverly weaving changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch if a little novel but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels not to take anything away from Rowling's writing. Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.Oh my god its only just sinking in this was the end....but what a great great end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what I was expecting... To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points characters and story lines. I guess I figured that was mainly because the movies only have a certain length of time to tell the story. Thus it was natural for me to assume that with 5 hours they would be able to include everything in the one book... I assumed wrongly.First off  Do not see this in 3D... The 3D is an after thought and literally added nothing to the experience. The only scene that was 3D that stands out in memory was the death of Voldemort and his confetti explosion.What did they get right? Well its hard to say really.. I was really disappointed with the pacing for the first half of the 2nd part. It felt slow and weird and anticlimatic the entire way. The bank scene and special effects seems average and low budget for a franchise with such high profits. The acting from everyone doesn't quite do the job. Snapes redemption scene was acted out really poorly by Alan Rickman.. which is a shame because I was really looking forward to it as it's one of the more moving parts in the series. The only scene that felt like it mirrored the book accurately was the Kings Cross section apart from Harry having clothes on... My main gripe with the movie is that they left out so much considering they had two movies to cover it. Harry telling Neville to kill the snake and thus Neville having and important role in the ending of the war  This part was the ONE part I was looking forward to when Neville pulls the sword out of the hat and cuts Nagini in two... Yet they changed it to Hermione and Ron battling the snake and Neville coming in as an afterthought... The entire war at the end was missing  Centaurs GoblinsKreecher HagridAragog and just felt very anticlimatic and also have very poor CGI. The entire point of the Deathly Hallows is missed out with Harry not claiming ownership of the wand and reflecting Voldemorts death spell back onto him and is replaced with a VERY tame action scene that went for about 10 minutes its then mentioned as an afterthought by Harry post battle. The scene when Harry confronts Snape was also bizarre and seemed unnecessary... Overall the changes and missing scenes left me feeling very empty.My girlfriend hasn't read the books and she enjoyed it.. So I'm sitting here wondering if the knowledge of the books hampered my enjoyment of it. I have no doubt this film will be hailed a success and will make bazillon dollars but I can't help but feel that another directorteam could've handled this a lot truer to the books.".

	schema:headline " A pathetic excuse for what should've been an epic movie";
	schema:reviewBody "My husband and I compromised our integrity on the knowledge of the most beloved books of all time when David Yates took control of the franchise thereby effectively beginning its downfall.... however rather than bore you with infinite details on how Yates manages to skip most of the greatest bits and substitute them with paltry unnecessary figments of his own inexplicable disconnected imagination we're going to stick to THIS PARTICULAR MOVIE.In what could have been Yates' greatest defining movie of his career attain him a legendary status amongst the directoral elite rake in billions at the box office true fans would have watched this no less than 20 times he manages to leave us in the same state as the crowd in the great hall after what was supposed to be the greatest battle in wizarding history and no one was there to witness it! Utterly Bored disappointed and completely unaware of what had just happened! To be fair  the moviemaking special effects and storyline although twisted in the aforementioned imagination seemed to be heading for an epic ending... up until the pensieve the most powerful part of the book Snape's revelation the incredibly romantic highly emotional story created by Rowling was reduced to a slideshow of muffled voices and disconnected scenes mostly consisting of James and Lily! ... and downhill it goes....Yates has flippantly undermined Neville's importance in the story by having him slit Nagini a new one by pure chance with no knowledge of what he was doing his speech was weak  the speech he made to Voldemort sounded lamer than an Air Supply song..as were a quite a few other bits of dialog.... anyone catch the emotion between Harry and GinnyHello there alright?.... gonna die today are we?.... OK gotta run!Yates' new inventions that would be well suited to other movies include... 1 Prof. McGonagals Lets lock the Slytherin students in the dungeons  2Voldemort and Harry can now suddenly feel horcruxes being destroyed never happened in the previous movies 3The horcruxes are just little objects that Voldemort thought of picking up in Diagon Alley on his way to lunch with the Malfoys and now appear to have an Accio Harry effect and call out to him! Losers that gave this movie a 10 read the books and join the true fan club every horcrux had its own tale and significance! Rowling spent 10 years of her life creating this world... Yates appeared to have planned the movies while on his lunchbreak! 4 It's OK to ignore Harry and sip on a cup of Joe just after the epic 'good over evil' battle. 5 Its more important that Ron and Hermione blush and hold hands than run to hug their friend who's just saved the entire wizarding universe. 6Ol George from Fred n George grew his ear back for this installment! wonder what that spell sounded like? 6Its OK to snap the ELDER WAND with your bare hands and throw it off a bridge who's gonna fashion you a new one??? As I recall olivander and gregorovitch and are bit tied up these days... 7 Voldy's been working out  you can tell by the way he suddenly wants to slap Harry and use physical strength rather than the magic he's mastered.100001 later lets get back to some other weak pointsHarry's mum displays all the emotions of a corpse pride joy tears for the son who's done them proud...its all there only its Sirius who's more maternalDumbeldore was unbelievable! Cocky arrogant and incredibly frustrating while the book portrays him as broken embarrassed and so proud of Harry's bravery.. instead we sat through k lightning enough with the questions..gotta fade into oblivion Yates budget on fireworks doesn't have any pennies left for my wages...No grand finale after Harry kills Voldy no fireworks no celebrations its like noone's happy about it...potentially the most emotional tear jerking sequence 10 years of this creation but we're left with faces that portray ehhh miss old Voldy already... bloody harry... why'd you have to go do that now? Seriously watch the actors faces as he walks through the great hall!Voldy and Ole Trixybells alone seem to have been made of weaker stuff than the other death eaters and wizards as they exploded into confetti last time Voldy did that he came back! thinking of your own sequel now Yates? cant wait...Enough said... we'll end with the faint and distant hope that Rowling awakes from the imperious curse and allows someone else to remake these movies capturing the integrity they deserve until then .. once again to all those who gave this movie a 10 READ THE BOOKS NOW ... Or at least get YATES to do it....".

	onyx:emotionText "My husband and I compromised our integrity on the knowledge of the most beloved books of all time when David Yates took control of the franchise thereby effectively beginning its downfall.... however rather than bore you with infinite details on how Yates manages to skip most of the greatest bits and substitute them with paltry unnecessary figments of his own inexplicable disconnected imagination we're going to stick to THIS PARTICULAR MOVIE.In what could have been Yates' greatest defining movie of his career attain him a legendary status amongst the directoral elite rake in billions at the box office true fans would have watched this no less than 20 times he manages to leave us in the same state as the crowd in the great hall after what was supposed to be the greatest battle in wizarding history and no one was there to witness it! Utterly Bored disappointed and completely unaware of what had just happened! To be fair  the moviemaking special effects and storyline although twisted in the aforementioned imagination seemed to be heading for an epic ending... up until the pensieve the most powerful part of the book Snape's revelation the incredibly romantic highly emotional story created by Rowling was reduced to a slideshow of muffled voices and disconnected scenes mostly consisting of James and Lily! ... and downhill it goes....Yates has flippantly undermined Neville's importance in the story by having him slit Nagini a new one by pure chance with no knowledge of what he was doing his speech was weak  the speech he made to Voldemort sounded lamer than an Air Supply song..as were a quite a few other bits of dialog.... anyone catch the emotion between Harry and GinnyHello there alright?.... gonna die today are we?.... OK gotta run!Yates' new inventions that would be well suited to other movies include... 1 Prof. McGonagals Lets lock the Slytherin students in the dungeons  2Voldemort and Harry can now suddenly feel horcruxes being destroyed never happened in the previous movies 3The horcruxes are just little objects that Voldemort thought of picking up in Diagon Alley on his way to lunch with the Malfoys and now appear to have an Accio Harry effect and call out to him! Losers that gave this movie a 10 read the books and join the true fan club every horcrux had its own tale and significance! Rowling spent 10 years of her life creating this world... Yates appeared to have planned the movies while on his lunchbreak! 4 It's OK to ignore Harry and sip on a cup of Joe just after the epic 'good over evil' battle. 5 Its more important that Ron and Hermione blush and hold hands than run to hug their friend who's just saved the entire wizarding universe. 6Ol George from Fred n George grew his ear back for this installment! wonder what that spell sounded like? 6Its OK to snap the ELDER WAND with your bare hands and throw it off a bridge who's gonna fashion you a new one??? As I recall olivander and gregorovitch and are bit tied up these days... 7 Voldy's been working out  you can tell by the way he suddenly wants to slap Harry and use physical strength rather than the magic he's mastered.100001 later lets get back to some other weak pointsHarry's mum displays all the emotions of a corpse pride joy tears for the son who's done them proud...its all there only its Sirius who's more maternalDumbeldore was unbelievable! Cocky arrogant and incredibly frustrating while the book portrays him as broken embarrassed and so proud of Harry's bravery.. instead we sat through k lightning enough with the questions..gotta fade into oblivion Yates budget on fireworks doesn't have any pennies left for my wages...No grand finale after Harry kills Voldy no fireworks no celebrations its like noone's happy about it...potentially the most emotional tear jerking sequence 10 years of this creation but we're left with faces that portray ehhh miss old Voldy already... bloody harry... why'd you have to go do that now? Seriously watch the actors faces as he walks through the great hall!Voldy and Ole Trixybells alone seem to have been made of weaker stuff than the other death eaters and wizards as they exploded into confetti last time Voldy did that he came back! thinking of your own sequel now Yates? cant wait...Enough said... we'll end with the faint and distant hope that Rowling awakes from the imperious curse and allows someone else to remake these movies capturing the integrity they deserve until then .. once again to all those who gave this movie a 10 READ THE BOOKS NOW ... Or at least get YATES to do it....";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and was very pleased with how well it stuck to the book. Because of this I had high expectations for Part 2. I mean if you did so well in the first half you have to do just as well in the second half right? Right? Wrong.The movie started off very well starting from exactly where it left off in Part 1 and staying faithful to the book all the way to when Harry and co break into Hogwarts. That's where it starts to go down hill.Spoilers! The good Neville. He was perfectly perfect. I really wish they gave him more screen time because he was adorable.The Gringott's scene. Very well done.The emotion we are shown from Snape. Throughout the series he's been rather monotonous and emotionless. In the pensieve we see a different side of him and it is a refreshing change.The battle at Hogwarts. It was intense and wonderfully done.Helena Ravenclaw. It was very emotional and creepy. Although they did not tell us her back story with the Bloody Baron.Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe shirtless. That's certainly a plus.OK you know it's bad when I resort to writing about that.The bad They completely took out the scene where Harry and Luna go into the Ravenclaw Common Room where they are ambushed by one of the Carrows. It appeared as if they would show it as I hope they would I've always wanted to see the other common rooms but then they don't. Hm.Fred's death scene. Gone. Yup. They show his body once at the end and don't even give you time to grieve before moving on to the next scene. This was an insult to his character's memory.Crabbe's disappeared. Gets replaced by Zabini and replaced in a different way by Goyle.Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. They just go through a few of them quickly. I've always enjoyed the memories because you get to see life at Hogwarts through the eyes of someone else for a change in a different time era.Hermione and Ron battle Nagini and eventually Neville slays the snake. Eventually. It takes some time getting to that scene.There is not a single mention of Teddy Lupin. That is until the end when Harry suddenly knows about Lupin's son. Weird considering Harry was camping in a forest and hadn't heard of any of this.Collin Creevey is replaced by that random Nigel kid.The students are not sent home. No the teachers think it's OK to just lock the Slytherins in the dungeons and let everybody else stay and fight.Still no mention of the significance of the horcruxes. Hufflepuff's cup is just a plain old cup that Voldy turned into a horcrux.Not enough interaction with characters other than the trio. Too much Harry. It's as if everybody else just have cameos.Random scene where they blow up one of the bridges ignoring the fact that there are like 2 other bridges that would take them into the school.Voldemort's and Bellatrix's death  explosion into confetti!Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all a reoccurring theme with Yates don't you think?.Harry does not fix his old wand with the Elder Wand. No instead he takes the Elder Wand and SNAPS IT IN HALF. Is that even possible? I didn't think so. So Harry breaks the wand and then chucks it into the abyss. Really Yates really?All of the fun and cheerful dialogue from the future scene has been resorted to everybody staring and smiling at each other. No explanation once again. They don't even say who's who! Plus there is absolutely no chemistry between Dan and Albus Severus. And it was really awkward to see them all with old make up on.Goodbye Dumbledore's back story! Too many attempts at oneliners and humorless jokes.End of Spoilers All in all all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is actionpacked as possible. It's a shame to see something that you've grown up with learned to love taken and twisted into somebody's 'vision.' I mean why bother adding your own unimportant scenes to the movie when there are perfectly good ones in the book that you did not bother using at all? There's no...bonding with the characters no connection with them you felt in Part 1. I did not feel the love for this movie like I had with the book. There was just so much significance that was left out of that movie and it is such a shame. It had such potential to be a fantastic movie and it fell short all because of the changes that were unnecessarily made.See the movie and I'm sure you'll form your own opinion of it. It's not a bad movie just disappointing and unsatisfying for a diehard fan who's been following the books for 10 years of their life.".

It's as if everybody else just have cameos.Random scene where they blow up one of the bridges ignoring the fact that there are like 2 other bridges that would take them into the school.Voldemort's and Bellatrix's death  explosion into confetti!Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all a reoccurring theme with Yates don't you think?.Harry does not fix his old wand with the Elder Wand. No instead he takes the Elder Wand and SNAPS IT IN HALF. Is that even possible? I didn't think so. So Harry breaks the wand and then chucks it into the abyss. Really Yates really?All of the fun and cheerful dialogue from the future scene has been resorted to everybody staring and smiling at each other. No explanation once again. They don't even say who's who! Plus there is absolutely no chemistry between Dan and Albus Severus. And it was really awkward to see them all with old make up on.Goodbye Dumbledore's back story! Too many attempts at oneliners and humorless jokes.End of Spoilers All in all all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is actionpacked as possible. It's a shame to see something that you've grown up with learned to love taken and twisted into somebody's 'vision.' I mean why bother adding your own unimportant scenes to the movie when there are perfectly good ones in the book that you did not bother using at all? There's no...bonding with the characters no connection with them you felt in Part 1. I did not feel the love for this movie like I had with the book. There was just so much significance that was left out of that movie and it is such a shame. It had such potential to be a fantastic movie and it fell short all because of the changes that were unnecessarily made.See the movie and I'm sure you'll form your own opinion of it. It's not a bad movie just disappointing and unsatisfying for a diehard fan who's been following the books for 10 years of their life.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this film has amazing special effects and the Hogwarts fight really keeps you on edge for the entire film. The fight between Voldemort and Harry was really well done even though it deviates from the book but being a film it has to.Where this film loses point is where it omits far too much from the book. This goes for the Halfblood prince too. In fact I think all of Yates' films follow this patternI know they have to make some tough choices by cutting out what is not really essential. Though an extra 10 minutes would not have hurt. Dumbledore's past is only slightly hinted at in both films but never explored. Leaves you wondering why they even bothered to mention it in either film. One thing I was really looking forward to was the fight between Dumbledore and Grindewald in a flashback of some sort. Aberforth neglected to mention anything though. I was also looking forward to the threeway duel between Voldemort McGonnagal and someone else I can't remember who but that was also omitted. The Deathly Hallows aren't really explained we never know that Harry's cloak is one of them or that Dumbledore possessed all 3 at one stage. Makes the film's name seem a little pointless. Horcruxs are also rushed. No explanation for their significance. Also why Harry is able to go back to life the significance of Voldemort using Harry's blood back in film 4 is all left out. Most disappointing of all is the ending. When Frodo destroys the ring the movie doesn't just end. But when Voldemort dies the movie ends a minute or two later. Lets not forget the 100s of death eaters that are still alive....what happened to them? There's no happy endings rejoicing no thankyous nothing. This is another point where I think Yates gets it wrong. There really is no interaction between Harry Ron and Hermione. In fact Harry doesn't have much dialog either. He doesn't even look at his Dad in the forest. This really make the film feel rushed. As I said once Voldemort dies there really is nothing else. You kind of expect some sort of happy ending with Hagrid the Weasleys the Gryffindor kids. But look the film was still pretty good. I give it a 7 out of 10 and there's a load of review that will tell you why. Go read those. Also the giants looked stupid.".

His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.Spoiler alert Just some scenes that could have been added or extended Snapes memories a few more scenes to greater establish his closeness with Lilly and his role in fighting Voldemort. It would have helped to explain why Harry named one of his kids after a man he had hated for 7 years. And a few more lines to show his reluctance to have to be the one to kill Dumbledore. This would have shown Snapes greater respect and love for him.Slightly extend the scene leading up to Mrs. Weasley fighting Belatrix. A few more seconds to establish Jinny's peril in the fight before Mrs. Weasly stepping in and uttering her great line. IT happened so fast you could miss that Jinny was even fighting Belatrix if you blink at the wrong time.SHould have shown the death of Fred and Percy's reuniting with the family. This wouldn't have taken very long and Fred deserved to have his death scene rather than just being an afterthought body on a stretcher.SHould have shown a few more individual fight sequences especially with Hagrid. I was beginning to wonder if Hagrid was even going to appear. And there was no emotion from him when he thought Harry was dead.Extend the scene of Mrs. Malfoy and Harry to better explain why she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead.Should have shown more entities involved in the fight like parents Hogsmead residence the elves as lead by Kreacher  rather than showing mainly an army of kids fighting the Death Eaters.MOre of the school's teachers in the fight.The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort could have been done better and stayed truer to the book.OVer all Yates' Harry Potter movies have been rather emotionless and anticlimatic.

It is meant to be a dark film after all. 6. Not showing characters deaths. Which one of the Weasley's died? I challenge anyone that hasn't read the book to answer that. They showed no close up and didn't really give any notification as to who it was except for maybe once. Which doesn't really give the characters justice and makes them seem worthless. 7.

So why did it do so once the part of Voldemort was out of Harry and just before Nagini was killed? It's as if it went oh Nagini is now dead. Voldemort can die. Let's deflect the spell onto him now. So stupid. Substituting suspense with a consistent plot. 9. You'd expect some interesting words from Harry and Voldemort especially since their feud has been hyped up for 10 years. There was none of that. 10. No screen time for anybody except Harry and Voldemort. The Good. 1. Voldemort walking through blood in his bare feet talking to Nagini in parsel tongue. It was dark and brilliant. If there rest of the film had continued like that it would of been a lot better. 2. Snape's memory. It contained emotion and served justice to the character.

	schema:headline " Better Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre  unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills plans and escapes to big and loud battles.The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not you'll love this series. And yes this is another remarkable movie series.".

	onyx:emotionText "Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre  unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills plans and escapes to big and loud battles.The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder.

	schema:reviewBody "We've been to the first session virtually of each Harry Potter movie. You expect the movie to never be exactly like a book when is it EVER?! but this one really did change a few things that shouldn't have been touched.There was a lot of good work in this movie. Lily James Sirius and Remus joining Harry to go into the Forbidden Forest was well kept. The acting was impressive as usual something one has come to expect from this group. The visual effects were also excellent and the storyline was well followed up to a point this is why the movie got 710 from the writer however when major changes to this occurred disappointment set in.The lack of use of the Invisibility Cloak which we all know is one of the most important hallows to possess by Harry throughout the movie except for when they are at Gringotts is puzzling as he used it extensively to get around Hogwarts so he could manage to obtain the diadem horcrux as well as make his way to Voldemort within the Forbidden Forest. Also when Harry 'falls' out of Hagrid's arms out in Hogwart's grounds when all Hell breaks loose due to Nagini's demise he uses the Cloak to escape and cause panic amongst the Death Eaters.Also the fact Harry didn't tell Neville it was imperative Nagini needed to be killed but Hermione instead diminishes Neville's importance! In the book it is completely up to Neville to destroy Nagini as he is the only one left who it is thought to be able to. Also it can be tied into the prophecy that Trelawney made all those years before as Neville killing the final horcrux causes Voldemorts vulnerability. Thankfully Neville is the one that kills Nagini but more by luck than good management.Harry telling Dumbledore that he had nothing to kill Voldemort with at Kings Cross Station was not correct as well as he went into the Forest with both the Cloak and a wand which was what made him so special as he did not raise that wand against Voldemort. He instead died willingly again showing his great strength and love of those important to him  his friendsfamily at Hogwarts.The adaptation by the screen writer Steve Kloves of the final scene between Voldemort and Harry of the novel  well...THAT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! What J.K Rowling wrote was good enough and whenever I've read it I've always loved it and pictured it so clearly in my mind so the whole battle scene between Harry and Voldemort was ridiculous and could only occur because they ruined the sequence of events. VERY UNNECESSARY! The wands locking in battle  what the???? That should not have occurred as they had different cores different timbers and were nothing like the Twin Core Phenomenon that occurred in book four Goblet of Fire. You don't even hear Harry say Expelliarmus which had become his 'trademark spell'.Harry Ron and Hermione not going to the Headmaster's Office after defeating Voldemort and there getting a standing ovation from all previous Headmasters and Headmistresses and Harry not mending his phoenix feather core wand through using the Elder Wand Death Stick was very much an anticlimax. Instead Harry in the company of Ron and Hermione snaps the Elder Wand the possibility of which I would think is questionable in the first place! and chucks it off the bridge never to be seen again?.It would have been nice to have had the connection between the Dumbledore's and Grindelwald explained especially Adriana's death. This actually moulded Dumbledore into the man he became  a professor and later Headmaster of Hogwarts never Minister of Magic and a supporter of Muggleborn witches and wizards. It also explained how he came into possession of the Elder Wand.I was so glad and there was applause in the theatre when the epilogue occurred as its lovely to see Albus Severus Potter and the short conversation between him and his father Harry.Overall probably not one I will see again at the movies which is something I have done with the others though they were disappointments in ways as well!.".

And what a showdown it is tense thrilling breathtaking and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. Whereas the first instalment of the 'Deathly Hallows' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry Ron and Hermoine screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live and from start to finish for once in a Harry Potter movie the action is swift and relentless.Part II picks up right where the previous film left off the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world i.e. the Elder Wand from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore Michael Gambon. The next shot is equally ominous students are marched rankandfile through a Hogwarts courtyard watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.There is precious little time to waste and the first we get to see Harry Ron and Hermione they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their breakin settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuicedisguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a rollercoaster ride through the vault culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.But as readers of the book will tell you the last stand happens back at Hogwarts and true enough after this thrilling early setpiece at Gringotts the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight in particular Neville Longbottom Matthew Lewis emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic sendoff they deserve.Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's Alan Rickman vindication long thought to be the Judas Iscariotequivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an actionpacked spectacle it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.Though brief this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry's realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort one that is fierce ferocious and thanks to Yates' imagination more exhilarating than reading it off the page. The outcome of that battle shouldn't be a secret by now and when the 'happilyeverafter' coda in Rowling's book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here you can't quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.They are of course no longer kids here Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.That we can be so fully immersed in Harry's world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography and Mark Day's skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat's evocative score which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper's mournful composition for the sixth movie works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.Pardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the 'Harry Potter' franchise it's really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potterworld in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good even great things have to come to an end so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter.".

	schema:reviewBody "As many people have already seen Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is out in Theaters. I will not spoil this film for you if you have not seen it yet. I will let you form your own conclusions as to whether you wish to see it or not.As everyone knows this is the last film in the Harry Potter franchise started 10 years ago with Mr. Chris Columbus at the helm. Many people credit the third film of the series Prisoner of Azkaban as the moment the franchise went from made for children to a more mainstream mature audience. I have to give major credit to Mr. Columbus though as without him the visions actors and feel of what we know within the films would not have been created. Several years later we are at the end of an epic journey. We have laughed cried looked on with awe and inspiration. Mr. David Yates returns to his role and directs a wonderful end to J.K. Rowling's loved works of literature. To explain how I felt while watching this film is difficult to achieve. I was enthralled from the opening scene to the start of the credits. Very few films capture me like that where I am so in tuned with the story. Star Trek 2009 Inception and Avatar are a few of the movies in which I have found myself repeat visits due to wanting to see parts of the movie that I have missed along the way. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride starting off slow until you reach the first action sequence then rushes headstrong into another series of scenes focusing mostly on Harry and his charge of destroying the horcruxes. This is Harry's story. This is his moment to set the wizarding world right. Along the way several characters stand out. Nevil Longbottom Matthew Lewis makes a stand and Professor McGonagall goes to war. There are many moments in which supporting cast members take the foreground for a moment or two but it is still Harry's story throughout the movie.I have to applaud Alan Rickman for his portrayal of Professor Snape. He has always amused me in every movie and he doesn't fail here. Another film to see how great of an actor he is besides Die Hard and Galaxy Quest Bottle Shock.Now was it a perfect movie. No. The CG at points looked amateurish and some of the dialog didn't fit well into the movie. Does it deter you from enjoying the experience. It shouldn't. These are just little things that annoy me.If you read the books which I am sure most of you have the story doesn't follow the book as well as it did in Part 1. I have yet to see any movie adaption of a well loved book ever faithfully follow the book to the letter. Even Game of Thrones didn't follow the books to the letter but it did a good job. Enjoy the movie for what it is A satisfactory end to a magical coming of age story.".

	schema:headline " A breathtaking finale to an amazing series";
	schema:reviewBody "Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book knew the plotting and remembered the fates of all the characters but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state  the end was coming and there was nothing I could do to stop it.Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off the film begins with Harry Daniel Radcliffe Ron Rupert Grint and Hermione Emma Watson still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's Ralph Fiennes soul. Rather quickly it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community and the world at large begins.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. Grint Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here they have totally immersed themselves into their roles and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book and move from sadness to courageous to fearful and more with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. Even with their varying screen times the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley who gets the greatest line in the film. Jason Isaacs Helena Bonham Carter George Harris Tom Felton Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters and help deliver awesome performances all around.But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.But like all Harry Potter films however the cohesive product is not without its faults.My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been threedimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal never exploring the format and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend. In what feels like a blink of the eye the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived and with it an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year and one of the best film finales ever conceived. 8.510.An extended review also appeared on httpwww.geekspeakmagazine.com.".

	onyx:emotionText "Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book knew the plotting and remembered the fates of all the characters but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state  the end was coming and there was nothing I could do to stop it.Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off the film begins with Harry Daniel Radcliffe Ron Rupert Grint and Hermione Emma Watson still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's Ralph Fiennes soul. Rather quickly it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community and the world at large begins.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. Grint Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here they have totally immersed themselves into their roles and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book and move from sadness to courageous to fearful and more with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. Even with their varying screen times the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley who gets the greatest line in the film. Jason Isaacs Helena Bonham Carter George Harris Tom Felton Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters and help deliver awesome performances all around.But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.But like all Harry Potter films however the cohesive product is not without its faults.My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 also known as the movie that tore my heart and soul into oblivion. If you thought goosebumps was the criteria for a good scene then mix those goosebumps with emotional upheaval coupled with your hands almost shaking and this is Deathly Hallows part 2 in its entirety.Harry Ron and Hermione are still on the pursuit to collect and destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. They believe the next one is hidden away in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in Gringotts the wizarding bank. But going into the bank is near impossible  unless you know a goblin who worked there which they do. And so a deal is stricken. At Gringotts they are discovered to be impostors. Hearts will race as they try to escape with the horcrux and as Harry soon finds out the next one is hidden inside Hogwarts and it's something that belongs to another founder of the school. And it is to Hogwarts that he goes. But Hogwarts has changed. Snape is the new headmaster.But there are many things that Harry doesn't know the ultimate secret being one that revolves around his every being. Things are never as it seems. People will show their true colors and they will come out as triumphant even after years of hatred.Dan Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have done the impossible here. They are possibly the only set of actors that you have seen grow up on the big screen and as the actors grew up on a personal level they added their maturity to their characters. It's very fascinating to watch them interact. Their acting is relentless captivating and charming as it should be now that they have mastered the characters they're playing. You cannot imagine other actors portraying Harry and Ron or another actress to portray Hermione. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as Snape and Professor McGonagall respectively gave their all in this movie. You cannot help but be on the edge of your seat whenever any of these two actors are doing their thing. Rickman has a part of the movie entirely dedicated to his character's personal story. It is also one of my favorite parts of the book. The Prince's Tale is transferred so magnificently on screen that it WILL bring you to tears.Professor McGonagall takes a stand  several actually  in Deathly Hallows as well. She stands up for a Harry and when she does the whole theater will explode in applause. Maggie Smith fortifying Hogwarts and then cracking a joke to lighten up the mood Just the way I like it. You cannot but share the pain in Smith's eyes as she sees her beloved school crumbling around her as she sees all the work that they've done go to waste And what better actor to portray this generation's most badass villain than Ralph Fiennes. He gives his character an extra dimension in this movie now that he has the room to spread his wings so to speak seeing as he's one of the movie's main pillars. Lord Voldemort is all evil. But in this movie another side of him shows up anguish and misery. And yet there's this subtlety to the nuances of the portrayal that make up the overall result to be very epic indeed.Steve Kloves is the movie's screenwriter. He captured the movie's essence perfectly. He presented J.K. Rowling's work in such a brilliant way that even the slight deviations from the book and they are very few do not even matter anymore. He portrays the gravity of the situation to the letter the deaths the destruction the revelations the buildup. His version of the story is so well done that it would be incredible not to see an Oscar nod and a win! for him in the Screenplay category. He added his touch while keeping Rowling's magic. Some of the lines from the book are transferred to the movie as they are and for someone who has read the book over and over again I was ecstatic to hear them on screen. Look atme. Enough said.Director David Yates has helmed the last four Potter movies and while I had my doubts about him at first Order of the Phoenix was not exactly great he more than surpassed my wildest expectations in this. The pace he sets for the movie never dies down. It keeps on building up and up like a beautiful orchestral crescendo. He guides his actors and actresses with confidence. He's working with a marvelous script based on a terrific book. And he has the green light to give it all out. What do you expect from a very talented director with those options? Something not less than magical.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 provides you with a sense of catharsis as it ends. It lets your senses go. It lowers your inhibitions more than alcohol. You cannot help but see your hands automatically clap at some points in the movie. You shout in desperation without even controlling your voice and you root for your characters like they're really in front of you. Tears flow down your face without any power of you to stop them. There isn't any better way to end the epic series that was Harry Potter. If only it weren't ending".

BUT I'm 100 sure that David Yates never read the books cause there are nearly no similarities to what happened in the books. I could make a full list but i think its not worth the web space filling so i will only write down what i remember1. In Bellatrix chamber the things inside are not just duplicating they get very hot so hot that they are burning them.... 2. Harry isn't telling anybody then Hermine and Ron about the Horcruxes and especially not Dumbledores brother... 3. The flames would have destroyed the diadem anyway so it wasn't necessary to kill it with the basilisk... at least not in the books... but in Davids world i guess its OK .' 4. The fight with Volde at the end was in front of all the people but i guess Yates missed that too cause its certainly more expensive then just alone somewhere in the bush. 5. Harry repaired his own wand before he kept and never used the elder wand again until he would die so the power of it would vanish. 6. A looooottttt more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!All in all i hated the movie in the last part of the movie i stopped watching the movie and was just thinking about how it is possible to make such a bad movie out of a wonderful book. Thanks David for making that possible!!!!!! PS. Eng is not my foreign language if u find spelling mistakes u can keep them D".

Overall it's a pretty silly film the story is certainly no masterpiece but I really enjoyed all the typical 1960's views. The buildings the cars the card system that picks Olga and Anja as the perfect couple to deal with the problem. The slapstick comedy group looks as if they're somewhere dragged in but this is a minor case of Europudding so who cares. A funny film in my view perhaps not in the way the makers meant it to be but I had fun watching it albeit over thirty years after production. That probably helped too.

Their goal is to wipe out a tyrannical town boss who is partly responsible for the death of the soldier's father.How can any spaghetti western fan not like a movie whose main female character is named Violence?

It stars Steve McGowan Richard Harrison a Confederate soldier who returns from the American Civil War to his ranch in 1865 . But his father Gustavo Re has been killed by the Miller's hoodlums . Steve seeks revenge to kill the murderers . Then  the villainous boss Miller Alejandro Ulloa hires a gunslinger called Sabata Raf Baldassarre and henchmen to kill Steve .

Steve is imprisoned but in jail he finds the known Mexican bandit Len Pompero Fernando Sancho . After that  they get escaped .

Starring Richard Harrison as a stranger rider who vows revenge  a soldier who returns from the Civil War and finds his father has been killed by a greedy landowner . Richard is pretty nice  he ravages the screen  he jumps leaps and bounds  hits and runs  besides  receiving violent punches  whipping and wounds . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the confrontation between Richard Harrison and Raf Baldassarre as the notorious hired hand called Sabata with some looks that say it all  including an exciting ending . Here Sabata usually played by Lee Van Cleef performed by Raf Baldassarre is another hero of second class in the S.W. genre as Sartana Gianni Garco or Cuchillo Tomas Milian or Ringo Giuliano Gemma or Holy Ghost . Strong and robust Richard Harrison was a magnificent muscleman . Harrison played in Hollywood some minor roles as Kronos South Pacific and Master of world . Then  Harrison jumped at the chance when offered the first character in 1961 The Invincible Gladiator  which was filming in Europe . He wound up settling in Italy for the next two decades . To avoid being penned in too much as a muscle man  he sought characters in routine spaghetti westerns as Texas the Red Gringo Reverendo Colt  Joe Dakota  even the main role from For a fistful of dollars was offered to Richard Harrison  but he turned down and explaining  Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing Fistful of Dollars and recommending Clint Eastwood for the part . Support cast is frankly good  thanks to the boastful Fernando Sancho  playing a likable bandit  as usual . He played a Mexican outlaw lots of times  as he starred multitude Chorizo or Pipperone Westerns  as the quarrelsome  swanky Mexican bandit  such as  A pistol for Ringo Return of Ringo Requiem for a Gringo  Dakota Joe  Winchester Bill  The Man Who Came to Kill and several others .

Most of the movie is focused on the characters played by Richard Harrison and Fernando Sancho. The two actors have some good chemistry together and also manage to deliver a considerable amount of light comic relief which is welcome. There is a significant problem with the movie and that is that the middle section of the movie moves at a crawl with little done to advance the story.

In any case the quality of the DVD tends to bring down my grade but it's hard to determine if the lousy editing  sound is a problem with this particular print or if it's intrinsic to the original film. In any case if you can roll with the palpable flaws this is an entertaining Italo Western hopelessly dated music and all e.g. bad dubbing and sound effects. The protagonists are amusing and likable and they develop a good camaraderie with the darkhaired hottie that hooks up with 'em. Productionwise this is nowhere near the quality of Leone's Dollars trilogy but storywise I find it superior. The movie leaves you with a good feeling.

On one level it has sumptuous cinematography on a par with 'Le boucher' another excellent score courtesy of Pierre Jansen and some very stylish direction. All Chabrol's actors play their parts beautifully although Audran undoubtedly has the best material.But what marks this film out and what many cannot appear to perceive is that it is not a meditation on class or a portrait of a 'menage a trois'. It does touch on those subjects as do many of Chabrol's films but this film is essentially about identity and it's destruction or absorption by another. Stephanie Audran's character is put simply a VAMPIRE. This is humorously and beautifully established early in the picture when she first meets Sassard's character 'Why' on a bridge in Paris amid a Gothic mist and with Audran looking drained and evidently needing a new victim. Many have commented on JeanLouis Trintignant's acting arguing that it is bland or inexpert failing to realise that as part of the plot he had to be 'consumed' by Audran and had to appear ineffectual. Compare Audran's extraordinarily vital near superhuman character in 'Les Biches' to her purposefully meek character in 'La Rupture' and one can begin to see what a subtle and intelligent actress she is.On first viewing 'Les Biches' some years ago I was mystified and like other reviewers irritated by the two scroungers Robegue and Riais. After further viewing it appears they are purposefully antagonistic and their apparently parasitic relationship points to them being Audran's familiars.The raison d'etre of the film are the final sequences in which 'Why' ultimately escapes the fate of Paul and destroys Frederique by becoming her. So 'Les Biches' is essentially a nuanced and very stylised commentary on identity and it's struggle to coexist within a relationship.".

Unlike other French film makers Chabrol showed he was more interested in style over politics. The structure of this film seems mapped out carefully as there is no spontaneous moment in the film. Chabrol calculated how he wanted to present the story in his own terms. The result is a film that was ahead of its times in many aspects perhaps in the frankness the director treats with the subject at the center of the story.Unfortunately we saw the film recently in the DVD transfer which pales in comparison with the original way we saw on the big screen. Since the format is not the letterbox format most scenes show only half of the actors faces. This is a film that cries for a better transfer because of the elegant lines Mr. Chabrol created for the film.The film is divided in three chapters involving the three principals of the story. Frederique a rich bored woman wants the beautiful young street painter she meets on one of the bridges over the Seine. It's clear from the beginning what Frederique's real intentions really are. The glances Frederique gives the young woman Why as she has named her have an explicit connotation hard to ignore by this gorgeous creature.Things begin to change as Frederique and Why arrive at the Saint Tropez house. It's winter so the place is empty. When the young architect Paul Thomas comes to a party at Frederique's he only has eyes for Why but Frederique succeeds in snaring him.

The romance between Frdrique and Why for example is never explicit but it is to be read between the lines through the glances of the socialite to her protg. Why Frdrique supports her two gay friends is never clear but maybe she finds them amusing with their silliness. Paul Thomas seems to be only interested in Frdrique's money but his character is also not well developed and serves only as a pivot to the tragedy.

The male lead JeanLouis Trintignant is easily the least interesting and developed of the three main characters but it doesn't matter much the story begins and ends with the two women. Audran's two eccentric friends  freeloaders in her lavish house provide some amusing comic relief. The film is quite unpredictable in its development in fact for a while it almost seems like everything might turn out just fine until you remember that a Chabrol doesn't like happy endings b that poisoned dagger could not have been introduced so early without a reason....Anyway this is an absorbing beautifully filmed psychological thriller and I think it's also a great starting point for those still unfamiliar with Chabrol's work.  out of 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although comparisons to Hitchcock are inevitable and perhaps deserved Chabrol's best films have an ethereal quality and a unique approach to the storytelling that's all his. In many ways although coming in the late stages of what is considered by many Chabrol's transitional phase which I sometimes think is a polite way to say 'Chabrol went daft on us and decided he was a glossy espionage thriller sort' Les Biches is reminiscent of some of Chabrol's early films including the ones which were key to the development of the French New Wave. There's a lot of that in this film with its offkilter approach and unconventional editing a pleasant surprise coming after the glossy typical murdermystery that was The Champagne Murders. This film fits perfectly with Chabrol the auteur's style ideology and storytelling method focusing heavily on the characters and it's nice to see him craft such a visually remarkable film after the disappointments that preceded.Before going further into the visual aspects of the film I'd like to address the script. In short it's great. It's the sort of thing that could have so easily been a heinously atrocious melodrama or a cheap skin flick which as the film involves bisexuality is unsurprisingly how it was marketed in the US but is so intelligentlywritten and welldeveloped that it works tremendously well. Most importantly of course the characters are complex and interesting enough to carry the first half of the film before the strange relationships between the three main characters come to the forefront and Chabrol relentlessly builds the sexual tension and suspense all the way through to the film's excellent final scene. The visuals are unquestionably Chabrol. The direction is highly controlled and the camera is rarely still and even then a zoom is almost expected. With most other directors this would almost feel impatient and unnecessary but Chabrol is always able to use the technique to his advantage using the motion evocatively and reflecting the nature of the film's events and this also means that stillness can be used to great effect as it is in a key scene in around the hour and twenty minute mark. The cinematography by Jean Rabier Clo de 5  7 is excellent and doubtlessly influenced heavily by Chabrol who frequently favors muted colors especially pastels and understated use of sunlight. The choreography of the camera movement and those in front of the camera is of far more interest than the photography however and may even be a nuisance to some viewers as the movement of the characters is often very contrived and even unnatural to create a particular sort of shot composition. These scenes achieve a sort of gracefulness that ultimately works in favor of the film stylistically but realists and naturalists might be upset.Les Biches is one of Chabrol's better sixties films a taut suspenseful drama that should be approached without any specific expectations of genre or style. The characters carry the film and Chabrol's stylish but sophisticated direction keeps the film involving and gripping allowing the viewer a rare bit of comfort now and then before raising the tension again. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Les Biches is from the early middle period of Claude Chabrol's long career in film making. It is interesting but somewhat inexplicable. It features longtime French leading man JeanLouis Trintignant as Paul Thomas an architect who comes between wealthy playgirl Frederique Stephane Audran and her latest plaything street artist Why Jacqueline Sassard with disastrous consequences.Audran who was Chabrol's wife at the time sports spit curls down the side of her ears like sideburns which is apropos since her character is bisexual. She is a woman with a steely imperial manner who enjoys conquests above all. First she picks up Why beds her and then when Paul arrives on the scene showing an interest in Why she seduces Paul and dumps Why.The question is why? In the central scene as far as the plot goes the three get drunk with seemingly obvious intent only to have Frederique nix the menage a trois and shut the bedroom door on Why. Why who has been desperately trying to look like Frederique sits outside the bedroom door and listens to the drunken lovers inside and sucks on her fingers.Obviously Paul would have gone along with this juicy arrangement and certainly Why wanted it desperately. But Frederique is malicious and all conquering. Paul who is anything but a heroic character does not insist on Why's joining them in bed not because he is madly exclusively in love with Frederique but more likely because Frederique is the better catch because of her wealth. He is a cautious opportunistic man.The dialogue is sharp and witty but reserved and terse. One striking feature is the way the eyes of the women are so heavily made up. Clearly this signals a film made in the sixties. The scene in which Frederique hosts a poker game certainly anticipated the popularity of the game today. Interesting are the sycophantic gay guys that Frederique keeps around her chteau in St. Tropez for amusement.The finish of the film is a bit of a surprise and really not that well foreshadowed. Also the title Les Biches translated as Bad Girls in English is a bit of mystery. More appropriate might be L'imperatrice petite with the focus where it should be on the character of Frederique.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:headline " Beautiful French drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Les Biches is only the fourth film I've seen from 'The French Hitchcock' Claude Chabrol but already the great director is becoming one of my favourites. Chabrol clearly likes to keep his films under wraps and deliver stories in a succinct manner and Les Biches is another example of that as on the surface the film is a rather tame thriller focusing on the ambiguous relationship between two possible lesbians but underneath it's a strange and interesting character study exploring an unorthodox three way relationship. The first character we are introduced to is Frdrique a seemingly wealthy woman who meets a street painter who simply calls herself Why. Frdrique gives the painter money before asking her if she will accompany her back to her lavish villa. The street painter agrees and goes back to the house where we meet the strange gay couple Robque and Riais. Soon enough an architect named Paul Thomas imposes on the girls' relationship first romancing Why and later being seduced by Frdrique before moving into the villa...The film makes homosexuality one of its main themes which must have been fairly daring considering the time in which the film was released. The film stars two beautiful women  Stphane Audran Chabrol's wife at the time and Jacqueline Sassard. Both women look great and their chemistry together provided one of the main reasons I enjoyed this film so much. The actresses' beauty is matched by Chabrol's cinematography as the great director ensures that everything about this film is stunning and a joy to behold. As is always the case with Chabrol the film is extremely high class and the production values and acting are exquisite. It has to be said that the movie doesn't have a great deal of plot and this has lead to a number of viewers labelling the film 'boring' but for me the visuals and implications of the plot were enough to ensure that Les Biches is always interesting. The film is not so much of a thriller as the likes of Blood Relatives and Le Boucher there's not a great deal of suspense and it's not difficult to work out where the story is going. However as a drama the film works magnificently well and Les Biches does come recommended.".

Opening Why to an exploration of her identity the writers wonderfully have her purity of love be grinned down by obsession of Frdrique and the bourgeoisie gluttony of Thomas and Why.Proving that three's a crowd JeanLouis Trintignant gives a very good performance as Thomas whose lack of warmth has Trintignant freeing him up to be a vessel for Frdrique's passions. Finding herself becoming an outcast Jacqueline Sassard gives an incredibly delicate subtle turn as Why with Sassard bringing out in her body language a deep love for Frdriquethat is left shattered. Stealing everyone's hearts like a merciless Femme FataleStphane Audran gives a fantastic performance as Frdrique via Audran giving Frdrique a compassionate faade that causes Why's obsession to grow.";

As an homage to her I reviewed this movie again today.Stphane Audran was awarded the Best Actress prize of 1968 in the Berlin Film Festival for this movie. The film was cut in different markets from the original 104 minutes to 99 97 in USA for a PG rated VHS 1980 release and even 88 minutes.After seven years of rather paltry stuff Claude Chabrol reestablished his reputation with this elegantly enacted cool callous and witty bisexual mnagetrois. It was also the first film in which Stphane Audran Mrs. Chabrol since 1964 was given a role worthy of her subtle expressiveness.  Bloomsbury's Video Guide.This movie proves that you can make a very sexy movie with practically no nude or copulation scenes. Yet the underlying sex drive is steamy and erotic.  The XRated Videotape Guide vol. II.1967 was the year of lesbianism in French cinema. Two films were turned with just a few months between them Les biches by Claude Chabrol with an original script and La Religieuse by Jacques Rivette upon Diderot's novel. Chabrol admits It was explosive for it's time. For the first time you were seeing a girl taking another girl... Be it the scene of the bathtub or Stphane's stripping I never photographed below the navel I always cut right in time! After all both my does fell in love with a boy and the most rich won him what as far as I saw it was more immoral than a special relationship. Besides to tell you the truth lesbianism doesn't attract me it only interests me as an abnormality. If a woman wants to have children that is not the best way to achieve it...  Chabrol cited by Frank Deeth Sapho c'qui faut! Quand les biches envahissent l'cran in Le Crapouillot n 23 December 1972.The original title sends a complex message. Les biches French for female doe the sweet animal a girl is drawing on the pavement when we first meet her character is also French slang for girls in the way the British used to refer to young women as birds and the Americans as chicks or foxes with no derogatory intention. The Portuguese title when the lesbian word was taboo As Rivais erases the essential subject of the story emphasizing the threesome of the story. The American title Bad Girls adds an ethical judgement on the two women's behaviour that is far from what we are told about their characters. Claude Chabrol was an uppermiddleclass man a bourgeois and though he did not subscribe to the leftist agendas current in France in the 1960s he was a permanent critic of the upper classes hypocrisy and disdain for the others. Some reviewers have pointed that the end of the movie represents the victory of the rich girl over the poor girl in their dispute for the man  therefore representing the usual realistic triumph of the rich and powerful. Having seen many of Chabrol's films I agree that in this one he was sending that message too that we mostly missed for the blatant dare of showing with taste but explicitly love among women.".

Or was it about finding an identity in lesbian affair there is no nudity which was a quite a topic for '60's? Was it about commitment passion jealousy or the mortal love? I have to confess none of these convinced me at all. Second of all the acting was ridiculous and the mood of the film was cold as ice. Maybe Chabrol thought that the climax could get warmer in Saint Tropez but it didn't help as well. If you are looking for beautiful scenes of Southern France I will recommend To Catch A Thief instead with a brilliant story and directing from Hitchcock Their acting didn't give the feeling of love in fact any feeling at all.

	schema:headline " It has problems but this is a fairly enjoyable if silly film";
	schema:reviewBody "As long as you're in the mood for a lighthearted somewhat goofy and selfconsciously modern Bollywood romantic comedy Mujhse Shaadi Karogi can fit the bill. It's often funny and in many ways it is technically impressive. However partially due to the necessity of stretching out the film's running time to standard Bollywood length it becomes quite taxing during the second half. Most viewers' ratings are likely to go down during this period but director David Dhawan redeems his film in the climax. My final verdict was a 7 out of 10 or a C.Mujhse Shaadi Karogi is the story of Sameer Salman Khan. It was clear since Sameer was a baby that he was headed for trouble. The priest who named him suggested Sameer because it means something like calm breezehe predicted that Sameer would frequently have problems with his temper and in a very funny opening sequence we see the truth of this as we quickly follow Sameer as he grows up. At one point he even smacks his high school principle. Of course Sameer always thinks his actions are justified that he's just sticking up for people who have been wronged. Unfortunately people in power such as judges tend to disagree with him. And even the woman he loves says she's afraid of him. She marries someone else instead. Sameer decides that it's best for him to leave town and try to start afresh. He acquires a job as a lifeguard in Goa. Once there he sees and falls in love with Rani Singh Priyanka Chopra his neighbor. Unfortunately as soon as he meets her he unwittingly assaults her father for a minor transgression. To make things worse Sameer ends up with an obnoxious competitive roommate Sunny Khurana Akshay Kumar. Sunny is a womanizer who falls for Rani too and he continually turns the tables on Sameer to ruin his chances with Rani.The majority of supporting characters are very funny. Once in Goa Sameer hooks up with a younger astrologer named Raj Purohit Rajpal Yadav. I've seen Yadav in a few films now including Dil Bechara Pyaar Ka Maara 2004 and the excellent Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon 2003. He's had a comic edge in all of them and he's impressed me with his range. Sameer's landlord in Goa Mr. Duggal Kader Khan suffered a head injury that results in him alternately being blind deaf and dumb on different days. A sign outside of his office lets people know which problem he has at the moment.Of course some of this is a bit ridiculous. Ridiculousness is a big theme actually and imbues everything from characterization to the music. There is a lot of almost corny hiphop music and attitude in the film including a recurring low soulbrother voice that keeps telling us how wicked Sunny is in a singsongy fashion. Such touches are prominent in a lot of modern Indian films. The aim is to draw in a youth crowd. In many cases such as Lakeer  Forbidden Lines 2004 there isn't a firm enough commitment to this MTVish positioning to make it work for the film overall. Here director David Dhawan keeps up the ridiculous material more consistently and as this remains a comedy for most of its length the cornycampy stuff often works. It may be a bit stupid funny like a Bollywood hiphop Green Acres 1965 but that's still funny.Part of the ridiculousness is realized through references or less charitably derivativeness to other films. In the opening sequence Sameer is fighting with a couple basketball players via Matrix 1999like wire stunts and there's even a bit of bullettime camerawork. Later there is another Matrix reference this time to The Matrix Reloaded 2003 as a drunken Sameer fights multiple Mr. Smithlike copies of Sunny in the street. There are also hints of and even an entire lifted scene from Meet the Parents 2000. At one point it seems like the plot is going to turn into an uncredited remake of that film as Rani's father has military background and a Robert De Niro as Jack Byrnesish disposition. He even has a less than attractive dog that he's obsessed with but who doesn't like Sameer very much. However the Meet the Parents material turns out to not be so important and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi has a more standard Bollywood love triangleconfused identity plot.The main problem I had with the film which brought my score down a couple points was that it's difficult to not become aggravated with Sameer in the later stages of the film. Actually it's more of an aggravation with the scriptwriting because the scenarios and Sameer's odd muteness while he's in the midst of situations that are constantly recontextualized so that they're not in his favor become overly contrived. At the same time the character of Sunny becomes annoyingly obnoxious and the twist between the two characters isn't exactly believable.Part of this is due to the attempt to stretch out the running time to a typical length for a Bollywood filmit clocks in at 2 hours and 40something minutes. It should have been cut down by an hour. We get a deus ex machina plot device to solve the dilemma in the middle of the film but it is all for naught and even given the film's running time the resolution of the dilemma ends up seeming rushed at the end. The attempt to stretch out the tension was just a bit too overambitious.On the technical side there is some very nice cinematography set designs locations costumes and such. The film won the Screen Weekly Award for Art Direction and was nominated for many more.You shouldn't bother with Mujhse Shaadi Karogi unless you've a strong taste for sillinesscorninesscampiness but if you do you'll find enough to keep you entertained if you can make it through the frustrating section before the climax.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being an Indian I am always baffled by the ignorance of Bollywood film makers about the globalization of cinema. I really really want to like these films and have refrained from commenting negatively on ANY of them just out of respect... but this one was the the straw that broke the camel's back. I apologize in advance for the scathing and sarcastic nature of this commentary and the suretofollow tirade about Bollywood film makers.Re The filmmakers. Do they really think Indians don't watch American films? You reading this Mr. Mahesh Bhatt? Do they really think that we can't tell when scenes are plain STOLEN from American films? There are at least three scenes in Mujhse Shaadi Karogi that borrow liberally from Anger Management starring Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler. The film also samples scenes from Meet the Parents starring Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Their two roles are portrayed in this film by Mr. Salman Do I take my shirt off yet Khan and Mr. Amrish Yet another film where I play a retired Punjabi Army GeneralColonel who disapproves of my daughter's choice of spouse Puri. While the story is not an exact duplicate of either Parents or Management the characters in this film are so derivative formulaic and clichd that you could have thrown them in any Hindi romantic comedy. I wonder if the producers throw darts at a list of character attributes for HERO ROLE and HEROINE ROLE when coming up with plots. This film even has the overacting sidekick thrown in for comic relief... although I guess Johnny Lever had a scheduling conflict. Instead they cast some other guy in a clever double role as twin brothers  An astrologer and his twin... uh... well... a thuggish motorcycle gang leader. Yes you read that correctly.Nothing new in this film  the usual sacharine acting which keeps the glycerine stock high in Mumbai... Those pathetic songdance numbers which make one thankful for the existence of the Fast Forward button... and your garden variety soulless lovetriangle storyline. I think the script would have had better use if they printed it on toilet paper. I can't believe some of these lines were said with a straight face by the actors. Here's a question for you educated viewers Is it any more irritating when a film soundtrack has to cue you how to feel? Every time Akshay Kumar does something slimy we are treated to the whispers of Wicked Sunny!! over and over with another horrible attempt at copying 50Cent's music from his hit At the Club. It made my teeth itch!!I wish more films like the novel Dil Chahta Hai were made. At least the predictability factor is a little subdued in that film! Bollywood is the most prolific film producing industry  but it is evident that quantity is DEFINITELY not indicative of quality. And please my Bollywood friends... stop copying formulaic American films and scenes. I think M. Night Shyamalan and Gurinder Chadha have demonstrated that Indians can be creative without borrowing. This applies to film plots as well as soundtracks! I wonder if Roy Orbison is getting royalties for Pretty Woman from the Kal Ho Naa Ho songwriters. To summarize I would rather drink a quart of paint thinner than see this film again. It's disgusting devoid of any true emotion and worst of all  it's humor is just artificial and derivative. I wanted to throw things at the screen and didn't laugh once. I groaned plenty though.Yes perhaps I take some if this too seriously... I know the movie is just supposed to be fun. It tries hard to be that... I know it's just a romantic comedy but I am beginning to loathe the complacence and mediocrity turned out by the Bollywood film industry which consistently underestimates the intelligence of its audience. I just had to write this. I refuse to hold Indian films to a different standard simply because they are Indian. I'm really cheering for all of you in Bollywood to get it together and make something worthy of international notice. They should be making American versions of OUR films not the other way around! Turn off MTV for new ideas and realize that the lead actress' navel is not a crucial plot device. Adapt some novels to the screen... scan our history and tell some of the truly endearing human stories.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film's sets are spectacular. I have to admit I don't even know if the film is actually taking place in a set or Goa itself. Huge budget for the film. The sets look absolutely spectacular.The film itself is pretty entertaining. Lots of laughs all round from many of the characters of the film. Salman Khan is on a role. After last year's hit Tere Naam his box office draw is higher then ever. Even his lackluster film Garv drawed the masses with his star power. His spectacular performance in the film must be noted. Even Salman admitted in an interview that he did not expect much from his last film. Salman is great at comedy and this film should be no surprise if one has seen his performance in films like Andaz Apna Apna Biwi No.1 Judwaa Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Yeh Hai Jalwa. The last 4 title being directed by the director of this film. Salman Khan has admitted he is temperamental and as it happens so is his character in the film. Therefore Salman is easily able to understand his character's weaknesses. Salman invokes a lot of sympathy into his character.Akshay Kumar has shown great comic timing. Fantastic performance. Again his no stranger to comedy as has shown his skills in films like Suhaag and Awara Paagal Deewana. Akshay's best comic performance ever!Priyanka Chopra is one of the most charismatic actresses today. She is full of confidence. Extremely beautiful not surprising since she is a former Miss World. Her debut in Andaaz was impressive. Unfortunately her role is not as big as Salman or Akshay but her presence is felt.Amrish Puri is great. Very rare to seem in a comedic role in recent times. He shows such anger yet you laugh as he is so funny. His altercations with Salman will bring down the house.Easily the best David Dhawan film ever. I have to admit I'm not a big fan of his when he makes with films with Govinda. His films with Salman are always a riot.The best film so far this year leave your mind at home and enjoy. Laughs guaranteed.".

But not a 100 Rip off they have changed it a Little since in This Movie 2 Guys named Sameer Malhotra and Sunny KhuranaSalman Khan and Akshay Kumarare after a girl More or Less you have to see the Movie. OK this is one of the Thousends of Bollywood Movies that have been Rip offs from Hollywood or even elsewhere but i think this is one of the few Good ones. And besides of that 2004 was a poor Movie Year for Bollywood Movies and i think its getting worser every year. After all the Only good Films beside this one were Main Hoon Na Dhoom which was a Rip off from Fast and Furious Musafir which was a Rip off too but i don't remember from which Movie. If there are any other Movies that forgot to Mention sorry. But you will say it in your Review for sure . The only thing in this Movie that was very awful was the Laughing of Salman Khan it really gets on your nerves. The Story is not something new i agree with that but it is a Comedy Movie so you don't have to expect much from it it should entertain you and it does.".

But not a 100 Rip off they have changed it a Little since in This Movie 2 Guys named Sameer Malhotra and Sunny KhuranaSalman Khan and Akshay Kumarare after a girl More or Less you have to see the Movie. OK this is one of the Thousends of Bollywood Movies that have been Rip offs from Hollywood or even elsewhere but i think this is one of the few Good ones. And besides of that 2004 was a poor Movie Year for Bollywood Movies and i think its getting worser every year. After all the Only good Films beside this one were Main Hoon Na Dhoom which was a Rip off from Fast and Furious Musafir which was a Rip off too but i don't remember from which Movie. If there are any other Movies that forgot to Mention sorry. But you will say it in your Review for sure . The only thing in this Movie that was very awful was the Laughing of Salman Khan it really gets on your nerves. The Story is not something new i agree with that but it is a Comedy Movie so you don't have to expect much from it it should entertain you and it does.";

I expected the film to get better after Akshay came in but unfortunately it got worse. The scenes in which Akshay is always putting down Salman seemed so childish. The second half is filled with such silly pranks and juvenile humor. And the climax sequence where Salman proposes to Priyanka on the cricket field bought the film to an all time low. All Priyanka Chopra does is look pretty her performance is awful lets just say the mannequin acted better then Priyanka. I cannot believe an actor who delivered such good performances in films such as Hera Pheri Ajnabee and Khakee gave a terrible performance in this film. Salman Khan was the only saving grace in this film. He was extremely likable as the goodygoody Samir and he looked great too. Of the support cast Amrish Puri and Rajpal Yadav were the best. Other are not worth mentioning. I would give credit to David Dhavan who at least tried to do something different from his earlier films. The promos looked promising. But at the end Mujhse Shaadi Karogi felt like any other clichd David Dhavan film. The look of the film is great! The film maintains a stylish look throughout. Music wasn't appealing. For the exception of Lal Dupatta all the other songs seemed out of place. Watch this film at your own risk. 510.".

Two odd newly married couples find at the same restaurant for their wedding receptions where things will get confused giving rise to misunderstandings crises and final catharses. One couple is made up by Sally in desperate need for money for her and her daughter who has married Wilfred a black man in need of a citizenship the other is the marriage between Freddie who has married who had already been his former wife Sophie and after a divorce and some psychoanalysis went to the altar for the second time as a sort of last chance with good intentions but no convictions. It s an intelligent movie in the way it poses some questions on the real nature of marriage despite the two major stories also the minor characters will gradually question their relations and the meaning of their lives and the hours spent in that restaurant will be revealing. It is interesting in the way in the end women make the definite and resolute decisions knowing they have to come to terms with their destiny with courage and strength even if without a man even against family pressure whereas men never show any single sign of courage and determination and just act according to women's choices. There are also some moving but never pathetic moments to be enjoyed as truly genuine. And the girl playing the little daughter acting as a trait d'union between all these interrupted souls is great. This movie proves how a well cast both main characters and secondary ones together with an intelligent script can make out an intelligent product although not original in content but certainly worth seeing as feelgood genuinely entertaining and honest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maura a single mother must get prepared for her wedding something she reluctantly does. One can see her heart is not in it but she is facing a financial crisis she owes money to everybody. When some of her furniture is repossessed before she even leaves the house Maura decides to go ahead with her arranged marriage with Wilson the African man who is illegally in Ireland. Maura stands to gain about nine thousand Euros for going through the charade which will allow her new husband in he country. Unknown to her and the future husband their union is closely monitored by two immigration officers.Parallel to Maura's wedding Freddy is remarrying Sophie. The first marriage did not go as well ending in divorce. They have put aside their differences and will try again. Freddy although doubtful this new wedding will work has given his word to his former wife and now he cannot go back on his promise. We watch the hesitation as the priest asks Freddy for his vows. Sophie is a somewhat hysterical young woman who might not be marrying again on her own accord but because she wants to please her parents.As fate would have it the two wedding celebrations have been booked at the same seaside hotel.

Maura and Freddy keep meeting each other in funny situations. They develop a rapport with each other they do not enjoy with their intended partners. It is not too difficult to realize they are really meant for each other.Written and directed by Stephen Burke this appears to be his first full length feature and it shows. The material had potential for more laughs. It is a romantic comedy with shades of screwball thrown into it. The excellent Sally Hawkins is at the center of the action as Maura. She makes a wonderful Maura. Same could be said about Tom Riley's Freddy a handsome actor who matches his costar well. Best of all is young Sinead Maguire who is seen as Molly the girl who has an uncanny sense of timing delivering a good performance that feels real an accomplishment for the director. The action is not all even something to do with Mr. Burke's screenplay. One gets the impression this is a film that was dumped to DVD and had a limited release.The film is worth a look because the presence of Ms. Hawkins Ms. Maguire and Mr. Riley.".

One can see her heart is not in it but she is facing a financial crisis she owes money to everybody. When some of her furniture is repossessed before she even leaves the house Maura decides to go ahead with her arranged marriage with Wilson the African man who is illegally in Ireland. Maura stands to gain about nine thousand Euros for going through the charade which will allow her new husband in he country.

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like and enjoy this movie but it's just not terribly good all in all. I liked pretty much all the actors and would like to see them in other better movies. I'd particularly like to see the actress playing I think Karen Maura's sister or close friend her character gets somewhat dropped in the course of the movie. This movie was just so disjointed and ridiculous disjointed and ridiculous is not a dealbreaker for me but it has to work and this just didn't. One indication of how negative an impression this made on me is reflected in what I just wrote in the message section The element that most stood out for me in this middling little movie was the ridiculous inconsistency of the hair on Sally Hawkins' head. I'm not one of those people who generally notice goofs and screwups in continuity but this was so 'in your face' even I couldn't miss it.Even within many little scenes from shot to shot her hairstyle changes. Sometimes it's fairly natural looking with a part on her left side the bangs falling in a few segments and the entire shape not terribly big sometimes it's kind of like that but with a slightly larger shape probably from teasing yielding a bit more 'lift' sometimes it's kind of like that but the hair darker and more smoothed sometimes with the bangs all sticking together in one piece sometimes there's no part at all and there's one point while Maura and Freddy are outside looking for Molly who ends up being up in a tree where the hair appears to be a helmety yucky looking wig no part there either.It got to be really annoying couldn't help wondering why no one could be bothered trying to keep any kind of continuity in that element. In that scene where she particularly seems to be wearing a wig I was taken out of the story again wondering if these shots were filmed much later than the rest and maybe Sally H. had cut all her hair off so they had to use a wig and didn't have time to get a good one and get it styled right. Just so sloppy kind of like the runon sentence I just typed. Too bad but at least it's not a great movie otherwise either in which case it would have been a real shame.".

In which is a bit a surprise because it's rather an entertainingly sturdy oldfashion boy's own adventure with feverish plotting buoyant performances and striking scenic locations on show. Think of another Bronson feature Villa Rides made two years before it as the story is kind of similar but set in a different time different place.It's 1922 and two former U.S army soldiers Adam Dyer and Josh Corey meet under unusual circumstances where these rivals join together as a group of mercenaries in Turkey. They're hired by a local governor for a mission through the Mediterranean which includes transporting his three daughters and a gold shipment. This leads to a lot of devious developments occurring on the wartorn journey.Charles Bronson and Tony Curtis simply clicked together as the two soldiers of fortune. Curtis' happygolucky approach matched up well with Bronson's laconically calculated manner. Both provided many amusingly perceptive quips as they try to out wit each other. The snappy script keeps the sharp humour and comic elements on the cards. This along side the illustratively sunbaked Turkey backdrop with its local flavour and revolutionary wars gave British director Peter Collinson an excitingly colourful frame to work with. His uniformed handling is lively tough and sprawling in its madeup spectacles. Random opportunities knock for the characters to take up and so does the rough and tumble action. It's punchy with enough bangs for you buck as the madcap narrative moves at a locomotive pace. Bert Kaempfert's flighty music score is a majestically sounding arrangement that suit's the film's epic framework and exotic locations. The cast also features the likes of Leo Gordon who also penned the film's screenplay Patrick Magee Horst Janson Tony Bonner and extremely beautiful Michle Mercier.You Can't Win 'Em All is an agreeably fitting and strongwilled adventure comedy escapism.".

They're hired by a local governor for a mission through the Mediterranean which includes transporting his three daughters and a gold shipment. This leads to a lot of devious developments occurring on the wartorn journey.Charles Bronson and Tony Curtis simply clicked together as the two soldiers of fortune. Curtis' happygolucky approach matched up well with Bronson's laconically calculated manner. Both provided many amusingly perceptive quips as they try to out wit each other. The snappy script keeps the sharp humour and comic elements on the cards. This along side the illustratively sunbaked Turkey backdrop with its local flavour and revolutionary wars gave British director Peter Collinson an excitingly colourful frame to work with. His uniformed handling is lively tough and sprawling in its madeup spectacles. Random opportunities knock for the characters to take up and so does the rough and tumble action. It's punchy with enough bangs for you buck as the madcap narrative moves at a locomotive pace. Bert Kaempfert's flighty music score is a majestically sounding arrangement that suit's the film's epic framework and exotic locations. The cast also features the likes of Leo Gordon who also penned the film's screenplay Patrick Magee Horst Janson Tony Bonner and extremely beautiful Michle Mercier.You Can't Win 'Em All is an agreeably fitting and strongwilled adventure comedy escapism.";

	schema:reviewBody "You Can't Win 'Em All 1970  out of 4 Mildly entertaining action film has former WW1 soldiers traveling to Turkey where they are hired by Osman Bey to help guard a gold shipment but after countless double crossings and twists the soldiers begin to realize that there might be something more at stake than just gold. It's important to note that the soldiers are played by Tony Curtis and Charles Bronson and those names are big enough to make you want to keep watching even when the film itself starts to unravel and come apart. The movie gets off to a great start as Curtis is stranded at sea in a sinking boat and gets picked up by captain Bronson but before he can get on the two have a nice exchange of words. The first twentyminutes of the movie are fast sharp and contain some very funny moments but all of this stuff pretty much goes away once the center story kicks in. I never really could get too involved with the story in Turkey simply because it really didn't feel all that real and I also thought it was rather poorly written. I think there's way too much story trying to go on and there's really nothing behind it because the main goal is just to get to the next action scene. As far as the action goes we get a couple excellent sequences. The opening bar fight is pretty good but the real highlight comes towards the middle of the film when the train carrying the gold comes under attack. After viewing the movie I had to do a Google search to see how many stuntmen got killed in this sequence but apparently it was none. The physical stunts are extremely graphic and there are a few scenes where horses are tripping off one another and there's one instant that will really stick out because it seems the human riding it gets crushed during all the mayhem. There's another big action piece at the end which results in another twist in the story that actually works pretty good. The main draw of this movie is going to be seeing Curtis and Bronson together and they actually do a pretty good job. I thought that laid back smart ass attitude of Curtis worked perfectly well with Bronson stone cold approach. The two are simply so different that when they mix it up they just come off very funny. The banter between the men in the bar at the start of the film is certainly one of the highlights. YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL is far from a masterpiece and in reality it's not even a good movie.

	onyx:emotionText "You Can't Win 'Em All 1970  out of 4 Mildly entertaining action film has former WW1 soldiers traveling to Turkey where they are hired by Osman Bey to help guard a gold shipment but after countless double crossings and twists the soldiers begin to realize that there might be something more at stake than just gold. It's important to note that the soldiers are played by Tony Curtis and Charles Bronson and those names are big enough to make you want to keep watching even when the film itself starts to unravel and come apart. The movie gets off to a great start as Curtis is stranded at sea in a sinking boat and gets picked up by captain Bronson but before he can get on the two have a nice exchange of words. The first twentyminutes of the movie are fast sharp and contain some very funny moments but all of this stuff pretty much goes away once the center story kicks in. I never really could get too involved with the story in Turkey simply because it really didn't feel all that real and I also thought it was rather poorly written. I think there's way too much story trying to go on and there's really nothing behind it because the main goal is just to get to the next action scene. As far as the action goes we get a couple excellent sequences. The opening bar fight is pretty good but the real highlight comes towards the middle of the film when the train carrying the gold comes under attack. After viewing the movie I had to do a Google search to see how many stuntmen got killed in this sequence but apparently it was none. The physical stunts are extremely graphic and there are a few scenes where horses are tripping off one another and there's one instant that will really stick out because it seems the human riding it gets crushed during all the mayhem. There's another big action piece at the end which results in another twist in the story that actually works pretty good. The main draw of this movie is going to be seeing Curtis and Bronson together and they actually do a pretty good job. I thought that laid back smart ass attitude of Curtis worked perfectly well with Bronson stone cold approach. The two are simply so different that when they mix it up they just come off very funny. The banter between the men in the bar at the start of the film is certainly one of the highlights. YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL is far from a masterpiece and in reality it's not even a good movie. With that said fans of the two stars will probably want to check it out but others will probably not find too much to keep them watching from start to finish.";

This time around the characters have to guard a gold shipment from various renegade factions leading to plenty of stock action scenes and gungho adventure staples.The film wins plaudits for casting a couple of decent actors as the leads there's Charles Bronson acting all tough and stoic as usual while Tony Curtis in contrast brings plenty of laidback charm to his character role.

Its funny in a movie when you have German soldiers throwing lots of firepower against American soldiers few Americans get killed however when you see soldiers of countries like Greece or Turkey with less firepower they are good at killing Americans in large numbers.".

As they leave for their ship the soldiers exit the bar and start shooting AFTER the fight is over and many people have been beat up.Later on Bronson is talking to the Sultan of Turkey about working for him. Whenever the sultan talks his face is in the very corner of the screen and you can only occasionally see his whole face.  Also a microphone is extremely obvious just offcenter.Besides these details the movie is extremely repetitive.  I have no idea how many scenes contained Bronson and his men riding horses camels donkeys etc.Here's a rough depiction of a quote from the movie Bronson hands the other guy a gun This good charity is going to be the death of me.

If you don't believe me that it sucks this bad rent it for yourself.  If you enjoy watching movies that are so bad that they are funny this one is a mustsee.

A strangely jaunty optimistic sounding title for such a grim and nihilistic movie though.If you tell me why you want to die then I'll kill youReally? Yes? It's because I'm so hopelessly unhappy in this lifeBit of a rough quote there I'm afraid. GGSTV! opens with a 17 year old girl being dragged to a rooftop and raped by a gang of thugs whilst a boy of a similar age watches on expressionless. The sun rises the next day to find boy and girl still in the same positions sat in silence until the girl rises and wishes him Good morning. Awkward conversation arises and the girl reveals that this is the second time she's been raped. She is surprised to find that she has bled this time too hence the title which is actually a line from a song she sings to herself. The conversation progresses little better when she asks the boy to kill him. Throughout the course of the day the boy lets her into his own life a little which we find to be at least as fed up as hers. I don't know what it is about the Japanese but they seem to have a knack of producing the strangest and most disturbed movies in the world. Takashi Miike might be shocking audiences and provoking walk outs now but 32 years ago Koji Wakamatsu was producing movies that were at least as dysfunctional and disturbing. Whilst the west was having flower power and free love Japan appears to have had quite a different approach to the hippy movement though this may not be an entirely representative sample!. If GGSTV! were to be made now it could only be a student film and it would be largely criticised for its naivety probably accused of being selfindulgent. And for having some truly awful acting. But movies in general were different in 1969 and GGSTV! was certainly a pioneering film and seemingly quite sincere in its bleak world view. It feels in many ways more 'film' like than most movies today... the cinematography is all very photographic and the way the interesting soundtrack is blended with the movie  definitely 'cinema as art'. I'm not going to suggest it's a great movie but it is fascinating and provocative and deeply bleak and depressing so that might appeal to some .".

This is a strong film showing the innerturmoil of two teenagers who've each had a rough life.Tsukio follows after a gang of guys who take a young girl to a rooftop to rape her. He stands by and watches and stays on the roof until the girl wakes up the next morning. They start a sort of friendship based on their mutual depression and angst at the world. Poppo the rapee constantly asks Tsukio to kill her and Tsukio constantly refuses. They eventually take revenge against the gang that raped her and decide to take their own destinies into their own hands...Much like Wakamatsu's earlier film THE EMBRYO HUNTS IN SECRET  GGSTV is a pretty bleak film punctuated with poetic and strangely beautiful moments. There are a few rape scenes and a little bit of splatter for the sleazeheads out there of which I am proudly one... but this is not an overtly sleazy film. This film is more of a tragic chronicalling of two desperate lonely and hopeless individuals. Though GGSTV has some pinkystyle elements those hoping for either a fun pinky film or a twisted violentpink style film will be disappointed. Others that go into this one knowing that it's more serious than the typical pinkytype entries will probably enjoy it...7.510".

Do I pretend I am the intended audience? I do that for some films and in some cases where it is a film I have seen I recapture that prior self as well as the filmmaker's intended effect.

Go Go Second Time Virgin is as surreal and strange as its title suggests it is. The basis behind the plot is relatively simple but I have no idea what the film is trying to say and that's what enforces the weirdness of the film. Go Go Second Tim Virgin starts with a rape sequence and from there we focus on two teenagers one of which being the girl that was raped. The pair of them are depressed and the girl insists that she wants to die and asks the boy to do it but he refuses preferring a different solution to the problem. The film is stylishly shot most of it is in black and white although certain sequences are portrayed in colour. The bleak atmosphere is the main point of the film this film is extremely bleak throughout and not a great deal of fun which might not please anyone going into this film expecting something more fun considering the film's 'pinku' origins. There's not a great deal of sleaze in the film  the rape scenes are not overly graphic and there's not a great deal of gore either. I won't name this film as a favourite or anything like that but it's an interesting little flick that is definitely worth seeing and therefore comes recommended.".

There is a natural tendency of considering this movie as a fareastern one and especially as a '60's '70's one. More than that can you imagine GoGo Second Time Virgin' is a strange and beautiful combination BunuelResnaisAntonioni in a Japanese manner. It is true that the movie is violent really violent but physical violence is a indispensable element in GoGo Second Time Virgin' especially when the same violence is not being followed for any single moment by Wakamatsu. The TITLE signifies purity and in the beginning a 17 years old girl is gang raped on a roof while a boy is watching without participating. The boy remains there right next to the raped girl till the morning 8th of August a warm and sunny one. The girl gets up and even though she wasn't a virgin she still bleeded after the rape. It was the second time she was raped first time it happened on a beach and from BW the image is now cyan. She bleeded for the second time because she didn't lose her innocence and directly comes the title GoGo Second Time Virgin'. For the same reason the movie is build' on and around a ROOF with many WHITE SHEETS in the 8th of August morning scene. The girl is sad and she wants to die and the boy an anonymous poet pretends that he does not understand why. We go down the roof in a flat where the image turns for the last time from BW not a coincidence into colour this time and there is a murder scene with four bodies and a lot of blood. The victims have sexually molested the boy and he killed them for being pigs' and that's how ABUSE is introduced. From this moment 'till the end the movie turns into a not losing purity dilemma and the climax is the night i'mgonnakillyoudance all WHITE SHEETS are gone and a misty morning on the 9th of August. As for the set the image and the shot Tarkovsky's and Kieslowskyi's fans would be delighted seeing GoGo Second Time Virgin' a '65 minutes everyday Masterpiece about trying keeping and fighting for your own purity. The most violent nonviolent film I've ever seen simply BEAUTIFUL 810.".

Director Koji Wakamatsu demonstrates mastery of his craft exquisitely binding exploitation to arthouse treatment switching to colour for memory or grisly violence and deploying once or twice handheld camera for shocking style as he pulls his actors inexorably to climax. The film does slip into the realms of the unnecessary in using photographs of Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate underlining the climatic violence and its riff on the then all over the papers TateLo Bianco murders but it felt somewhat out of place to me. The dialogue also at times perhaps goes beyond its intent perhaps a little too arch at times and the final moment is a little unsubtle driving home in bleakly humorous fashion a message that could just have well have been left implicit. But the overall effect is hardly abated by these small slips so potent is the ambiance. Not a film for everyone that's for damn sure but to those that value the stranger side of serious cinema this is a must see. 910.

	schema:reviewBody "Koji Wakamatsu is a strange dude he was raised a farmer but became a lowlevel gangster after hitting the town due to getting expelled from school for fighting. He worked for an organized crime gang which collected payments from film crews and got himself in prison for six months where he was tormented by guards fueling his distrust of authority. He then made a ton of pinku soft porn films. His other exploits include getting high with Yoko Ono in a hotel room getting banned from entering the USA because of radical political affiliations in his youth producing Nagisa Oshima's controversial pinku film In the Realm of the Senses and according to some rumors even sending his daughters to a Palestine army camp to teach them discipline.Take everything written above and take the title Go Go Second Time Virgin and just try to visualize what sort of a film this is. And the final result surprising no one is weird as sht. A pinku Japanese New Wave exploitation arthouse film shot on a shoestring budget in foru days resorting to a single location like in other Wakamatsu films in this case a building rooftop. In the end  the movie is very nihilistic  you can't escape the rooftop and its wickedness and the only way out is jumping off of it to your death.The title of the film is taken from one of the poems the heroine recites and is a reference to how she bled after getting raped on the roof even if it weren't her first time. For visual accompaniment Wakamatsu focuses on white hanging sheets which disappear after the opening scene. The film's bleak BW look is also sometimes interrupted by a cyantinted flashbacks and later a full color violent flashback which manages to be incredibly unsettling despite the extrafake blood effects and the amateurish acting.It's a short watch spanning just over an hour in typical pinku fashion but I'd say every minute of it is wellspent even if I have trouble understanding it. It relies on poetry and jazz songs to give the story more depth although Wakamatsu's intent is never made clear right to the very end where the camera focuses on an childrenaimed ad advertising not to sniff thinner. There's also a scene where the titular girl Poppo speaks to the camera and yells Fuck you! after confessing that neither her nor her mother felt any pleasure while getting raped. The scene has been read as Wakamatsu's attack on conventional plot points concerning rape in pinku films.One oddity in particular concerning this films is that it's tied to the Manson Family murders. Apparently Wakamatsu based his '60s scripts on actual crime events. This movie for example ends with a quickcut collage of violent manga extracts and pictures of Roman Polanski and his murdered wife Sharon Tate. The film begins on August 8th the same day as the Tate murders and 3 women and 4 men are killed in the movie same number as the TateLaBianca killings.And you know what else? This movie is really good. Although I have no idea what it's trying to say and several sequences were extremely unpleasant to sit through it's the intent but still the atmosphere was just amazing. The combination of excellent jazz music and the dark cold rooftop location was spot on. It may not be an enjoyable watch but holy hell is it memorable.".

A pinku Japanese New Wave exploitation arthouse film shot on a shoestring budget in foru days resorting to a single location like in other Wakamatsu films in this case a building rooftop. In the end  the movie is very nihilistic  you can't escape the rooftop and its wickedness and the only way out is jumping off of it to your death.The title of the film is taken from one of the poems the heroine recites and is a reference to how she bled after getting raped on the roof even if it weren't her first time. For visual accompaniment Wakamatsu focuses on white hanging sheets which disappear after the opening scene. The film's bleak BW look is also sometimes interrupted by a cyantinted flashbacks and later a full color violent flashback which manages to be incredibly unsettling despite the extrafake blood effects and the amateurish acting.It's a short watch spanning just over an hour in typical pinku fashion but I'd say every minute of it is wellspent even if I have trouble understanding it. It relies on poetry and jazz songs to give the story more depth although Wakamatsu's intent is never made clear right to the very end where the camera focuses on an childrenaimed ad advertising not to sniff thinner. There's also a scene where the titular girl Poppo speaks to the camera and yells Fuck you! after confessing that neither her nor her mother felt any pleasure while getting raped. The scene has been read as Wakamatsu's attack on conventional plot points concerning rape in pinku films.One oddity in particular concerning this films is that it's tied to the Manson Family murders. Apparently Wakamatsu based his '60s scripts on actual crime events. This movie for example ends with a quickcut collage of violent manga extracts and pictures of Roman Polanski and his murdered wife Sharon Tate. The film begins on August 8th the same day as the Tate murders and 3 women and 4 men are killed in the movie same number as the TateLaBianca killings.And you know what else? This movie is really good. Although I have no idea what it's trying to say and several sequences were extremely unpleasant to sit through it's the intent but still the atmosphere was just amazing. The combination of excellent jazz music and the dark cold rooftop location was spot on. It may not be an enjoyable watch but holy hell is it memorable.";

Very minimalist film almost entirely shot on a grimy rooftop where a young woman gets raped repeatedly mostly because after the first rape she decides to STAY on the roof to wait for someone to kill her or rape her again! She meets a young shy man who is harboring an incredibly morbid violent secret. The two depressed deathobsessed teens find solace in each other and form a kind of bond against their brutal surroundings. Effectively filmed in black and white with some jarring color flashback scenes this film can really get under the skin. Many people die and the casual way the deaths are filmed makes for a surreal and unpleasant mood. Worth mentioning too is the sultry moody jazz soundtrack that is featured. Recommended for all those obsessed with rape and murder.".

	schema:reviewBody "Go Go Second Time Virgin opens with the gang rape of a seventeen year old girl by four men. With a slow Japanese acid rock tune playing in the background the camera focuses on the face of the young girl while she is raped by each man. This scene then goes to a flashback in sepia tones in which the viewer witnesses the first time the girl was gang raped. Instead of fleeing the scene or calling the police the girl remains on the rooftop and makes a shaky friendship with a boy the son of the building's manager who witnessed her rape. Spending their time on the rooftop the boy and girl engage in a conversation which basically consists of the girl telling the boy that she wants him to kill her. However the boy of course is reluctant to do so but as time goes on the boy agrees to do so and it seems that he might have some experience in the area of killing.Go Go Second Time Virgin is a bizarre film by a director who broke many filmic taboos and directed films such as Blood Red from the Sun The Wet Flower's Budding Eye and Flesh Target Escape in a time in which Japan was producing one pink film after another so where Miike can be viewed promulgator of extreme violence in Japanese film of today Wakamatsu was pushing the envelope of eroticism over forty years ago during a time in which censorship was much stronger. However how does Go Go Second Time Virgin rate as a film? Upon my first watching of the film it seemed nothing more than a way to display the naked body of its lead actress as much as possible and upon my second viewing of this film it seemed as if Wakamatsu was trying to create a film that not only had erotic aspirations but was also trying to push the pink film to a new level of artistry. For some it seems that this film did reach this goal and for others this film is nothing more than a big mess. However for those who like the films of Suzuki Norifumi the older films of Oshima Nagisa and Imamura Shohei or maybe the fiction of Murakami Ryu Go Go Second Time Virgin might be a good example of some of the sleazier films produced during the 1960s in Japan.".

	schema:reviewBody "La traversee de Paris is a brilliant and often profound blend of comedy and drama. The story is rather uncommon and told in a most antirhetoric way. During World War II in Paris occupied by the Nazis two men have to deliver four cases filled with pork meat for the black market. They cross the city overnight trying to avoid French cops and German soldiers as well.The fun is mainly based on the duets between the two heroes Grandgil Jean Gabin and Martin Bourvil supported by a firstrate witty script. These two characters are drawn with psychological depth. Grandgil is somehow a mysterious man. Sometimes he seems to be a sort of thug. He despises and bullies innocent bystanders. He wants to cheat and steal the pork meat following a sort of selfish anarchism. But many clues make the viewer feel that all this should be a Grandgil's joke. On the contrary Martin is proud to be a decent person and to keep honest and correct even working for the black market. The unavoidable quarrels arising between the two men build a nonstandard but deep friendship. Extraordinary is the actors' job. Jean Gabin is deservedly a cinema legend and never disappoints the audience. Here the always excellent Bourvil is on a par with his great partner.On the background we have the masterly rendered atmosphere of those bleak years. French people is oppressed by deprivations and lack of food. Patriotism and heroic resistance are far from being appreciated. People are widely depressed by French defeat on the battlefield and just wait for the end of the war and of German invasion. The first scene sets the tone of the movie. A blind beggar plays the Marseillese with his fiddle. Martin is displeased. What's the point of vainly provoking the Nazis? However he gives a coin to the beggar. And even a German officer gives money to the blind man. As a matter of fact German soldiers do not appear as cruel barbarians. The officer who questions Grandgil and Martin is even nice. But when something wrong happens namely an attack against a German colonel then the inhuman ferocity of Nazism shows his face. And the French hostages blame the partisans for that! Meanwhile the swashbuckler Grandgil always ready to despise other people's cowardice realizes that in tragic circumstances one must care only for himself and his own life. There is a lot of depth in these scenes believe me.It is not surprising that this excellent movie was reviled by French audiences and critics when released. This antiheroic even petty representation of French people at wartime was surely hard to swallow. A magnificent nocturnal photography and artistic camera work together with a firstrate direction by AutantLara add further value to this superb movie.The final scene may appear somehow stuck to the movie. But it contains an important message. Life has won life continues. Common simple decent people survived. Barbarians have lost doomed to destruction by their own infernal wickedness.La traversee de Paris is a gem of French cinema. Highly recommended.".

Jean Gabin as usual is excellent. The story line is simple  two men have to carry across Paris black market pig meat. Bourvil an unemployed cab driver does it for money Gabin a well known artist does it for kicks.";

	schema:reviewBody "The bringing together of two great comic actors of the calibre of Jean Gabin and Bourvil could not fail to be a great success but this film surpasses the audience's expectations by several hundred kilometres.  For both actors this is a real tour de force.  Bourvil is the hapless stooge to Gabin's outrageously forceful character and the double act is unbelievably funny. One can't help but have pity for the poor unemployed Parisian as his nighttime trudge across Paris is turned into his worst nightmare.Whilst much of the humour is in the performance of its two stars joined by Louis de Funes in that amazing cellar scene near the start of the film the script is wellwritten and genuinely funny in places.  The menace of the Nazi threat is there all the same and this is heightened by the darkened sets representing a deserted Paris resounding with the distant tread of the German patrols.  The last twenty minutes of the film is a distinct contrast to what preceded it and the humour appears to fade very quickly into drama. Luckily our heroes emerge unscathed possibly but the threat of what might have been substantially changes one's view of the film.Needless to say when this film was released in 1956 scarcely 10 years after the end of the Second World War it was widely reviled.  It presented a view of the occupation that whilst honest and accurate in retrospect had never before been seen in French cinema and which was simply too much for many to stomach.  Gabin's character was a particular target for scorn representing a cynical freethinking attitude that could only be regarded as dangerous and antiRepublican.  The film's director Claude AutantLara should be credited with immense courage in presenting to the French people his perception of the war unadulterated by the constraints of convention. That he should achieve this through one of the funniest of French films is a remarkable achievement.".

It is in the way he frames a shot builds the tension and especially the transition shots that define one. In that case AurentLara ranks up there with the likes of Eisenstein and Hitchcock. The man was an ultimate craftsman who understood cinema. Shame on Truffaut who just showed his ignorance for slamming him and his movies. This movie also known as four full bags teams two of France's biggest stars of the era Jean Gabin and the one name Bourvil in a delicious comedy with a human heart. It is WWII and occupied France is running short of pigs thus creating a black market for it. Bourvil's job is to get the already killed pig's carcass aka pork in four cases and deliver it to the seller who will take it to the market. He meets and enlists the homeless Gabin to assist. They must outwit scared Parisiens and Nazis on the night watch to achieve this deceitfully simple task. That is all you need to know to enjoy this war time romp. The laughs come at a clip a minute mainly from the garrulous and belligerent Gabin with Bourvil the straight man in their Lawrence and hardy relationship. Before the night is over and daylight comes we shall meet dogs drunks experience the fear of an occupied people who hope for a better tomorrow all done with a airy touch. And the last scene will make any cinema lover and human being rejoice. I love this movie so much I think though it is not as complex as Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove shares its agony and eccentricity of the nature of war.".

That's not the image that springs to my mind when I think of Gabin but then neither do I think of Bourvil as a dramatic actor  until I stick 'Le Circle Rouge' in the machine for the nnnth time. Whatever the two were teamed brilliantly in this postwar nod to the Black Market in Paris during the occupation. The 80 minute running time is just about right for this romp that obliges regular Black Marketeer Bourvil to work with a dep Gabin and transport valises stuffed with pork from arondissment to arondissment under the eyes of the Germans.  The movie is kickstarted via a cameo from alltime great French comic Louis de Funes and it seldom lets up.  Although the soundtrack is replete with Parisian underwold slang the thing is so visual that even non French speakers could follow the story in the original nonsubtitled version.  The denoument such as it is that Gabin is really a celebrity artist and is doing the gig for kicks rather than money is fairly irrelevant and the last scene with Bourvil now a railway porter toting Gabin's bags is neither here nor there.  Even today half a century after the events the French are still sensitive to anything apertaining to the Second World War and the French movies that address those feelings whether sentimental frivolous or dramatic are among the best movies of any country. This is no exception. Five stars in anyone's solar system.".

And never are the laughs triggered by funny situations but funny reactions from rather dramatic situations. We laugh first and think after.La Traverse de Paris was released in 1956 a decade after World War II. Paris hadn't changed much and people still had vivid memories of these dark years that followed the defeat in 1940. When France ceased to belong to French the country was economically a slave for Germany while morally French people were entrapped in a neverending torment the bitterness of having lost war freedom and the faith on a brighter future. It was indeed as they say now the 'darkest hours of French history' and it's only fitting that the movie takes place during the night to accentuate the blackandwhite hypnotic photography. Darkness is omnipresent when memories from WWII are revived from Night and Fog to Army of Shadows.In fact darkness is almost a protagonist for during the Occupation it helped many good people to hide from the Germans or French Police. It was a time where French used their resourcefulness when ration tickets weren't enough. The darkest hours saw the rise of the black market. After all when the dignity of a whole country was traded for peace when the government has betrayed the honor of France many French didn't feel like owing anything to the power it's less heroism than pragmatism yet from our perspective these men and women were brave because they jeopardized their lives and could easily say one word too many to a friend of the Germans a collaborator as they say.And the opening sets the tone Marcel Bourvil and Mariette Jeannette Batti enter a bar they learn that a black market partner was arrested because he trusted someone and told him he sold soap he was then arrested. Speaking of soap a painter named Grangil Gabin comes to the bar and needs to wash his hands the bartender tells him that there's no soap as if there was enough trouble with it already. Police officers come and ask a client if his hands are dirty coal has been stolen Martin's girlfriend understands and discreetly gives Grangil a bar of soap. Everything is put together in that introducing sequence solidarity suspicion and betrayal. And if Grangil is brave enough to smuggle coal maybe he'll make a good replacement to Martin's partner.Grangil accepts to cross the town with luggage full of pork parts avoiding Police and Commandantur. The journey starts and there's something so exhilarating in Gabin and Bourvil's performance that we enjoy first the film for what it is a superb demonstration of what the Golden Age of French cinema was. Gabin who gained a little weight and gray hair was still looking fairly young and he who used to be so restrained and cold is more grandiloquent than Bourvil who's generally the funny guy but here plays the straight man. It's as if Gabin enjoys postwar life again and can finally inject the relief of the peace in his performance and even vent his passion against the cowards in two marvelous scene.The first one is when he raises the prices of the mission asking for more and more even though Jambier the butcher says yes from the beginning. Out of his lungs he screams the name of Jambier of the street he lives in and asks for money where a disoriented Bourvil wants to shut him out. The scene is perhaps the noisiest of French cinema. Gabin is noisier than De Funs and funnier than Bourvil but the two stars take the distance with him at that point it's Cinema all the genius of French Cinema finally imploding for laughs and simple laughs. But then right after comes the other powerful moment with Gabin's rant and boy was he great at ranting toward an old bartender and his clients who wanted to get them out from the bar when they felt something suspicious with two men carrying big luggage.They were coward enough to denounce them and not to even take a chance and the luggage with an infuriating Gabin delivered one of the most powerful monologues of French cinema incriminating all the little guys who think they're better than the others but don't even make an effort to be decent he insult their ugliness  physical and moral and conclude his diatribe with an immortal salauds de pauvres literally  which would e translated as you rotten poor. Marcel Aym's script has never sounded so incisive so politically correct yet so humanly correct at these time were courage was a luxury. This is Gabin show and he carries the film as confidently and strongly as he does for the luggage Bourvil and De Funs will have their stars shining in many films to come but the reason to watch the film is to admire Gabin.What he stands for in terms of masculinity and principals and moral values. Now you have a French President claiming I don't like the rich which sounds so fake so popularityseeking so forgettable when a fictional Gabin treated the poor as rotten it sounds real and eternal. This is how low things has sunk. La Traverse de Paris is a reminder that sometimes it's the darkest hours that allow the brightest souls to shine.".

But then right after comes the other powerful moment with Gabin's rant and boy was he great at ranting toward an old bartender and his clients who wanted to get them out from the bar when they felt something suspicious with two men carrying big luggage.They were coward enough to denounce them and not to even take a chance and the luggage with an infuriating Gabin delivered one of the most powerful monologues of French cinema incriminating all the little guys who think they're better than the others but don't even make an effort to be decent he insult their ugliness  physical and moral and conclude his diatribe with an immortal salauds de pauvres literally  which would e translated as you rotten poor. Marcel Aym's script has never sounded so incisive so politically correct yet so humanly correct at these time were courage was a luxury. This is Gabin show and he carries the film as confidently and strongly as he does for the luggage Bourvil and De Funs will have their stars shining in many films to come but the reason to watch the film is to admire Gabin.What he stands for in terms of masculinity and principals and moral values. Now you have a French President claiming I don't like the rich which sounds so fake so popularityseeking so forgettable when a fictional Gabin treated the poor as rotten it sounds real and eternal. This is how low things has sunk. La Traverse de Paris is a reminder that sometimes it's the darkest hours that allow the brightest souls to shine.";

It's short and sweet just about 1hr20min no scene ever stalls the movie no line in the dialogue branches out into its own thing. It's tight focused and efficient. It knows exactly what it's about.It's both fantastical in its concept and terribly realistic at the same time. Both lead actors were perfect for the cast and play their roles perfectly while Louis de Funes is also excellent in a more secondary but not any more quiet role.The film dishes out bits of life lessons here and there forces a bit of thought and perspective but never feels selfcomplacent or happy about itself. It delivers the goods with a super simplistic plot a bit of humor a bit of wisdom a bit realism a bit of fantasy it's a little tragic but also quite light... and it does it damn well.".

It's illogical historically incorrect and almost ridiculous. But it's French so maybe it works.From a modern perspective it's a difficult movie to connect with. Although it does function as a period film much of its relevance to today is virtually nonexistent. And much of the dialogue is cut during the English subtitling so unless you're fluent in French it'll be difficult to pick up on certain details. Overall it's not a bad movie by any means but it does leave much to be desired.".

It also has comedic elements and it is allegorical. Gabin's Grandgil is rousing and larger than life while Brouvil's Martin is duller and timid. Yet Grandgil is an antihero.

Marcel's job is to take the meat across Paris to a butcher that is going to pay handsomely for the rare commodity. Since the hog that was killed weighed more than a hundred pounds it is almost impossible for Marcel to transfer the valuable cargo to its destination. Outside Jambier's he finds a man that looks strong enough to help him. This man is Grandgil a painter who happens to be in the neighborhood.Grandgil realizing there is a lot of money involved in the deal shames Jambier into giving him more money while Marcel is to get the original share.

Their adventure ends badly when Marcel and Grandgil are found by a German patrol and taken to their headquarters.Claude AutantLara the wonderful French director took a look at those dark days of the German occupation of Paris and turned it into a winning comedy that plays much better than it should because of the strength of the two main characters who come together because the promise of a lucrative deal but who end up becoming friends.

Both actors show why they were the professionals they were in the French cinema. Their collaboration came natural. Mr. Autant Lara gets good performances from his strong cast that included Louis De Funes in a small role Jeannette Batti Georgette Anys and Jacques Martin among them.A must see for fans of the great Claude AutantLara".

Either way he has to be stopped before all hell breaks loose.Much like Rollercoaster a year later TwoMinute Warning is wrongly lumped in with the disaster movie genre that flooded the 1970s and just like Rollercoaster TwoMinute Warning is an excellently taut thriller. The build up is paced to precision all characters are introduced to us to give us something to associate with should things go very wrong. As this is happening we get little POV snippets of our killer accompanied by Charles Fox's harshly impacting music the killer is never seen but we feel the dread the impending sense of murder is a constant presence.Once we are at the game and the authorities are aware that a sniper is on the roof the film shifts up a gear and lays on the suspense thick and heavy. Captain Holly Charlton Heston is joined by the SWAT team led by the cool and serious Sgt. Chris Button John Cassavetes whilst stadium security manager Sam McKeever Martin Balsam prays that disaster can be averted. Then the final third of the picture is a ripperheart pounding stuff a final third that rewards the viewers patience for having invested in the film and its characters. Filling out the cast is Gena Rowlands Jack Klugman brilliant interplay with Mitch Ryan's priest Beau Bridges Walter Pidgeon and David Jansen. TwoMinute Warning is a quality thriller that is sadly undervalued on the IMDb site go on give it a go and you might just be pleasantly surprised. 7.510Footnote I should point out that my thoughts are on the original unedited cut of this film I have never seen the watered down TV cut and have no plans to ever do so.".

TwoMinute Warning is a quality thriller that is sadly undervalued on the IMDb site go on give it a go and you might just be pleasantly surprised. 7.510Footnote I should point out that my thoughts are on the original unedited cut of this film I have never seen the watered down TV cut and have no plans to ever do so.";

	schema:headline " A bleak and cynical yet still gripping thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "A very bleak and cynical 70's allstar cast suspense thriller about a crazed motiveless sniper who for no rationale reason decides to blow away a bunch of spectators in a crowded stadium during a football game. It's up to ramrod police chief Charlton Heston assisted by coldly efficient SWAT team commander John Cassavetes and antsy stadium manager Martin Balsam to stop the mysterious lunatic before it's too late. Among the many folks in jeopardy are Beau Bridges as an unemployed dad who's trying to show his wife Pamela Bellwood and kids a good time David Janssen and Gena Rowlands as a pair of middleaged lovers Jon Korkes as a pathetic jerk whose date with the lovely Marilyn Hassett goes disastrously awry Mitchell Ryan as a gentle priest Walter Pigeon as an elderly pickpocket and Jack Klugman as a hapless compulsive gambler who's bet what little money he has left on the big game.Director Larry Peerce relates the tightly streamlined plot in a fiercely stark and unsentimental manner artfully using subjective camerawork long lenses and high angle shots to stoke the gutwrenching tension to a nervejangling fever pitch. The setup of said suspense tends to be a bit laborious at times and the background exposition on the many secondary characters is likewise a tad extraneous and even a bit tedious too but the final climactic eruption of raw violence and sheer pandemonium the crowd explodes in a frenzied blind panic when the sniper starts shooting them is both gripping and disturbing in comparable measure. But what really gives this film an extra unnerving edge is its bitter cynicism and surprisingly upfront amorality especially when it comes to the frequently brutish tactics used by Cassavetes to nail the sniper. The scene where Cassavetes gives an innocent spectator a severe beatdown and doesn't even apologize to the poor guy afterwards is particularly unpleasant and upsetting. This guy is the iron lung of law enforcement who's portrayed with a wired intensity and seething psychosis by Cassevetes that's genuinely frightening to behold. Whether intended or not it's this nice nihilistic blurring the line between the cops and the sniper which in turn makes TwoMinute Warning a distinctly 70's kind of gritty and absorbing dead serious thriller.".

Black Sunday TwoMinute Warning and Rollercoaster are really the three most believable nowthe disasters are manmade and show us how vulnerable we really are I for one am praying members of terrorists group don't watch the movie Rollercoaster. In TwoMinute Warning a sniper with no apparent motive climbs to the top of an LA football stadium and starts shooting at the twominute warning. It is possible the sniper had political assassination on his mind as the President was scheduled to come to the game. But it's never really explained which bothered many critics including Roger Ebert. But after the events in the DC area in the fall of 2002 which I lived throughI'll never forget having to pace back and forth quickly while pumping gas to avoid being a target snipers are never really understoodthey're psychotic plain and simple. Targets the early Peter Bogdonavich film which TwoMinute Warning reminded me of spent a good part of the movie explaining the alienation of its sniper. To a degreeyou saw his family his interaction with his wife and saw what appeared to be his isolation. It's certainly not a justification for killing innocent motorists but the film did show his face. TwoMinute Warning doesn't even show the face of the sniper until the end. The point of the filmmakers is clear The sniper is unknown and deadly. This movie goes a little overthetop in the gratuitous violence unlike most other '70s disaster movies but is absolutely suspenseful and the acting is very good especially by John Cassavettes as the leader of the SWAT team. Gena Rowlands Cassavettes' wife and muse also appears as a spectator.".

The sniper is a metaphorical cultural surgeon as the film opens with him snuffing out a middleaged cyclist replete in synthetic modern tracksuit the cyclist is of course still chasing after the American dream. An injury burnt ballplayer with vivacious young and demanding girlfriend can be viewed as a dream casualty initially hungry exploiter now almost exhaustively exploited for the purpose of entertainment to which American football occupies one of many sporting dream pinnacles.Jack Klugman is desperately chasing his vision of the dream via high risk stakes gambling with money which is not his own putting his life at risk as he literally tries to get rich whilst almost dying trying. Then we have David Jansen and his girlfriend who are entangled within a tired and respectless relationship with Jansen more interested in running off to Las Vegas for some gambling after he proposes to his beleaguered girlfriend with what in all probability will be a quick and doomed marriage.Archetypal young family guy Beau Bridges heads the prototypical dysfunctional family that decades later would be fodder for The Jerry Springer Show as we witness father chastise his barely long haired youngest son for being wise when the kid rebukes his dad's imposing conservatism with everyone can see in response to being told that his hair is too long. Bridges later attempt at model citizenry by informing the police that there is a sniper in the coliseum backfires on him with the brave boys in blue attempting to cart him off somewhat ambiguously for further questioning do the police believe he may be a suspect in cahoots with the sniper or are they just trying to stop a panic situation too late as by this point the dream culture cleansing has begun with Jansen's girlfriend arbitrarily spared a prolongation of their mutually unsatisfying relationship.The enclosed and insulated television crew media spinning the ballgame with their customary brand of allAmerican labelling as we are all too aware of today their egos quietened as the carnage unfolds reality crashing through their subjectively controlled and packaged vicarious version of reality. An unsuspecting long haired teenager who has clambered up out of the designated seating area makes himself a target of the now twitchy prior hungho swat boys who heavy handedly remove him from his perch upon suspicion of what may be contained within his rucksack triggering fear that he may be the snipers accomplice supplicate topical paranoia. Longhaired young men do not fit the profile as signed up card carrying pursuers of the American dream.Assorted ill reflections upon the dream pop up throughout the picture.

The respectable looking Walter Pidgeon failing to pickpocket the film's singular paid up ballgame viewer to be held in esteem by the filmmakers that of a doctor beguiled by a female onlooker acting as chaperon to an insecure male counterpart who wishes not to be seen in public without requisite female date trappings of his American dream. During the ensuing human crush we witness said doctor saving the life of his new found lady fan clinging to life from a stairwell of white concrete.The sniper's supposed target that of the man who sits atop the American dream never arrives. When the bullets begin raining down on this most veneer thin picture of national conservative pride the true spirit of American humanity bulldozes through in an everyman for himself helterskelter stampede as a supposedly civilised gathering reverts back to the days of the rush for land the gold rush the oil rush the arms rush the space rush the global greed rush of collapse.Little wonder why this film bombed on its theatrical release striking a deep resonant chord within the American psyche. Witness today American's on IMDb's discussion boards label up the film with outraged impotent cries of Utter Crap The picture of themselves reflected back through this now timecapsule piece of effective culture and ideal mirroring.What of Charlton Heston I hear you say well he represents moderate conservatism committed by a sense of duty but willing to provide the trigger happy swat'ers their neccessitation for existence of pumping lead kicks' as a final solution.

	schema:reviewBody "The Seventies was the decade of the disaster film but oddly enough Charlton Heston has never been credit for being King of the genre. We know Heston for his work in big budget spectacles like The Ten Commandments and BenHur but he's probably appeared in more disaster films than any other player.Think about it Heston during the seventies starred in Earthquake Grey Lady Down Skyjacked Airport 75 and this film Two Minute Warning. All of them with a cast of well known players put in harm's way of a terrible act.In this case it's some psycho freak with a rifle with telescopic sight who decides he's going to take out a whole load of people at a championship football game at the Los Angeles Coliseum. As in all disaster films the guessing is as to who among the cast will survive until the end of the movie.We're not sure what the freak's motivation is we do know that as the film opens for target practice he shoots down one of a pair of bicyclers driving past his motel. On some level I really don't care. The time for societal soul searching stops when the bullets begin to fire. After that it's only one thing get him.Charlton Heston is the police captain at the precinct where the Coliseum is located and John Cassavetes is the SWAT commander assigned to kill or capture. By the way it is also shown earlier Cassavetes SWAT team actually taking a suspect alive so it's not that they are just looking for an opportunity to use the weapons.Among the crowd at the football game there are some performances I especially liked one of them being Beau Bridges as a young father out with his family for the game who spots the sniper and tries to warn the already informed police. Also Mitchell Ryan and Jack Klugman have some nice scenes as a priest who happens to be sitting next to a gambling addict who literally has his life riding on the point spread.Two Minute Warning is not the best or worst of the Seventies disaster films. The cast is competent enough a bunch of real professionals without a sour note among them. Terror is real an evil unto itself without reason and Two Minute Warning dramatically drives that point home.".

On some level I really don't care. The time for societal soul searching stops when the bullets begin to fire. After that it's only one thing get him.Charlton Heston is the police captain at the precinct where the Coliseum is located and John Cassavetes is the SWAT commander assigned to kill or capture. By the way it is also shown earlier Cassavetes SWAT team actually taking a suspect alive so it's not that they are just looking for an opportunity to use the weapons.Among the crowd at the football game there are some performances I especially liked one of them being Beau Bridges as a young father out with his family for the game who spots the sniper and tries to warn the already informed police. Also Mitchell Ryan and Jack Klugman have some nice scenes as a priest who happens to be sitting next to a gambling addict who literally has his life riding on the point spread.Two Minute Warning is not the best or worst of the Seventies disaster films. The cast is competent enough a bunch of real professionals without a sour note among them. Terror is real an evil unto itself without reason and Two Minute Warning dramatically drives that point home.";

In fact I was rather relieved when they finally died because whenever they started acting like jerks I thought to myself oh god kill them already!.Which is not going to happen until the end. Then the movie actually takes up some pace. The sniper gets hit quite a few times but that doesn't stop him from shooting more. While others die with a single shot. And what a shot! They look like they got hit by a balloon filled with red color. I've seen better effects even in movies as old as this.Altogether twominute warning has no suspense hardly any action for most of the parts and the ending can't make up for the rest.

And yet the one I replied to is still there all these years later which should tell you something about the peculiar standards of this place. I am submitting it again since I think people should see for themselves that what I wrote back then as a normal response to a leftwing extremist's injection of his personal hatred of Charlton Heston into his review was not the one that merited an abuse report.ORIGINAL 1999 Review.The previous reviewer completely misses the point. The reason why the sniper in Two Minute Warning isn't given any lines or isn't shown to have humanity is because what this man is doing is a crazy psychotic act with no rational purpose to it and that is what makes him a more terrifying threat I can't begin to imagine how watered down the threat would seem if I ever saw the alternate version that made him part of a rational plot and makes the story suspenseful. Only those with a visceral hatred of Charlton Heston because of his offcamera politics would try to read anything else into that it is amusing that Heston has to suffer this from so many liberal reviewers while Hollywood liberals like Paul Newman never have to worry about conservatives reading between the lines of every film they're in.That said Two Minute Warning ultimately is flawed because it does have a less than stellar script when it comes to the supporting characters not very interesting performances from a largely TV cast Jack Klugman David Janssen and also the sense of realism is hurt by the fact that the NFL didn't give permission to use the names of real football teams thus creating too much of a sense of artificialness with people just rooting for a generic Baltimore and Los Angeles. Black Sunday works a lot better in that regard because it made sure to get permission from the NFL and do actual filming during the Super Bowl.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a mostly overlooked film which is actually full of some great suspense and tension. The film has a few flaws but overall it can be recommended as a great little diversion and a chance to spot the star and see who makes it out alive. It almost falls into the disaster category but would probably rather be thought of as a thriller. The plot is simple. A mysterious virtually unseen sniper perches himself above the scoreboard of Los Angeles Memorial Colosseum and readies himself to open fire on a 90000 person crowd. Heston wearing the worst tie in the history of film and Cassavetes attempt to prevent a massacre as the football game approaches the two minute warning. The most major flaw in the film is that due to the refusal of the NFL to allow their names to be used the game is referred to as the Championship rather than the Super Bowl and the teams are generic. If a viewer can get past this oddity the bulk of the film is enjoyable. Sports fan may find it distracting. It helps that authentic commentators Howard Cosell and Don Meredith appear. There's a large cast of '70's stars and almost stars. Most don't get very much time to establish any meaningful characterization but that's often the case in these types of films and one reason why so many known personalities were cast. It's intriguing to see the father of improvisational cinema Cassavetes butting up to the king of 70's action epics Heston. Their styles and characters clash somewhat. Bridges and Bellwood are an average couple with two kids who are feeling the bite of those '70's demons inflation and unemployment. Janssen and Rowlands play a bickering pair whose relationship reaches it's pinnacle right as the sniper decides to have some fun. Stickyfingered Pigeon chose the big day to pick as many pockets as possible. Balsam is the concerned manager of the arena. Klugman hams mercilessly as a desperate gambler with a lot riding on the score of the game. The Other Side of the Mountain 's Hassett discovers the other side of the escalator when the crowd erupts. Bridges has one memorable moment when he is racing to get to his family and is confronted by hoards of panicking people. The film is not a particularly optimistic one. The fact that the sniper is coldly displayed and unexplained only adds to the eeriness of the film. His eventual attacks are surprisingly vivid. The police in this film come off as highly arrogant and ineffectual for the most part. There's a startling brutality and sinister air in some of their scenes. The cynicism continues as we see fleeing people acting downright barbaric to each other. In the aftermath of the WTC attacks nothing was ever reported that would suggest such selfishness. Maybe it was a 70's viewpoint. It's hard to believe that the downbeat musical score is by the man who wrote the TV themes for Love American Style The Love Boat and Wonder Woman! DO NOT under any circumstances sit through the bastardized TV version which is a deadly recut of the film with new cast and scenes. It is tremendously awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "An allstar cast led by Charlton Heston with likes of John Cassavetes Martin Balsam Beau Bridges Mitchell Ryan and Jack Klugman feature in this well directed but thinly written semidisaster fare that never goes beyond its onedimensional framework. Its central focus follows that of an unknown sniper planning a massacre at a championship football game at the Los Angeles Coliseum as the coming and going personal dramas of certain people at the game intertwine. Slow to get going and rather onenote in its dramas never being as interesting as it should have been but it opens up when the SWAT team enters and the sniper finally let's loose for a thrilling final third. As the joy and excitement of the match transforms into confusion and anxiety where the stadium turns into a shooting pallor. I've read some people complaining about a lack of a motivation for the killer but really one wasn't needed and the ambiguous nature only made its frenetic climax more effective. For most part it's a waiting game preying upon the inevitable buildup even though the authorities know about the sniper they don't want to start a panic of hysteria. So it's a scary idea exploitatively handled and director Larry Peerce creates a large scale look giving it an intense scope. The performances are stalwart but no one really makes much of an impression.Lets not get too nervous about it. ".

	schema:headline " Very surreal and a different spin on the seventies disaster film";
	schema:reviewBody "There can be a lot of bad said about 'Two Minute Warning' but you have to give it a lot of kudos for it's style and it's very surreal tone which speaks more loudly than ever to us now than it probably did thirty years ago. This film could be classified in a number of genres but ultimately it fits into a very distinct classification of films that were enormously popular in the seventies and that is the disaster film. Although a very different type of situation it still follows the close recipe for the disaster film by showing several different characters and their lives before during and after the cataclysmic event which in this case is a rogue sniper. The problem that many have with this film and I do understand where they are coming from is that these characters don't have a lot of depth despite the various stars and talent in the film. The makers of the film use far too many characters instead of focusing on one or two of them to make an impact. The story fortunately focuses more on the police and their actions in taking out this sniper. I have read that there is an alternative version of this film that involves some sort of robbery that explains the sniper but I think that entire idea would ruin this film because part of the intensity and surreal nature is that we don't know why this sniper is doing this or even if there is a reason...it's an act of random violence.Charlton Heston sort of leads the cast as Captain Peter Holly. He doesn't seem to be his larger than life screen capturing loud self in this role. It feels back seat even when he does come onto the scene. His performance is not nearly what Heston is capable of but he does up the ante of the cast for sure. Beau Bridges is the unemployed Dad who is one of the only spectators to discover what is going on. Bridges is an outstanding actor and he still stands out in this role given the little he has to work with. John Cassavetes is the head strong leader of the SWAT team sent in to remove the sniper. Given better writing his character could have really been good but they don't give him a lot either. David Janssen is one of the more interesting characters and he does a good job as the grouchy sarcastic business man and he's one of the only characters you actually become attached to. Jack Klugman also gives a pretty decent performance given the sub par character development. Gena Rowlands Brock Peters David Groh Mitch Ryan and Martin Balsam all play different characters with different problems and things going on around them and they are all terrific actors but the script doesn't give them anything to work with unfortunately.Despite the lack of character development the film really does still hold it's own with a lot of suspense and a great build up the actual disaster. The story itself is well written and would have done better without focusing on any of the characters in the crowd and just focused on the sniper and the team trying to stop him. I don't think any suspension of belief is required to believe he could perch himself up there during a championship football game because it happens...it happens every day. Regardless of the issues with the film it still makes for a great suspense film and a good Sunday Afternoon classic. It has it's moments and still widens your eyes to see something horrible like this happen. 710".

	schema:headline " Great premise cheap cheesy execution";
	schema:reviewBody "TwoMinute Warning is one of those films that has a great premise91000 people gathered at the L.A. Coliseum are terrorized by an anonymous sniper during a championship football gamethat is undone by one of the stupidest most incompetent scripts in the history of motion pictures.  Add to that the fact that the filmmakers spared every expense possible in telling the story and you have a cheap cheesy film that has to rank as one of the most disappointing films of the 1970's.How incompetent is it?  How about this for a setup  on Super Bowl Sunday or Championship X as its referred to in the film a sniper guns down a bicyclist from a nearby hotel then escapes to the Coliseum where he hides out in the belltower for the game to start and evidently to start shooting. How does he get in?  He simply breaks open a couple of locks feeds the guard dogs some hamburger and climbs the ladder into the tower.  There is no security no police no media nobody around except one maintenance man the morning of the biggest football game of the year.  Now I was 13 in 1976 and I can tell you security was a concern even then.  There is simply no possible way anyone could enter a facility that easily on such an important day.  Then there's the flimsy cast of characters  Charlton Heston as the police chief John Cassavetes the SWAT leader Martin Balsam the coliseum manager Beau Bridges a father of two bratty boys Pamela Bellwood as his wife Marilyn Hassett as a college coed David Janssen a car salesman and Gena Rowlands his girlfriend Jack Klugman a sleazy gambler Walter Pidgeon a sleazy pickpocket and David Groh as a doctor who hits on the coed.  There is no need to describe the characters any more because that is all there is to any of their personalities.  These stereotypical cardboard cutouts are so onedimensional they resemble nothing more than ducks in a shooting gallery which in effect is all they are anyway.And how about the ridiculous plot?  When the sniper is finally seen and the police called the wheels really start to turn with the main conflict between the straightlaced captain and the flaky SWAT leader.  The SWAT leader wants to put sharpshooters in the light towers without 91000 people or the sniper noticing.  The captain's plan?  Evacuate the coliseum without the sniper noticing.  They finally agree to man the light towers but to wait until the twominute warning until any action is taken.  Why? Because the sniper obviously wants to wait to see who wins the game before opening fire!Honestly the movie goes downhill from there.  I can suspend disbelief up to a point.  But this is the type of flick where a man can be shot and left dangling behind a thousand people and no one notices for five minutes.  Or that the nosy father can see the sniper he's evidently the only one in the stadium with eyes and go to alert the police but tell his wife and kids to stay in their seats in the line of fire so he can find them later.  Or that the maintenance man can be knocked off a fortyfoot ladder in full view of the crowd and not be seen by anyone but the policemen.  Or that Well you get the idea.  Then there's the annoying fact that the filmmakers were obviously too cheap to pay the NFL for use of their football uniforms and the Super Bowl logo so we have the dubiously named Championship X between Los Angeles and Baltimore but not the Rams and the Colts as they were known back then. Since 1977's Black Sunday which was also set partially at the Super Bowl actually used the name Super Bowl and real teams I have to believe money and not the NFL were behind the decision not to use the name.  And instead of paying for a topnotch recording star to sing the National Anthem here we get Merv Griffin! warbling the anthem in one of the most laughable scenes in modern movie history.And let's not even discuss the acting suffice it to say that a lot of talented actors are wasted in roles that they took obviously to pay the bills until something better came along.  And the direction is just pitiful. Can I nominate Larry Peerce whose filmography includes such classic stinkers as A Separate Peace The Sporting Club Why Would I Lie and Wired the John Belushi biopic that ruined the careers of everybody involved as second worst director of all time right behind Ed Wood?  In two hours he establishes no mood no style no urgency and no suspense whatsoever.  And the miserable script by Ed Hume deserves placement alongside Eric Roth's The ConcordeAirport '79 as the single worst piece of film writing of all time.Incidentally when NBC bought broadcasting rights to Two Minute Warning it must have been sight unseen because by the time they cut the violence and profanity out only about 80 of 115 minutes remained so they reshot the film adding an hour of new footage in which the sniper went from an anonymous threat to a decoy for a jewelry heist next door which simply made things even more ludicrous.  After it's initial threehour showing the film was cut back to two hours with most of the new footage left intact but only about 30 original minutes left mostly with Chuck Heston and Cassavetes as the only original cast members left with any screen time.  However all of the names were left in the opening credits even though Hassett and Pidgeon were completely cut out of the film and the other supporting characters reduced to cameos.  Which should serve as a further indicator of how bad this film really is.  So consider yourself warned and proceed at your own risk.  And let's depart with this classic exchange of dialog  Coed to doctor  Are you a doctor? Doctor surprised  Yes I am.  How did you know?  Coed  Dirty shoes. Nice clean hands.  Only a doctor would have hands that clean.  Or another Coed  I hate football.  Doctor  I do too.  Coed  Well then why did you come?  Doctor  To meet you! Coed giggles uncontrollably.  Viewer runs screaming from room.   out of ".

Eventually after a LONG time the LA SWAT team makes its way to the game. You would think that a couple of highly trained police snipers could take the mad gunman out with a shot or two right? Well you would be wrong! There is actually a scene where the SWAT team member has his sniper scope trained on the gunman. What happens? The gunman sets up his gun picks out a target in the crowd aims and shoots the football fan. The SWAT team member never even attempts to shoot the sniper. Why? I have no idea whatsoever.This movie continues in this inane fashion. It attempts to make some sort of statement at the end but falls flat. One of the sloppiest and insulting movies ever made.".

Well you would be wrong! There is actually a scene where the SWAT team member has his sniper scope trained on the gunman. What happens? The gunman sets up his gun picks out a target in the crowd aims and shoots the football fan. The SWAT team member never even attempts to shoot the sniper. Why? I have no idea whatsoever.This movie continues in this inane fashion. It attempts to make some sort of statement at the end but falls flat. One of the sloppiest and insulting movies ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Two Minute Warning  out of  qualifies as a thoroughly pedestrian police potboiler about a mad sniper who holes up behind the scoreboard at the Los Angeles Coliseum during a championship football game crunches on a candy bar and patiently bides his time until the title climax. Arguably the best part of this contrived clunker is the last 30 minutes. Director Larry Peerce who went on the helm more television shows than movies spends the first 90 minutes introducing us to the sniper as a random shooter ensconced in a highrise hotel that kills a college professor Tommy J. Huff on a bicycle. Afterward Peerce alternates between pointofview shots from the sniper's perspective and a motley crosssection of the sniper's potential targets as they file into the stands to watch the game. Unfortunately most of these characters aren't sympathetic. First Stu Sandman Odd Couple TV star Jack Klugman plays an obnoxious gambler down on his luck who needs for his team to win or the mob will kill him. Earlier they dangled him by his heels from the balcony of their hotel room. Second Beau Bridges is a snotty outofwork father with two bratty kids and a longsuffering wife. David Janssen of the TV classic The Fugitive is cast as Steve an arrogant outoftown car dealer who cannot stand his clingy girlfriend Janet Gena Rowlands of Gloria who wants to marry him. Former MGM leading man Walter Pigeon plays a pickpocket who has a field day putting his paws into other people's pockets. Of all the potential targets we learn the least about Pigeon's generically named 'Pickpocket.' Of all the targets the most interesting is a trio of fans Lucy Marilyn Hassettshe starred in Larry Peerce's My Side of the Mountain made before the Two Minute Warning and My Side of the Mountain Pt 2 made after the Two Minute Warning and later married Peerce Jeffrey Jon Korkes who appears to be her nominal date after her roommate stood him up and Al David Groh of TV's Rhonda the curlyhaired guy who sits on the other side of them and attracts Lucy's attention.The chief problem with the Two Minute Warning is the lack of characterization. Charlton Heston's police captain is a nonentity and John Cassavetes is just a nudge or two away from being just as onedimensional. Cassavetes gets the best dialogue in a concluding commentary about how the media will treat the sniper. This movie would have been a lot better if they had given the heroes and the villain some kind of personality. Around 53 minutes into the action the Goodyear blimp spots the sniper and Captain Peter Holly Charlton Heston finally gets off his butt and eyeballs the problem. When a disgruntled stadium employee Brook Peters of Ace High tries to enter the bunkerlike station behind the electronic scoreboard the killer strikes him with the butt of his automatic weapon and sends him falling to his death 60 feet below. Now Capt. Holly calls in the S.W.A.T. team headed up by Sergeant Button John Cassavetes of The Dirty Dozen. Holly wants to wait until the last minute to take out the sniper while Button complains that the longer that they wait the worst the situation will become.Others here in this comment section have already commented on the irony of future NRA President Charlton Heston clamoring for restraint while liberalminded actor Cassavetes plays a triggerhappy cop.Once the shooting starts the Two Minute Warning turns into a minidisaster epic as the crowd of between 90 and 100thousand fans panic and scramble for the exits. Of course our heroes ice the sniper but learn little more than his name. Talk about an interesting trivia question what was the sniper's name? The Two Minute Warning lost money and later he was reedited by nervous television executives who felt the theatrical version did itself in because of its murderous sniper character. Gee guess none of those guys ever saw Peter Bogdanovich's Targets 1968 or Don Siegel's Dirty Harry 1971. Mind you sniper movies go back at least as far as the 1952 Edward Dmytryk movie The Sniper. Peerce generates moderate suspense but you won't be sitting on the edge of your seat. Instead you'll be juggling your remote control trying to decide whether to fastforward. Oh yeah the sniper's name is Carl Cook and he is a transient. Our heroes never learn his motives. Incidentally softcore porn director Andy Sidaris plays the TV sports director and his assistant is none other than future sports movie director Ron Shelton. Another major complaint is with the game itself. It's hard to keep the teams straight especially because they are fictional teams and their uniforms bear no markings. About the only use for this movie is as a time capsule. Nobody who pull off what the sniper did in the opening scenes especially with his jacket that was modified to conceal the various components of his rifle. A better version of this movie appeared a year later in 1977 with a terrorist attack on the Super Bowl in director John Frankenheimer's Black Sunday.".

	schema:reviewBody "In more ways than one TwoMinute Warning is very reminiscent to that other 70's movie Rollercoaster. They're both quite obscure in spite of the famous names involved they both qualify as paranoid disaster movies and they both could and should have done more with their potentially brilliant basic plot outlines. I use the terms paranoid thriller and disaster movie to describe these films because they are mixtures of both. In paranoid thrillers a psychopath usually selects random innocent targets to agonize and in disaster movies large masses of people suddenly find themselves trapped or in great inescapable danger. Two Minute Warning is a nearly perfect amalgam with its premise of a lone sniper  whose motivations and even his face remain unknown throughout the film  hiding in the scoreboard tower of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during the football championship finale when the stadium is at its full 91.000 maximum capacity. His motivations may be unknown but the stone cold and brutal opening sequence in which the shooter target practices against an innocent man on a bicycle already manifested that he's merciless and extremely dangerous. When a TVcamera spots the sniper in his hideout a largescaled police operation unfolds behinds the scenes of the ongoing football game with police Captain Peter Holly Charlton Heston preferring to wait and SWAT commander Burton John Cassavetes insisting on prompt action. Overall I would say that the suggestive power and ideas behind Two Minute Warning are far more disturbing and nightmarish than the actual execution. But perhaps it's also better this way because the actuality of the subject could still cause largescaled mass hysteria even nowadays. Strictly talking in terms of cinematic value TwoMinute Warning nevertheless benefices from a very powerful first half hour and an astonishingly tense climax. Apart from the aforementioned target practice sequence the opening contains many more sequences that literally ooze with suspense. For example the scenes in which the sniper observes the crowd through the telescopic lens of his rifle and occasionally stops to zoom in on a potential victim are literally nervewrecking. The POV camera angle increases the intensity and this sniper just happens to be crazy enough to shoot anyone and thus the level of tension remains quite high. The finale last 15 to 20 minutes or so are sheer disaster movie genius with devastating images of chaotic escaping attempts and unsettling footage of people getting overrun on their turbulent journey to the emergency exits. These massively staged sequences obviously aren't pleasant to look at but you simply have to admire any film that mobilized such large crowds of people. The middle section is slightly overlong and drags in places as it particularly focuses on the police interactions and the slightly more detailed introduction of a handful of football fans in the stadium. The script focuses on certain people like a bickering elderly couple a family of four a man with huge gambling debts and a woman openly flirting with the man in the seat next to her but we don't really get to know them. These short interludes might have worked very effectively in the novel TwoMinute Warning adapted from a novel by George La Fontaine Sr. but in a film they merely just serve to fill up some time. The violence like the impact of the rifle shots is quite harsh and shocking. The acting performances are decent but certainly not outstanding with routine roles for disaster movie veteran Charlton Heston Earthquake Skyjacked Martin Balsam Psycho Beau Bridges David Janssen and Jack Klugman. Recommended in a double feature with the aforementioned Rollercoaster perhaps but for genuine disaster movies check out The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure and for genuine paranoid thrillers check out the first Dirty Harry also with a sniper.".

I was not present when this happened but a gunman came into my church and killed 6 or 7 people before killing himself.

	schema:reviewBody "TwoMinute Warning is a good enjoyable thriller made in the style of the popular disaster film cycle of the 1970's with a large cast of familiar faces playing characters with their own little stories. Many of them however take a back seat to the action in this story based on a novel by George LaFountaine about a sniper spotted above the scoreboard in L.A. Coliseum during a championship football game. The cops can't be sure of who this person is targeting and have to figure out how best to approach the situation. It's only towards the end in the last half hour when the action really gets cranked up the stakes are raised and things get pretty violent. One nice element of mystery is that we never get that good a look at this sniper Warren Miller we learn his name at the end but little else about him although one of the characters believes that information will come out soon enough. People can take issue with the inefficient security at this place or the fact that the cops are most often not too effective here but the movie is basically decently made entertainment with a very good music score by Charles Fox. Some of the actors get a good showcase Charlton Heston as takecharge police captain Peter Holly John Cassavetes as S.W.A.T. team commander Sgt. Button Martin Balsam as stadium security head Sam McKeever Beau Bridges as family man Mike Ramsay Jack Klugman as shameless gambler Sandman and David Janssen  Gena Rowlands as argumentative couple Steve  Janet. Other familiar faces and prominent character players in the cast include Brock Peters David Groh Mitch Ryan reallife football star Joe Kapp Robert Ginty Tom Bower Carmen Argenziano Michael Gregory and Harry Northup. Unfortunately the great Walter Pidgeon is wasted as an elderly pickpocket. Filmmaker Andy Sidaris Stacey Malibu Express etc. plays the TV director and TV personality Merv Griffin sings the national anthem! A sufficient amount of tension and excitement is created the aerial photography is very good and the visceral quality of the movie is undeniable things get effectively bloody before the movie ends. There's even a touch of grim irony to the proceedings. The climactic action is both gripping and frightening showing how bad things can get when a lot of people are in a panic. Overall this movie is a decent diversion if not terribly substantial and keeps from ever getting boring. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:text "    The film is about two teenage girls Behiye and Handan with contrasting characteristics and backgrounds forming a close relationship with sexual implications. As they become closer and closer the relationship becomes more fragile and the impossibility of the survival of their relationship becomes more evident over time. Economic social psychological and sexual problems come in the way. Behiye is angry and rebellious but her frequent outbursts cut little ice with her conservative family. Handan is trapped in a different way in a lovehate relationship with her single mother Leman. Although Leman is willing to turn tricks to raise Handan's college fees she's otherwise hopeless with both men and money. When a mutual friend introduces Behiye and Handan they immediately hit it off and despite the differences in their backgrounds they embark on an intense relationship and with it a secret plan to escape their dysfunctional families.";

Although the finale is nothing like something out of a fairy tale with a perfect ending it definitely makes a mark and proves its point the emancipation of women and how stereotypes stigmas and even physical and psychological pressure and abuse cannot repress inner strength and joie de vivre as one could say.I thought the movie was brilliantly interpreted and the comic references were certainly well put forward by both the director and the actresses.

Having said this if your idea of life is soccer and drinking booze this is not a film for you. For the other lesser beings such as myself I would like to add that this is one of those rare films we see in the world today that will change one's life.

You may find my reaction over the top but for someone who loves movies and has to see again and again simply bad films in Turkey finally a breath of fresh air. Kutlug Ataman is arguably the best film director of Turkey today. What is really refreshing about him and his films is that he seems to make his films for the Turkish public in mind and not foreign film festivals. Having said that this film should interest any audiences around the world. A real and huge step forward for cinema. Sorry guys you may say you have not liked the film but the two times that I went to see the film in Ankara I have seen some of you trying to hide you tears. Good for you! Time to grow up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Growing up I eagerly saw each new Truffaut film when it opened in the United States. This one had the biggest impact on me of all.It's interesting seeing the dichotomy in the reviews here about half call the film melodramatic pointless and dull. The other half find it beautiful touching even a masterpiece.The flaws are easy to pick out. Leaud is awfully lowkey to the point of blandness and the thankfully few English language scenes clearly suffer from Truffaut's unfamiliarity with the language  he failed to catch some really bad English line readings.But the narration totally works for me giving the film the tempus fugit feel of a great nineteenth century novel. The purposefully rushed monotone narration keeps the story from becoming overly sentimental. The voiceover sounds like the cold wind of Fate sweeping the characters through the years from naive youth to the disillusionment of early middle age.I think one's response to the film has a lot to do with one's own nature if you have loved passionately and experienced serious heartbreak you may really GET this movie. If you're a cynical hipster who is simply embarrassed by passion romantic love and strong emotions it's not for you. This is a highly emotional film for highly emotional viewers.Muriel's letter scene will divide these two groups of viewers. Some posters here call it laughable and ridiculous perhaps because they're sexually immature or repressed so the topic of masturbation automatically gives them the giggles. To me this scene is heartbreaking when you realize this poor young woman's guilt over masturbating has warped her life and spoiled her chances for happiness. It shows how a small misunderstanding or character flaw can lead to loneliness or lifelong unhappiness.This film affects me more strongly than the more famous and acclaimed JULES ET JIM where the characters' actions strike me as more peculiar and clinical than moving. But that's just me.Few films give such a strong sense of time passing as this one and life running through the hourglass as we poor human beings bumble blunder and suffer as we search for love.The final scene of an aging Leaud walking through a changed Paris he hardly recognizes as the city of his youth is unforgettable justifying the movie's length. With a shorter running time the film could never give you such a sense of time passing characters growing changing and missing chances for happiness.For those who respond to it this is one of the most beautiful affecting films of the 1970s.".

	schema:reviewBody "The actor JeanPierre Leaud the child star of Truffaut's breakthrough '400 Blows' and who plays the protagonist Claude in 'Deux Anglaises et le Continent' symbolises the flawed and tender charm at the heart of this 1971 film. Leaud can't act. Nevertheless by dint of his solemn Gallic charm and beauty there is something deeply moving about this turnofthe century crossChannel menageatrois. The story is an adaptation of a novel by Truffaut's beloved author Henri Pierre Roche who also wrote the novel which inspired 'Jules et Jim'. 'Deux Anglaises et le Continent' is written in diary form from the points of view of three characters Anne Muriel and Claude who make up the narrative's central love triangle. The story is basically one of thwarted love. Both English sisters develop strong feelings for their French 'brother' Claude which eventually turns into destructive sexual passion. As such the film is an inversion of 'Jules et Jim' which was a comic celebration of love between two close male friends and one girl. Stories of doomed love appealed to Truffaut.When it appeared in cinemas the film was a critical and commercial flop. In '71 society was in the grip of sexual liberation and here was Truffaut who had reflected the zeitgeist so perfectly six years earlier with a whimsical celebration of liberated passion in 'Jules et Jim' serving up a period piece more reminiscent of the buttonedup prudery of a Bronte novel.There are many things wrong with the film. There is an odd tension between the acceptance of Claude's promiscuity as a French fait accompli on the one hand and the sisters' chaste Victorian values on the other. The film also contains anachronisms throughout which it's fun to spot including modern electricity pylons. The first half of the film is set in Wales but you can tell it was filmed in Normandy Truffaut didn't want to travel to a nonFrench speaking location. There are several scenes in English in which the dialogue makes you squirm. And in my opinion it was an error of judgement on the film maker's part to record the voiceover narration himself in such a hasty lacklustre tone. And yet and yet... There is something moving and wonderful at the heart of this film because it is naive. When it was made society had moved on and women were taking the pill and changing history the last thing it wanted was a pastel moodpiece about two thirty yearold virgins. But there is an innocence at the film's heart which is not sentimental but you could call it very male. On the one side you have Leaud's truly shocking moments of ham acting stilted dialogue unbelievable period settings and a generally plodding tone but in the balance these are outweighed by the beauty of the cinematography the fine performances from Kika Markham and Stacey Tendeter the music and Truffaut's genuine feeling for the intricacies of love in all its colours.".

	schema:reviewBody "A mildly moving inoffensive Truffaut movie about a young French bloke played by Truffaut regular JeanPierre Laud far more remarkable in movies such as Les Quatrecent Coups who in turn romances two English or rather Welsh! sisters set during the first decade of the 20th century. It's a French movie and features a love triangle so that for a start could have turned it into a potentially unoriginal and clichridden affair. Yet the main problem I had with it wasn't so much the welltreaded theme of the love triangle as the voiceover which somehow gave the feeling the narrative was rather weak and I suspect it was. The characters of the two sisters especially the older sister were surprisingly better drawn than the male lead's or maybe it just had something to do with the fact the two actresses playing them were more appealing than the inexpressive boyish Laud  I simply could not bring myself to believe that these two girls would both feel so attracted to such a bland young man! He was definitely more engaging as Antoine Doinel!. The movie was also successful at portraying something of the difficulty in relations between the sexes in the Edwardian era  how young men and women really needed to go clandestine if they hoped to even get to know each other decently not just carnally but also emotionally. The issue of women's sexuality and how it was virtually denied them in this epoch  the price to be paid for socalled respectability  is also a theme that's successfully conveyed by the movie. How could a woman rightfully claim her own sexual identity in such a day and age? An interesting question worth raising. Fortunately we were spared any simplistic clichs contrasting libertine France vs. straitlaced Britain as well.This is on the whole also a goodlooking movie with lovely sets costumes and photography. One question why does everyone in the movie including the title keep referring to the two sisters as English when they live in Wales and define themselves as Welsh?".

Notwithstanding Truffaut's corpus is remarkable as one of the most astonishingly beautiful works of his century.Truffaut's cinema is the complement and the result of a very particular and highly differentiated worldview. In a genuine and authentic way he was aware of his singularity. One of his aimsor rather of his meansof his deliberate meanswas to tell dirty things in an ingenuous naive and gentlemanly way.Truffaut used stylized narrative forms to explore the substratum of the couple relations. He did this in even a more deliberate way than the movie authors he promoted in the '50s. Yet his approach is not a spoofing one his exoticism isn't mockexoticism it is related to some ancient forms of the French culture to some metarealist traditions. To a certain Renoir the one that didn't pretend to be naturalistic or Zolist but who crafted exquisite divertissements. It's not that Truffaut's picturesque is a fake one it is strictly subordinated.In Truffaut's case a quite peculiar worldview got the chance of a full direct expression. What is this quality of Truffaut?What is the gist of Truffaut's art?Some have expressed it in indirect or inappropriate or even hostile waythey felt that particular quality yet their perception is clumsily or inimically expressedso with Antonioni who disliked Truffaut's softness and tenderness and feminineness if one might say so.Mrs. Deneuve who was Truffaut's mistress they had no children together spoke about Truffaut's feminine side or perception. I do not think this is properly expressed.What needs to be indicated is his delicacy subtlety freshness fineness gentleness mildness and his frank tactfulness.His subtle smooth irony his civilized polished and indiscreet humor his highly humane quality in exposing and defining in artistic terms the secret substratum of the human relations of the desire and of the loneliness and alienationwith a sense of the piquant. As in JJ whose declared complement it is this approach helps enables Truffaut to narrate with due smoothness and finesse a disturbing and twisted story. The same shamelessness the same suavity.Truffaut has a very cute topic for his moviethe feminine masturbation and a dose of lesbianism at the little girls needless to say that such things are still strictly taboo for most of the mainstream cinema then the defloration.As some other Truffaut films TEG  contains some piquant nudity and sexuality.A word about the beauty of Truffaut's actorsa beauty that is generally mild and unobtrusive and discreetyet very physical and subtly sensual and bodily JeanPierre LaudKika MarkhamStacey TendeterMarie Mansart. One more thing to be spoken ofthis one is a period movieand consequently there is a fair amount of a certain colorist instinct joy and gustothat I will leave the pleasure to my fair reader to discover for himherself. Truffaut flirted here somehow with a certain trend of aestheticism and stylization that are customary in the period films. One can perceive the trepidation of the erotography of the epochthe interest for this kind of literary production. On the other hand Truffaut's huge interest in making such period films is the pendant and the complement of his studious love for a certain class of literature. Truffaut was one knows it such a good reader . On the other handwhen he adapted a book that book was never a mere pretext on the contraryit was the hallmark. Truffaut adapted only things that he respected. One sees that is not true about say Welles or Hitchcockwho go beyond the literary pretext Truffaut reveres the book he deepens it he remains true to it.The beauty of the main actors the finesse the writer loved by Truffaut the twisted content the indiscreet topic of masturbation and bodily life the hidden substratum the tactfulnessI hope my fair readers will give this very fine movie the esteem it deserves. Truffaut's stylizations are strictly functional they are never vain useless decorations they wholly belong to the style and are directed towards the movie's meaning and are fully adequate.Truffaut is as true as authentic as he is smooth and elegant. Through the stylistics of the social life he reached the stylistics of the inner life.I would include Two English Girls and the Continent in a list of Truffaut's best tenor maybe even five!movieswith Jules et Jim 1962 The Soft Skin Mississippi Mermaid Vivement Dimanche! 1983 .".

The same shamelessness the same suavity.Truffaut has a very cute topic for his moviethe feminine masturbation and a dose of lesbianism at the little girls needless to say that such things are still strictly taboo for most of the mainstream cinema then the defloration.As some other Truffaut films TEG  contains some piquant nudity and sexuality.A word about the beauty of Truffaut's actorsa beauty that is generally mild and unobtrusive and discreetyet very physical and subtly sensual and bodily JeanPierre LaudKika MarkhamStacey TendeterMarie Mansart. One more thing to be spoken ofthis one is a period movieand consequently there is a fair amount of a certain colorist instinct joy and gustothat I will leave the pleasure to my fair reader to discover for himherself. Truffaut flirted here somehow with a certain trend of aestheticism and stylization that are customary in the period films. One can perceive the trepidation of the erotography of the epochthe interest for this kind of literary production. On the other hand Truffaut's huge interest in making such period films is the pendant and the complement of his studious love for a certain class of literature. Truffaut was one knows it such a good reader . On the other handwhen he adapted a book that book was never a mere pretext on the contraryit was the hallmark. Truffaut adapted only things that he respected. One sees that is not true about say Welles or Hitchcockwho go beyond the literary pretext Truffaut reveres the book he deepens it he remains true to it.The beauty of the main actors the finesse the writer loved by Truffaut the twisted content the indiscreet topic of masturbation and bodily life the hidden substratum the tactfulnessI hope my fair readers will give this very fine movie the esteem it deserves. Truffaut's stylizations are strictly functional they are never vain useless decorations they wholly belong to the style and are directed towards the movie's meaning and are fully adequate.Truffaut is as true as authentic as he is smooth and elegant. Through the stylistics of the social life he reached the stylistics of the inner life.I would include Two English Girls and the Continent in a list of Truffaut's best tenor maybe even five!movieswith Jules et Jim 1962 The Soft Skin Mississippi Mermaid Vivement Dimanche! 1983 .";

The story tells how time and again love is thwarted or suppressedby Anne's feeling of inferiority in comparison with her sister by Muriel's secret puritan guilt by Claude's self absorption and by his interfering mother.Another weakness of the movie is the portrayal of Claude by JeanPierre Leaud. Given what should have been a profoundly moving story he is surprisingly inexpressive and in appearance he could be any young man walking down a street in Paris todaynot the Paris of 1900.One of the great strengths of the movie is the wonderful cinematography by Nestor Almendros including interior shots of the girls' house in Wales the panoramas of the landscape in Normandy which was intended to stand in for Wales the view of the retreating land from a moving train and the tracking shot of Anne moving through the forest as seen from a lake in Switzerland.All in all a very good movie.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on a novel. This is a very important fact. The opening credits show us the novel presumably so that we will all know what a book looks like. To emphasise the fact that this is a movie based on a novel there is lots of narrative voiceover. The voiceover is helpful for those of us who cannot see the screen. It describes what is going on on screen and it also describes what is going on in the characters' minds presumably because for some reason the director has no other means of letting us know what is going on in their minds. And the voiceover is rather tedious just like the way I'm writing this is tedious. No seriously it's awful. The French guy is staying with the two English girls and their mother and as the camera shows us 1 French guy 1 English girl and 1 mother at dinner plus 1 empty chair the voiceover tells us the other English girl isn't there. We watch them eat in silence. The voiceover tells us they ate in silence. It got to the stage where the voiceover said something about them out for a walk coming to a rushing torrent. My own personal voiceover said If I see a rushing torrent in the next two seconds I'm out of here. Bingo! Of course this all wouldn't be so bad if the story itself was particularly interesting but as judicious use of the fastforward button made clear it's just your standard tedious French drivel that claims to have the last word about human relationships. Some movie adaptations you can dismiss as better off just reading the book but with this one you're better off reading a book on a different topic by a different author. Note added later I subsequently have seen a couple of Eric Rohmer films and didn't like those either! So I concede that there's a particular type of movie that I hate the French philosophical relationships movie.".

It describes what is going on on screen and it also describes what is going on in the characters' minds presumably because for some reason the director has no other means of letting us know what is going on in their minds. And the voiceover is rather tedious just like the way I'm writing this is tedious. No seriously it's awful. The French guy is staying with the two English girls and their mother and as the camera shows us 1 French guy 1 English girl and 1 mother at dinner plus 1 empty chair the voiceover tells us the other English girl isn't there. We watch them eat in silence. The voiceover tells us they ate in silence. It got to the stage where the voiceover said something about them out for a walk coming to a rushing torrent. My own personal voiceover said If I see a rushing torrent in the next two seconds I'm out of here. Bingo! Of course this all wouldn't be so bad if the story itself was particularly interesting but as judicious use of the fastforward button made clear it's just your standard tedious French drivel that claims to have the last word about human relationships. Some movie adaptations you can dismiss as better off just reading the book but with this one you're better off reading a book on a different topic by a different author. Note added later I subsequently have seen a couple of Eric Rohmer films and didn't like those either! So I concede that there's a particular type of movie that I hate the French philosophical relationships movie.";

The lead actors are the same and Dieter Prttel is back as director too but they made a couple changes for the story. This time there is no so much dressing up as other characters and nobody realizes who they really are. Instead they include a real crime story with our two heroes running into a bunch of scary professional criminals from start to finish of this 92minute movie. With this runtime it is also roughly 10 minutes longer than the previous installments. The good thing is that this film has not gotten any worse in terms of quality compared to the previous films. But this is really only because this franchise was already fairly unfunny from the first film. So nothing changed to the positive. Despite the inclusion of more dramatic elements this can really be only seen as 100 comedy still and yes even despite a torture scene with the comments coming from Tommy and Mike during that scene but it is not a funny comedy. Familiar faces include Gottschalk's wife Thea Jrgen von der Lippe Jochen Busse and Hans Werner Olm. And just like these Gottschalk and Krger have their strengths certainly in other areas than acting.

In my opinion the authors of said reviews were obviously looking for a stereotypical romantic comedy storyline. That's not what this film offers. Instead it takes a more realistic approach to the relationships between its main characters. An approach that is roundabout and does not offer the quick rewards of a Nora Ephron instarelationship try You've Got Mail if that's what you're looking fortypical romantic comedy but with panache.A major point of 'Til There Was You is to show how intricately interwoven people's lives are without them even knowing it echos of It's a Wonderful Life anyone? This means backstory and tangents. Everything from names to people restaurants TV shows buildingsthey all relate to each other. Thus you can be intimately connected to someone without ever meeting them. Or as this movie proves you can be intimately connected and meet someone after MANY years and THEN realize how intimately connected you've been all along.In the case of Gwen and Nick they know the same people eat in the same restaurants frequent the same buildings etc. but they've never had a conversation and they don't know each other's names. That type of interaction is so intrinsically real that I personally can't help but be enchanted by the carefully constructed scenes. Of course it can be difficult to piece everything together which cuts down on the instant reward of an easy to follow storyline that being another reason I believe critics didn't like itit takes more than one viewing to really catch all of the details. But honestly most of the greatest artistic works can't possibly be comprehended in one sitting if you feel you can pull out every subtle fluctuation of every word in an Emily Dickinson poem by reading it once you must have missed something...If you invest enough time and attention in this film THEN I think you'll see how wonderful it actually is.

	schema:reviewBody "The people panning this movie  do they even LOOK at the assembly line derivative crap crap crap movies Hollywood puts out year after year? No one should pan this movie who has gone to any derivative movie in the last 20 years.This movie stacks up just fine against many of the light romantic movies of say the Jean Arthur or Clark Gable or Spencer Tracy days or even some of Kate Hepburn's. I tried to watch Adam's Rib last week and it was just PAINFUL dialog and stage acting. Let's all act like we are acting!Most of the writing and acting in those black and white movies was every bit as cheesy as in this gentle film. And let's not even get into film noir and its cheesiness. Or vampire movies or coming of age movies in particular. No Sarah Jessica Parker couldn't act her way out of a thin paper bag  then or now. Yes Jean Tripplehorn was miscast and her pratfalls should have been edited out. Dylan McDermott I thought was cast well and performed well and HIS character was quite sympathetic.Also on all three viewings the movie did engage me enough in wanting the characters to find what they were looking for. Coming back to it 16 years late this was just as true as my first viewing.To me  don't laugh  the REAL star of the movie was the open courtyard of La Fortuna the apartment building. I watch this movie mostly to see the courtyard again. It has a magical atmosphere. I even went looking to find out if it was a real place it isn't. And the story really does revolve around the courtyard. It's a place I'd have loved to live.And as it turns out in watching this movie again late 2013 I recognized that I actually found an entire TOWN with the atmosphere of La Fortuna and I live there now. People mill about and come together in any corner and smile to each other. When I first beheld my current town I had the same reaction that Tripplehorn had when she stepped into it  and McDermott too. So now I can be pleased with myself for having found myself a magical town officially even! to live in.".

And she's also extremely attractive which never hurts.Jen Aniston didnt play Rachel which was a good thing. The supporting cast did their jobs well and Dylan McDermott? Well you either like him or you loathe him I have found. I thought he was quite watchable in this.I was amused to see reviewers on here knocking the film because people smoked in it. Honestly I don't understand what that has to do with a film's artistic merit. On matters like smoking and drug use some of our membersnonUK usually tend to let their right wing views tarnish their opinions of a film.

It's not that the ending was tragic or predictable  it was just so blah.  And after such a wonderful movie the ending was such a disappointment such a downer  it was almost physically painful.And ironically despite the fact that 99 of the movie is wonderful the ending was so bad that I actually recommend against seeing this movie.

WORST movie ending ever. Not only are the viewers robbed of the actual portrayal of the climax it's implied but also of the longawaited epiphany and dialogue expressing said epiphany climax. There is NO dialogue whatsoever to finish the climax tell the story etc. just schmaltzy music played over the entire ending which again centers not on the heroic but the mundane forget the personal struggle for the good of the neighborhood the preservation of a place whose inhabitants had grown to love and cherish and finally attempt to protect. Also a touching subplot re a family heirloom piano is completely discarded and never answered this would have been a classic tear jerking scene heartachingly touching. It's not there never appears. The last ten minutes of this movie was akin to an eighth grader who begins his term paper 500am before school the day it is due. The screenwriter seems to have forgotten where this movie was going and gives up. Was ready to give 10 stars but cannot ending is just so disappointing. Grrr.".

One awaits the dramatic climax the satisfaction and completion of the two main characters' journey of self discovery personal fortitude and uniting in saving an historic and legendary neighborhood and its architecture...SEMISPOILER COMING...DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW A BIT RE THE ENDING...SPOILER ALERT FOR TEXT BEYOND THIS POINT...... and then? WORST movie ending ever. Not only are the viewers robbed of the actual portrayal of the climax it's implied but also of the longawaited epiphany and dialogue expressing said epiphany climax. There is NO dialogue whatsoever to finish the climax tell the story etc. just schmaltzy music played over the entire ending which again centers not on the heroic but the mundane forget the personal struggle for the good of the neighborhood the preservation of a place whose inhabitants had grown to love and cherish and finally attempt to protect. Also a touching subplot re a family heirloom piano is completely discarded and never answered this would have been a classic tear jerking scene heartachingly touching. It's not there never appears. The last ten minutes of this movie was akin to an eighth grader who begins his term paper 500am before school the day it is due. The screenwriter seems to have forgotten where this movie was going and gives up. Was ready to give 10 stars but cannot ending is just so disappointing. Grrr.";

After you've already seen it once you already know that it's more of an introspective drama so you can watch it in that context  it goes much better. It's actually not a BAD movie if you're in the mood for more of a down movie but if you're looking for an ACTUAL romantic comedy which are up movies this is NOT it! The first 2 minutes are happy  hopeful but after that the happiness turns to sadness the hopes are dashed and it's a movie focused on addictions broken relationships lies tears broken hearts pain death destruction goodbyes and a general sense that nothing lasts forever...a sense of hopelessness. Only in the last 6 minutes of the movie is there even the slightest glimmer of hope again. But the mistake they make is that they run the movie full circle so that the hope at the end is the same as the hope at the beginning...the hope that was killed during the movie. So the end result is that they're implying whether intentionally or not a cycle of hopelessness.And when what I wanted were some happy hopeful thoughts to close out a rough day and give me sweet dreams this heavy feeling of depressiveness really sucks.

	schema:reviewBody "Jackie Chan had just established his Hong Kong popularity with Seasonal Pictures Snake in Eagles Shadow and the sublime Drunken Master. With the success of those films Lo Wei who lent him out to Seasonal let Jackie have complete control over his next picture. Fearless Hyena would be Jackie's directorial debut  though he would be working with a much smaller budget than his Seasonal experience. He would also stunt coordinate and write this film too. This movie would out gross the stellar receipts of Drunken Master and help earn Jackie 6000 HK dollars his pay was 3000 per film though he made over 50000 on Drunken Master. This measly pay helped exacerbate the rift between him and Lo Wei which led to his departure and the infamous sequel. Jackie reprises his goofy student role that he played in Drunken Master. This time he is Shing Lung a talented but capricious student and grandson of Chen Ping Fe the ubiquitous James Tien. Lung would rather gamble or goof off then study his forms. Little does he know that his Grandfather is marked for death by Yen Ting Hua the underrated Yam Saikwoon aka Yen Shi Kwan who is trying to destroy the Sien Yi clan founded by Hiu Fei I just love keeping track of these names I do not know why. Though Shing is forbidden to teach or show the Kung Fu his grandfather teaches him he of course does it anyways.Shing tries to make his grandfather proud by getting a job selling coffins. The coffin dealer played by Dean Shek is an unscrupulous merchant who even sells secondhand coffins. This cameo plays to the strengths of Dean and is quite an interesting and hilarious scene. Hapless Shing blows this opportunity by trapping Dean in one of his favorite coffins. He runs away and while walking the public he is confronted by three ruffians Great Bear Stony Egg and Ironhead he beat up earlier. They want him to teach them Kung Fu.Shing meets their Master Ti Cha who is in charge of the Everything Clan who has no actual skills except for scheming. Ti offers Lung a position and lots of money to help there school learn effective fighting techniques. Ti uses him in the old ploy as a lowly laborer to fight heads of other schools so if the lowly laborer is that good just imagine how good Master Ti is. This leads to several excellent fight scenes that are incredibly fun to watch. I especially like when Shing fights the Lu Ying and the Willow Sword using the Pink Panther theme as background music as a crosseyed beggar. He then fights a large albeit slow man as a woman yes Jackie in Drag and no he is not cute.Shing then makes a huge mistake by naming the facility under the Sien Yi name. Now the rest of the film is very predictable with the ultimate showdown between Shing Lung and Yen Ting Hua. The way it is handled though is quite sagacious. The training scenes are Jackie at his masochistic best. With him pulling huge sacks doing amazing upsidedown situps with his new trainer the Unicorn having a sadistic gleam in his eyes. Shing is even taught Emotional Kung Fu which Jackie made up for this film using Joy Anger Sorrow and Happiness to focus on one's enemy emotional weak spot.One of my favorite scenes is the Dueling Chopsticks scene in which the Unicorn prevents Shing from eating by using his chopsticks of course. Unfortunately it has influenced me to be quite annoying and apply this whenever applicable.I would not rate this film as highly as Drunken Master. There are problems with the plot that takes too much from Drunken Master. However I feel that this is an unheralded martial arts piece that is funny and exciting with excellent ideas and stunt choreography by Jackie Chan. This is also a must see if you want to watch Jackie in drag.".

However there is the classic humor of Jackie which even involves himself dressing up as a woman and beating a guy up with his breasts and an unbelievable chopstick battle for a piece of meat between Jackie and his teacher THIS WAS AMAZING HOW THE HELL DID THEY DO THAT you'd HAVE TO SEE IT TO BE BELIEVED!!Martial Rating 6.5 out of 10Overall rating 5 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "For me the absolute best of Chan's earliest 'star' period that is not counting early bitparts and actually better than Drunken Master.Before judging this film one has to ask after Chan's real goals here. He wants to demonstrate that he can write a whole narrative that flows in smooth linear fashion he wants to learn all he can about camera placement and editing he wants to pay tribute to the comic masters of the past that he truly admires especially buster Keaton and Douglas Fairbanks the original Zorro yet he also wants to demonstrate that he can act serious scenes and that he can direct other actors performing serious scenes. In this way he identifies himself as real creative talent and not a Sammo Hung clone not a Yuen woo Ping clone and anything but a Bruce Lee clone  which means that he is already thinking of his future nonAsian audiences.So the question becomes first whether or not he accomplishes these tasks.Well obviously I think he has.consider this With a lesser actor and director the transition from the 'silent comedy' tribute scenes in the martial arts school at the beginning to the revenge driven training sequences later on would snap the film in two. But here when Chan's character discovers the murder of his grandfather he also discovers that he himself in however small a manner has been instrumental in leading the murderer to his grandfather. Thus the hidden issue requiring resolution is not revenge at all but guilt and expiation. This reconstructs the Chan character as a young man on the quest for redemption not just revenge. A theme brilliantly emphasized by the very last image of the movie. On top of this Chan has demonstrated articulate command of medium he has also directed James Tien who little older than himself to appear convincingly as his grandfather and of course the comedy is hilarious especially the fight in drag.Chan fans as well as fans of silent comedy and of chopsock kungfu owe it to themselves to see this movie enjoy it and remember it.".

	schema:headline " Tremendously inventive tour de force for Jackie  both in front of and behind the camera";
	schema:reviewBody "This film from 1979 marked Jackie's first venture behind the camera as director. FEARLESS HYENA is a traditional periodset kung fu flick that closely resembles other Jackie Chan films made around the same time the focus is on comedy followed by revenge and these elements in combination with the sheer screen presence of the young star make it well worth watching. It begins with a chase scene in which the ruthless Yen who half resembles Christopher Lee murders a number of rivals using his kung fu skills. The story then cuts to more familiar territory as we are introduced to Lung Jackie's character. Lung is learning kung fu skills from his grandfather played by the familiar and reliable James Tien.The first hour of the film follows the comedykungfu mould as we watch Lung train his kung fu as well as interact with various characters in the village. These range from a crazy undertaker a cameo from Dean Shek to three gamblers who eventually persuade Lung to come and work at their kung fu school. Jackie proves his worth by beating a number of rivals. The final half hour of the film concentrates on revenge as Lung discovers a new mentor a crippled beggar nicknamed 'the Unicorn' and undergoes some gruelling training before taking on the bad guys in a violent showdown.Essentially FEARLESS HYENA is a film made up of two separate parts with the first hour concentrating on comedy and the latter part building up to a vengeancefuelled showdown. The comedy is of the slapstick variety that Jackie loves and there are some obvious nods to the likes of THE THREE STOOGES as our hero joins up with a trio of gamblers and engages in some cartoonish battles with them. Love it or hate it this type of slapstick comedy was beloved by Chinese audiences and always pops up in these types of films.Better still are the 'comedy fights' in which Jackie battles his opponents in various amusing ways. These fights are centred at the kung fu school as Jackie dons a variety of disguises to battle a series of hardened kung fu masters. It's easy to dismiss these scenes as childish or timefillers but in fact they display some highly impressive acrobatic skills from the star whose splitsecond timing is impeccable. The scene where he dresses as a crosseyed janitor and fights an opponent using benches and a table for instance is wonderful expertly choreographed and full of fluid action that only seasoned performers could have pulled off.This wouldn't be a traditional kung fu film without any training sequences and these are also some of the best put on camera. Jackie proves himself to be at his physical peak as he performs upsidedown situps over and over again and drags weights across a field every muscle and tendon on his body straining. The opening and closing fight scenes get pretty violent  the blood runs freely  and the finale in particular is edgeoftheseat stuff. A new type of kung fu is introduced into the film it focuses on the emotions happy sad angry etc. and with it Jackie is able to take down his opponents in various painful ways.Watching Jackie fight in new unique ways is always a pleasure and the fights here are no exception trust Jackie he's even able to inject some humour into these moments with his 'sadness' kung fu resembling drunken boxing as he falls over and against his opponent. As the villain Yen Yam Saikun may not be as skilled as Hwang Jang Lee but his kung fu skills are pretty spectacular especially his deadly 'eagle claw' strike. The film ends on a real high with Jackie excelling both in front of and behind the camera. His fellow cast members all put in good performances and the martial arts is tremendous as usual.".

I consider this movie to contain some of his best fights ever. The end battle was really good showing Jackie fight without fear. Watch for the scene with the chopsticks and the big pots. Jackie dressing up as a female was good too. The most impressive thing for me was the brilliant trainingworkout scenes which really showed the physical strength of Jackie chan. Anyway if your into your Kung Fu movies then you definitely need this film in your collection. Memorable scene is the chopsticks duel. Jackie uses Emotional KungFu a style that involves displaying the emotions of anger sorrow joy and happiness to find the opponent's weakness thus fighting whilst crying or laughing. Very unique. This movie also happens to be Jackie Chan's directorial debut.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review I really enjoyed this authentic Kung Fu movie but a lot of time is wasted on silly jokes and unnecessary scenes. At the time of it's release I was totally amazed with this unknown Kung Fu world were a man trains to be an expert and he uses his skills to kill the baddies so this film definitely brought back some memories. This film sees Chan play a young Shing Lung who lives with his grandfather and makes money any which way he can. Whilst staying in his grandfather's house he's taught different styles of Kung Fu and he uses his skills against the bullies in his remote village. His talents soon get recognised by a money making con artist who opens Kung Fu school were Chan takes on everyone that comes to takeon there pupils. When his grandfather finds out how he's been making money he gets very upset because he doesn't want there Kung Fu to become known to others. After a while the schools name spreads across the village and his grandfather's enemy tracks him down kills him after a lengthy battle. Chan then seeks revenge for his grandfather but his Kung Fu isn't up to scratch to challenge him so he learns new styles from his grandfather's friend which lead to a showdown that is definitely worth watching. Its your usual You Killed My Master type of concept which I have grown to love in this genre. The only problem is that it takes a long time to get going but it's worth the wait. The funny dubbing really made me laugh and some of the fighting scenes were a bit over the top but that was expected because of the age of the movie. Chan does give his all throughout the movie and the different costumes that he put on during his time at the school were amusing but the true action should have started a lot earlier in the movie. With that aside I still enjoyed the film and I'm glad that I was able to get my hands on it. Enjoyable!RoundUp This movie was directed and written by a young Jackie Chan who done a great job at such a young age. The choreography throughout the movie was also done by Chan so he really put a lot of time and energy into his directional debut. At the time Chan was only 25 so you have to give him recognition for his first attempt behind the camera. Anyway if your into your Kung Fu movies then you definitely need this film in your collection.I recommend this movie to people who are into their actionmartial artscomedies starring Jackie Chan James Tien and Dean Shek. 710".

And as if that wasn't bad enough it sounded like a single constipated guy was making all the voices for all characters in the movie. It was just awful.But the movie was also incorporating a bit too much slapstick comedy and really bad sound effects in an attempt to emphasize on the comedy on the screen.Despite the abovementioned things then there are good things to the movie as well. The main thing being the acrobatic and physical performance that Jackie Chan delivered. It was just impressive. And you also get to see Jackie Chan dressed up as a woman which was just hilarious and that scene alone makes it worth to sit through the entire movie.Storywise then Fearless Hyena Xiao quan guai zhao is fairly simplistic and easy to follow even as the movie doesn't require any real brain activity from the audience.This is not amongst the best of Jackie Chan's earlier movies in his otherwise impressive movie list. And I must admit that I thought this movie would be more than it turned out to be as I had heard nothing but praise and great things about it.".

In this one it's emotional kung fu. There is really no real emotional kung fu system but it doesn't matter. Chan carries the film with his fight choreography comic effects and silly antics. However the plot is forgettable the dialog is really bad at times and the dubbing is horrible. The acting is laughable too and get a load of those phony lumps that appear on iron head during his fight with Chan. Chan has a habit of mugging for the camera in this film as well. Still the film is notable not only as Chan's directorial debut but as a continuation of his stylistic ploy of ingratiating himself to audiences through the use of physical comedy.  of 4 stars.".

The less you know about the story the better the experience. The actress who plays the central character on screen every moment of the film is mesmerizing as the somewhat clumsy yet fanatic young woman at a precarious crossroad in her life much of the film is comprised of extreme closeups of her face the flaring nostrils and heavy breathing alerting us to the dark thoughts running through her mind. The audience is given very little back story of what brought her to this hotel room awaiting her fate and the ambiguity pays off in the second half preventing the thrust of her mission from going down a welltrod path. This film could have easily stopped at a couple different junctures and been less successful as result however the director keeps the story moving towards a surprisingly heartwrenching moment that validates its whole purpose.Grade 810".

And that added creepiness greatly to the suspenseI literally jumped a little bit out of my chair at one point and I can only remember doing that a handful of times in my history of moviegoing.Still I dont know whether or not the slow pace would hold up well to repeated viewings and it's not like the pacing was perfect shaving ten minutes overall probably would have helped.

	schema:headline " Hugely Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Day Night Day Night could possibly be the culprit for Joe Blow's distaste for independent films and their attempts at capturing the essence of humanity using shakycam directing and pitiful dialog that is painful to listen to. Almost all art house cinema appeal to a narrow audience but still retain the vital elements of film that anyone can appreciate. This movie fails in the latter respect.There are only subtle traces of character development. Please note revealing preexisting attributes of a character is not the same as character development. For the first 30 minutes of exposition and the next...and the next... we learn very little about our protagonist. Perhaps we'll watch She clip her toe nails brush her teeth get dressed sit blink a few times flip the lights on and off look out a window perhaps digest her pizza and silently break wind etc and in the end something will bond each stray element of seemingly mundane activity that we've forced ourselves to sit through into a cohesive story.Which is what this film lacks story. The film is a penguin waddling along hefting a fat belly of exposition vainly flapping it's tiny wings for a takeoff. We the viewer are aware that this film is a penguin and penguins can't fly but we're willing to discard logic for hope hope that this penguin might get a little assistance in the way of a clich gust of wind that would just hurry us along to the inevitable.If you'd like to watch a girl walk around chewing her cud into a boom Mic which probably accounts for 15 minutes of run time She chewing pizza a candy apple pudding Chinese food a soft pretzel etc this film is for you. For anyone wishing to make a remake film yourself taking care of your morning routine in a hotel bathroom walking around Times Square buying and eating food and carrying a heavy backpack through crosswalks. That's about how exciting this entire film is. If you're like me the only reason you watched it all is because you are anal and must watch a fim from start to finish once you've committed.It's pretty bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Hannah Arendt coined the expression the banality of evil surely she must have had something like Day Night Day Night in mind. With chilling detachment this brilliant and terrifying film chronicles the last 48 hours in the life of a potential suicide bomber. It is a topic rife with all sorts of potential pitfalls both political and cinematic yet the movie succeeds as a work of art because it never resorts to sensationalism or exploitation to get its point across.Filmmaker Julia Loktey has deliberately eliminated any back story that might explain why a beautiful young girl like Leah would be willing to perform an action as inconceivable and incomprehensible as the one she has planned here. The whys and the wherefores are really of little concern to Loktey. Instead she has chosen to concentrate on the almost strikingly banal stepbystep process Leah must go through to complete the deed. Indeed it's amazing how through context alone even the most mundane of actions  brushing one's teeth taking a bath clipping one's toenails  can suddenly become imbued with the most terrifying significance and sense of foreboding. It's almost as if Leah is trying to hold onto a sense of normalcy for as long as she can savoring the minor pleasures of life that she knows she will never experience again. In fact in the stunning final half hour of the film as Leah roams around the streets of New York City trying to summon up the courage to fulfill her mission she begins to cling more and more to the simple joys of life  a mustardcovered pretzel a candy apple  before taking that final plunge into the abyss. What's particularly disturbing is how unfailingly sweet and polite Leah is to the people around her  be they the common pedestrians or storekeepers who could easily become her victims or the masked men who calmly almost apologetically feed her instructions on what she is to do when the fateful moment arrives. The scene in which they dress Leah up in terrorist garb and methodically direct her for a video that will be released after her death is one of the most chilling in the entire film.Luisa Williams who is never off camera for a single moment in the film delivers an astonishing tourdeforce performance that is guaranteed to leave the audience stunned into silence. With very little in the way of dialogue to work with Williams is forced to rely almost exclusively on facial expression and body language to convey a wealth of emotion. The incongruity between the character's sweet personality and demeanor and the horrific act of violence she is about to commit throws us completely off balance and makes us call into question our own perception of the world and the way it works.Loktey employs documentarystyle realism to tell her story using her camera to record almost as a dispassionate observer the events as they unfold in the course of that 48hour period.Day Night Day Night contains more nervewracking suspense than a boatload of standard thrillers yet it is a suspense that is honestly earned for Loktey never stoops to implausible timing or hokey contrivance to create her effect. This is the stuff of real life  with all its attendant unpredictability and ironies  unfolding before us. We are forever focused on this young lady who remains a fascinating and terrifying enigma throughout the entire hourandahalf that we spend with her.Stated simply Day Night Day Night is one of the most riveting and important releases of 2007.".

Who knows maybe the wine would help me figure out why the hell I'm so depressed and how did I come to the conclusion that I wanted to be a suicide bomber?

I couldn't help think that if I was catching change from strangers for a phone call I would at least collect enough change to buy a bottle of wine to have a little going out party for myself. Who knows maybe the wine would help me figure out why the hell I'm so depressed and how did I come to the conclusion that I wanted to be a suicide bomber? Or just get drunk because I'm in this ridiculous artsie fartsie dreadful movie. If any producer out there is interested I would be happy to reenact my homeless days  I guarantee you'll be entertained.";

At the depot she is met by a man that takes her to what appears to be a suburban motel. She has come for the sole purpose of being trained for a mission to sacrifice herself in a terrorist act. The woman takes a bath scrubbing herself clean as though preparing for the sacrifice she is about to commit Masked men enter the room. Blindfolding her they take her through a training different in a lot of possible scenarios. She is given a new identity and has to learn it by rote. When she is deemed ready she is taken to a desolate area where a car awaits her to take her to another bus depot. Her destination we learn at last is Times Square the heart of New York City.Leah Cruz the would be terrorist embarks on a walk throughout the area. The usual crowds are a reminder of what she is about to do. She is constantly surrounded by a mass of people that are oblivious to the danger so near to them. After trying the explosive device she realizes it's not working properly something she or the team that prepared the explosion probably didn't count on. As the story ends we watch her being pursued by a young man who might be a predator looking for easy an easy mark.Suicide bombers are a recent development in the world. They have been responsible for the death of thousands of innocent people that didn't deserve to die in the first place. It is hard to understand how a human being will get to that stage. Not only will they kill a lot of bystanders but in the process they don't live to see the havoc they create.Day Night Day Night is the creation of Julia Loktev a director unknown to this viewer. Not knowing what to expect we took a chance with this indie film from IFC a producer of quirky fare. Ms. Loktev takes the viewer into the mind of a person that is determined to carry out a horrible act. We never get to know Leah's background or what is the cause for which she is fighting. We never learn what has been her reason for getting involved in such a criminal act. When she calls her parents they sound as though they are concerned about her but not much more than what a parent of a young person would be.Louisa Williams has the kind of face that could pass for any ethnicity it is difficult to peg her down to any specific race group. Her eyes tell the story of the conflict within her. Walking among the crowds of Times Square Ms. Williams appears at times as though she is overwhelmed by the garishness of her surroundings while at other times she appears to be afraid of dying for a cause that even she can't comprehend.The excellent hand held camera of cinematographer Benoit Debie captures the Times Square area as through the eyes of a tourist or even a would be killer.

The movie does start out slowly with the young woman in closeup obviously praying. Then the tension begins to build and does so when she begins a very rigorous grooming regime. Also notice how wellmannered she is. Who says thank you and so often to people she does not know and who have arranged for her death even if she wants to die? Watch the little details when she is downtown. The people around her especially at the stoplight. What they are doing or not doing. The sounds around her. The sounds she makes even when she is eating. How she is showing us her apprehension and nervousness regarding what she is about to do.

People merrily go about their day and randomly hand a young teenage girl change for the phone unaware she's calling the very men.. who have planted about 20 lbs. of Semtex in her JanSport.Everything we love and live for everyone we hold dear is gone within a Killswitch engage of a second.. and we didn't even realize we walked right past the girl.. and yeah so what if she was crying a little and had some urine on her pants.. I can't remember what she was wearing.. she looked American to me Officer!.. I mean I have a kid sister that age mister detective...A young girl going from one random street clicking on a Mp3 player and helplessly being devastated by the fact that she failed her people and yet innocent bystanders just simply look past her most not even noticing the possible brush of death knocking so closely at their door.. as they walk right by with their children.Her untrue story is she has no family.. they died where she came from and something tells you that if she had stated the truth these men would never let her go through with it.. and yet when she reaches out for her parents.. the shame of it seems to make herself dead to them or she chose this for her punishment. But at what price and what reward.. Honor? Vengeance? No Self Worth? I mean teenagers are teenagers no matter what country they are evolving from.I believe she was faced with the same humanity we are faced with in every country. We need and we need to be needed. She was reaching out to be important and when she failed in an epic way.. she was no longer useful to herself.. it left her open to face the issue of being in enemy territory and even more vulnerable and here we grow a bit more compassion for her character. I loved the ending of the movie. Chills on so many levels and if you didn't get them then you need some deep rooted nature and issues to dissolve within yourself and although I would never want anyone to succeed at these actual acts in reality it is about time the people get a film where someone finally puts an end to it all. No endings like 2012. No islands to save the lucky innocence. If people want reality and believe me a movie like this can't get any more true to the bone real and then they want to complain about how slow and boring it went.. then I say let them have their oblivious ending. It wasn't supposed to have a hero or a fight scene .. running 'lola' or DEA busts. JUST RAW TRUTH. But the wake up call that we are so blind to hate and acts done out of confusion fear misunderstanding and pure hatred given from a higher command.. It's a sad and scary thing.. and I can only hope to understand someday why anyone feels compelled to be a suicide bomber. As an American citizen.. I think it's my right to know exactly why they hate us so much to do this? What is truly going on that we aren't being told?? This movie gives me the humanities version..not the stereotypical terroristic Ironman version. that was a great movie too. but Not even close on the same level of art!".

	schema:headline " a beautifully mixed up film about the faith which makes us act";
	schema:reviewBody "The first act of a film sets up the plot the beginning of the story. The act is a series of events called scenes which move the viewer though situations with the characters to develop the story. This first act takes up about a third of the entire film. And in this third of the film you learn about the characters through scenes that might not have much to do with the plot of the film but that nonetheless serves to create some sort of understanding of the characters maybe to create an emotional attachment with these characters which will later pay off when these characters are in a tough predicament. The conflict. But I digress.You could start the opening on a wide shot of some place maybe some people are visible but are very small on the screen within this place. You might cut in closer on those people and that is when you might hear and see them begin to speak. Their faces are centered in the frame and they are very visible due to the proper lighting. They speak about something which gives you some understanding of them or where we are heading as viewers. Just before the first scene ends you cut back out to a wider shot signifying their physical situation and putting a distance between us and them back to where we began. This is standard. True.The first shot of Day Night Day Night does something else. Before one can adjust in their seat as the lights dim and the screen sparks up there were few to no trailers or commercials before most of the films at this festival we see the first frame and hear a girl's voice. We cannot see the girl clearly for she is a shadowy silhouette in profile. She speaks quickly in a whisper. We must be guided with English subtitles though later it becomes clear she speaks perfect English. I cannot recall the exact opening monologue but the girl speaks of God and being chosen and obeying and not failing she speaks in haste and we must struggle to stay understand because we could easily miss everything. For what seems like a minute only quicker the frame is still and she speaks like this. There is a light moving quickly behind her. And this is how one of the most involved and intense first scenes in a single frame in a film begins. This was at the New Horizons Film Festival in Wroclaw.The side of the bus opens and legs come into frame. Luggage is grabbed and the legs walk away a shot done like some comic strip flat but conveying enough information to get it. Cut. We are behind the shoulders of a dark haired girl who seems lost is walking up escalators in this bus station the camera reminiscent of the Darden brother's style shaky like documentary footage real. She is bumping into people. The environment spinning like a whirlpool around our seemingly grounded figure she is turning around her face not exposed to the viewer. It is like this at a moment later when we sense urgency or maybe fear at the suddenly increased pace of the camera's movements and for a moment from profile the face looks at us and we are met with an odd gaze from dark eyes and high cheekbones and thick dark lips maybe a native American maybe middle eastern odd and mysterious. Before we can really take this view in she turns away in search of someone or something. A phone rings she hangs it up. It rings again and this time she picks up. A steady and calculated voice sounds out telling her to go to the parking lot where someone is waiting for her. She responds. Her voice is soft and weak. She is compliant and well mannered. Thank you. Where is this leading to? We are taken with her in a car with an Asian driver and then to a hotel room where the blinds are instantly closed. From over exposed brightness to unclear darkness. Stand here the Asian guy says and leaves. She cleans herself obsessively scrubbing her body clipping her nails. She is preparing for something big. Is she some sex slave? Has she been purchased for sex labor? Just one thought about the possibilities of what could be happening. The handcuffs she is commanded to put on by the voice from the phone can attest to this. And at this time the simplicity of the shots the nearly static camera scrubbing and washing the voice on the phone the tension and eeriness the girls face her willingness for all this and even duty is the work of a very detail oriented and inventive writer and observer. A name I had not heard of before this film Julia Lotkev the filmmaker behind Day Night Day Night is the second feature of this new gal on the block. And she has definitely something to show off with this film.We learn that this nameless girl is a suicide bomber. Her target which we discover nearly three fifths of the way through is times square New York. But in this case unlike in Paradise Now we never understand the reasons for these actions. Though her hasty personal monologues of fanatical devotion  they occur a few times in the film but none are as intense as the opener  clue us in to what spiritual voyage she might be dealing with something we can in a vague or personal way parallel with our own convictions it is still just vague and unclear and does not hint at any kind of Islamic hatred to the west. And it is this quiet inner turmoil or love of hate which is leading this young and fragile girl to kill herself and others.To continue reading this review go to httpblog.changeofbase.com".

Frankly these questions are ancillary to the fact that she's Nike paraphrase just going to do it but like Hemingway's killers in that short story of his which I'll have to reread again now that I think about it she doesn't kill anybody. Is it because of her hunger for life? Lots of scenes of her eating the soup the pretzels the muffin the pizza the candy apple  she's got quite an appetite which I appreciate  and there's the way the director wants you to hear every muscle of mastication working in her.If anything I wish it could have been longer. So many unanswered questions. What is the fallout of her failure? Does somebody contact her? Maybe one of the hoods from earlier in the movie? Or somebody higher up? What's the punishment for her failure? And it's really telling that this actress hasn't been in many films afterwards. All in all a tight little movie and lesson on hunger and what drives you and how a hunger for life can in some people overpower your hunger for anything else and that in my opinion is ironically the thing that leads to your downfall.

Paolo Laurana is a leftist professor not convinced of the official truth and starts investigating by himself. He finds some help from a solicitor Mr. Rosello. While investigating he is fascinated by Luisa the widow of one of the victims. But the reality is too different from what Laurana could imagine. Reality includes not only the mafia and corrupt politicians but also Church connections. The reality is that there could be only one end for Laurana. It won't take long.";

Wherever characters go the sea or Mount Pellegrino always appear behind them. It's a beautiful landscape mocking all the ugliness bubbling in its urban centres.The town pharmacist Manno Luigi Pistilli  fans of Spaghetti Westerns will immediately recognize his face receives a letter threatening him of death. It's the sixth that month and he's still alive so he doesn't take it seriously. But the next day during a hunting trip he and his friend Prof. Roscio Salvo Randone are murdered.We could say that one of the film's theme is indifference. Most people seem indifferent to the double homicides. They certainly regret the death of Prof. Roscio which was probably accidental a typical example of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There are no regrets for Manno the town philanderer. You mess with another man's wife you get oldfashioned justice. When the relatives of a young girl Manno was seeing are arrested the case seems closed. No point asking more questions. As Jack Nicholson says in Chinatown let sleeping dogs lie.Paolo Laurana Gian Maria Volont refuses to let sleeping does lie and starts investigating. An intellectual loner and leftist sympathiser Laurana a teacher is different from his townsfolk. Analysing one of the death letters he discovers the letters were cut from the L'Osservatore Romano the Vatican's official newspaper. Knowing that the suspects are illiterate and discovering that very few people receive this newspaper in town he continues his investigation to have the men freed.His investigation makes him to grow close to Luisa Roscio Irene Pappas the deceased's widow and her cousin the lawyer Rosello Gabriele Ferzetti who's taken the defense of the suspects. Through Luisa Laurana discovers that Prof. Roscio was actually the target and the death threats against Manno just a pretext. It seems the professor had discovered evidence that someone important in town was involved in corrupt businesses.The story is sadly predictable and takes us through a web of intrigues involving the clergy the senate the town's influential men and possibly the Mafia although the word itself is never spoken. It's the typical story of a nave man who stumbles upon corruption and dark secrets in an apparently idyllic place. How much of the story's weakness is due to the original novel by Leonardo Sciascia or the adaptation by Petri Ugo Pirro and Jean Curtelin is anyone's guess. But Sciascia a celebrated author in Italy did express disappointment over the screenplay.The strength of the movie lies in the cast. Gian Maria Volont is unstoppable and perfectly captures Laurana's navet and aloofness. He's an erudite person but inattentive incapable of seeing what goes on around him. This flaw is his doom and leads directly to the climax the best part of the story an act of betrayal so unexpected and emotionally cruel that I was heartbroken for Laurana.Irene Pappas also gives a fine performance as the widow Luisa funny in every movie I've seen her she always plays a widow. In defence of her lack of variety she does look great in black. Less expansive than Volont Pappas acts mostly with her vivid eyes revealing a personality that has little to say but is always calculating. Her expression of uncertainty and regret at the end of the movie which is also the beginning of her wedding encapsulates her character's essence and like the beautiful landscape that contrasts with the horrible crimes is at odds with the finale's festive tone.Elio Petri Gian Maria Volont and Ugo Pirro met for the first time in this movie. So it's of historical curiosity to their fans. Although they went on to make masterpieces together the simplistic We Still Kill The Old Way is not to be sneered at even if it tastes like a mere appetiser for their future successes.".

The murder is filed under honour crime delitto d'onore a murder committed out of passion and jealousy and a peasant is convicted for it.

As the story unveils he will discover unpleasant truths but will continue with the investigation despite all dangers. Volont is as formidable as always changing his accent and posture to fit the part. But the real protagonist is the Sicilian landscape in all its harsh brightness.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good solid beautifully photographed crime thriller. My misfortune was to pick this film to watch the night after watching Illustrious Corpses. Now that Italian political crime thriller made in 1976 and based upon a book by Leonardo Sciascia is a near faultless classic with deep undertones and a broad scope that is simply a joy to watch. This it turns out is another film based upon another book by Leonardo Sciascia from 1967. How much more sensible it would have been to watch this one first. The thing is there is nothing wrong with this film except it is also about too easily explained killings that the lead character sets out to investigate and in the process overturns a hornets' nest but there is much less action intrigue and politics. Gian Maria Velonte is excellent as the professor who takes it upon himself to get involved when most people seem not to care. Interestingly this was the film that helped to lift this actor into more 'serious' films after having made many spaghetti westerns one of the last being face to Face also from 1967 when he also played a professor.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a good solid beautifully photographed crime thriller. My misfortune was to pick this film to watch the night after watching Illustrious Corpses. Now that Italian political crime thriller made in 1976 and based upon a book by Leonardo Sciascia is a near faultless classic with deep undertones and a broad scope that is simply a joy to watch. This it turns out is another film based upon another book by Leonardo Sciascia from 1967. How much more sensible it would have been to watch this one first. The thing is there is nothing wrong with this film except it is also about too easily explained killings that the lead character sets out to investigate and in the process overturns a hornets' nest but there is much less action intrigue and politics. Gian Maria Velonte is excellent as the professor who takes it upon himself to get involved when most people seem not to care. Interestingly this was the film that helped to lift this actor into more 'serious' films after having made many spaghetti westerns one of the last being face to Face also from 1967 when he also played a professor.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm told that there are some cultures which regard living through interesting times as a curse. What would happen to drama if times were uninteresting. Meet Molly Roth Jodhi May. She's a normal teenager in a regimented society. It's 1963 in South Africa. Her parents are involved in the antiapartheid cause. Her father flees the country. The police pick up her mother.It is a partially valid criticism offered by another commentator that the film does not explain why the Roths oppose apartheid.

She's a normal teenager in a regimented society. It's 1963 in South Africa. Her parents are involved in the antiapartheid cause. Her father flees the country. The police pick up her mother.It is a partially valid criticism offered by another commentator that the film does not explain why the Roths oppose apartheid.

	schema:reviewBody "An important and recurring film trend in the 1980's was to deal with the apartheid in South Africa which brought to the world a deep understanding of what the British were doing in that nation with their racial politics of segregation. The world got deeply involved with that protested in every possible way and when the 1990's came it was all over South Africa was free again even though it took some time to reach peace and to develop politics for blacks and whites. The film trend had films like Cry Freedom A Dry White Season and this one directed by Chris Menges best known as cinematographer of many classics. What makes A World Apart to differ from those besides the quality the mentioned films are far better is that it's a story that seemed designed to educate younger audiences about the apartheid reality. Commendable initiative but the ambition is so big that the movie falls short of accomplish something with such difficult task.In the 1960's Johannesburg the 13 yearold Molly Jodhi May tries to understand the world around her a world of segregation where whites have everything and blacks don't have anything but following the racist laws created by the British where rights are denied no public meetings are allowed protests are deemed illegal and people are sent to jail to long sentences or die in suspicious circumstances. Those facts hit her closely when her father Jeroen Krabb leaves the house to never return and her dedicated mother Barbara Hershey is arrested under a new law that allowed authorities to sent suspect people to jail for a 90day period without trial. Molly's parents are leftist journalists who support the black South Africans in their quest for freedom and social rights. What follows is Molly's perspectives about this harsh reality as a young girl growing up having to face life without the presence of her parents taking care of her younger sisters without any help from her friends who turned away from her when they heard about the mother's politics and imprisonment. The film is good. The idea though lacking and confusing makes the film something worth seeing and almost important. However Shawn Slovo's screenplay isn't all that great and neither deserving of the many accolades it received a Bafta win included. I thought everything was taken too lightly tension is built then fades away. Little is known about the activism of Molly's parents and Jeroen as the father has only one scene and we never get the chance to know why he was so important to the cause and what really happened to him. It's the kind of script that ends up treating its adult audience as children and if the concept was schemed to bring kids to it then it failed a lot cause they don't offer a background neither a summary to the events taking place in South Africa and they'll feel lost. Gladly some scenes are very convincing there's a good drama that sometimes unfolds with some bumps those happen more because of the acting than the script itself. I know a lot of people are head over heels Jodhi as Molly but I frankly thought it was one of the strangest performances I've seen in a child actor. In quietmoderate scenes she owns the role and you cheers for her character always wanting to see her overcome the obstacles life thrown at her. But when it's time to break down cry and yell or act different than her sweet almost naive way she felt so forced so overthetop I couldn't relate with the girl anymore. Yes Molly is supposed to be spoiled and ungrateful towards her caring mother she truly believes she can change the world around her to the point of enduring all those days in prison but the sentimentalism she brings with that just make her intolerable. Barbara Hershey carries the film in a good way too bad the movie wasn't focused directly on her. Tim Roth's role is brief but it's a class act David Suchet always deserves credit whenever he plays a villain it's a subtle bad guy who appears to be good.Can I say the movie is positive for the cause of education? Yes I can. But if you really can show to your children the films I mentioned earlier then move on with the history books documentaries or even Invictus this one more contemporary. 710".

	schema:headline " Apartheid Through A White Family's Eyes";
	schema:reviewBody "Apartheid was just beginning to face its end in 1988 as this movie was being made but it was still a few years away from disappearing completely. This movie is set in the 1960's  a time when apartheid was still enforced ruthlessly and A World Apart gives us the story of a white but antiapartheid family struggling against the regime. The story is shown largely through the eyes of Molly Roth played by Jodhi May  a 13 year old girl. As the movie begins her father is leaving South Africa to avoid arrest as a communist. Meanwhile her mother is an antiapartheid journalist. Molly finds herself increasingly ostracized by many of her white friends and their families because of her family's political views and her mother is arrested by the government under a law that allowed for people to be held for 90 days without being charged so that they could be interrogated. The movie certainly makes the point that apartheid and the white regime were inhumane and brutal. It also  to me  made the point that apartheid sowed the seeds of its own destruction. Because of its ruthlessness rather than stamping out opposition by frightening its opponents it enraged them and emboldened them and ensured that there would be an ever increasing number of recruits for the anti apartheid movement a point made I thought by Molly's raised fist in a gesture of defiance in one of the last scenes of the movie.In this movie the central family is the Roth family  Gus and Diana and their children most importantly Molly. In fact the movie is really based on the story of Ruth First who was the wife of South African Communist leader Joe Slovo. First did indeed find herself arrested under the 90 days law and actually served almost 120 days before being released. She was assassinated in the early 1980's and this movie serves as a tribute to her and was actually written by Shawn Slovo Joe and Ruth's daughter. I found myself wondering if the title might be referring to Molly's or Shawn's experience of being in a world of her own  not completely fitting in with the black world even though she was a supporter of their cause and obviously not fitting in with the white world most of whom regarded her and her family with a mix of contempt and suspicion.As apartheid movies go this was somewhat unique in trying to tell the story through white eyes. To me though it didn't really succeed. While the regime shown through its police and security forces was ominous and everpresent the movie seemed to lack intensity and treated the subject a little bit lightly. It's interesting but to me it seemed to miss the mark. 610".

The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves i.e. this is real life.What the poorlyrating reviewers seek is escapism. In my viewhowever limitedthis film aims to depict two human beings as they learn grow and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side married and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year hence the name partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film shunned by a few reviewers elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a runofthemill romance. Again speaking in terms of the development between characters the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline the first twothirds to a certain degree lack what the final third delivers surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the halfwit category can follow the story regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.".

	schema:headline " 'One Day' is an achievement in film acting and a beautiful love story";
	schema:reviewBody "Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful beautiful love story of two people Emma Anne Hathaway and Dex Jim Sturgess. After spending the night together after graduation we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls who also wrote the screenplay 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie  if the actors are great the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all but when everything else is done so well if the acting were bad the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact as an onscreen pair they work extremely well together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry you'll be happy you'll be sad  the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told  there is no instant gratification there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of everything's all goodobstacleeverything ends well  there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details like eyelines smiles sighs cutoff conversations etc. were paid attention to. The costuming cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and aweinspiring. I left the theater crying but it didn't stop there even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with or maybe just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is this film comes with my highest recommendation is rated PG13 and runs 107 minutes.".

The film has a very unique atmosphere as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also without giving away the ending I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one nor is it onesided. Given how different they are there is a lot of conflict between them although they do love each other. Similarly what Dexter and his exwife feel for one another is never pure hatred but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.".

The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together shown only through one day July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute funny and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie that really anyone can enjoy if your looking for a romance movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer first up biased review as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature yet fated to be together. The premise is novel with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him always. But then his life is also hollow his friends shallow and in the end a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18 decide to remain lifelong friends and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life they are inexorably drawn towards each other dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts even if long lost when they do come together they do get together without any questions asked i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter their love story is so compelling and adorable that you become a part of their story you care for them you laugh with them and also cry you want them to do what you would do and yes you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathawaysuitably rumpled and grunge in the first half and elegance and grace personified in the second when she flashes her pearly whites the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh colourful London and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable till the very end. People and things change with time but memories remain the same. here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories a Must watch for mushy folks!".

A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10".

Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remakereboot which critics and public alike have grown tired of I feel fresh ideas should be applauded even if it doesn't quite work. For me however it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig An Education paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful especially a scene where our wouldbe lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor joy sadness regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy nor does it end like one. One Day is however easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.".

I personally could have done with one less event in their lives and perhaps a different ending but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship but the novel was about the people.

Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on selfconfidence as he is on drugs and alcohol he gets by on his looks  literally  he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years except none of that is in the movie so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching One Day without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing empty experience.

One Day was a movie I was looking forward to and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie what wasn't quite there was the nostalgiaevidence of it but could've been more and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said I loved the beautiful look of the film the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent the telling of the story is well pacedif somewhat glacial and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the late 80s a girl named Emma Anne Hathaway is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter Jim Sturgess. They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show while being warned by his sick mother Patricia Clarkson that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig An Education 2009 tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious unoriginal and simple one that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame just like in 500 Days of Summer 2009 but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine 2010 is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls adapting his own novel lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant rude promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her oversized glasses only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe 2007 and The Way Back 2010 is gifted too with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romanticcomedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes entirely predictably well you probably guessed as much from the trailer they made an utter pig's ear of it. The GoodAs Dex Jim Sturgess is decent  nails the look and the accent both of them. Rafe Spall as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine  although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped but hey it's not his story right? To be honest it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.It does have a few reflective moments of stillness which are incredibly welcome  mostly concerning Dex and family if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story here it favours Dex  but they're all too rare.The BadAll too rare because this one zips along like it's left the iron on no mean feat in an 108 minute movie galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997 for example literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know booktofilm adaptations bowdlerise to an extent but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough a previous David Nicholls' TV miniseries called 'I Saw You' starring Fay Ripley is practically a warmup for One Day and is absolutely wonderful  very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck usual story this would have benefited from a miniseries of its own. But then of course there's no money in Telly.At its worst the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly stalking Anne Hathaway. That twist at least is intact and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking 'workingclass Northener' you're distractedly thinking 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai who plays Sophie would have done better  dresseddown a bit. Or as often suggested Carey Mulligan. And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because you know specs always make people look dowdy apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well to Hathaway's own American accent in fact.The UglyThe more I think about this the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs as in the novel as it wouldn't suit her martyred character  and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered interesting character becomes a 2dimensional pouter pure and nunlike. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready waiting for him to finally come around and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive actually  and totally a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short it's not the very worst film in the world  it's just completely and utterly unremarkable SubRichard Curtis which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.".

Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough a previous David Nicholls' TV miniseries called 'I Saw You' starring Fay Ripley is practically a warmup for One Day and is absolutely wonderful  very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck usual story this would have benefited from a miniseries of its own. But then of course there's no money in Telly.At its worst the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly stalking Anne Hathaway. That twist at least is intact and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking 'workingclass Northener' you're distractedly thinking 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai who plays Sophie would have done better  dresseddown a bit. Or as often suggested Carey Mulligan. And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because you know specs always make people look dowdy apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well to Hathaway's own American accent in fact.The UglyThe more I think about this the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs as in the novel as it wouldn't suit her martyred character  and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered interesting character becomes a 2dimensional pouter pure and nunlike. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready waiting for him to finally come around and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive actually  and totally a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short it's not the very worst film in the world  it's just completely and utterly unremarkable SubRichard Curtis which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.";

	schema:reviewBody "In reading the reviews for this film it seems to me that most people who strongly disliked this film either didn't really pay attention to it or just didn't get it. One main example being the criticism that Emma loving Dex in the first place never made any sense. Yes he was a rascal in college but let's be honest he's exactly the kind of guy who got all the girls in college. After their near miss on the day they officially met they did in fact become friends. He's the only one who helps Emma move albeit grudgingly. And when she's feeling low about still working in that Mexican restaurant he's the one who gives her a pep talk and supports her and we can see he's sincere about what he tells her. When he loses his way and stops being a friend to her is when she breaks off contact with him. In fact losing her is part of what makes him shape up even though most of the credit is given to Sylvie. We later see however Sylvie is not the saving grace he thought she was.Also some say there was no chemistry between the leads Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. I suppose this is a subjective thing but in the beach scene where he rubs sunblock on her back I could FEEL heat coming off the screen for Pete's sake. Another criticism was Dex was a defeated man. I didn't see that at all. His television career was a big part of what led him astray. After it was over he had to reinvent himself starting from scratch. There's nothing defeated in a honest day's labor. This could be why Sylvie cheated and left as she married up but in the humbleness of working hard to get his feet back on the ground he did in fact become loving and decent just like his mother said he would and by the time he and Emma were ready to plan their wedding he was owner and operator of his own caf so he did become accomplished as well. He was hardly defeated. I loved the nuances of the story. How Dex's relationship with his parents is never explicitly spelled out in dialogue but we see how close he is with mom and how distant with dad through his interactions with them. I also loved the use of light to express time of day how the street lights go out at the beginning and when the end wraps up the story by returning to the rest of that first day they spend together the street lights go on as dusk approaches. Like Hathaway said they're talking and their souls are having a totally different conversation. That's the loveliness of this movie. Yes sad things happen but it ends on a very lifeaffirming note as if to say yes it was worth it. Loving each other breaks their hearts at different times and they think they might not even survive it but it was worth it. It truly touches the heart of those who bother to understand what's going on.".

I have not read David Nicholls' novel but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma Anne Hathaway has on her classmate Dexter Jim Sturgess. He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty  despite the ridiculous oversized glasses for the early scenes  and very intelligent and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the nonthreatening one with flopping standup comedian Ian played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe and a boring French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not however British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress but she is not British either. Seriously are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a moneygrubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable followup and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.".

This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However Anne Hathaway's character Emma Morley sounds at different times Irish Scottish and American but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter Jim Sturgess meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meetcute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other therefore fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light in fact he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director Lone Scherfig who made the brilliant An Education two years ago completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie but she only shows up in about twothree scenes moves the plot along and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had plenty of potential. Surely it was a consistently grim and depressing film but the themes about love and the main cast kept us interested. This movie had potential in which the aura of hope was strong enough to keep us wanting to see a nice resolutionin the midst of the depression. One Day could have been a wonderful film about love and friendship across different fields of time and distancesomething that only the film Before Sunset accomplished in every degree imaginable. And then came the third act. That bloody awful third act.One Day is a film that was running a certain direction and then totally flips the switch in the final third of the movie resulting in a jumbled mess of inconsistent themes inconsistent pace and just a story that seems like its only goal is to drive the audience to tears and suicidal thoughts. While it was accurately faithful to the book sometimes this is a bad thing as novels do have their pitiful moments See No Country For Old Men. Worst of all the screenplay was from the author so any hope of changing some of the material or some of the extremely weak parts of the novel were pretty much dead and gone.This movie is about a friendship between two characters that spans three different decades and we the viewer see where they are in their lives as they meet each other on the same day every year. Despite their scenario and financialmartialemotional status they find a way to see each other to catch up. Like I said before the script was from the same writer as the 2009 novel David Nicholls. Nicholls had a fresh concept a fresh twist to the romantic drama genre but in order to keep one step ahead of the reader he shifts gears in the final moments of the novelwinding up with a book I would most likely wind up hating. And all those events lead to a script that I wound up hating.The 2011 Summer Season has been a very disappointing one but we've had great performances left and right that have saved certain films Bad Teacher and propelled others to new heights Horrible Bosses. Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess kept my interest in the movie as they delivered fine performances that chronicled them at their happiest and at their downright most depressed. Sturgess had a lot more to work with because of the events on his side and he handled them quite tell. Hathaway despite using an accent not necessary if you ask me also did a fine job and being a naturally beautiful woman had to find a way to look unattractive and unappealing to the audiencemeaning she also had to do some tough work. The rest of the cast did a decent job but our main stars kept the film afloatuntil the third act.Lone Scherfig who directed the undertheradar Oscar bait An Education did quite well in spite of the frustrating material she was dealt with. She handled her shots quite well and sometimes let the visuals describe the emotions and mindset of our main characters. Sadly Scherfg's direction was marred by the editing which oddly left out some vital material and shuffled around some scenes awkwardly. If your movie is being done in chronological order why mess that up in the final act? Why skip out some of the better characterrelationshipbuilding scenes only to use them for the final act once their relationship has already been established? I'm telling you this third act is poison.Bottom Line An ending can make or break a movie it can erase some of the shortcomings in the first two acts or ultimately weaken the entire structure of the film. One Day's final act will leave you frustrated will leave you upset and it's not just because of the events that happen but in the manner that they are presented. Everything you were learning about the movie all the lessons and themes and nice moments the script was giving us are flung out of the window in favor of an unexpected finale that crushes the soul of the entire body of work. The ending of this review will remain consistent with the rest of the article Do not watch unless you are a fan of depression or subpar material.".

Anne Hathaway's character was this 21year old going on 50 year old who did a good impression of a frigid librarian whilst also managing to be very annoying and an absolute scunner. Jim Sturgess mental note  will avoid all films with him in future was a right banker only replace the 'b' with a 'w'. He had this terrible transatlantic slimy twit of an accent going on I didn't find him charming or enigmatic I just thought you're a right idiot.The film really missed a trick as well with the so called passing of time and context of the era. In the beginning scenes it was set in the 80s had they not told us this I would've thought it was 1940 by the way everyone was dressed costume design?. I also hate the way a lot of these films depict British people as if we've all got a bag of jorries in our mouth and we're as posh as the queen or something. Totally unrealistic and off the mark totally.The plot is totally predictable I guessed every major event in it. I felt no empathy towards the characters whatsoever. When Anne Hathaway's character got run over by a bus that was the highlight for me. I was watching it with my mum and even she commented that it was a shame that Jim Sturgess didn't get run over as well.Another small highlight was seeing Romola Garai playing Sylvie. It's a shame her character didn't have a larger role as she's a fantastic actress. 10 times better than that bore Anne Hathaway.In short don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this utter drivel. Cut your toenails or clean the oven instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read in Danny Peary's A Guide for the Film Fanatic that some people have formed a strong emotional attachment to this 1967 film. I am one of them. From the opening notes of Henry Mancini's evocative score personally I think it's his best work to the end where the main characters drive off into Italy after some verbal sparring this movie still provides the same pleasure it did when I first saw it on TV in the early seventies. Two for the Road is a time capsule of Carnaby Street fashion and French new wave scene juxtaposition but it remains timeless in its emotionally piercing view of marriage and in the beguiling presence of Audrey Hepburn. There will unlikely be an actress with more style or grace on screen and never has she seemed more sexy playful or innately human. It's a shame she never played a role as rich in texture as Frederic Raphael's script provides here. His dialogue is sharp and insightful as he has the main characters often repeat one another for the sake of getting a different meaning from the same line of dialogue.As Joanna and Mark Wallace Hepburn and Albert Finney get to live out more than a decade in their characters' lives from initial meeting to neardivorce. What makes the evolution more impressive is that the story is not a linear narrative but rather a series of five road trips that volley the viewer back and forth in the relationship. Finney provides a formidable match for Hepburn and he plays with the right mix of roguish insouciance and insecure ambition that doesn't make his character always likable but certainly believable. Their chemistry is palpable especially in the early days of their courtship as the movie makes hitchhiking the most romantic of adventures with the couple cutting through the entirety of France in various vehicles in record time. Only in the movies. The episode with the pretentious American tourist couple and their bratty daughter provides some biting and funny moments...ironically the actress portraying the wife Eleanor Bron is British. Not surprising that this movie was not such a huge hit stateside since the four Americans in the movie are portrayed in such an unflattering light.Regardless credit needs to go to director Stanley Donen himself an American who somehow pulls all these disparate elements together and uses his extensive Hollywood experience to bring a nice glossy sheen to the whole film. His third collaboration with Hepburn after Funny Face and Charade really turns into a tribute to her as she makes a remarkable transformation from nave choirgirl to jaded jetset housewife that goes well beyond the changing hairstyles and clothing. This is one to treasure.This wondrous film has been lovingly restored for its muchdelayed DVD release. The print quality has been significantly improved over the VHS tape I've had for over a decade. A nice bonus feature is a splitscreen beforeandafter short that shows the visual improvement. Best of all there is finally an audio commentary track to accompany the film and Donen provides illuminating insight on the elliptical narrative structure and the nonchronological juxtaposition of the scenes. He explains that the characters are reliving their memories by association with the feelings they are having in the present. His adoration of Hepburn is pervasive and understandable as he claims rightfully that this was her best performance they worked together three times. I just wish Finney was available to add his perspective. Moreover if you ever wondered why the young Jacqueline Bisset's voice doesn't sound like her at all he admits she was redubbed by another actress due to the blaring noise of generators during the location shooting. She apparently had already moved on to shoot her first Hollywood film. For those like me who adore this film the DVD is a mustbuy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is my favorite movie of all time. I just saw it 2 weeks ago and I've already watched it about 7 times. The way that Mark and Joanna's relationship is displayed through the time changes is excellent and while you'd think that keeping track of the time would be difficult it's actually quite simple if you look at the hair and the attitudes of the couple. Audrey Hepburn is magnificent one of her best performances ever and Albert Finney is charming as her workaholic husband. The MaxwellManchesters are hilarious especially the little girl Ruthie. Audrey is the bored wife trying to save the 12year marriage while Albert is the overworking bad tempered husband. The movie takes you through their three trips the first when their love affair began the second when she is pregnant with their first child and the third when their marriage is beginning to fail. Their love is displayed wonderfully and anyone can see that Hepburn and Finney were in love in real life too. The music is beautiful I love how it's played all throughout the movie. I think that it's one of the best parts of the whole movie but there wasn't a moment when I wasn't completely wrapped up in what was going on. This is a classic and I can't believe I'd never heard of it before I accidently picked it up at the video store. Anyone who is married or who's looking for some laughs should definitely watch this movie it's a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thank God that Audrey Hepburn made this film before slipping off into an extended temporary retirement. Was she too old for this movie? Not for the segments that deal with the latter part of the married relationship. The movie spans eleven years and yes it is a bit of a visual stretch to see a 37 year old Audrey portraying a 22 year old college woman but her performance throughout was nothing short of brilliant. This film was a tremendous departure for her. In Two for the Road she does not play the part of the doeeyed delicate creature of her earlier movies. She even abandoned reluctantly her trademark Givenchy wardrobe to sink her teeth into a gritty visceral part. Many critics of the time remarked on its art house appeal due in large part to the back and forth sequence editing and the clever juxtaposition of similarities parallels and contrasts in scenes spanning eleven years. The film must have been incredibly fresh and jarring in its day abandoning a linear narrative approach to the history of a marriage. Even today it comes across as very contemporary. Albert Finney delivers an equally strong performance. There is genuine chemistry between Finney and Hepburn. The viewer sees all that is wonderful and horrible about the dynamics of a couple that comes to realize that despite mutual infidelity they still love each other and belong to one another.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Dissection of a Marriage";
	schema:reviewBody "Under the glossy sheen of what was sold as a romantic comedy Stanley Donen's incomparable film Two for the Road is at heart the dissection of a relationship between two people over a decade of their life together. During the course of the film Mark and Joanna Wallace mature from two carefree young individuals into a union of two people which is stronger than the sum of its parts. Frederic Raphael's Oscarnominated screenplay relates the story of this couple through a series of car trips across France. The trips vary as the years pass and most are taken together although one is with another couple and one is with their young daughter. As the couple's affluence grows the cars become more expensive the clothes more stylish and the two partners more distant. Early in their lives Mark and Joanna note a man and woman sitting in a restaurant without looking or speaking to each other. Joanna asks What kind of people sit in a restaurant and don't talk to each other. Mark replies Married people. After a decade together Mark and Joanna sit in a restaurant together without speaking. While lacking the cynicism of Stephen's Sondheim's views on marriage Raphael makes his point.If the film had been told in a straightforward time line the results would have been ordinary at best. However Raphael has fractured time and the stories unravel in bits and pieces that are inter cut to compare and contrast Mark and Joanna and their relationship as it grows and reacts to life. Some of the cuts are amusing such as a scene when the couple is hitchhiking and a car passes them without stopping. Mark says I'll never pass a hitchhiker without stopping. The film jumps to Mark who during a subsequent trip passes a hitchhiking couple without even a glance at them. The cuts are not flashbacks however because the characters are not remembering the past. As the director Stanley Donen put it every scene is the present which makes the film a revolving prism that reflects various facets of the union of these two people at different points in their lives. Perhaps this unique structure is what has made the film so appealing to so many viewers. Everyone sees the film from his or her own experiences and stage of life. As the viewer matures and changes so does his or her relationship to the film and its characters.With a sophisticated script to work from the actors were at the top of their form. Arguably Audrey Hepburn has never been better and displayed a range unrivaled in her other films as she matures from a young collegiate on tour to a sophisticated but bored wife of a successful architect. Albert Finney was never more attractive and his chemistry with Hepburn is essential to the film's success. An American couple played to perfection by Eleanor Bron and William Daniels and their daughter Ruthie who travel with the Mark and Joanna on one trip are the film's comedy relief. The anal husband snobbish wife and insufferable child comprise a family that Joanna desperately does not want to become or to share an automobile with.Beautiful widescreen cinematography of the French countryside by Christopher Challis and one of Henry Mancini's finest scores only enhance this masterwork further. The collaboration of Henry Mancini Stanley Donen and Audrey Hepburn which worked so well on Charade reached a peak with Two for the Road. Like other films that used fractured time such as Citizen Kane and Memento Two for the Road does not pale under repeated viewings because the structure makes it difficult to anticipate the order of sequences and the film always seems fresh. Only the screenplay's overreliance on phrase repetition in the dialog exchanges and the ongoing gag about misplaced passports wear thin. But despite any minor quibbles this viewer is always willing to take another trip across France with Mark and Joanna. When the film draws to a conclusion and the couple cross a border both literally and figuratively their final exchange is Bitch Bastard. To which all I can add is Brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am only 20 years old and by no means close to marriage but from what people tell me marriage is a lot like what is portrayed on screen in Two For The Road. It details the relationship between a husband and wife who basically have a love hate relationship. It's not sugarcoated at all. Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are great but really do you expect anything different? Hepburn is really the only reason I know of this movie and I'm glad that I watched it. Most of the old movies always have the typical romantic feel to them. There are bumps in the road but really you know watching that in the end they will end up together. With this film it's unclear what the ending will be and that makes for a much more fun ride along the way.You can tell from the very opening scene that the two leads despise each other but then in the next segment they hadn't met. For me at first it was a bit jarring not knowing this film was going to take a different approach. It's told in the non linear and jumps around every 10 minutes or so. It's a very effective approach but there were times where I thought it was choppy. For this time of filmmaking it must have been extremely experimental doing a movie this way.There are times where Finney and Hepburn are unlikeable but even then it's hard not to root for this couple to somehow resolve their long term marriage. It seems that in order to have a successful marriage you have to be willing to make some big sacrifices and ultimately that's what it comes down to. I really liked the scenes in the middle of their relationship where you can start to see the flaws but at the same time you realize the young love that is blossoming. By the way can Audrey Hepburn be any more beautiful? She is around 40 years old in this movie and looks better than ever. It must be that long hair look...Not only is it a fun film to watch but it's a realistic one. It may not be a true story but it seems to depict a real marriage give many glimpses at how people deal with each other for several years and in the end if they can resolve or destroy their marriage.8.710".

	schema:headline " One of the Best Film Explorations About Marriage";
	schema:reviewBody "1967 was a clearly Audrey Hepburn's final peak as a leading lady. With Wait Until Dark and 'Two for the Road finished she would quietly divorce Mel Ferrer and sit out her final productive years as a movie star eventually marrying Andrea Dotti having another child and semiretire to her Roman apartment to raise her sons.  Eight more years would pass until she finally agreed to do 'Robin and Marian.  Well Audrey Hepburn is my alltime favorite movie star. This ethereal beauty with the dark expressive eyes elegant clotheshorse figure and unforgettable voice rarely made a mistake  in her career.  Here's another example of her infallible ability to find the right script.  If only Julia Roberts had paid closer attention. If you're going to draw your career to a close and I'm not sure she realized this was it no actress could do better than 'Two for the Road' and 'Wait Until Dark.  Audrey was such a natural screen presence and with 'Two for the Road' she had a wonderfullyhandsome leading man in Albert Finney there were strong rumors of a relationship during this film and completely at ease with a director she had successfully worked with in the pastStanley Donen.  Frederik Raphael's edgy comedydrama about a young and successful couple's courtship and marriage was completely in step with the time and when I rewatched it recently I was totally drawn into their world.  The young and carefree early years had the breezy  romance and charm of Hepburn's early romantic comedies.  As the story crisscrosses throughout the various years you can see Finney withdrawing as he doggedly pursues his architecture career.  You can see Hepburn's disappointment as she loses her husband to his work and most devastatingly to other women.  She is finds the right reaction when he discovers she has finally taken on a lover of her own and just when it looks like he's ready to forgive her Finney's character lashes out viciously.  Hepburn's look of utter horror at his cruelty is amazing. There's no violence here except emotional devastation and both actors deliver detailed and moving performances.  I like the fact that they seem to stay together the humor of their early years often in evidence he's always losing things and when she finds them he calls her bitch and she replies btard. I also like the fact that the script doesn't demonize Finney's character  or the lack of it.  Marriage is a twoway street here.  I'm a bit confused as to some of the criticism I read here of this movie.  TWO FOR THE ROAD  is an adult movie about adult relationships and stars two of the most appealing film stars of their era.  It is well directed and I was never confused about what is going on in any scene.  Eleanor Braun and William Daniel's are outstanding as the perfectly awful couple you'd never want to be stuck with in a car trip especially when their odious little girl comes along !   This I believe was Jacqueline Bissett's first film and you can tell right away she's got star quality.   But this is Audrey and Albert's show all the way.".

Here's another example of her infallible ability to find the right script.  If only Julia Roberts had paid closer attention. If you're going to draw your career to a close and I'm not sure she realized this was it no actress could do better than 'Two for the Road' and 'Wait Until Dark.  Audrey was such a natural screen presence and with 'Two for the Road' she had a wonderfullyhandsome leading man in Albert Finney there were strong rumors of a relationship during this film and completely at ease with a director she had successfully worked with in the pastStanley Donen.  Frederik Raphael's edgy comedydrama about a young and successful couple's courtship and marriage was completely in step with the time and when I rewatched it recently I was totally drawn into their world.  The young and carefree early years had the breezy  romance and charm of Hepburn's early romantic comedies.  As the story crisscrosses throughout the various years you can see Finney withdrawing as he doggedly pursues his architecture career.  You can see Hepburn's disappointment as she loses her husband to his work and most devastatingly to other women.  She is finds the right reaction when he discovers she has finally taken on a lover of her own and just when it looks like he's ready to forgive her Finney's character lashes out viciously.  Hepburn's look of utter horror at his cruelty is amazing. There's no violence here except emotional devastation and both actors deliver detailed and moving performances.  I like the fact that they seem to stay together the humor of their early years often in evidence he's always losing things and when she finds them he calls her bitch and she replies btard. I also like the fact that the script doesn't demonize Finney's character  or the lack of it.  Marriage is a twoway street here.  I'm a bit confused as to some of the criticism I read here of this movie.  TWO FOR THE ROAD  is an adult movie about adult relationships and stars two of the most appealing film stars of their era.  It is well directed and I was never confused about what is going on in any scene.  Eleanor Braun and William Daniel's are outstanding as the perfectly awful couple you'd never want to be stuck with in a car trip especially when their odious little girl comes along !   This I believe was Jacqueline Bissett's first film and you can tell right away she's got star quality.   But this is Audrey and Albert's show all the way.";

We see her progression from college coed to married woman with child all over the course of about 14 years. In the beginning she is a woman without experience and falls for the boyish charm of Albert Finney. During the course of their marriage it is she who evolves as she copes with being a parent and with his philandering. This movie portrays what happens to women who enter relationships as innocents who deal fairly and faithfully with their husbands only to be done dirt. Had this movie been made twenty years later we may have seen Joanna progress to a life without Mark and perhaps claim her own identity separate from his. The only movie contemporary to Two for the Road that deals realistically with a woman being trapped in a marriage with a cheating spouse is The Happy Ending with Audrey's contemporary the underrated Jean Simmons. I think that Two for the Road kind of craps out at the very end by simply devolving into a madcap Swinging 60s frolic as we see the characters kiss and make up and ride off into their highend Euro trash sunset.".

But those fans will have a big surprise coming for them with this littleseen gem her most free and spirited performance of her career. The film chronicles the 12year marriage of Joanna a sweet chorus girl and Mark Wallace an architect. Out of chronological orderI want to mention that this film came 30 years before Memento and 21 Grams were even conceivedthe film follows them from their first loveatfirstsight meeting to their bitter arguments and casual infidelities all on road trips to the same beach where they fell in love. Through the highs and the lows their love always shines through. Audrey had to let go of many safety nets to make this movie. For one she let go of her trademark Givenchey wardrobe as it would be unsuitable for the wife of an architect. The plot and filmmaking was unlike her usual Cinderellalike romantic comedies. Offscreen her marriage to Mel Ferrer was crumbling they would divorce only a year later. This film was an escape and she was never more vulnerable free or real in her whole film career. The chemistry she has with Albert Finney is so wonderful thanks mostly to the fact that for a rare time in her career she was given a male love interest who was close to her own age Finney was actually 7 years YOUNGER than Hepburn. They just seem to click like great film romances should. They deliver witty and bitter lines with precise timing utterly in tune with each other. This is a perfect romanticcomedydrama a film that rings true for anyone who is married or is just disillusioned with happilyeverafter films such as me. It may not be one of Hepburn's betterknown films but it's certainly one of her best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like a number of Audrey Hepburn's films Funny Face Charade Paris When It Sizzles and others Two for the Road is set in France but whereas those films were all set in Paris this one takes place in the French countryside. It opens with a British couple Mark and Joanna Wallace flying their white MercedesBenz roadster to Northern France. Their plan is to drive down through the country to SaintTropez where Mark an architect has a meeting with a wealthy client the idea being to combine business with pleasure. It quickly becomes apparent however that there are tensions in their marriage and the two are constantly bickering and quarrelling. As they journey through France they discuss and recall several earlier trips along the same route especially those in the earlier days of their marriage when their relationship was a happier one.Trying to explain the plot any further would be difficult because the story is told in an extreme nonlinear fashion abruptly switching without warning between scenes set in the present and those set in the past and mingling the events of one journey with those of another. The only way in which director Stanley Donen and scriptwriter Frederic Raphael attempt to maintain continuity is at each stage of the journey to juxtapose scenes of the present day with scenes set in the same geographical area during previous journeys.I have been a great fan of Audrey Hepburn ever since I fell in love with her watching Breakfast at Tiffany's as a teenager but even I have to admit that Two for the Road is both one of her weaker films and one of her weaker performances. It would seem that there are roles beyond the reach of even an actress of her talents and the role of a wife whose husband is tired of her appears to have been one of them. Now I am well aware that in real life Audrey was twice divorced but her screen persona at least in her comedies and this film is officially a comedy was almost invariably that of a beautiful playful enchanting and utterly adorable girl the sort of woman that no husband could possibly tire of unless he were either mad or a complete bastard. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson when a man is tired of Audrey Hepburn he is tired of life. Had Audrey been able to hint at a darker side to Joanna's personality Mark's disillusionment with married life might have been more understandable but Joanna comes across as just as totally lovable as every other Hepburn heroine from Sabrina to Suzy in Wait Until Dark and even though Audrey was 38 when she made the film just as beautiful.Albert Finney by contrast has no difficulty in playing a man whose wife is tired of him the problem here is that his Mark is so charmless and arrogant that it is difficult to understand why Joanna should have fallen for him in the first place or why their marriage should have lasted so long. Finney incidentally was seven years younger than Hepburn which must have made a refreshing change for an actress who spent much of the earlier part of her career playing the loveinterest to men old enough to be her father Bogart Fonda Astaire Harrison or nearly so Peck.As I said the film is officially a comedy and there are indeed some genuinely comic moments ranging from the slapstick to the satirical. An example of the former is the scene where Mark and Joanna's car runs out of control down a hill and ends up demolishing a barn that could have been something out of Buster Keaton. Most of the satire is at the expense of Mark's American exgirlfriend Cathy MaxwellManchester her pompous priggish husband Howard and their badlybehaved daughter Ruthie. Even though the film had an American director these scenes are based upon what were some fairly common British prejudices about Americans around this period and doubtless explain why the film was not a great success across the Atlantic.Unfortunately the film's comic elements do not sit very easily with its underlying serious theme the decline in the relationship between Mark and Joanna. This theme is also undermined by the film's unorthodox structure and nonlinear narrative which makes it difficult to follow the progress of that relationship or to understand what is going on. The movie was in its day considered experimental but not every experiment whether in science or the cinema is a successful one and I was left with the strong impression that the story of Mark and Joanna is one that could have benefited from a more conventional linear style. 510".

That trip involves a delicious sequence in which both Joanna and Mark are seen riding in different vehicles as they hitchhike throughout France to the Mediterranean.The film is a series of flashbacks that point out to hilarious times on the road as they vacation in France and twelve years later when they as a couple seem to have failed miserably in spite of the fun times they always cherished. The death of their young daughter weighs heavily on both something that begins to pull them apart. As a couple they appear to have taken each other for granted because of the pain caused by their terrible loss.One of the trips offers a hysterical trip Joanna and Mark took with Howard and Cathie Manchester and their small bratty daughter Ruthie. Cathie had been involved with Mark but now is the prim and proper wife of the fastidious Howard a man that has no initiative and must account up to the last penny of their expenses. Needless to say they prove to be too much for Joanna and Mark.Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney show an easy chemistry in all their scenes. Ms. Hepburn looks radiant as usual. Mr. Finney the dashing young English actor is also effective in the complex role of Mark. William Daniels and Eleonor Bron are perfect as the Manchesters. The young and gorgeous Jacqueline Bisset has a small part in the picture.

	schema:reviewBody "It's easily the worst I've seen in months. It was hitting notes that were really hurting my ears and it kept hitting those same notes over and over and over and over again. I thought I was going to die. I can't believe I even finished it. I passed the excruciating two hours by creating an elaborate fantasy wherein I torture each of the artists involved with the film in the most sadistic ways possible except Audrey of course whom I would be rescuingAhem. Anyway my God I hated this movie. I mostly blame Frederic Raphael the screenwriter who comes up with a nice gimmick. The film retells the story of a marriage whose participants are Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney in a somewhat random order telling the stories of their various vacations from when they meet to when other lovers come between them. Unfortunately the script is in search of an arch. I need some sort of path to follow emotionally but instead we get everything randomly. Any scene near the end could just as easily be transported with any scene from the beginning. The film wouldn't be any more confusing for the most part. So we're hitting these ups and downs of the couple's lives pretty steadily and it just starts to get as repetitive as hell. Worse yet the dialogue is some of the most horrible ever. It's clever at a certain low level but the same bit of cleverness hit over two thousand times in a single movie is enormously torturous. Reminds me of David Mamet. I tried tried hard to keep my mind on Audrey because I love her so so much but I couldn't. Her costumes were really nice but that's about the extent of how pleasant I can be. I so wanted to beat Albert Finney to death with a street sign. And every supporting actor is so obnoxious which is the perfect word to describe this movie it's the single most obnoxious piece of tripe ever committed to celluloid.".

But I never found out what she saw in him. From the start he seems to be an egotistical lout. This is certainly not a comedy as presold in the trailer but it most definitely is an adult love story.

The HepburnFinney 'magic' has been talked of in the same vein.So before watching this film I felt there were four strong reasons to expect good things from it.I was disappointed on all counts.Hepburn is too old for the role Finney not a romantic lead is miscast.Despite rumours that for Hepburn their affair was much more than just a fling there is absolutely no chemistry at all between her and Albert Finney.However the film's biggest flaw is the Godawful smart arse gimmicky script that is so dated it's untrue.This was obviously made at a time when unimaginative dialogue where one character offers a slight variation on what the other character has just said was clearly seen as sharp and witty.ExampleFinney on seeing a miserable couple That's marriage for you.Hepburn That's marriage for them.Finney That's marriage full stop.In a word... terrible.There are many other examples.The supporting characters irritate as well.Sure the MaxwellManchester's are meant to be an annoying couple but my God that was blatantly obvious from the moment they appeared so there was no need to give them so much screen time. This ensured that not only were Finney and Hepburn driven crazy by them but the entire audience were as well.I hoped the MaxwellManchester's would be involved in a horrific car accident at some point in the film alas it never happened.Also there are inevitable problems in trying to make a film where the principal characters age from their late teens to their early 30s. At some point someone is either going to look far too young or far too old.The fact that Hepburn is too old to play early 30s let alone a youthful teenager further exacerbates this problem.Finney is a very talented actor but he sometimes chooses roles outside his range. He was great in 'Tom Jones' oozing charisma and marvellous in 'The Dresser' where he should have won the Oscar.But he was staggeringly bad as Poirot in 'Murder on the Orient Express'. Many will disagree with this but I felt he was pretty average in 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' the film that first brought him acclaim.He went from talking twice as loud as he needed to in 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' to speaking twice as slow as he needed to here.He often reminded me of the way someone tries to talk when waking up from a deep sleep or when someone visits an old partially deaf relative in a nursing home lingering slowly over every word to make sure it registers.This film is pretty bad it has to be said a bad story not worth filming and a poor screenplay that prevents it from ever being remotely interesting.The music was pretty good though...".

His favorite one is going through Germany posing as an American GI of Teutonic extraction. Whenever he spots a girl he likes he takes a Polarod picture of her house knocks on the door waving the photo and pretending to be on a pilgrimage to this very cottage his grandmother so vividly described. It is an infallible system for a hitandrun seduction. Benson seems content with his game until he meets Jameson a real operator who has learned to combine sex with money. Jameson poses as an exiled prince and not only gets women to share his bed but also to bestow their jewels on him for the sake of the counterrevolution. Benson decides to corner Jameson's market on sex plus finance. A contest develops and whoever wins will dominate a small Riviera resort as King of the Mountain the film's original title. Remade in 1988 as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw it in the late '60's on TV when I was home from school. Years later I became a screenwriter and got a call from David Bowie's production company. He and Mick jagger wanted to do a movie together and hoped I would write it. I suggested doing a remake of Bedtime Story with Bowie as Lawrence Jamison and Mick as Freddy.They were both interested the studio UA was interested but the movie had been made at Universal and there was no way they could get the rights. A number of other studios were interested but couldn't wrestle the right away from Universal.Turns out no had bothered to do a copyright search. I did. Turns out the rights had reverted back to the original writerproducer Stanley Shapiro. We met at the Pink Turtle a coffee shop at what was the Beverly Wilshire and did a deal on a napkin.The original title was King of Hill. Since Stanley was the man behind the Doris DayRock HudsonCary Grant movies  he decided to write with Maurice Richlin  who went on to pen the original Pink Panther a movie where Cary Grant and Rock Hudson would compete for Doris Day.Apparently Cary had asked Rock to do a movie with him but Rock had turned him down. So Cary didn't want to do a movie with Rock. And Doris wouldn't do the movie without the both of them. Hence it was recast with Niven Brando and Shirley Jones.Stanely said this movie didn't do all that well in its original run. He felt that the movie fell flat in the south because of Brando championing civil rights.Thought I do prefer my ending but this is nevertheless a very charming movie. Which is why I tried to preserve as much as the original as possible. Hey if ain't broke don't fix it. And certainly don't change it.".

	schema:reviewBody "...the original version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels a 1988 comedy. I just saw the original again for the first time in years and found this tale of two competitive French Riviera con artists fleecing rich women a charming polished delight.David Niven is perfectly cast bringing his charm and droll humour to the role of the wealthy well established con artist working in collaboration with the corrupt captain of police to suavely pluck the rich female tourists arriving in his affluent but small Mediterranean town without their ever knowing that they have been plucked. Along though comes a brash American con artist interloper Marlon Brando threatening to spoil the pickings for Niven. From there the story takes off.The film looks like parts of it may have been filmed in the Riviera adding considerably to the sunshine kissed affluent atmosphere of this handsome production. And there is often some rather clever dialogue. At one point Brando in talking to the French town police officer says She caught me with another woman. You're French. You understand. To be with another woman that is French replies the Frenchman To be caught that is American. That same line of dialogue by the way would reappear in the remake Stanley Shapiro has writing credit on both films.Niven brings his expected aplomb to his role. Did any actor ever look more at home in a white tuxedo? But Brando is an unexpected pleasure to watch in this film as well gleefully leaping into the role of the lower class brash Yankee ready to exploit the gullibility of innocent women. At one point Niven says to him By no stretch of the imagination would I associate myself with someone like you. You're crude. Well so is oil until you refine it into high octane gasoline says Brando wanting to be taught all the tricks of sophisticated film flammery at the hands of an old master like Niven.Both Bedtime Story and its Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remake are well worth viewing. Where the remake has an edge over the original though is in the casting of Steve Martin who has a few sequences of physical comedy brilliance when he poses as Ruprecht Niven's brain addled brother who acts at times like he's almost half monkey. These scenes are hysterically funny thanks to Martin. Michael Caine plays the Niven role in the remake and he's more than fine.The real difference  the ending of the original shows the remaining romance of the production code era that love can flourish even under the most lurid of circumstances. The remake's ending shows all the cynicism that you would expect in a postWatergate postVietnam world. Both endings work well. I'll let you watch and find out what I mean.".

Even so he is definitely hilarious his facial expressions alone are sometimes able to make me laugh out loud. The film does also offer a quite convincing demonstration of Marlon Brando's talent as a comic performer and furthermore that his capabilities as such has been unjustly underappreciated.

It may be true that all of Brando's most memorable performances are of the dramatic kind Stanley Kowalski in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and Terry Malloy in ON THE WATERFRONT being two obvious examples. However I do not accept this as a valid reason to entirely neglect his attempts at other kinds of roles. Brando himself may have felt that he couldn't do comedy well but he did admit in his autobiography 30 years later that he found making BEDTIME STORY a delight possibly the only time he truly enjoyed working in a film. He claimed to have laughed so hard during certain scenes that he often had to leave the room but even then it was hard for the performers to ignore his howls of laughter.BEDTIME STORY is an entirely undemanding piece of entertainment a very light comedy indeed but also a very enjoyable one if you are in that kind of mood and just wants to laugh after a stressful day.".

Brando's scheme at the beginning of the movie to seduce the beautiful peasant girl by aging a Poloroid picture of her farmhouse claiming it was the home his grandmother lived in gives some insight to his character. The fact that Brando is just in it for the sex and Niven is doing it for big money sets the plot for the rest of the movie. Niven sees this interloper as a threat and we are off to the races for the rest of the plot. Both Michael Cane and Steve Martin did a good job in the remake but the BrandoNiven combination is unforgettable. Too bad it is not available on DVD for the US market. A British PAL version was released in 2004. I hope the USDVD is not far behind.".

Niven not wanting any competition arranges a small frame up with the cooperation of the police chief Aram Stephen. Of course when Brando gets wise to it they're forced into a partnership of sorts.Niven sort of glides right into a part that he's done on many occasions in this case not even having to rely solely on his considerable charm to carry a weak film.

	schema:headline " Yes Brando Could Do Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This film has a history of name confusion to rival Hitchcock's SECRET AGENT SABOTAGE and SABOTEUR or HERE COMES MR. JORDAN HEAVEN CAN WAIT and HEAVEN CAN WAIT. There is a 1941 comedy with Loretta Young and Frederic March called BEDTIME STORY about Broadway theater people. Then this film was created in 1964 and marked the only time David Niven and Marlon Brando costarred in a comedy. Then the 1964 comedy was remade in 1988 with Michael Caine and Steve Martin in the Niven and Brando film but was now called DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS. That is the title that shall always be recalled with this story especially since it has been turned into a successful musical show in London and New York City. Truth be told I favor the 1988 version because the two male leads manage to squeeze more reality out of their characters than Niven and Brando did. Brando had too much intelligence for playing the slovenly conman Freddy Benson while Steve Martin showed his intellectual limitations far better. Niven got carried away showing Jamieson's intellectual philanthropy from the proceeds of his swindles while Caine took the same material and showed it for what it really was  an emotional hobby. That said the 1964 film was good within it's own limits not notable for nearly a quarter century. The only other alteration was a final surprise which makes the remake much superior.Lawrence Jamieson has set himself up in a mansion on the gold coast of the Riviera and attracts wealthy women with the assistance of the local police chief  who is in his pay. He convinces wealthy women pretending he is doing it in a noble cause to give him thousands of dollars for the purpose of freeing his country from the tyrants it is obvious he is supposed to be a deposed Balkan monarch fighting the Communists. The con is perfect and the machinery is well oiled. But along comes Freddy Benson an American conman who threatens to ruin the con Jamieson sets up. They try to work together for awhile but Jamieson sees Freddy as an apprentice at best a junior partner and that irks Freddy. So they set up a bet  winner takes over the local Riviera town as his preserve. They will both go after a new target and whoever gets 10000.00 from her first wins. Soon a young American woman Shirley Jones shows up as the American Soap Queen. Freddy pretends that he is a soldier suffering from some psychological shock that has left him crippled he is actually spoofing in part his serious performance in his first movie THE MEN where he was a crippled war hero. Jamieson pretends he is a famous Vienese psychologist who Freddie claims he has tried to contact. And the film gets into a series of feints and pretenses that both men play on each other to get them out of the way while they work out their wiles on Jones. Jones is a perfectly decent type who gradually is very attracted to Brando. SPOILERS COMING UP.It turns out that Jones is the winner of a big contest from the American Soap Company and she is not a millionaire. Niven learns this first and then Brando. But Brando has slowly gotten to like Jones too so he ends up returning to America with her as her husband. Niven accepts that he must struggle on as a bachelor to the end  and heads back to the glittering life of the Riviera.That is not how the remake ended. Jones' character turned out to be a very successful female conartist who beats Caine and Martin. Caine of course fully appreciates the artistry of the woman Martin's just angry but she returns as she sees both men can be useful partners to her schemes especially the smarter Caine. So the three of them go after their rich prey with glee at the end.The remake had the better ending...hand's down! It kept the surprises coming up to the conclusion of the film. But the original had some nice moments. Brando playing the silent assistant to Niven as his apprentice has to play a halfwit brother Prince to Niven's exiled King Prince Rupprecht who wears Napoleon suits. He also towards the end does a nice brief imitation of Niven as the art and culture lover admiring a Stradavarius violin. The Chief of Police helping Niven also has an interesting plan to get rid of Brando with a gun whose fingerprints will lead to a weird historical dead end you have to hear the plan to understand it. So I would recommend the film as a worthy comedy but one that eventually was far improved upon.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a bedtime fairy tale with princes wolves and preyedupon damsels castles and woods.  Fairy tales are often designed to be instructive or to inculcate a moral.  'Bedtime Story' is instructive  we learn how to cheat lie humiliate plot bribe wager impersonate amuse and is cheerfully amoral.  Like the traditional fairy tale it ends in marriage which is another word for souldestroying prison the final trap set by a master conman.'Story' is one of the few genuinely funny comedies from the 1960s and I can't understand why it hasn't been acclaimed as such or developed even a cult following.  It may not be very cinematically inventive but there are sequences here of such audacity cruelty and gasping hilarity that it puts even the Peter Sellers bits of 'The Pink Panther' movies to shame. Its influence furthermore can be seen in two of the most important films of the last five years.  Like 'In the Company of Men' two men  coldly wager on winning the affections of an innocent woman.  Like 'The Idiots' one of the characters pretends to be disabled to 'subvert' bourgeois normality in this case to wring money and jewels from them.  Maybe this is why comment on the film is silent some people confusing a character as morally callous as Freddy Benson who would impersonate the disabled for his own gain with a general attitude of mockery towards the disabled.  It is true that these scenes are very uncomfortable which is why they are so eyepoppingly funny maybe it IS offensive to use being disabled as character shorthand  even though it is a good metaphor for Brando's physicality being paralysed by mental grace he still gets to walk up again.I don't know.  I loved 'Me Myself and Irene' too.  Maybe I'm not a nice person.  The film's air of cold bonhomie extends to its structure which operates with a mathematical precision appropriate to its German setting not only in its three act structure introduction of characters working together final wager but in the way in introduces its characters seperately before putting them together like a theorem or a chemical experiment.  The chief joy of this film is the way it plays on their stars' very welldeveloped personae both public and private David Niven is the conman with perfect English elegance and etiquette with suave quick alert movements figuring the practical clockwork in his head whose sense of morality and decency conveniently gets competition out of the way.  His performance plays most obviously on his 'Pink Panther' role but there is a touch of Phileas Fogg in his Freudian doctor impersonation which allows him to inflict clinically methodical cruelty to uproarious results. Brando meanwhile is a comic revelation.  Like Robert De Niro his serious dramatic roles are always laced with a menacing selfaware humour but his straight comic vehicles have been humorless mugfests.  He is in his element here as the kind of brash unprincipled cheating thieving blackmailing American the real Brando despises making fun of the solemn brilliance of his best films especially 'The Men' with that familiar Brando whine and hurtbabyfaceintoughguybody look. Because this is a film about acting about two of cinema's greatest performers from totally different traditions trying to outskill each other there is genuine admiration to be seen as each watches the other do his stuff just as each character's bluff is outbluffed by the other.  And this is what gives this marvellous film its depth the idea of acting in life of assuming roles of constructing identities as a necessary defence against the stolid domesticity to which Brando is apparently condemned.  The film seems to have a moral after all  better the settled married man over the aging 'free' bachelor which Jameson acknowledges while mocksadly making off to indulge that freedom.".

It is true that these scenes are very uncomfortable which is why they are so eyepoppingly funny maybe it IS offensive to use being disabled as character shorthand  even though it is a good metaphor for Brando's physicality being paralysed by mental grace he still gets to walk up again.I don't know.  I loved 'Me Myself and Irene' too.  Maybe I'm not a nice person.  The film's air of cold bonhomie extends to its structure which operates with a mathematical precision appropriate to its German setting not only in its three act structure introduction of characters working together final wager but in the way in introduces its characters seperately before putting them together like a theorem or a chemical experiment.  The chief joy of this film is the way it plays on their stars' very welldeveloped personae both public and private David Niven is the conman with perfect English elegance and etiquette with suave quick alert movements figuring the practical clockwork in his head whose sense of morality and decency conveniently gets competition out of the way.  His performance plays most obviously on his 'Pink Panther' role but there is a touch of Phileas Fogg in his Freudian doctor impersonation which allows him to inflict clinically methodical cruelty to uproarious results. Brando meanwhile is a comic revelation.  Like Robert De Niro his serious dramatic roles are always laced with a menacing selfaware humour but his straight comic vehicles have been humorless mugfests.  He is in his element here as the kind of brash unprincipled cheating thieving blackmailing American the real Brando despises making fun of the solemn brilliance of his best films especially 'The Men' with that familiar Brando whine and hurtbabyfaceintoughguybody look. Because this is a film about acting about two of cinema's greatest performers from totally different traditions trying to outskill each other there is genuine admiration to be seen as each watches the other do his stuff just as each character's bluff is outbluffed by the other.  And this is what gives this marvellous film its depth the idea of acting in life of assuming roles of constructing identities as a necessary defence against the stolid domesticity to which Brando is apparently condemned.  The film seems to have a moral after all  better the settled married man over the aging 'free' bachelor which Jameson acknowledges while mocksadly making off to indulge that freedom.";

Niven is perfect here even better than Michael Caine and I love Shirley Jones Janet Walker not Colgate in anything but they are not enough to bring this marginal comedy any higher than '7' of 10.Plus 'Bedtime Story' was obviously filmed on a set with filmed scenes of Germany and southern France shown in the background.

The story is mostly the same an elegant English conman on the Riviera is annoyed to find his pitch invaded by an uncouth American huckster. They briefly become partners then rivals.In the original the leads are taken by David Niven and Marlon Brando of all people. But it's a comedy masterclass  in how not to do comedy. Just about every scene in the remake milks the full comic potential far better.In DRS there's a scene where Freddie the Yank conman is thrown into a French jail. Steve Martin has a loud check shirt a big white Panama hat and big shades he's the epitome of the loud American abroad and out of his depth as leaning against the barshe goes all self pitying and pleading to the unimpressed French inspector. Watching the original we find that Martin filched the entire performance from Brando with one crucial difference  Martin is funny. Brando  he just ain't funny...At one point Freddie is asked if he has a reliable local character witness. Martin goes through a minute of exasperated tipofhistongue recall jumping up and down banging his head until he gets it at last. Brando just gives him the name. Brando seems to be enjoying himself but Martin has the comic's gleeful sadismmasochism towards his character's plight.Later you may recall Caine is required to impersonate a German psychotherapist. He has a cold sadistic tone that works well against Martin's horrified incredulity. Niven who plays the same role is called upon to impersonate a Swiss doctor. And just plays him as Niven with the same voice and everything. Critics say Caine is always the same but Niven though urbane really is shown to be a onenote actor in this.The comic scenes are generally leaden though to be fair Martin borrowed Rupret's hulking suspicious demeanor from Brando except again he's funny and Brando is not. Worst of all the film ditches the surprise twist of DRS ending with a real cop out.They could have cast it with Jerry Lewis as Freddie and maybe Dean Martin as the smooth one or even as a Hope and Crosby vehicle.

If you've only seen the insipid remake Dirty Rotten Scoundrels relax you're in for a treat so settle down and see how the Big Boys do it. On paper Niven and Brando shouldn't work representing as they do diametrically opposed styles but on screen and against the odds it works splendidly and Shirley Jones has just the right volume of 'niceness' to make the perfect foil. A barrel of laffs whichever way you slice it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was director Ralph Levy's first feature film  he made only one more Do Not Disturb  and if he seems assured at directing light comedy it's because he spent several years directing the likes of Burns and Allen Jack Benny Lucille Ball etc on TV. Cowriter Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning had written between them several Doris DayRock HudsonCary Grant movies so everything was in place for highly polished classy sophisticated goingson with a very welcome  especially today  slice of nonPC. If you've only seen the insipid remake Dirty Rotten Scoundrels relax you're in for a treat so settle down and see how the Big Boys do it. On paper Niven and Brando shouldn't work representing as they do diametrically opposed styles but on screen and against the odds it works splendidly and Shirley Jones has just the right volume of 'niceness' to make the perfect foil. A barrel of laffs whichever way you slice it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't figure it out until a third of the way through this movie but Bedtime Story is the original version of the beloved comedy and subsequent Broadway musical Dirty Rotten Scoundrels! The two movies are so incredibly similar from the writing to the acting that no matter which one you watch first you'll be in for a hilarious evening. There's really only one little difference and while I prefer the way the original was written the remake is still very cute.David Niven as studly as ever is a conman who preys on rich American women. He pretends to be a royal prince desperately in need of money to free his enslaved people and after a seduction the women gladly surrender their jewelry and checkbooks. Marlon Brando not particularly studly also cons women in giving him moneyfor his nonexistent sick grandmother who needs an operation. The characters are introduced separately to the audience and each set of scenes is totally hilarious. When they finally reunite on the screen there's a sidesplittingly funny battle of the wits as they try to top each other in the con game. I could tell you more of the plot but there's really no need. The first fifteen minutes is funny enough on its own to make you want to watch the entire rest of the movie. Stanley Shapiro'sthe Oscarwinning writer of Pillow Talkand Paul Henning's script is quick witty clever and charming. I highly recommend watching Bedtime Story or Dirty Rotten Scoundrels whenever you need a good laugh. You'll be laughing for days.".

	schema:headline " Very funny dated comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Bedtime Story is a very funny film but it might leave some with an off taste in their mouth. That's in the subtlety and delivery of some of the comedy. Since its remake in 1988 Dirty Rotten Scoundrels it's only natural to compare the two films. I don't know if there's any hard data but Hollywood has a mixed record of successes and failures in movie remakes. My guess is that three out of four don't pan out or certainly don't exceed the original film. Some that have been highly successful have had two or more remakes. In this case though the remake Dirty Rotten Scoundrels of 1988 far surpasses this original. And this original is quite good. The difference is in a few things. The first is the jettison in the remake of some of the extraneous material that takes quite some time in the original. The fact of Lawrence Jameson David Niven supporting some of the arts as a heroic charity for cultural posterity seems to be to build his character up in the eyes of the 1964 audience as somewhat justifiable for what he does. That minor subplot detracts from the main plot and the humor. The early scenes of Freddy Benson Marlon Brando in the Army running illegal activities on his Army camp in Germany and seducing German frauleins probably was intended to paint him as the less honorable of the two scoundrels in this film. But those scenes aren't that funny and are a further detraction from the main plot and humor. Another difference is more subtle. Marlon Brando's Freddy comes close to being a misogynist. He disdains women except to conquer them in bed. His persona seems to have a little meanness about him. Steve Martin's Freddy is out to take the women for their money and he is attracted to them otherwise. Then there's the difference in both leads in both films and their delivery and humor. Brando was a great actor but only soso as a comedian. He is too selfassured in his composure and glances in this film. Steve Martin is a good actor and a great comedian. His persona comedy delivery and character are naturally more funny. David Niven was a very good actor and he could do comedy well as the straight man and con man think Pink Panther. Michael Caine is a great actor and he's superb at comedy. Then there's the overall dialog of Brando's Freddy. It's very dated with the use of slang that the remake has eliminated. He talks to Jameson and repeatedly says Oh dad. When Jameson tells him the name of Sir Walter Raleigh he says That's the goof. He says to Jameson Let me put some new colors in your paint box. And later he says Have some gigs. When he outs Jameson on his con operation he says Up my octane big daddy. Even Jameson gets in the act on the train when he says they have arrived at Deadsville.I appreciate the background that screenwriter Dale Launer gives in his review of Bedtime Story. He collaborated with the original writer Stanley Shapiro on the 1988 remake. Shapiro told him this movie didn't do all that well in its original run. He said it fell flat in the south possibly because of Brando's civil rights efforts. I think there may have been more than that about the film's mild reception. Most notably among American servicemen from Germany and their families and people who were paying attention to the news in Europe. I'm quite familiar with that period because I was stationed in the U.S. Army in West Germany from early 1962 to late 1964. After the Berlin Wall went up in 1961 the U.S. began building up its forces in Germany. Since the end of the occupation forces in May 1955 the American forces part of NATO had dwindled to little more than a paper tiger. Studies and news of the time reported that fact. Along with the American forces buildup GermanAmerican relations had been on the decline. A 1961 movie touches on this somewhat  A Town Without Pity. The subject of that movie  rape of a German girl by American GIs was not an isolated instance. In 1963 a brutal rape and murder happened near where I was stationed and it involved a GI from my base. Overseas Weekly newspaper we called it Oversexed Weekly for obvious reasons reported regularly on scandals and local crimes involving American servicemen. I would bet that Bedtime Story didn't go over well in West Germany. So this movie is about  and should focus on the two scoundrels and their differences joining of forces parting of ways and final competition to see who will be king of the mountain. The extraneous stuff before and in between should be minimal and only used when it adds to the plot and the humor. The remake  also written by Stanley Shapiro with Dale Launer cuts the calories and fat from the original and gives us a hearty wonderful cut of a film that viewers can really enjoy for its nonstop humor. And while the ending in this film was okay  even good for its day the surprise ending in the remake is over the top hilarious and brilliant. Here are some funny lines from the film. Check the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page for more humorous dialog.Lawrence Jameson You do have a sort of brutish appeal to women. You're certainly unprincipled. Lying and cheating come naturally to you. You're completely without moral qualms. Freddy Benson There you see. Everybody's got a good side if you look for it.Freddy Look daddy you wanna play 'Robin Hood' okay. But don't shoot my arrows. There's one thing the archaeologists aren't gonna dig up and that's Freddy's money 'cause I'm spending it right now. So hand it over taxfree.".

The Childrens Jury at the Stuttgart Film Festival 2003 voted it Best Childrens Film at the festival.Two kids  about 11 years old  Marcello and Fatima meet and like each other very much. Both have dreams and problems. Marcello wants to fly but feels like an absolutely useless human being Fatima wants to play soccer  which is not acceptable for her muslim family. But then they start to support each other in a very delicate and subtle manner...The film combines realistic moments and problems with dreams and imagination especially Marcellos. I.e. there is a statue of Jesus Christ waking up and talking to him in a humoristic way. Grownups will maybe have some problems with that but children like the fact that the world consists of both  reality and their imagination.Children and their way seeing the world are taken seriously in this film which is very rare in feature films for children!Very good for Children aged ca. 8  12.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the best movies for kids Ive ever seen. Children  mine included  like it a lot and thats most important for a kids film. The Childrens Jury at the Stuttgart Film Festival 2003 voted it Best Childrens Film at the festival.Two kids  about 11 years old  Marcello and Fatima meet and like each other very much. Both have dreams and problems. Marcello wants to fly but feels like an absolutely useless human being Fatima wants to play soccer  which is not acceptable for her muslim family. But then they start to support each other in a very delicate and subtle manner...The film combines realistic moments and problems with dreams and imagination especially Marcellos. I.e. there is a statue of Jesus Christ waking up and talking to him in a humoristic way. Grownups will maybe have some problems with that but children like the fact that the world consists of both  reality and their imagination.Children and their way seeing the world are taken seriously in this film which is very rare in feature films for children!Very good for Children aged ca. 8  12.";

Godard consequently examined his theory that to live in Paris in 1966 one had to prostitute oneself to survive. The narrative is shot through the eyes of Juliette Marina Vlady a Parisian housewife.

You should feel about a woman. You can't kiss a movie.The film does have enough spice to tantalise prurient tastes middleclass parttime hooker. Yet our storyline is no tempestuous avalanche of excitement crashing to a windswept climax. Godard uses it as an attack on fiction itself. In doing so he questions how we fictionalise our very lives. Buying into lifestyles or accepting dominant themes in merchandising and politics. Pax Americana jumbosized advertising as a voiceover proclaims.Performances are excellent. Cinematography has plenty of Godard's hallmark arresting features. The film integrates a political kick more successfully than many of his attempts. But the real thrill is an intellectual one. 2 or 3 Things I Know about Her appeals to the philosophically inclined. For this viewer it is a film to watch and rewatch many times enjoying the test of ideas. A work of great beauty. It also transports Godard to being more than just a filmmaker.An exemplary demonstration and examination of Brechtian technique it is more than a purely cinematic use of Bernold Brecht's 'alienation' effect. Godard uses it to make the viewer examine the nature sensory perception and the almost existential convenience of any definition of truth.Peter Wollen in his essay 'Godard and Counter Cinema' described how the director was working towards a political rationale for his attack on fiction. Fictionmystificationbourgeois ideology. But Wollen acknowledges that initially Godard's fascination is more connected with the misleading and dissembling nature of appearances the impossibility of reading an essence from a phenomenal surface of seeing a soul through and within a body or telling a lie from a truth.The basis for all this is a story of Paris  it could be the 'her' of the title. Galloping consumerism. Policies determined by economics not people. Demolition and construction at an alarming pace. While the ordinary decent person cannot keep up. If you can't afford LSD buy a colour TV.Our 'ordinary decent person' is an attractive woman on the balcony of highrise. Our voiceover describes a few things about her. As she turns her head he describes her again. Same description. Different name. The first time the real actress Marina Vlady. Then she is the character Juliette Janson. Her hair is dark auburn or light brown says the voiceover I'm not sure.The voiceover Godard himself in a conspiratorial whisper switches back and forth between politics and Juliette's situation leaving us in no doubt over parallels. The two are then linked diegetically The government is disrupting the nation's economy not to mention its basic moral fibre.Johnson's futile bombing campaigns in the Vietnam also come under attack. One of Juliette's clients is a war reporter. She does a 'double  allnighter' with her colleague Marianne which includes parading naked with flight bags over their heads. We are treated to intercut pictures of napalmed victims.Although it is one of Godard's cleverest and most rounded attacks on capitalism the film comes into its own as he questions the nature of reality neatly linked up using gender politics. What is language Mummy asks Juliette's youngster. Language is the house man lives in she answers. Examples of maledominated language pervade the film from street hoardings to bright signage both used as intertitles.Language is not 'objective' and defines how we view things rather than just what they 'are'. Juliette's husband is proud of how clever she is finding a car at a 'bargain' price. She doesn't reveal to him how she is helping things along.Juliette is objectivised both in the story  with our conscious collusion  and by her habit of turning to the camera to address us directly as Vlady the actress commenting on the character speaking about her and through her.Yet Godard attempts to rise above maleorientated perception. Should I have talked about Juliette or the leaves . . . since it's impossible to do both at once? Perhaps our use of language extends to our thinking where it can be equally subverted. Now I understand the thought process says Juliette It's substituting an effort of the imagination for an examination of real objects. A more precise definition is developing. What is an object? It is something we pass from subject to subject to allow us to live together. Arbitrary agreements a language an arbitrary 'reality.'But it is not all dour. Take love. True love changes you false love leaves you as you are. Juliette seems unaffected by her double life as a hooker. She applies garish red lipstick before servicing a client. But her studied indifference would tend to make her one must assume a rather unappealing prostitute in real life. And as Godard lifts our spirits more with thoughts of leaves and children than of the depredation he has critiqued we are lifted to savour the divine inspiration of a seeker after truth. One must always be sensitive to the intoxication of life. He says. Which can be taken both ways. Both the leaves and Juliette trembled slightly.A particularly beautiful sequence is when Juliette says You can describe what happens when I do something without necessarily indicating what makes me do it. She sheds a tear. This is how 150 frames later . . ..2 or 3 Things I Know about Her also contains perhaps the most legendary closeup of a cup of coffee ever made. Foamy swirls appear only to disappear again. Visual metaphor appearing and dissolving.".

	schema:reviewBody "2 ou 3 choses que je sais d'elle 2 or 3 Things I know About Her is one of Godard's most fluid and complex narratives and that is saying much considering the very nature of most of Godard's work. On the surface the narrative if one were to call it that concerns a group a middleuppermiddle class Parisian women who prostitute themselves in order to buy consumer goods. Based on a newspaper article Godard read this narrative seems like an interesting point for gender politics.However narrative or gender politics are really not the point of 2 or 3 Things.... First off her is less a person but a city Paris. And it is just not Paris as in the city of romance and art but De gaulle's radical transformation of Paris from a prewar city of antiquity to a modern commercial center. The film is framed around extended shots of constructions sites developing freeways and cranes for a reason to show how this ancient city is being radically transformed with or without the benefit of its citizens. In a way this film is a meditation on a phenomena spreading around the world from the 1990's to the present and especially the United States urban gentrification. In the push to modernize and beautify a city the powers that be often step on the majority which make up a city the lower and middle class. Godard's precise comments on urban planning are 40 years ahead of their time. If anything 2 or 3 Things... is far more relevant today than in 1967.Secondly the film is an agitprop protest against crass commercialism and how it defaces and devoids the human experience. The 2 or 3 women in the film Paris included are so wrapped up in the base drive for material goods that they forget the very principles of humanity love caring for one's family intellectual desire and compassion. Godard's definition of consumerism robs a society of its metaphysical compassion and leads intellectual and personal freedom into a locked room. In the age of IPods and Paris Hilton Godard's sharp criticism of crass consumerism is amazingly relevant. It is a wonder that the AdbustersCulture jam movement have not latched onto this film with a passion.2 or 3 Things... also serves as one of the many watermarks of Godard's highly productive and influential 1960's period blending the emotions of Contempt or Vivre Sa Vie with the chic radicalism of La Chinoise or Week End. Godard was an artist in constant evolution in the 1960's and 2 or 3 Things... is one of these many evolutionary steps.Be forewarned 2 or 3 Things... is NOT a good starting point for those new to Godard. It is far too meditative slow and didactic for one to get a true sense of Godard's radical style. I strongly recommend MasculineFeminine Contempt Breathless Band of Outsiders or Week End as a better starting point for Godard. A newcomer to Godard's style might be forever turned off by the slow pacing of 2 or 3 Things.... However after digesting a few of this great film maker's works line up 2 or 3 Things.... A timeless and extremely relevant film.".

The 2 or 3 women in the film Paris included are so wrapped up in the base drive for material goods that they forget the very principles of humanity love caring for one's family intellectual desire and compassion. Godard's definition of consumerism robs a society of its metaphysical compassion and leads intellectual and personal freedom into a locked room. In the age of IPods and Paris Hilton Godard's sharp criticism of crass consumerism is amazingly relevant. It is a wonder that the AdbustersCulture jam movement have not latched onto this film with a passion.2 or 3 Things... also serves as one of the many watermarks of Godard's highly productive and influential 1960's period blending the emotions of Contempt or Vivre Sa Vie with the chic radicalism of La Chinoise or Week End. Godard was an artist in constant evolution in the 1960's and 2 or 3 Things... is one of these many evolutionary steps.Be forewarned 2 or 3 Things... is NOT a good starting point for those new to Godard. It is far too meditative slow and didactic for one to get a true sense of Godard's radical style. I strongly recommend MasculineFeminine Contempt Breathless Band of Outsiders or Week End as a better starting point for Godard. A newcomer to Godard's style might be forever turned off by the slow pacing of 2 or 3 Things.... However after digesting a few of this great film maker's works line up 2 or 3 Things.... A timeless and extremely relevant film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The title is a slightly ironic one implying the importance of Godard as the film's personal narrator and ably illustrating that the two or three things he knows about her are referring not only to the film and the central character but to Paris itself. It's one of the filmmaker's most difficult and disorientating films existing within the same creative mindset as Week End 1967 and La Chinoise 1967 but failing to meet that particular level of subversive brilliance. Many of Godard's most obvious hallmarks are still in place from the notion of society as prostitution the rise of American consumerism the state of France in the midst of political upheaval relationships between men and women the nature of cinema as a platform for discussion satire imagination and ideas and the appropriation of a larger than life visual design taking in elements of pop art surrealism Buuel and Brecht. However unlike the similarly minded films aforementioned 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her 1967 doesn't quite come together as a consistent and cohesive whole instead seeming somewhat sluggish and anchored to a character that is neither interesting nor particularly well performed.That said I feel people shouldn't be so quick to dismiss the film as it features several scenes of bold technical invention a sharp and biting wit and a real sense of both visual and thematic imagination. It is also a fairly worthy time capsule to the spirit and scope of Paris at this particular time expressing many of the political fears and social concerns central to most freethinking Parisians circa 1967. Whereas the two other Politically minded films that Godard produced in 1967 would broaden the thematic scope to create a much more pointed attack on armchair terrorists and bourgeois revolutionaries 2 or 3 Things works on a much smaller scale choosing suburban Paris with its highrise apartment buildings shops and service stations as a backdrop that is continually dwarfed by the wheels of industry and industrial repair. At one point Godard says in voice over that the landscape is like a face all the while showing how it is continually destroyed changed and redeveloped in a series of repetitive visual metaphors open to a variety of thematic interpretations. Many viewers take these sequences at face value and choose to view the film as a simple heavyhanded essay on the decline of industry and the rise of Capitalism and subsequently write the film off. However even though the film takes a great deal of work and may indeed seem boring and heavyhanded there are deeper themes and ideas that make this a slightly more rewarding work in the long run.Once again Godard anchors his ideas to the theme of prostitution recalling elements of Vivre sa Vie 1962 whilst simultaneously foreshadowing certain issues later expressed in Sauve qui peut la vie 1980. Like the latter film Godard implies that with an increasing focus on consumerism and the pursuit of material gain society is prostituting itself. This is further elaborated upon by Godard's continual focus on product logos and brand names that are inter cut and often reframed in order to create humorous puns that are probably lost on anyone not entirely familiar with the French language as well as a final shot that renders the cityscape of suburban Paris as the ultimate consumer paradise. The idea of prostitution also extends to the main character who here prostitutes herself in order to break up the monotony of her everyday life whilst also featuring as a somewhat controversial comment on acting itself something that is further implied in the opening scene.Like many of Godard's films 2 or 3 Things uses a great deal of humour to give the satire a more pointed attack. Much of this humour tends to go over the heads of most viewers largely as a result of having to read the subtitles or simply missing out on much of Godard's clever use of wordplay and usually ironic puns. Scenes such as the young boy relating his dream about the unification of North and South Vietnam or the scene in which Juliet and her friend enact a bizarre tongueincheek sex game with a foreign war correspondent who films them with a super 8 camera and looks a little like Godard himself all the while cutting back and forth to shots of construction and cars entering a service station being an incredibly bold and rebellious critique in itself. Other sections of the film seem more poetic almost as if Godard is putting his thoughts on film as he goes along and creating something that is on the one hand entirely personal whilst simultaneously being an obvious piece of satirical agitprop. The two strands don't always sit well together and too often Godard's ideas seem strained and unformed especially in comparison with those two other films from 1967 previously mentioned.Obviously many viewers have had problems with the film and really your enjoyment of it will depend greatly on how much you trust Godard's instincts as both a satirist and filmmaker and how willing you are to enter into a dialog with him on a subject that is now resigned to an incredibly brief footnote in 20th century history. For me the film is undoubtedly one of his more difficult projects and not one that I would place higher than the likes of Le Mepris 1963 Pierrot le fou 1965 or Helas pour moi 1993 etc. However the scope of Godard's ideas and his way of presenting them visually are close to genius whilst the occasional moment of imaginative wit visual poetry or the sheer verve of Godard's filmmaking abilities make the slow pace and poor performance from Marina Vlady all the more bearable. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her is worth seeing in the context of both Week End and La Chinoise and is certainly worth experiencing as a double bill with the similarly themed Sauve qui peut la vie.".

Christophe Juliette's young sonIn the opening moments of the film Godard introduces uswith his famous whispering narrationto Marina Vlady the actress who will play our protagonist in a few frames to paraphrase. He repeats what he says only a few frames later this time introducing her as Juliette. This is what cinema is. A movie that isn't completely selfconscious is little more than a book on film. In addition to Godard's ramblings on such topics as Vietnam Paris life and philosophy Juliette often thinks outloud speaking directly to the audience while looking at the camera. We even get the privilege to experience her thoughts firsthand a few times.Her is not Juliette nor Paris as some theories state but the cinema. In fact we learn very little about Juliette or about Paris as they are both lost behind ridiculous questions with no answers and the result of these questions. Commercialism is a mask for some people and many scenes suggest lifestyle is becoming more important than life. The final shot of the film shows many household productssuch as Tidescattered in a field. Godard is say we must live together with each other and these objectsas they are all together in the fieldwhich as he states sadly live on longer than we do. The more primitive we are the happier we become but we are to conditioned to use them so we must make a compromise on both sides.But what are the two or three things Godard knows about cinema? Everything there is to know about this young artform. Future filmmakers must take a work of art like this and figure out everything else because right now we only know two or three things about it.Discuss the film and others athttpmoviefan.proboards20.com".

	schema:reviewBody "It's strange to see a work by a filmmaker that is a lesser one but made during his prime. It's like watching a Godard that speaks to his future films the much lesser ones while still holding onto the quality of his work at the time. It came after MasculinFeminine a very good work made during Made in USA unseen by me and before Week End possibly Godard's quintessential attacksatire on culture and filmmaking. With 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her we get a character who you might think at first is like the Anna Karina character in My Life to Live. She seems to sell herself for sex but also just lives her life the way she wants it to. But it's really sort of three different strands going on concurrently there's a pretty coherent look at a mother and wife Juliette Marina Vlady often as deadpan as Godard can get her to be who sometimes takes cares of her kids sometimes just goes out to shop and socialize and sometimes has absolutely passionless sex for money. The second strand almost comes as being like a pseudodocumentary or a satire on one perhaps where Godard has his ladies Juliette and several others throughout who break the '4th wall' and talk right to the camera about their own state of mind and being and such. The third strand has Godard himself in a perpetual whispering tone to get our attention of course about the usual sociopoliticalphilosophicalmoralcinematicwhyistheskyblue narration that accompanies many a Godard film.And all of this of course with some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've seen in any of his work there are closeups that as repetitious as they might've been really did work. Like with the coffee we see the coffee and the bubbles and the colors swirling while the narration keeps on going. There's even a very selfconscious moment where the camera blurs the narration mentions blurred perspective then when things come into 'focus' on both ends. In fact this is not only one of the most selfconscious of all of Godard's work but one of the most selfconscious films I might have ever seen. Not that this is an immediate negative and in this framework Godard's intentions aside from giving a good kick in the nuts to conventions and what the usual even means in typical words and descriptions of 'things' much less with cinema. There's almost a sense of consciousness expansion he's after in this selfconsciousness too which is par for the course for a Godard film. And it's also loaded to the gills with bright primary colors this was continued into Week End though with that in much greater striking effect and product placements galore it always gives one a grin to see his great lovehate relationship with items from mass marketing and produce. And of course those title cards.But what ends up lacking from the film for me and why I would only consider it a good Godard film as opposed to a masterpiece is that I get a lot more fulfillment watching Godard's work when he just loses all abandon of common plotsense and just makes almost an video essay with plenty of semantics a loose story and an eye for locations and people and scenery and products and all sorts of things that show him being instinctively good with the camera...BUT that it's also entertaining. It's not that 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her isn't never quite interesting but the fulfillment I got out of it was more of being so familiar with his work that I could get a kick out of things I could already expect in the changes of form and moments of contemplative narration not really out of any emotional connection though to anything with anyone in the film. Juliette unlike Karina's Nana who by the way as a tongueincheek injoke appears in a popart style photo on a wall in one scene right from that movie is at least 70 of the time not really a character in the usual sense if anything she's more of a mouthpiece a kind of figure for Godard to put forward his ideas of feministradical thinking done in a manner of voice and inflection that is always the same rarely shifting. Maybe that's part of the point and by the end we may know more than two or three things especially about what she's thinking and attitudes on gender and the whys and why nots of just living and existence but emotions are almost null  void in this world.In the meantime as Godard maybe knows he doesn't have enough of a story with her 'real' character when not talking to the camera as a wife and mother he shifts attention at times to random moments with other women like one who talks to the camera about her banal existence I walk climb see a movie twice a month etc or with a sort of touchy sexual discussion in a bar. The focus actually is never too grounded for Godard which is partly what I mean about this film hinting at the descent his films would go to in the 80s and 90s at least from my point of view. It's not JUST about women it's almost about everything drugs culture TV politics war Vietnam especially quite the topical philanthropic satirist he was automobiles a funny bit happens with a red car too literature morality and all that and a bag of 60'sera Godard chips. It's worth checking out I suppose especially in widescreen but not as something to see right away if getting into the director's work I think if I had seen this as my third or fourth Godard film I might've disliked it even more. As apart of a stretch of films I respect it and am involved but compared to the others it's not as successful in terms of it really connecting more than it does. B".

	schema:headline " The least successful Godard film I've seen and I've seen more than a dozen others";
	schema:reviewBody "Although it was a critical success when it was released and it still has strong supporters today I personally found Two or Three Things I Know About Her a very weak film. It represents a day in the life of a prostitutehousewife though that itself is difficult to tell. The film is rather amorphous. Maybe that's a word that many would use to describe the whole of Godard's films. But almost all of his other films with the possible exception of Alphaville and Contempt both of which I need to see again having not seen them for a few years have a little more internal structure and what is especially missing from Two or Three Things a pace. Other films of his are also more biting in their satire or drama depending on what Godard is going for. Two or Three Things is dead in the water. Think of the giddy quickness and insanity of Pierrot le fou or Le WeekEnd or the frightening images of Le petit soldat or Vivre sa vie. This film is not worthless however. I've never seen a Godard film that I would call bad. And it is like all of his films I also haven't seen one that any fan should miss important in his development as a director. You can see Le WeekEnd about to burst out of the screen. Two or Three Things contains a couple of remarkable scenes including the coffee scene. Godard narrates in a whisper philosophizing over his own role in the universe as creme swirls in a cup of coffee and clusters of bubbles rotate and pop the camera is so close that you can't see anything but the coffee in the cup. The cinematography in general by Godard's frequent collaborator Raoul Coutard is quite good. I especially like the shots of construction equipment cranes and such. They're kind of like the opposite of Yasujiro Ozu's pillow shots. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Godard made '2 ou 3 Choses...' more or less at the peak of his creativity. It was also made 'at the same time' as 'Made in USA'. The latter film is for me the beginning of the end of Godard as a major contributor to cinema This on the other hand seems to be quite wonderful.Godard had always been interested in 'prostitution' literally and metaphorically. Here he monumentalises his theme. Juliette Jeanson is a fabulous intensely feminine creation magnificently played by Marina Vlady. Augmenting her housekeeping money by prostitution as a rather more downmarket version of 'Belle de Jour' she muses about her life and its meaning.This is a film in which it is not the 'plot' or the 'narrative' or even the dialogue that conveys meaning it is the counterpoint between the images the dialogue and the situation. This is massively enhanced by the director's use of his own voice as a kind of commentary. 'Shall I speak of Juliette or the leaves on the trees...' etc.In a way the film is also an essay on subjectivity and the way that people are treated as objects in certain aspects of capitalism. I hasten to add that I do not swallow Godard's uncritical Marxism but there is quite enough in this film to make you think long and hard about modern society  today just as much as when it was made.But the great thing about the film is that it is not just an intellectual exercise less a piece of unthinking propaganda. It is a film with a heart and Juliette is one of the most lovable female characters in 60s French cinema.The downside for the here and now is that of all of the serious films of its era this is arguably the one that least fits on a television. The Techniscope seems to be the widest image that the cinema allows and trim anything from the edges of Godard's images at your peril. So the trick is to see it in a cinema!".

And I love everything I've seen by Godard till now I love the madness of Weekend the freespiritedness of Masculin fminin the colours of Pierrot le fou and Le mpris. Supposedly according to some critics this one has it all great cinematography which admittedly it has great story great film in and of itself.Now the story. What story? There's no story in here. Believe me I sat for all ninety minutes trying to figure out what the hell was going on. For the most of the time you either see a woman speaking directly to the camera and the women look good but they bore me immensely or a collage of nonrelated shots narrated by someone who likes whispering his whisper actually reminds me of the unseen killer in some of Dario Argento's pictures and it is in fact one of the coolest things about this picture. Nothing in this picture makes it all glue together. I can sort of try to trace a story in here but it's just a waste of time because even then the story is about as minimal as it can get and from what I see merely an excuse to blabber on about existential and political philosophy. Worthless brouhaha that's what it is. Nothing ever really happens and I tried to stay focused till the movie ended when I finally sighed of relief.These are the same philosophies that Godard introduced in Alphaville but when there's only philosophy and not a trace of a good cohesive plot or a drama this movie should have been reduced to and I'm being generous an essay. That would have been interesting. This isn't. The greatest scene in this picture occurs when the protagonist enters a caf and the narrator speaks about cosmos and various other interestingly universal things when Raoul Coutard Godard's cinematographer zooms in on the contents of the caf visitors' coffee cups. It looks amazing and the movie should be seen only for this particular scene the rest is up to you but I'll pass on this one. It's too heavy too abstract it's art and presumably very intelligent. But it doesn't get me going at all and it tries to maintain my interest but fails miserably for the most of the time. Not good.".

The old romantic Paris is reshaped large suburbs of tower blocks are built which Godard correctly predicted to be soulless and inhuman to some degree.

At one point she and her manicurist prostitute themselves to a USAmerican who wears a starsandstripesTshirt and makes the girls wear bags over their head. The narrative is so weak that I had to look it up on the internet. Unfortunately Godard doesn't limit himself to depicting the state of life in 1967 which could have made a fascinating cinematic time capsule. In a way he seems to be pssed off with the state of things in general. Les banlieues  bad. Vietnam war  bad. Bright boxes of soap powder  bad. Cinematic conventions and storytelling  bad. It's like watching the rant of a miserable old man. I thought the analogy between capitalism and prostitution was pretty cheap. Prefab tower blocks were going up in the Eastern bloc like mushrooms. What alternative does he have to offer? Is he just hankering for the old days of gay Paree? As if prostitution hadn't existed back then. In a way he's part of the parcel. People in 1967 were moving into highrise slabs surrounded themselves with bright plastic and had to endure soulless movies like this one.Yet I'm not angry with Godard. He tried new stuff in this movie and wasn't very successful with it. I'm angry with film critics who make this out to be a cinematic masterpiece merely because it's political.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shot backtoback with Made in U.S.A. his farewell to exwife Anna Karina 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her is one of JeanLuc Godard most visually arresting insightful and personal films. Inspired by an article in Le Nouvel Observateur about housewives prostituting themselves in Paris to fund their consumerist lifestyles Godard uses this as the foundation to explore many other themes throughout the film tackling everything from philosophy politics the ongoing Vietnam War sexuality and probably most important of all France itself the 'Her' of the title.There is little plot to the film and instead Godard uses every filmmaking technique in his arsenal to take the audience on a journey through the Paris suburbs having his characters delve into rambling monologues often responding to questions or regurgitating lines fed through an earpiece by Godard himself. The main focus is Juliette Marina Vlady who occasionally prostitutes herself so she can buy pretty clothes or perhaps just to relieve herself of the boredom of the consumerist lifestyle while her husband Robert Roger Monsoret listens to speeches on the radio regarding America's involvement in Vietnam.It's with his oversimplified characterisation of Juliette that 2 or 3 Things fails to hit the mark. She is beautiful and intelligent but seems to only truly love shopping or catching the eye of a handsome man in a cafe. There's little of the freespirited charisma that Karina embodied in her various roles under Godard but perhaps that's the point. Themes are often explored with a remarkable lack of subtlety with the director's obvious opposition to the illegal war in Vietnam cropping up many times throughout the film with photographs of victims of the war spliced into a rather silly scene involving an 'American' photographer with a heavy French accent and his odd fetish with placing bags over ladies heads and having them act out a routine.Far more impressive are the visuals with the celebrated shot of a swirling espresso while Godard whispers about his own inadequacy being the most memorable image and the sheer ambition of a project shot so quickly. Godard is both criticised and adorned for being simply too intellectual and obtuse for film and 2 or 3 Things is one of the greatest examples of his unwillingness to craft a digestible film for his select audience. The dialogue is often wonderful and poetic yet sometimes it's rambling nonsense spoken by characters who have no place in the story almost as if Godard got bored and moved his camera to a conversation he found more interesting. It's both frustrating and fascinating to see a director of such singular vision and while there is little of the excitement and energy of his early New Wave work 2 or 3 Things is an experience like no other.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her we see a beautiful woman on the screen and the narrator JeanLuc Godard whispers to us some things that he knows about her that she is the actress Marina Vlady and that she is looking to the right. And yes she is Marina Vlady but in a moment the narrator is whispering again that she is Juliette Jeanson which is the role Vlady is playing in the film. And yes she is looking to the right except that it's our right she is looking to her left. So immediately Godard has launched us into some conundrums involving actor and role as well as subject and object. Godard will insistently whisper his comments on these and other epistemological questions throughout the film as we watch MarinaJuliette move through a day in which Juliette takes her daughter to a very strange day care center has her car washed buys a dress meets a friend and turns a few tricks. We also watch the work at construction sites and contemplate the swirling foam on the surface of a cup of coffee. And throughout we are not only whispered to by Godard but also hear Juliette's thoughts and the conversation of other characters on the nature and limitations of language and art and philosophy as well as the psychic disturbance and political significance of the Vietnam War. For some all this will constitute an hour and a half of pretentious and boring fiddlefaddle the cinematic equivalent of the philosophical bull sessions we had in our college dorms. But let me hasten to defend the philosophical bull session It stretched our minds at the right time in our lives when we had the patience for ideas. Too few of us have the patience for ideas anymore and that may be an incalculable loss. It's easy to mock films like 2 or 3 Things to ignore their essential playfulness their overturning of the complacent expectation that a movie should tell a story or excite or entertain us. But pause to gnaw on some of the some of the things that are said in the film such as To say that the limits of language of my language are those of the world of my world and that in speaking I limit the world I end it. Or contemplate the fact that the surface of a stirred cup of coffee looks like the spiraling of a galaxy. Or engage your eyes with cinematographer Raoul Coutard's widescreen compositions. Or question the film's obsession with commercialism which echoes Andy Warhol's exaltation of soup cans and Brillo boxes into art. Or do anything else that the film prods you to do including wonder why Juliette leads the life she does and you've got at the heart of what makes Godard such a radically important filmmaker. charlesmatthews.blogspot.com".

This is a fair assessment but clearly does not go far enough. Advertising as a whole serves this function for all people male and female.

	schema:headline " A newspaper report that Parisian housewives were prostituting themselves for nice things led Godard to a bold attack on consumerism";
	schema:reviewBody "As the 1960s went on JeanLuc Godard was increasingly alarmed by the rise of consumerism in France. He first confronted this issue with his 1964 film UNE FEMME MARIEE where the characters mindlessly repeated advertising slogans in their dialogue and the eponymous protagonist keen on women's magazines and the latest fashion was completely unaware of Auschwitz or other tragedies. A couple of years later Godard read a magazine article about a housewife in one of the big new highrises outside Paris who while her husband was at work prostituted herself to afford all the nice things that he couldn't buy her. This led him to take up the housewife theme again but the resulting film 2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D'ELLE Two or Three Things I Know About Her is a considerable departure from past work and marks Godard's adoption of a more overtly political cinema.Marina Vlady not even 28 years old then but already seen as a venerable old actress plays Juliette Jeanson.

Thus much of the film consists of the protagonist or other characters delivering what seem to be disjointed monologues. The technique tends to dehumanize the characters just as Godard feels that consumerism makes everyone a zombie. But it also makes them blatant mouthpieces for Godard's own thoughts which can start to feel rather tiresome. If you've wondered where the dividing line is between New Wave Godard and political Godard falls it's here. Indeed Godard goes heavily didactic here. Over much of the film he gives a voiceover in a barelyintelligible whisper presenting his own fears and hopes. Over one of the film's most famous shots the swirls in a hot cup of coffee Godard even says something which doesn't even seem to be related to the film at all but which involved his disappointment at being jilted by Vlady romantically at this time. But in his voiceovers and in the dialogue of his characters Godard also takes on the war then raging in Vietnam to such a degree that the original housewife prostitution plot is pushed aside or at least made only a tiny part of a vast geosocialculturalpolitical point the director is making and Godard's disappointment with the United States is presented in a bitter fashion.Thus 2 OU 3 CHOSES is in my opinion a not completely successful experiment where Godard wanted to include the whole world but was unable to make the elements cohere. Still it is worth watching for cinephiles. While as I said Godard had dealt with the housewife and consumerism theme in an earlier film this is much more effective due to its use of color. After all commercial brands were deft users of color to attract the eye of shoppers and a mere blackandwhite shoot would miss out on this explosion of hues. At one point Godard says in voiceover If you can't afford LSD buy a colour television. The final voiceover and camera shot is particularly majestic in this regard. Elsewhere in the film as we move through blocks of flats shops or city streets Raoul Coutard's cinematography is mindblowing with long takes of powerful impact.".

	onyx:emotionText "As the 1960s went on JeanLuc Godard was increasingly alarmed by the rise of consumerism in France. He first confronted this issue with his 1964 film UNE FEMME MARIEE where the characters mindlessly repeated advertising slogans in their dialogue and the eponymous protagonist keen on women's magazines and the latest fashion was completely unaware of Auschwitz or other tragedies. A couple of years later Godard read a magazine article about a housewife in one of the big new highrises outside Paris who while her husband was at work prostituted herself to afford all the nice things that he couldn't buy her. This led him to take up the housewife theme again but the resulting film 2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D'ELLE Two or Three Things I Know About Her is a considerable departure from past work and marks Godard's adoption of a more overtly political cinema.Marina Vlady not even 28 years old then but already seen as a venerable old actress plays Juliette Jeanson. Married to Robert Roger Montsoret an auto mechanic she begins her day by seeing him off to work her young son off to school and then dropping her infant daughter off at a day care.

	schema:reviewBody "JeanLuc Godard is a master of making nonsense turn into something interesting something of deep meaning. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her is full of grand ideas jumbled up no less and in return they make a sometimes compelling and sometimes frustrating film. Godard famously once said that the film was supposed to be an homage to The Big Sleep but instead of a detective the main character is a prostitute. But if 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her is an homage to The Big Sleep then I must be a zebra. Frankly no matter what Godard tries to tell us beforehand this is a challenging film that has moments of great intellect and inspiration.The her in the title refers both to Marina Vlady and the city of Paris itself. Vlady portrays Juliette Janson a bourgeois housewife that doubles as a prostitute in order to pay the bills. Portrayal has quote marks around it as Juliette is less of a character and more of a representation Godard does not intend to tell the story of the complicated woman  he would prefer to study the changing climate of 1960s Paris and its people. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her marks a huge shift in Godard's career. A staggering fan of American cinema his earlier projects such as Pierrot Le Fou and A Woman Is A Woman were genre films that were stylized as crime thrillers and Technicolor musicals respectively. But 2 or 3 Things shows Godard more interested in politics and how the increasingly radical ideas of the world were shaping Europe. There are still very American things that show up in certain scenes in the opening credits the font is dressed in red white and blue. In the rest of the film advertisements that surround the characters are designed with art deco boldness. But it's difficult to compare the film to anything the U.S. had to offer in cinemas in 1967.2 or 3 Things I Know About Her feels like a delve into Godard's brain at the time. The Vietnam War is mentioned frequently serving not only as a point of critique but also as a pressing matter always on the mind. Juliette's immoral lifestyle choice is not a plot device but a reflection of 1967 France President Charles de Gaulle's bold transformations to the economic system are prevalent. Skyscrapers are gazed upon with an alienated distance and Juliette's work was an actual choice many women had to make as cost of living began to increase under his rule.Godard's positions are fascinating but at times they begin to ramble and become disjointed in their aesthetic. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her is at its most exciting when characters are simply having normal conversations. When they deliver fourthwall breaking monologues they lose quite a bit of their charisma as they feel as though Godard is talking to himself. Too much Godard can be too much Godard after all.2 or 3 Things I Know About Her features more successes than failures it's a film that doesn't have much emotional relevance but manages to create interest on a philosophical level. Godard had a great '60s and this is a fitting closing.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com".

He is definitely a better businessman as he passes his trash as art rather than the ADHDinspired crude humor that Tom Green sells.I do not recommend this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Director JeanLuc Godard came from the old school of filmmaking the way Andrew Sarris approached looking at a film watching a movie and understanding it as if it was a novel or some literary product you could start at the beginning and follow a line of thought through to the end. Breathless may have been his biggest hit because it was his most easily accessible film referencing Film Noir and Bogart all the way through to tap into the American love of thriller.Living in a constantly renovating Paris Juliette Janson Marina Vlady lives with her husband struggling daily with making more money and keeping pace with the everexpanding consumerism of the urban environment. Juliette has taken to prostitution to make more money for the household and in an afternoon meeting she and a friend supply pleasure for an American gentleman. The act has a depleting effect on her but she accepts it in order to keep up with the growing economic pressures of marriage and family.2 or 3 Things I Know About Her feels like a far more mature work as the director uses a variety of techniques to get his point across. In one scene where Juliette and a friend entertain the fetishistic attentions of a John in and afternoon tryst while wearing airline carrying bags over their heads is even by today's standards superkinky and LMAOfunny as well. This is definitely not one of those easily accessible movies that consist of a comic book mentality but one that trusts its audience to be interested and stick with it until the last brittle image of a variety of consumer products laid out across a green suburban lawn.Writer Catherine Vimenet and JeanLuc Godard make the most of a sound track that has the director practically whispering conspiratorially to an audience as he tells the tale of the main character. It's a mammoth project and very sophisticated but Godard doesn't spoonfeed any of us. He's got something to say and to make sure you listen he whispers it with urgency on a soundtrack that alternately explodes with the sounds of construction in the city of light.Far from being out of the ordinary this particular style of filmmaking is something Goddard seems to prefer over the structured narrative forms of some other New Wave filmmakers. The narrative includes a distancing effect on the viewer so that no mistake can be made between story teller and intended listener. One particular standout section includes an extreme close up of sugar being stirred into a cup of coffee as Goddard's narration reflects on the sound track about how meaning in our lives is achieved through perception a typical Goddard viewpoint that her was in its incipient stages.If 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her leaves you cold it may be due to your own perception of what cinema is and how film narrative functions to involve the viewer. Goddard is still a filmmaker at heart and his use of cinematographer Raoul Coutard to create an alluring visual palette for the viewer is impressive to say the least. Coutard is known for his work on a handful of characteristically New Wave films Breathless in 1960 Jules and Jim in 1962 Z in 1969 and Pierrot le Fou in 1965. The imagery he creates here serves the film well and may have you coming back for more.".

I liked the leads and thought they had good chemistry and while not as funny as say American Pie I did find many of the jokes amusing.However there was one aspect of the film that really bothered me which I notice has been mentioned by others as well.  SPOILER WARNINGNow if a woman was handcuffed to a bed and sleeping and somewhat delirious and her exboyfriend showed up and had sex with her when she is clearly in no position to give consent few people would hesitate to label that as rape and it certainly would not go without mention and condemnation in the film.  Yet Nicole rapes Matt and the only issue that seems to arise is how he screwed up.  Excuse me? Granted blaming the rape victim is not a new concept but one would hope in this day and age it doesn't find its way into films at least not without suitable counter statements being made.  Male rape is a serious issue that is rarely dealt with as such and movies like this tend to reinforce the erroneous belief that male rape doesn't exist except in prison or Deliverance.  Maybe we shouldn't expect this movie to have any great social impact challenge the views of the establishment but acknowledgement that SOMETHING wrong had happened other than Matt screwing up would have been nice.  I seriously hope Nicole didn't get to collect on her bet.Also someone suggested that it was unrealistic for Matt not to have woken up before he had an orgasm.  I'm not a guy so I can't speak from experience but there are such things as wet dreams.  It seems to me that was essentially what Matt had only unbeknownst to him he had a little help.  That's actually what I found unbelievable surely he would have long since had a wet dream on his own.  But it's a movie.".

	schema:headline " Ridiculous premise about shallow people";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood and their incredible shallowness wants it's viewers to care a lot for the main character in this film and it's because he's good looking. Nothing more than that and I took an instant disliking to this ridiculous attempt at comedy and the rest of the characters are portrayed as either vapid or moronic. Story is about Matt Sullivan Josh Hartnett who is having a very difficult time getting over his breakup with Nicole Vinessa Shaw and he goes out with several girls but they don't amount to anything and he becomes disgusted by his own behavior. Matt decides to give up sex for Lent and at first he seems okay with it but as time goes on it gets very difficult and while at the laundromat he meets a new woman.SPOILER ALERTMatt meets Erica Shannyn Sossamon and they have an instant attraction to one another but he has a hard time explaining his actions when he starts acting weird but she finds out the truth when Matt's coworkers put his plan on a website and place bets whether he can last the whole duration.This film is directed by Michael Lehmann who has helmed two pretty good films Heathers The Truth About Cats  Dogs that deal with relationships and human interaction but he has also directed some awful films Hudson Hawk Meet The Applegates My Giant and I certainly believe that this attempt belongs in the latter. The film is basically an attempt to showcase Josh Hartnett and take advantage of his looks which is fine but the script makes his character so nice that he's just a complete bore. Are we really supposed to feel sorry for him because he's not getting laid? Is not getting any for 40 days that long? If it is I definitely live in another universe and basically I cannot relate to Hartnett's character on any level and I'm a single guy! Every female that works in the same office as Hartnett is smoking hot and this is an office that easily has no idea what sexual misconduct is. Hartnett is not a bad actor but when he's cast in these cutesy boy roles he's ingratiating. With the exception of Sossamon who gives an earnest attempt the rest of the cast is portrayed as uncaring jerks who seemingly have embraced their shallowness. If your looking for a smart and sophisticated comedy than keep walking because this lame film has a script that is totally devoid of anything resembling wit and intelligence.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Each year we all claim we're going to give up something for Lent. Whether for religious reasons physical reasons or even for a bet we all have attempted and mostly failed to sacrifice those things we need the most. It'd be interesting to know how many have attempted to sacrifice sexual activity for that time. In 2002's '40 Days and 40 Nights' Josh Hartnett's character tries just that. Crammed full of sexual reference and incredibly dumb moments '40 Days and 40 Nights' is saved from the oblivion where it so obviously belongs by the pure fact that it is occasionally entertaining. Yes it never makes you fall off your seat in laughter and the characters are incredibly shallow but more often than not you can't help but find yourself smiling.Matt Sullivan Hartnett is a mess. Never recovering from his last girlfriends rejection he leaps from bed to bed only to find himself suffering psychological trauma and hallucinations. Deciding he needs to get his head sorted Matt decides that it is time to give up sex. Thus for the 40 days and nights of Lent he gives up all sexual activity. Including personal relief into the decision Matt finds temptation constantly around the corner not least from the fact that he has a new girlfriend in the shape of Erica Shannyn Sossamon.Firstly lets ponder the impossibilities involved with '40 Days and 40 Nights'. There's the fact that at one point he makes Erica orgasm using a flower a fact that women will happily condemn at a moments notice although most have probably tried after watching this film. There's also the fact that if a man goes from constant sex to no relief of any kind that he's not going to have a say in the matter. The body will find a way to make him let off steam. The fact that for the entire time Matt lasts in the film he never once experiences any sort of wet dream as would happen in such a sudden 'cold turkey' situation is just evidence of how little the creators thought this premise through.Away from practical impossibility the film also suffers from the predictable fact that it is often incredibly crude. Whether it is a hot office worker spreading her legs on the photocopier or Matt's hallucinations of naked women the film is never afraid to lower the tone beyond sensible parameters. At just over an hour and a half long it is just one long smut joke and it's doubtful 'Confessions of a window cleaner' had this many sexual references.All the characters are also incredibly shallow individuals. Obsessed with sex every single girl offers herself to him in return for the possibility of winning money. At the same time all of his friends rather than supporting him ridicule and humiliate him with an online betting syndicate. There's not an individual in the film that doesn't seem to be sex obsessed and superficial. This isn't real life this is some sort of nightmarish fantasy.So where do we go from here? There's so many criticisms about the film there surely can't be any saving grace? Well against all better judgement there is. You see whilst the film is crude flawed and dumb it is also at times entertaining. We're not talking hilarious or anything but it does sometimes make you smile and enjoy it. You watch the story unfold you really don't care for any of the characters and yet you just can't turn it off. The film hooks you in and subjects you to ninety minutes of torture. Yet once it's finished you do find yourself happy and content by what you've seen. It's always annoying when something like this happens but when the story is really this bad you find yourself even more frustrated.Rude crude physically impossible and woefully shallow '40 Days and 40 Nights' is not a good film. So it is with a heavy heart therefore to confess that you might actually enjoy it. It's a guilty pleasure. It's a film which is so inexplicably bad and yet for some unknown reason you find yourself occasionally smiling through it. You feel like the ninety minutes have been worthwhile even though they haven't and you genuinely believe that the film is worth anyone's attention. This is the evil of Hollywood at it's most pronounced and it's an annoying fact of life. You should hate this film but you'll think you like it.".

The funniest moments in the film were the condom scene at the beginning dinner with the parents and the examination of Matt's sheets. It's also nice to see a Hollywood movie that doesn't drag on beyond the two hour point. 40 Days... clocks in at a pleasant 94 minutes which feels just about right.All in all it's a mildly enjoyable film but nothing memorable.

This movie contains an attempted drugging sexual harassment sexual molestation and outright rape and we're supposed to just laugh it off because it happens to a man. And as we all know men can't go more than 7 seconds without thinking about sex.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Lehman's 40 Days and 40 Nights is a surprisingly funny smart edgy romantic comedy with an amazing sweetness to it. This is a feat given some of the graphic dialog and outrageous sight gags. Credit the star power of Josh Hartnett the skillful direction of Michael Lehman and a brisk and in your face screenplay by Rob Perez. The movie intends to offend and we give it permission to do so the effect is a fun time at the movies. Josh Hartnett plays young Dot Commer Matt who is suffering since his break up 6 months ago from Nicole a viciously good Vinessa Shaw. Matt has visions of a Black Hole fissuring from the ceiling whenever he is having sex with women which is very often poor guy. Matt confides in his brother John Adam Trese a priest completing his probationary period. John is not the tower of strength and inspiration that Matt is looking for. Then by design divine intervention or sheer insanity Matt chooses abstinence for 40 days and nights until Lent. And this is extreme no fondling and... no masturbation. No one believes Matt will last 40 days much less a week. Among the faithless is Matt's roommate Ryan Paulo Costanzo who betrays Matt confidence and tells his coworkers at Matt's Internet company. They start a pool on a website predicting Matt's demise. In the meantime Matt pursues a relationship with a great girl Erica a beautiful Shannyn Sossamon who he met at the local laundromat. Also by design it just happens that Erica has a history of dating weirdos and she works for Cyber Nanny a company that safeguards against pornsites. Matt also finds out that Nicole is back from Europe and now engaged and she will not let him forget this. What makes the movie special is that Matt really falls in love with Erica without sleeping with her and that he remains abstinent because he said so... This is refreshing. Josh Hartnett is great here. His Matt is a goodlooking charming guy who makes an insane choice and lives with it. Hartnett also comes across as empathetic as a man thrust in an almost impossible situation where everyone is betting on his failure. He has a quiet strength about him is very funny and totally believable. Shannyn Sossamon is stunning you can see why Matt falls for her. And when she wonders if Matt is gay this is hilarious. Sossamon's Erica is smart and compassionate with great humanity. Playing a woman wondering why the guy she is attracted to doesn't want to have sex with her is not an easy role... or natural. The humor in 40 Days is raw though enjoy the ride. Afterall it is a romance managed well by Lehman Harnett and Sossamon. And we don't mind being offended as long as it is done smartly with style and that we are ultimately touched.".

So you get lots of scenes of him gasping in frustration running away from women while putting ice down his pants.  I found the humor witless and below the standards of Porky's or typical teenage drivein type movies.Also in this world were Matt lives everyone knows about everyone else's sex lifes they are freely discussed and in Matt's case becomes the subject of world wide betting on the internet.  While Matt seems to view this as an unfortunate turn of events apparently he harbours no ill will towards his friends for publishing his plight.  Or doesn't seem to be upset with them as they go out of their way to make him break is vow for Lent.There is more to the plot of the movie he meets a girl and falls in love but the movie screams the question HOW CAN THEY BE IN LOVE IF THEY AREN'T HAVING SEX?

Once in a great while something seeps into the scripts they write that's so extreme in it's reprehensibility it reveals their delusional view of the world. That's what happened with this movie but since it wasn't a wildly popular blockbuster that was in the theatres for several months it was mostly ignored. At the end of this movie a man is raped by a woman in a context that makes it clear that the writers think it's a good thing. Knowing the stupid plot of the movie doesn't make it any better. Matt Josh Harnett just had a bad breakup with a girl and decides he would get a better perspective on women and relationships if he went without sex during the 40 days of Lent including kissing and masturbation. He meets a woman but continues his experiment in sexual abstinence without explaining his experiment to her just saying he wants a platonic relationship. I'll admit I didn't follow every detail of the plot and subplots he's some kind of executive and has a lot of obnoxious roommates and coworkers but I figure nothing could justify the rape at the end. There is a sequence where he's so aroused and frustrated he dreams he's flying through a landscape of CGIed breasts which I guess is relatively imaginative. Near the end of the movie he goes to bed as always handcuffed to the bedposts so he can't masturbate. His exgirlfriend gets on top of him and RAPES HIM! If the sexes were reversed there'd be a public outcry about this movie that would be pretty considerable even though the movie wasn't extremely well known. I think what the socalled writers think is that men having sex whenever they can get it and perpetually pursuing sex like mindless animals the rest of the time is the natural order of Nature and any man who goes against that is denying nature and is not a real man and deserves to be FORCED back into sexual activity in other words deserves to be RAPED. In their minds the abstinence is the twisted thing and the rape is the healthy thing. Of course movies are primarily entertainment and some people mostly women I guess would get a kick out of seeing a healthy goodlooking young guy constantly horny and teased and frustrated but the movie doesn't even work on that dark level because Hartnett doesn't react the way most men would. Most of the other characters in the film are shallow obnoxious twenty somethings who act like 12yearolds and I can't help thinking that this must be pretty close to what the writers act like. There are a lot of jokes about embarrassment over having erections at work. This isn't the worst movie ever made  that honor I think belongs to Forrest Gump  only because 40 Days and 40 Nights is useful in the way it reveals the societyinduced mental disorders of the writers.".

It's a lot harder than it sounds because Mr. Harnett vows to give up ALL forms of sexual activity including masturbation. Promiscuous roommate Paulo Costanzo as Ryan is around to help he examines Hartnett's sheets for fluids and lets everyone on the Internet know about his pal's pledge. Presumably Mr. Costanzo orders Hartnett to shower with the door open.Things get very sticky or not when women try to arouse Hartnett's interest. To complicate matters he meets sexy Shannyn Sossamon as Erica at the Laundromat. Still Hartnett perseveres. He gets Christian help in the confessional from priestly brother Adam Trese as John Mr. Trese is secretly struggling with the same vow. Of course the real story is the discovery by Hartnett of true love instead of just sex. Other than a confusing dream sequence climax it's all fairly predictable. Director Michael Lehmann and team succeed in making the premise unrealistic even for a silly movie. Sossamon and Costanzo are very likable with Hartnett. There are a few laughs. One cool scene features more topless women than Electric Ladyland. 40 Days and 40 Nights 3102 Michael Lehmann  Josh Hartnett Shannyn Sossamon Paulo Costanzo Adam Trese".

	onyx:emotionText "Six months of hot women can't get emotionally blocked San Francisco stud Josh Hartnett as Matt Sullivan to forget sexy exgirlfriend Vinessa Shaw as Nicole so he decides to give up sex for 40 Days and 40 Nights aka Lent the time period before Easter. It's a lot harder than it sounds because Mr. Harnett vows to give up ALL forms of sexual activity including masturbation. Promiscuous roommate Paulo Costanzo as Ryan is around to help he examines Hartnett's sheets for fluids and lets everyone on the Internet know about his pal's pledge. Presumably Mr. Costanzo orders Hartnett to shower with the door open.Things get very sticky or not when women try to arouse Hartnett's interest. To complicate matters he meets sexy Shannyn Sossamon as Erica at the Laundromat. Still Hartnett perseveres. He gets Christian help in the confessional from priestly brother Adam Trese as John Mr. Trese is secretly struggling with the same vow. Of course the real story is the discovery by Hartnett of true love instead of just sex. Other than a confusing dream sequence climax it's all fairly predictable. Director Michael Lehmann and team succeed in making the premise unrealistic even for a silly movie. Sossamon and Costanzo are very likable with Hartnett. There are a few laughs. One cool scene features more topless women than Electric Ladyland. 40 Days and 40 Nights 3102 Michael Lehmann  Josh Hartnett Shannyn Sossamon Paulo Costanzo Adam Trese";

That's the only possible explanation to the fact that this movie ever came out. Technically the movie is really lame. In fact I strongly doubt there was anyone involved in the production of this film that was aware that there exist techniques to shoot a movie. There's no photography management no aesthetics careness no nothing that would justify the one big and completely flaw by antonomasia that the script is. The only attempt of innovation you may find in the movie is the 100 computer animated sea of mammary glands waving all along the screen as the central character is supposed to be having an alucination. Concerning the script there isn't a single part of it that doesn't deserve to go straightly to the trash bin. I strongly recommend as well that Mr. Rob Prez dedicates the rest of his life in another work as good as he makes sure it doesn't involve writing. The plot is just absurd spoiler?. A guy swears to god that he won't have sex for the next 40 days and what's worst the entire community around him is so stupid and has nothing better to do in their own lives that they run a hitech bet system in which they bet to the day they think the oath will be broken. Give it a 5 second thought. If your neighbour doesn't want to have sex do you really give a damn about it??? Will your life start to work around that fact??? of course not!!! The movie it self doesn't have sense!!! Not even to mention the predictability of it. From the very beginning of the movie you know how it's going to end. And the gags and jokes that were supposed to be the strong side of the movie don't get to work at all. In all the time I wasted watching this movie not ever once my lips showed a glimpse of a smile.".

	schema:reviewBody "After spending six months dwelling on the demise of his last relationship Matt Sullivan Josh Hartnett decides to give up all his sexual outlets for Lent. Naturally upon making this decision he meets Erica Shannyn Sossamon and has to hope their budding relationship will survive 40 Days and 40 Nights'. Spoilers follow.To be perfectly fair I have to say that the allure of Josh Hartnett has mostly escaped me. Slouching lethargically through every role he plays Hartnett mumbles his lines as if slightly embarrassed in a voice just an octave short of Herman Munster and with all the energy of a very old man on a Nyquil bender. Watching Hartnett I found his sleepyeyed Matt a little hard to buy as a Lothario in overdrive. He hardly seems capable of dressing himself in the morning let alone pursuing so strenuous an activity as sex.As one would expect Matt doesn't manage to pursue his spiritual journey unnoticed  friends coworkers and even total strangers become aware of his pledge in short order. The addition of an Internet betting pool on the demise Matt's celibacy is one of the film's few smart moves  money always being an acceptable means of providing motivation where there would otherwise exist only mild interest. Folks with a stake in the whole mess begin to conspire against Matt immediately with all the attendant inappropriate unlikely and sometimes patiently illegal acts that might result in some kind of court date out in the real world. You know the jokes already Viagra in the orange juice the office slut teasingly spreadeagled on the copier with an open invitation the offer of a fullservice mnage a trios with a couple of other female coworkers out to win the pool making them a couple of highpriced okay very high priced prostitutes by proxy. Only in your local Spearmint Rhino and films like this do women dress this provocatively and men behave this foolishly in the workplace.The movie makes some feeble effort to acknowledge the spiritual nature of Lent having horndog Matt experiencing some mildly sacrilegious hallucinations shortly after making his conviction. Short of that and some rambling allusions to Satan's tests for Jesus while Matt is on the home stretch to victory seemingly only achievable at the zero hour by handcuffing himself to his bed the film uses the whole concept of spiritual growth through selfdenial cruelly. By the climax' Matt has devolved into such a twitchy bumbling sweaty hallucinating unbelievable neurotic that it's safe to say his journey has been a failure even if the trip has landed a hot new babe in his bed. Unfortunately the attraction between Harnett and the slightly funky but lovely Sossamon seems as forced as the entire premise.The movie does offer a precious few titillating moments personally I don't think I would have made it past the office slut's offer on top of the copier but there is nothing in the film so erotically evocative to make it worth the price of admission. For that kind of thrill there are far better films one can rent in the privacy of your own home with your own remote control and your own bottle of baby oil. I think you know where I'm going.The only real bright spot in the whole dismal setting for me is Paulo Costanzo as Matt's roomie. Costanzo seems to have come from the Jerry Seinfeld School of Acting being unable to deliver a line without an attendant smirk. Usually this would be annoying but Costanzo manages to make it somehow bearable  kind of like talking to a good friend and sharing a sharing a private joke. He seemed to consistently generate the most laughs out of the wasted cast.I guess to the pompous vaguely agnostic HeyWe'reBiggerThanJesus executives over at good ol' Universal releasing 40 Days 40 Nights' during Lent seemed like a real nobrainer. Certainly it doesn't seem likely that any devout Catholics will have this film at the top of their To Do' list though some kind of protest action by a fringe activist group doesn't seem out of the question. If you are Catholic and you haven't given up anything for Lent might I suggest films like this? I'm all for a good oldfashioned slightly titillating youthoriented sex comedy but since you can also add mindless' unconvincing' and unfunny' to the list of adjectives in this case you can live without them for the next 40 days. I'm not Catholic or a prude or even religious but I can still appreciate the value of selfsacrifice. Fortunately for me giving up films like 40 Days and 40 Nights' is a little like giving up crushing my testicles in a vise  easy to do and I wouldn't miss it a bit. Three Stars out of Ten.".

A woman in the place of the man would have been a rape victim and the man as a boyfriend would have the urge to run after the other man for some serious beating up.Personally in the position of the man I would have immediately called the police and filed my exgirlfriend for rape.

It has a lot of flaws most notably the liberal applying of schmaltz across the whole film but it does have it's rewarding moments and interesting characters such as the Bagel guy who knows everything except how to turn up on time. A lot of the comedy is too heavy handed but there are moments which genuinely made me laugh. I particularly liked Josh Hartnett's Priest to be brother struggling to listen to Josh's tales of sexual encounters. That said the two main characters are somewhat lacking in life and could have done with a bit more development. This is a largely French funded film and it does show in places. There are elements of French farce about it but with transposing the action to California it was always inevitable there'd be the standard Hollywood ending and it doesn't disappoint in that respect. Hopefully this won't be the best film you'll see this year but it certainly could be worse.".

That said the two main characters are somewhat lacking in life and could have done with a bit more development. This is a largely French funded film and it does show in places. There are elements of French farce about it but with transposing the action to California it was always inevitable there'd be the standard Hollywood ending and it doesn't disappoint in that respect. Hopefully this won't be the best film you'll see this year but it certainly could be worse.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the finest and most memorable westerns of the fifties is GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL! A splendid Vista Vision Technicolor presentation based around the famous shootout that took place in Tombstone Arizona on the 26th October 1881. Produced by Hal Wallis for Paramount Pictures in 1957 it was masterfully directed by John Sturges and mightily cast with Burt Lancaster as the great frontier lawman Wyatt Earp and Kirk Douglas as Doc Holliday. The combination of these two heavyweight stars playing the leads plus the movie's catchy fire cracker title assured the picture's box office success. From an excellent screenplay by Leon Uris it was stylishly complimented by the brilliant and glowing cinematography of Charles B. Lang together with Dimitri Tiomkin's rollicking score including the clever vocal sung by Frankie Laine which operatically guided us through the narrative. Regretfully Sturges had another go at the incident ten years later with the now disregarded and dismissed Hour Of The Gun 1967 starring the lightweight James Garner as an unconvincing Wyatt Earp Jason Robards as a just about adequate Doc Holliday and a poorly cast Robert Ryan in the under written role of Ike Clanton.The story we all know and love recounts the arrival in Tombstone of Marshal Wyatt Earp. From his developing relationship with the dubious Doc Holliday to his many run ins with rancher Ike Clanton and his law breaking gang of cowboys which would inevitably lead to the event that would become known as the most famous and notorious shootout in American western history.........THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL.The incident itself has been well documented by Hollywood. Most famously by John Ford in 1946 when it featured in his classic My Darling Clementine for 20th Century Fox with Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp and Victor Mature as the consumptive Doc Holliday. After the dismal Hour Of The Gun in 1967 came Tombstone in 1993 with Kurt Russell as Earp and Val Kilmer who just chewed up every shred of scenery as a swashbuckling Holliday. This was followed the next year by Kevin Kostner's over long and bloated Wyatt Earp 1994 with Kostner making for a stiff Earp but Dennis Quaid delivering a blistering and definitive performance as a really frail and ill looking Holliday.It is interesting to ponder that the actual event that occurred on that fateful October afternoon in 1881 when the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday confronted the Clantons and the McLaurys at the OK Corral was but the briefest of encounters. It was all over inside of thirty seconds! With thirty shots fired at point blank range it resulted in the deaths of Tom and Frank McLaury and young Billy Clanton. Morgan and Virgil Earp along with Doc Holliday were wounded but survived. Wyatt was unhurt. For an incident that  in reality  was so short it is quite amazing how elaborate and embellished Hollywood has depicted the event in every movie. Sturges' '57 film probably contains the longest and most colourful version of the incident which took up to about twenty minutes of screen time. Of course we must accept this to be artistic licence and enjoy it as it is  regardless of the liberties taken by the film makers concerning the facts of what actually occurred that day. Also It is curious that situated next to the OK Corral was the photographic studio of Camillus Fly Fly was famous for his many photos of early Arizona including those taken at the negotiations between the Apache warrior Geronimo and General Crook. Unfortunately Fly  reputed to be under threat from the Earps  took no photographs of the unfolding events that day in the adjacent OK Corral. A missed opportunity most certainly a shamefully lost scoop that history can never forgive. Fly's studio is nowhere to be seen in either Sturges' or Ford's pictures. And yet it was quite prominent in 1993's Tombstone. However actual occurrences and events not withstanding Sturges' movie is still an immensely entertaining picture. Performances are top notch! Lancaster makes a fine upstanding square jawed Wyatt Earp against Douglas' tempestuous and aggressive Doc Holliday. Good too are those in smaller roles like Jo Van Fleet as Doc's abused girl friend Big Nose Kate Lyle Bettger as Ike Clanton John Ireland as Ringo and Dennis Hopper as Billy Clanton. All in all another great one from the fifties the decade of the classic Hollywood western.".

	schema:reviewBody "In one of her books Hedda Hopper devoted a chapter to both of the stars of Gunfight at the OK Corral calling them the Terrible Twins. As a columnist Hopper was a firm defender of the old studio system and both Burt and Kirk were seen by her as betraying old Hollywood.Now personally I think their careers show that both of these guys knew exactly what they were doing in guiding their own destinies. This film is a great example of it. It was deservedly a critical hit and a moneymaker.No film has ever been made that completely told accurately the story of the famous gunfight least of all this one. But it sure captures the spirit.I think both of these guys could have played each other's part and the film still would have been a winner. The problem with playing Wyatt Earp is that he's usually such a straight arrow on screen or on television that the main job of the actor is to keep from making him sound like Dudley DooRight. Burt Lancaster is capable enough and did it but Wyatt Earp maybe one of the least complex roles he ever essayed.Kirk Douglas though is the best Doc Holiday I've ever seen portrayed. Doc Holiday is a brooding consumptive alcoholic who's also a woman batterer. He treats Jo Van Fleet like garbage and her responses to him is responsible for several of the plot twists. As I've said before Douglas can flip into rage better than any other actor ever. Just watch him with Van Fleet after the youngest Earp brother has been killed.Today we would call Jo Van Fleet a battered spouse even though she and Douglas are living commonlaw. Her's is the next best portrayal in the film besides Kirk Douglas.Rhonda Fleming has little to do except look coquettish and beautiful as the lady gambler who Lancaster falls for. But that was usually enough for her public. It's ironic that she's playing a liberated woman for 19th century and Fleming's politics are quite right wing and Lancaster her very traditional 19th century man was a noted political liberal.And of course the unbilled costar is Frankie Laine singing that wonderful title song by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington. Tiomkin was one of the best of movie composers his music gave that extra oomph into a lot of good movies making them great.".

Lancaster as Wyatt Earp moves through this film like a ballet dancer and Douglas as Doc Holliday squares that famous chin and gets tough while hacking up his lungs to tuberculosis. Who can forget Lancaster running and diving across the corral with a shotgun. His former career as an acrobat and trapeze artist is on display here.The supporting cast is about as good as it gets. From Lyle Bettger to John Ireland as the bad guys......to Jo VanFleet as Doc's woman.....to Dennis Hopper as the confused youngest Clanton. Rhonda Fleming is beautiful and is only part of the subplot used to flesh out the running time but I'm not complaining.You don't have to be a fan of westerns to get involved in this epic tale......and I haven't even mentioned Frankie Lane's title song. It's a heroic tale of family honor and violent consequences when honor is challenged. Accuracy be damned......it's a great film.".

The chemistry between Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster works extremely well. This movie works because of great stars and a solid cast of great actors. The score is outstanding featuring Frankie Lane singing the title song. The photography is very realistic compared to most westerns of that era. The gunfight at the Ok Corral is worth waiting for.

	schema:reviewBody "'Gunfight at O.K. Corral' is one of the many films that have told the tale of the famous showdown between the Earps and the Clantons but setting this version apart is the ideal casting of Burt Lancaster as the straightshooting Marshal Wyatt Earp and Kirk Douglas as the sardonic dying gambler Doc Holliday. As in all their pairings there is a chemistry between them that makes even mundane scripts seem magical!Lancaster continuing his rule of alternating between heavy drama and action films researched the historic Earp extensively speaking to many who knew him and his performance is restrained and assured. Douglas on the other hand fresh from playing Vincent Van Gogh in 'Lust for Life' knew he needed a splashy hit film and played Doc Holliday as larger than life swaggering diseased and charismatic. His portrayal is far closer in spirit to the interpretations of Holliday by Val Kilmer in 'Tombstone' and Dennis Quaid in 'Wyatt Earp' than Victor Mature in John Ford's 'My Darling Clementine'.The film cowritten by Leon Uris author of 'Exodus' is a historically fanciful but very entertaining exploration of the friendship between Earp and Holliday as the lawman moves from Dodge City to Tombstone followed by the gambler covering a 'blood debt' after Earp saves his life. The climax is naturally the infamous gun battle between the Earps with Holliday versus the Clanton family and their allies. While purists will quickly note that the shoot'emup presented is totally fabricated watch 'Wyatt Earp' or 'Tombstone' if you want accuracy it certainly is rousing!Other aspects of the film to enjoy...Dimitri Tiompkin's magnificent musical score highlighted by Frankie Laine's unforgettable performance of the title tune throughout the film...Excellent supporting players including Jo Van Fleet as Holliday's mistress John Ireland as evil Johnny Ringo a young Dennis Hopper as Billy Clanton and Rhonda Fleming as the gambler girlfriend of Wyatt based on Earp's actual wife Josie...Cameos by Kenneth Tobey as Bat Masterson DeForest Kelley as Morgan Earp Martin Milner as James Earp and Frank Faylen as the corrupt sheriff.The director John Sturges revisited the Earp saga some years later in 'Hour of the Gun' with James Garner as Earp and Jason Robards as Holliday but while the later film may be more correct historically 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' is a far more enjoyable film. I strongly recommend it to any western fan!".

The second part concerns on Holliday and his mate Kate Jo Van Fleet and appears a gamblingwoman  the redhaired named Laura Rhonda Fleming .

	schema:reviewBody "One of Hollywood's major offerings of 1957 Gunfight contains all the ingredients one would expect of a blockbuster  big stars big budget and a storyline calculated to capture the public's imagination.  For me however the film doesn't quite work.  In the final analysis the whole thing is a little too sluggish a little too formulaic.     To be sure it contains fine things.  Burt Lancaster is stolid and unyielding as hard lawman Wyatt Earp.  Sturges films him with the camera at ground level as he rides onto the screen making him seem superhuman in his largerthanlife moral certainty.  He faces down the armed drunk without the faintest twitch of fear the embodiment of a strong righteous enforcer of the law.  The friendship between the paragon and the wastrel is cleverly done with Earp and Holliday Kirk Douglas each seeing something to admire in the other very different man.  Character is also to the fore as a plotdriver when Kate Fisher Jo Van Fleet is forced by the dynamics of her relationship with the Doc into ever more wretched behaviour.  By comparison the EarpLaura love story is cold and staid.  Both Lancaster and Rhonda Fleming are terrific to look at but hard to warm to.  Though the film takes an eternity to get to the shootout which is its raison d'etre when the climax finally comes the suspense is built superbly.  In a nice symmetry we see the women of both sides dreading the fatal clash as Ma Clanton and Virgil's wife separately mourn the departure of their respective menfolk. Douglas made a career out of playing generousspirited bad guys and one of the best things in this film is Doc Holliday's heroic effort of will rising from his sickbed to stand beside his friend in the face of mortal danger. Shot in a rich Technicolor palette the film's images are strong and clean and at times even beautiful for example the barn fire or the approach of the Earp faction with Cotton standing facing them his body framed by the corral building.     Other elements are not so well done.  Wyatt is too unrelenting a hard man to win the audience's unqualified sympathy as in the scene when he tells the alltoohuman Cotton If you can't handle it any more turn in your badge.  The Frankie Laine ballad almost de rigeur in 1950's westerns is simply not up to scratch Boot Hill Boot Hill so cold so still ... There is an ugly shadow eclipsing Ike Clanton's face throughout his most important scene.  Billy a very young Dennis Hopper is 'converted' by Wyatt far too easily.     There exists a wide spectrum of opinion on the question of how loyal a work of fiction should remain to the historical event which inspired it. One camp would argue that the artist has total freedom to rework a popular legend such as The Gunfight while the other extremity would insist on documentary accuracy.  This film is interesting in that it takes a wellknown incident for which contemporaneous records abound and virtually disregards the historical truth.     In the film the decent cleanshaven Earp boys are merely 'doing what a man has to do'.  We know that the ClantonMcLaury gang is mean and duplicitous and that there will have to be a showdown between Right and Wrong.  The shootout when it comes happens over several minutes of time on a clear bright day.  There is an athletic battle of movement with the Earps in particular manoeuvring for position and finally trapping the Clantons in and around a burning wagon.  The strategic intentions of the good guys are clear and easy to follow.     The reality of October 26 1881 was quite different.  Two gangs of walrusmustachioed men confronted each other standing facetoface in a builtup street.  The shooting lasted a maximum of 30 seconds and when the smoke cleared three of the socalled cowboy faction lay dead or mortally wounded whereas the Earp faction sustained only minor wounds.  Wyatt was totally unharmed.  Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne two of the cowboy leaders had in fact run away when the guns opened fire.     This was no tussle between Good and Evil.  Wyatt Earp was not a US Marshall as the film tries to insist.  He was Virgil's assistant with purely local authority little more than his brother's pinchhitter.  Doc Holliday held no office of any kind.  This was a clash between two Americas  the Earps representing the urban northern republican culture which had won the Civil War while the Clantons stood for the freebooting democratic openrange mentality whose sympathies lay with the vanquished South.     A motion picture has a span of something like 90 minutes in which to set out its stall.  Perhaps such a narrow intellectual space imposes so many constrictions that the true flavour of a historic event can never be properly represented.  Or maybe the limitations of the medium set the filmmaker free to create a better more poetic reality.  I don't know the answer.  There probably isn't one.".

It makes the movie more easy and probably also more fun and light to follow than most other genre movies. The movie features very many characters with could had made the movie confusing to follow but you just know who all the characters are and where they stand.The story is very fascinating and entertaining. It's a bold story about gunslingers and lawmen and getting even. The story also leaves room for subplots and layers about family and friendship mostly of course the 'unusuasul' friendship between Wyatt Earp and 'Doc' Holliday. Unusual because their characters are some different from each other. The movie even leaves room for the lovestory between Wyatt and his lady friend though it's not as much present in the story as you would perhaps expect and it most certainly does not distract from the movie as a whole.The storytelling is great and begins from the moment Wyatt tries to settle down after his career as a lawman and the movie ends with the well known confrontation and shootout at the O.K. Corral. Yes the movie takes lot of liberty with the true story but its all for the good of the movie and its entertainment value. Director John Sturges surely knows how to tell a good story!It's a very pure western with all of the classic ingredients present of course gunfights card games and shootouts. The ending shootout at the O.K. Corral is surprisingly well brought to the screen. It's action packed and really spectacular filmed. It makes the ending very exciting and spectacular as well to watch.All of the characters are great and it's true that the movie is most definitely uplifted by the performances of the cast. Burt Lancaster is fairly good in the role of Wyatt Earp but the one that steals the show is Kirk Douglas as John 'Doc' Holliday. Also quite fun to see how much the 'young' Kirk Douglas looked like his son Michael. They even sound the same. The movie features an also still very young and hard to recognize Dennis Hopper as Billy Clanton.The movie its musical score is highly unusual. I mean the theme is actually sung by Frankie Laine! But it fits the movie surprisingly well and knows to capture the mood and atmosphere of the movie. The same goes for the 'normal' musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin.A very pleasant and greatly told movie from John Sturges with also memorable performances from the cast.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The stories and films about Wyatt Earp Doc Holliday and the Clantons are always interesting at least to me. They've been put on film a half dozen times over the years. I think the best feature of this particular version was the beautiful muted colors. Now that it's out on DVD I would like to see this on a nice widescreen transfer. My only looks two of them were on VHS. Storywise most of the others Earp films were more interesting than this one. What makes the story worth seeing are two big stars playing main roles Burt Lancaster as Wyatt Earp and Kirk Douglas as Doc Holliday. What's different about the story is that unlike all other versions Earp and Holliday are not good friends throughout this movie although they wind up as allies in the final shootout. Also the arguments between Holliday and his girlfriend Kate Jo Van Fleet grow tiresome after awhile.Overall this doesn't have enough action to satisfy today's viewers except for the shootout scene at the end which goes on for at least 10 minutes.".

Doc Holliday carries what looks like a .32 caliber popgun.On the other hand Lee Van Cleef is a drunken treacherous bad guy. So is Jack Elam. Lyle Bettger as the head of the Clanton clan is a cattle thief liar and bushwhacker. Does that give you any hints about stereotypical casting? No? How about Burt Lancaster as Wyatt Earp and Kirk Douglas as the morally ambiguous but highly honorable Doc Holliday? And Dennis Hopper as the weakling Billy Clanton? John Ireland playing Johnny Ringo  yet again? Ted DeCorsia  he of the pebbled voice  as a rude drunken coward? It's difficult to confuse the heroes and the heavies because they look as if they'd come from different universes. Maybe that's one reason why despite its length and territorial peregrinations the plot never really confuses you too much. One look at a character and right away you've got his number. It doesn't matter too much where you are or what motives drive anyone. One bad guy is pretty much interchangeable with the others.Admirable though are the edgy and sometimes uncomfortable relationships that Holliday has with Wyatt Earp and Holliday's girl friend Kate played by Jo Van Fleet. In a way it's really Kirk Douglas's picture. He's by far the most complex character in it. Lancaster's Wyatt Earp and his brothers are dull straightshooters. But Douglas drinks too much gambles constantly kills men in duels is jealous of women even after he throws them away and is coughing himself to death. How come? We don't have to ask why Wyatt is the way he is. He's the hero in a Western. Candidate for next most complicated Dennis Hopper's young misguided Billy Clanton. The script even gives him a loving mother and not just ANY mother but Olive Carey to boot.What are these affairs of honor anyway? The code duello was real enough brought to the antebellum South by the cavaliers who settled the region and then spread westward into Texas and the Southwest. Someone insults someone else and the two men kill one another. And it still exists if only in fantasy. There are quickdraw contests held at regional and state fairs in which grown men assume odd positions and see who can draw and pull the trigger faster while being automatically timed. Do any of the contestants secretly wish that THEY could have lived in the Old West and outdrawn everyone who insulted them? Compared to figuring out a fantasy like that understanding Doc Holliday is like two plus two.At the end of the shootout at the O.K. Corral bad Johnny Ringo pursued by Kirk Douglas's Holliday stumbles into an adobe hut pistol pointed at the door he just slammed. But Douglas appears suddenly in the open window and plugs him to death. In the Mad Magazine parody O. K. Gunfight at the Corral Ringo stumbles into the hut slams the door and thinks to himself I guess I'm okay for now. There's nothing in this room. It's empty except for that picture of Van Gogh on the wall. But it's not a self portrait of Vincent Van Gogh. It's Kirk Douglas with a little beard and a straw hat  and he plugs Ringo anyway.Overall nicely staged preened and pruned Hollywood professionalism near the top of its game.".

	schema:headline " Personal is not the same thing as important";
	schema:reviewBody "This must have been one of the first Westerns I ever saw and I was completely bowled over  not so much by the story as by the tightknit web of loyalties and obligations that run through the film. Watching it again after a lapse of years and four or five other pictures on the same subject that knifeedge tension is inevitably spoilt to some degree by foreknowledge yes hero and antihero will successfully team up and Doc Holliday will rise from his deathbed. And I'm more aware of the Western clichs for example the way that Holliday is repeatedly used to preserve Wyatt's lilywhite hero status by stepping in to do the actual shooting alas I'll never recapture quite that state of adolescent innocence again.But if the overall outcome is no longer up for grabs individual scenes can still despite all logic mesmerise. My adult self knows perfectly well that Wyatt must survive until the end of the film... but watches with bated breath as he faces down an armed drunk by sheer force of will. As for Holliday's tormented relationship with Kate crippled by mutual selfloathing almost every scene is a nailbiter as you ache for these two lost souls to stop hurting one another and find some comfort in their shared dependence.The Holliday role is inevitably the scenestealer in any version of this story as the antihero he gets all the best lines. And while the Earps as lawmen have to do the right thing or at least are supposed to for Holliday it remains a matter of active and thus significant choice at every turning. Some of the most agonizing tension in the film comes in the scene where having given his word 'as a gentleman' not to betray Wyatt's trust by engaging in extracurricular killing he is challenged to fight in a matter of personal pride two codes and two loyalties conflict with Doc's 'better self' caught hopelessly between them. Does he have the strength of character  the surviving shred of honour  to hold out in the face of mounting humiliation? Can he bear to hold to his word at the cost of his reputation? Ironically when Wyatt faces the same choice  between the 'personal' and the 'important'  he comprehensively fails it he has to of course or there wouldn't be any point to the film's title but it gives an oddly downbeat note to the final confrontation. By going out hand to hand against the Clantons in revenge for his brother's death by abandoning the law in a quest for personal vengeance he is effectively betraying everything he formerly stood for and he knows it. Again and again we've seen him refuse to escalate under provocation this time he allows himself to be pulled in.

	onyx:emotionText "This must have been one of the first Westerns I ever saw and I was completely bowled over  not so much by the story as by the tightknit web of loyalties and obligations that run through the film. Watching it again after a lapse of years and four or five other pictures on the same subject that knifeedge tension is inevitably spoilt to some degree by foreknowledge yes hero and antihero will successfully team up and Doc Holliday will rise from his deathbed. And I'm more aware of the Western clichs for example the way that Holliday is repeatedly used to preserve Wyatt's lilywhite hero status by stepping in to do the actual shooting alas I'll never recapture quite that state of adolescent innocence again.But if the overall outcome is no longer up for grabs individual scenes can still despite all logic mesmerise. My adult self knows perfectly well that Wyatt must survive until the end of the film... but watches with bated breath as he faces down an armed drunk by sheer force of will. As for Holliday's tormented relationship with Kate crippled by mutual selfloathing almost every scene is a nailbiter as you ache for these two lost souls to stop hurting one another and find some comfort in their shared dependence.The Holliday role is inevitably the scenestealer in any version of this story as the antihero he gets all the best lines. And while the Earps as lawmen have to do the right thing or at least are supposed to for Holliday it remains a matter of active and thus significant choice at every turning. Some of the most agonizing tension in the film comes in the scene where having given his word 'as a gentleman' not to betray Wyatt's trust by engaging in extracurricular killing he is challenged to fight in a matter of personal pride two codes and two loyalties conflict with Doc's 'better self' caught hopelessly between them. Does he have the strength of character  the surviving shred of honour  to hold out in the face of mounting humiliation? Can he bear to hold to his word at the cost of his reputation? Ironically when Wyatt faces the same choice  between the 'personal' and the 'important'  he comprehensively fails it he has to of course or there wouldn't be any point to the film's title but it gives an oddly downbeat note to the final confrontation. By going out hand to hand against the Clantons in revenge for his brother's death by abandoning the law in a quest for personal vengeance he is effectively betraying everything he formerly stood for and he knows it. Again and again we've seen him refuse to escalate under provocation this time he allows himself to be pulled in. And when the final shot has sounded his lawman's badge goes spinning down into the silence  his selfrighteous selfconfident days are done.Most versions of the OK Corral story start with Wyatt  Co riding into Tombstone and planning to hang up their guns for a prosperous civilian life given its take on the theme this one chooses to establish its version of the character and of the law on active duty via a succession of little frontier towns introduced by a sombre common thread  Boot Hill.

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1957 and directed by John Sturges Gunfight at the OK Corral stars Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday in a loose adaption of the events that led up to the famous shootout in Tombstone Arizona on October 26 1881. Rhonda Fleming and Jo Van Fleet are on hand as the protagonists' respective babes. Earl Holliman is noteworthy as Earp's deputy in Dodge City while John Ireland plays Johnny Ringo. DeForest Kelley Bones from Star Trek has a small role as one of the Earp brothers while a young Dennis Hopper plays Billy Clanton. This is a dialoguedriven production that reflects the era in which it was made hokey opening cowboy song and all. If you can acclimate to its 'world' there are a lot of rewarding elements particularly the growing friendship of Wyatt and Doc which starts out shaky to say the least. It's their relationship that anchors the story which has trouble working up suspense since it takes place in three distant locationsFort Griffen Texas Dodge City Kansas and Tombstone Arizona. By the time the Earp brothers  Holliday relocate to Tombstone there are a mere 50 minutes left in the movie which means there's only a small measure of time to establish the villainy of Ike Clanton Lyle Bettger  his 'Cowboys' outlaw gang and subsequently buildup to the climatic shootout. Speaking of which the real Tombstone gunfight only lasted about 30 seconds here's it's 16times longer at 8 minutes. Most other versions are more accurate on this count e.g. Hour of the Gun 1967 which by the way is Sturges' sequel to this one albeit with a different cast and a more accurate gunfight at the OK Corral Doc 1971 Tombstone 1993 and Wyatt Earp 1994. Speaking of Tombstone one of the reasons it was a hit is because it had well over an hour to build up to the main shootout and did so expertly Wyatt Earp less so but then Wyatt excels in areas that Tombstone doesn't like mundane realism and exposition on the title character. Besides the anchor of Wyatt and Doc's relationship Gunfight at the OK Corral does try to workup suspense through a fictitious growing rivalry between Doc and Johnny Ringo. While this is a talky Western it's interspersed with nigh shocking violence like a knifetothechest in the opening act. Nevertheless it IS dialogueoriented so to get the most out of it you'll have to 1. listen closely or 2. use the subtitles like I did which helps you keep track of names and various important mumbled statements. I shouldn't close without mentioning Rhonda Fleming and her whoaman beauty in a fictitious peripheral role. The film runs 122 minutes and was shot in Old Tucson and other Arizona locations as well as Paramount Ranch and Paramount Studios California. GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "Gunfight at the OK Corral 1957This has the makings of a classic and of course the story is one of the great ture legends of the Wild West. Burt Lancaster as the tough and unbending lawman and Kirk Douglas as the unpredictable semilawless cad are both great and the best scenes are probably those with the two of them. The rest of the cast is reasonable some of them really good though maybe the all important bad guys lacked some kind of wild evil they might have needed a Lee Marvin intensity. One of the bad guys Johnny Ringo is played by a nice guy actor John Ireland even though Ringo was never part of thie OK Corral story. It does have a young Dennis Hopper which is fun to see and Hopper hailed from Dodge City itself in real life.Still it looked like it would really be equivalent to Rio Bravo and others from the same time period.Not so not for me. And it's simply because of that whole range of different things that add up in a great movie and slip and slither in a decent one. For example there are a number of interludes with horses walking through the big landscape and the corny theme song is sung through a new verse. I can't believe this was effective even at the time music from 1957 in general wasn't so corny and fakey including country music but now it deadened the flow. Likewise the series of events didn't always seem to lead one to the next in a compelling way as the interludes allowed a shift in location and sometimes a whole new situation to develop.One problem if this is a problem is that it's based on facts. I think this made the movie makers add information and keep switching towns simply because it was the way it was and they thought they must. Maybe they did. Oddly they got lots of the essentials wrong that might actually make a better movie if someone wants to take another crack at it quick details at wikipedia. The final famous shootout is fun and well done but way too obvious with the good guys always getting their target and the bad guys missing or hitting a leg.So why the reputation? It isn't bad and it is always compelling to see Douglas in particular in almost any film. The filming by Charles Lang one of the greats is first rate and so just watching whatever the scene is enjoyable.".

Mustache event clearly goes to Kurt Russell and James Garner over Burt Lancaster. Lancaster plays it straight to the hilt and that's fine. The more interesting role is Doc Holiday who would have been a godsend to dentistry if he could have taken care of his cough. His lady friend you slut looks like she has seen better days and the nod goes to Kilmer's gal Kate played by Joanna Pacula. Kirk is great as always and proves a little cold water on the face is all you need plus a few shots of courage before a shootout. Johnny Ringo John Ireland has obviously lost his Cherry and crossed the Red River to Tombstone. Martin Milner 1 Adam 12 DeForest Kelly Bones and Dennis Hopper don't do to much but make you realize this movie almost 50 years old.I recommend it because of the play between the two lead characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Gunfight at the O.K. Corral takes many liberties with the historical facts of the incident it is nevertheless a classic western thanks mainly to the chemistry of its two stars Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas and its director the legendary John Sturges.Lancaster plays Wyatt Earp and Douglas Doc Holiday. Although neither even closely resemble the two characters their respective performances make you overlook this little flaw.The story opens in the dusty Texas town of Griffen Texas where Ed Bailey Lee Van Cleef rides in to exact revenge on Doc Holiday who killed his brother. At the same time Wyatt rides in hoping to find Ike Clanton Lyle Bettger being held by long time friend Sheriff Cotton Wilson Frank Faylen. Wilson however confesses that he no longer has the desire to be a lawman and that he didn't detain Clanton.Wyatt goes to the local saloon run by Shanessay George Mathews to seek information. He learns that Clanton had played cards with Doc Holiday. Earp and Holiday meet for the first time and don't immediately like each other. Wyatt gives Doc a tip that gives him an edge in his showdown with Bailey.Next the story moves to Dodge City Kansas where Wyatt is town marshal and his friend Bat Materson Ken Tobey is county sheriff. One day a beautiful lady gambler named Laura Denbow Rhonda Fleming comes to town and an attraction develops between the two. Naturally Doc turns up in town with his lady Kate Jo Van Fleet in tow.

	onyx:emotionText "Although Gunfight at the O.K. Corral takes many liberties with the historical facts of the incident it is nevertheless a classic western thanks mainly to the chemistry of its two stars Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas and its director the legendary John Sturges.Lancaster plays Wyatt Earp and Douglas Doc Holiday. Although neither even closely resemble the two characters their respective performances make you overlook this little flaw.The story opens in the dusty Texas town of Griffen Texas where Ed Bailey Lee Van Cleef rides in to exact revenge on Doc Holiday who killed his brother. At the same time Wyatt rides in hoping to find Ike Clanton Lyle Bettger being held by long time friend Sheriff Cotton Wilson Frank Faylen. Wilson however confesses that he no longer has the desire to be a lawman and that he didn't detain Clanton.Wyatt goes to the local saloon run by Shanessay George Mathews to seek information. He learns that Clanton had played cards with Doc Holiday. Earp and Holiday meet for the first time and don't immediately like each other. Wyatt gives Doc a tip that gives him an edge in his showdown with Bailey.Next the story moves to Dodge City Kansas where Wyatt is town marshal and his friend Bat Materson Ken Tobey is county sheriff. One day a beautiful lady gambler named Laura Denbow Rhonda Fleming comes to town and an attraction develops between the two. Naturally Doc turns up in town with his lady Kate Jo Van Fleet in tow. Despite their differences the two men grow to like and respect each other. Doc helps Wyatt subdue Shanghai Pierce Ted DeCorsia and his gang of cattle drovers which includes gunfighter Johnny Ringo John Ireland. Doc and Ringo develop an immediate dislike for each other.Wyatt then receives a call for help from his brother Virgil John Hudson. He learns that the Clantons have a nearby ranch.

There were several Earp sisters in between the brothers and there was an older halfbrother.  All 5 of the Earp brothers were in Tombstone at the time of the gunfight.  As usual Burt Lancaster turned in a great performance without hamming it up.  His background in the circus made him so agile and graceful it was always a pleasure to watch him move.".

I mean even in death was his judgment that seriously impaired?The boys are up to the necks in it in the town of Brushwood Gulch when they try to do their good deed. In fact Ollie's up to it even before as Stan innocently dumps the freeloading Ollie who is snoozing in a travois drawn by their donkey while Stan is guiding the poor animal. Dumps Ollie in a creek mind you. Serves him right actually.The boys arrive in town and wouldn't you know it they tell bartender James Finlayson what their mission is. So the quick thinking Finlayson gets his wife Sharon Lynne to pose as Lawrence and the boys sign the deed over to her. Later on they discover their mistake and the rest of the film is spent trying to make up for their mistake and get the deed to the rightful owner. Of course it's one mishap after another including Stan lighting Ollie's thumb on fire. Don't ask how.Everybody looks like they're having a great old time in Way Out West. Finlayson is a terrific Snidely Whiplash Lynne does a great imitation of the kind of brassy dame that Gladys George or Binnie Barnes had a specialty in and Lawrence is a fabulous little Nell heroine. Way Out West is one of Stan and Ollie's best feature film comedies. It even got an Oscar nomination for Best Musical Scoring. But I still wonder wasn't their anyone else Lawrence's father could get for such a mission?".

Dumps Ollie in a creek mind you. Serves him right actually.The boys arrive in town and wouldn't you know it they tell bartender James Finlayson what their mission is. So the quick thinking Finlayson gets his wife Sharon Lynne to pose as Lawrence and the boys sign the deed over to her. Later on they discover their mistake and the rest of the film is spent trying to make up for their mistake and get the deed to the rightful owner. Of course it's one mishap after another including Stan lighting Ollie's thumb on fire. Don't ask how.Everybody looks like they're having a great old time in Way Out West. Finlayson is a terrific Snidely Whiplash Lynne does a great imitation of the kind of brassy dame that Gladys George or Binnie Barnes had a specialty in and Lawrence is a fabulous little Nell heroine. Way Out West is one of Stan and Ollie's best feature film comedies. It even got an Oscar nomination for Best Musical Scoring. But I still wonder wasn't their anyone else Lawrence's father could get for such a mission?";

On his death they must take a locket and the deeds to a valuable goldmine to his daughter.  When they arrive at the saloon where she works the saloon owner sees a chance to get rich and gets one of his dancers to pretend to be the daughter Mary.  When they discover their mistake the pair try to get the deeds back but are driven out of town.  They plan to return that night and rob the safe of the deeds and return them to Mary.I have been watching plenty of Laurel  Hardy shorts recently but it's been many years since I saw anything longer from them so it was with great joy I saw this in the TV schedule and settled down to watch it.  My first observation as a short watcher is that it is surprisingly close to the consistency of the shorts even if it is over three times longer than those. The plot is detailed enough to provide several really good routines but also plenty of really enjoyable gags.Of great enjoyment to a fan of the shorts were several comic scenes that showed them to be more than just funny men.  The soft shoe shuffle is the oftquoted favourite and is quite amusing but the songs are all enjoyable without intruding on the comedy in the way some films of the time did.  The most pleasurable aspect is Hardy's voice  he is a charming baritone and is really surprising.  Laurel is good too and the pair are cool on Trail of the Lonesome Pine'.Both Laurel  Hardy's delivery is impeccable and the routines and gags are only made better by their talent.  Finalyson is excellent and for me is easily the king of that double takesquint thing that he does so very well! Lynn and Lawrence are both OK but are really secondary characters behind the men.Overall fans will rightly love this film and it may also win over some who have yet to experience the pair.  It has music dance routines and gags  all delivered by the great duo themselves.  What more do you need?".

	schema:reviewBody "Way Out West is unique in two ways. Not only is it the only Western Laurel and Hardy ever made but it's the only feature with a title card reading A Stan Laurel Production. It also has one of the oldest plots since movies first flickered onto the screen that of a daughter inheriting a gold mine from her father which Laurel and Hardy have to deliver.The boys have come west to give the deed to Mary Roberts Rosina Lawrence a present from her late father Sy. She works for Mr.Finn James Finlayson who runs the local saloon with his wife singer Lola MarcelSharon Lynn. Together they plot to steal the deed from Mary. As Laurel and Hardy have never seen Mary Lola pretends to be her full of sweetness and light. Stan is his usual tactful self.Lola Tell me about my dear dear daddy. Is it true that he's dead?Stan Well we hope he is we buried him.Later when they meet the real Mary Roberts the boys are determined to get the deed back. As Stan tells Ollie We'll get that deed back or I'll eat your hat!A running gag has the two crossing a lake to get in and out of town on the Roach lot this was known as Lake Laurel and Hardy. Stan crosses without incident but Ollie manages to find the deepest part every time. As he sinks into the water only his hat is left floating on top.Meanwhile the boys almost succeed in getting back the deed but Lola corners Stan in a locked bedroom and tickles him until he hands it over a very funny scene. Chased out of town by the sheriff they contemplate their next move Ollie has fallen into the lake again so his wet clothes are drying on the line. Ollie reminds Stan about the statement he made regarding a certain hat. He then forces Stan to eat it. At first he begins to cry but after a while he gets a big napkin sprinkles some salt on it and begins to enjoy it. Ollie quickly pulls it away but as Stan goes to check on his clothes Ollie takes a bite and chews. He spits it out disgusted. Although Ollie is disdainful of Stan he's also a little jealous. After all if ignorance is bliss Stan must be ecstatic.Just as he used his thumb as a pipe and smoked it in Blockheads Stan is able to light a candle with his thumb in this film. All through the movie a jealous Ollie tries to do it when his thumb finally goes on fire he's so terrified Stan has to come blow it out. Way Out West is also one of their most musical pictures featuring a duet on Trail of the Lonesome Pine and a great dance scene. Ollie had a fine voice having been trained as a singer early in his career. In fact as wonderful as their singing and dancing is it's amazing that it occurs so infrequently in the films.One problem that somewhat spoils the duo's great dancing is that for some reason it was filmed on a sound stage with obvious back projection. The only time back projection should ever be used is when someone is riding in a car or train. But even that can go terribly wrong if not done carefully. The worst back projection I've ever seen is when Lauel and Hardy are driving in the car at the end of County Hospital. It ruins what would otherwise be one of their finest shorts.".

Rosalina Lawrence best known as one of the school teachers on the Our Gang series is merely adequate as the heroine but Finlayson and Lynne are downright hysterical. A funny twist involving the boys trying to get into their house during the middle of the night is guaranteed to give the viewer chest pains from laughing including such props as the forlorn mule and a strategically placed bucket. This is farce at its best coming in a year that focused mainly on the sophisticated screwball comedy of the major studios and it certainly places amongst the best of that year as far as classic comedy is concerned.".

	schema:reviewBody "As with any classic Laurel  Hardy the plot is unimportant and just a frame on which to showcase their sweetly innocent brand of humor. Here they're trying to keep ownership of a goldmine out of the greedy clutches of a saloon owner and his blonde canary. The boys don't show up until 10 minutes into the proceedings but from then on they are center stage with one routine after another. Most are pretty funny though the keepaway parlor chase goes on a shade too long as does the breakin escapade. However when Hardy smugly revels in his superiority only to lose his outer garments and dignity to Laurel's witless bungling we get a good look at the core of their appeal.The comedy bits may be entertaining but the several song and dance numbers are sublime. Notice how effortlessly the duo picks up on the hiccuping beat of the musical Avalon Boys. The resulting dance duet is among the most charming in film annals. Hardy in particular transforms from ungainly fat man into nimble blithe spirit a beguiling triumph of grace over bulk and more meaningful in its implications than the miles of overproduced over choreographed numbers from Hollywood's army of Big Musicals.Sadly theirs is the fey gentle humor of an era gone by. Quite simply there's been no one like them before or since. But at least a permanent record of their achievement remains for the rest of us who enjoy this lighthearted look at classic comedy.".

Most are pretty funny though the keepaway parlor chase goes on a shade too long as does the breakin escapade. However when Hardy smugly revels in his superiority only to lose his outer garments and dignity to Laurel's witless bungling we get a good look at the core of their appeal.The comedy bits may be entertaining but the several song and dance numbers are sublime. Notice how effortlessly the duo picks up on the hiccuping beat of the musical Avalon Boys. The resulting dance duet is among the most charming in film annals. Hardy in particular transforms from ungainly fat man into nimble blithe spirit a beguiling triumph of grace over bulk and more meaningful in its implications than the miles of overproduced over choreographed numbers from Hollywood's army of Big Musicals.Sadly theirs is the fey gentle humor of an era gone by. Quite simply there's been no one like them before or since. But at least a permanent record of their achievement remains for the rest of us who enjoy this lighthearted look at classic comedy.";

	schema:reviewBody "WAY OUT WESTI love Laurel  Hardy. They were comedy genius' that nobody can ever replace. These 2 gentlemen are the funniest people that ever lived.Way Out West is one the best films in my opinion. When I was a kid I watched this film so many times and every time I laughed just as much as the last time.The story is about these 2 men who have to go and see a young lady to give her the bad news about her fathers death and hand over a deed to a gold mine that he left for her. When her guardians hear about the deed they trick the 2 men into handing over the deed to them. Their mission is now to get the deed back and hand it to the correct person.This really is so funny that I have tears running down my face every time I see it... but it is like that when I watch any Laurel  Hardy film. There are so many memorable scenes in this movie. One of my favourites is when Stan  Ollie are running around a room with the 2 guardians fighting over the deed then Stan puts the deed down his top but when the lady tries to take it out she is tickling him... when he starts laughing I can't help but laugh so hard it hurts. Stan has the most convincing and contagious laugh ever!This film also has one the most famous Laurel  Hardy songs... Trail of the Lonesome Pine which reached number 2 in the charts when it was released on single.The film is only on for an hour but it is really worth watching. The film was made in 1937 so as you can imagine the effects and picture are not brilliant but for it's time it was amazing.The film also stars James Finlayson. James starred in a lot of other Laurel  Hardy movies and shorts... he has such a funny face. The expressions he pulls in these movies is hilarious. I always look forward to seeing James in the films when I watch them.Other stars were Sharon Lynn  Rosina Lawrence.Stan and Ollie have the greatest partnership ever in cinema. They work so well together and even though they fight through most of their films you can see they have such a respect and love for each other. It really is amazing. They have perfect comedy timing and their faces can be so funny when they just look at the camera.This is the first film I have reviewed that is going to get 10 out of 10.This is pure genius and a classic... and even though we have been without Stand and Ollie for a lot of years now... their movies and comedy never get's old or out dated. I have met a lot of famous people in my life and got a lot of autographs but I am so gutted I am too young to have met these guys. That would be the best meeting ever!For more reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpswww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

I can confirm that I did I'm surprised that I didn't wake up my wife and daughters during the scene where Stan is being tickled. The dance routine is pure gold and Ollie is surprisingly nimble for a big man.For the musical scenes and also Stan's tickling scene this probably cements Way Out West as the best feature length movie that the boys made.

It is their only real Western PICK A STAR has a sequence where they are shooting a movie set in Mexico but they were in another modern period in other parts of that film and has usually been considered better than other major comedians' westerns. While it is no doubt better than the Marx Brother's GO WEST it is hard to be dismissive of the W.C.FieldsMae West comedy MY LITTLE CHICKADEE any film where a lynch mob asks Fields if he has any last wishes and he says 1 he wants to see Paris before he dies  but 2 Philadelphia will do!  has to be first rate!. The Martin and Lewis comedy PARDNERS has some nice moments in it too note the brief but telling moment when Lewis breaks his downtrodden son persona and shows a type of homicidal streak towards ironwilled momma Agnes Moorehead. The difference is that WAY OUT WEST is seamless in it's flow of events and humor. Like SONS OF THE DESERT BABES IN TOYLAND and BLOCKHEADS the events of the scenario don't seem forced let's face it  no matter how amusing that gorilla in SWISS MISS was how many gorillas are likely to appear on rope bridges in the Alps?.The boys are on a mission here  a gold miner who found a rich mine has died but before dying he gave the boys a deed to his mine to give to his daughter. The daughter is Mary Roberts Rosina Lawrence who is working as a maid in the saloon owned by Mickey Finn Jimmy Finleyson and occasionally helps prepare his lead singer and girlfriend Lola Marcel Sharon Lynn for the stage appearances. When Stan blurts out the reason for seeking out Mary to Finn he passes off Lola as Mary. The boys after some irritating delays  deliciously bothering Finleyson and Lynn give them the deed. But then they discover the error and try to get the deed back. Earlier they had managed to anger the town's sheriff Stanley Field by annoying his wife Vivian Oakland in a stagecoach. Field doesn't want to hear their complaint against Finn and they are run out of town. Eventually however the mistake is corrected to Finn's great discomfort and the boys and Mary head down the road presumably to develop her mine.This barely describes what stuff Laurel came up with. There was the spoof on Claudette Colbert's manner of stopping cars here stagecoaches in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. There are the musical numbers the soft shoe dance of Stan and Ollie to Commence A  Dancin' sung by the Avalon Boys including a young Chill Wills and the later singing of In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia sung delightfully by Ollie  Hardy had a good tenor voice  and then sung supposedly by Laurel using fake voices  one is Chill Wills' until Stan's head is hit with a mallet and then Rosina Lawrence's as Stan supposedly ends the song. There is the business here of Stan's incredible magic ability to turn his hand into a cigarette lighter and how Ollie keeps trying to duplicate it until his hand becomes a torch briefly it is like the earsie eyesie nosie routine in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER also bedeviling Ollie and Henry Armetta. There are bits with Finleyson like discovering his cash register is always announcing one dollar sales but nothing larger. He discovers that James Morton his bartender doesn't find it terrible but very useful for his purposes Finn does one of his doubletakes hearing this admission. And Hardy has his moments of dialog  addressing an annoyed Vivien Oakland in that stagecoach he announces cheerfully Lots of weather we've had recently. Finn has some good quick dialog too. To hide briefly that Mary is the maid and not Lola when Stan hears him seemingly calling the maid Mary Finn turns around and laughingly says Mary Christmas!The final scene of the film also shows the boys and Ms Lawrence in song  singing We're going to Dixie land! And we finally learn that Stan came from the South of London.With hardly a single wasted moment on film WAY OUT WEST is a joyful comedy experience. If not the best comic western ever done it has to be in the top ten comic westerns.".

Wild as in a shootout scene and wild as in wild women. Those female singers and dancers were beautiful. The woman who played the female lead in the film Sharon Lynn Lola really captured my eye.But once the boys appeared the comedy actually slowed down and after over a half hour of almost no laughs I almost canned it but it picked up in the second half and we even saw Stan and OIlie do a little soft shoe but I got this for the comedy not dancing.Humor is in the eye of the beholder and I sure am in the minority here on this movie but I didn't find this one of LH's funniest films at all. To me there was far more drama and music than comedy in here. The oldtime comics with the exception of Groucho Mark were best doing slapstick. Sorry but this movie was not as good as advertised. It just wasn't very funny.".

I thought I might die and was rolling around on the floor in front of my TV.I'd only seen the song of Trail of the Lonesome Pine and the dance excerpt up to yesterday when I caught the whole performance on youtube. I was in repeated paroxysms of laughter. What stupefies and astonishes me is that there are actually some people who think these two aren't funny. My daughterinlaw informed me some time ago that Laurel and Hardy's humour only appeals to men. I told her that was a strange opinion because my own mother in living memory had thought them the funniest ever. This film starts off very well. It establishes beyond all doubt that we are here visiting the wild west at its woolliest not to say its hollywoodiest and it will be an ideal not to say perfect place for our two heroes to embark on yet another of their fine and messy adventures. The spontaneous softshoe shuffle by an inspired stroke of creative genius was performed on a sound stage against a back projection of a western town's characters going about their daily business. A sublime piece of surreality. Where else could this bowler hatted duo perform quite so elegantly except in this nonexistent neverneverland ? It is certainly useful to know that we have been having a lot of weather recently. It must be the season because it is soon about to be Mary Christmas. Time for the end of this review.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can add very little to previous reviews of this film save to say it's still one of my favourite comedies from Stan and Ollie. Endearing  almost a celebration of cinema's greatest gagsters  Way Out West is just a film to love and a film to laugh with.Laurel and Hardy come to Brushwood Gulch to deliver a deed to a goldmine to a young daughter left behind when her late father went prospecting. And of course they get stiffed by the irresistible rascal Jimmy Finlayson. This is one of Fin's best showings those close ups of his reaction when Stan and Ollie hand over the deed had me in stitches.Of course there is also the wonderful chemistry of the stars themselves. Their dance to At The Ball That's All is a perfect joy and who can forget On the Trail Of The Lonesome Pine? And there's the wonderful running gag of Ollie disappearing to the bottom of a muddy pond never Stan! the highjinks of burgling Fin's house to get the deed back and the wonderful tickling assault on Stan. I struggle to believe that some reviewers don't care much for this film. Well each to his own.The Marx Brothers even borrowed the central plot for Go West which is far from their best effort. As much as I love the Marxes I much prefer this version. The comedian's age may show a little but they are still the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Way Out West is quite simply Laurel and Hardy's best film. Some people and most film critics say Sons of The Desert is Laurel and Hardy's best movie but the reason I like Way Out West over Sons of the Desert is because it never slows down. It is jampacked with verbal jokes and slapstick and two great song and dance routines. There is also some great support from James Finlayson and Harry Bernard. I think the cast of a Laurel and Hardy film tends to be over looked. Who can imagine The Boys movies without Charlie Hall Mae Busch and Tiny Sandford? An interesting thing to note is that the readers of Total Film voted it the 26th greatest comedy film of all time. One of the very finest screen comedies.".
