	schema:headline " A positive joyful film";
	schema:reviewBody "A rich slice of modern life presented wonderfully by Paul Thomas Anderson. Nine or so broken people are followed through the film each of them at least vaguely interconnected to the others. We are shown where they are currently at in life and find out what has happened to have brought them there. By the end of the film they are finally at a point where they can confront what is making them so unhappy and perhaps take control of their lives and look forward to a brighter future even if their time is limited.Some people have complained about the ending of the film perhaps hoping for everything to be neatly tied up or at least for something less absurd than we get. In my opinion however it is perfectly apt for things to end as they do. We dip into these characters' lives in the present learn about their past and leave with optimism for their future. I would have found a cinematic group hug to be overly sentimental and highly unnecessary. For that alone the director must be applauded for exercising some restraint. It would have been far too easy to extend the story a bit further and portray the characters as now being mended but this is not how real life is and would not have rung true with the film's overall tone of this is just something that happens.The sheer ambition of the director is also welcomed. It looks like premillennial tension sparked off a minirenaissance in Hollywood with this film and others such as Fight Club and American Beauty harking back to the period in the 70s when there was no distinction between mainstream and arthouse. Alist actors and directors were not afraid to take a few risks and boxoffice gross was not the only factor used to denote a film's success or failure. It remains to be seen whether the current revival is just a blip. Let's hope not.As for Mr. Cruise although this may be his best performance to date at times he looked a bit out of his depth. At the bedside scene for example the clenched fist intense gaze and facial grimace instantly shattered my suspension of disbelief. This trademark Cruise gesture as much so as Bruce Willis' smirk crossed the line between character and actor turning Frank TJ Mackey back into Tom Cruise  Movie Star. For most of the film his performance was convincing but when the role required some real emotion or loss of control his limited acting range was exposed. I don't think he'll ever be able to achieve the credibility he'd like but a good start would be to take on more such challenging roles with the proviso that they are not obvious vanity projects or oscarvehicles.To sum up I found this film warm and sincere not pretentious as some have suggested. As for the frogs? Well don't strain yourself looking for some deep hidden metaphor just take it at face value and enjoy the pure spectacle that you get from the sheer number and size of the frogs. It's a visually stunning sequence up there with other truly classic moments in cinema.From reading some of the comments presented here it seems a shame that many people can't get past the swearing drugs running time or arthouse cinema tag. To really enjoy this film you probably need to watch it without any such prejudices and to leave your cynicism at the door. Don't be afraid of not getting it take it as you find it. Just sit back let it envelop you and you'll be rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "And it is a FILM.  It is no ordinary movie.  As a fan of Boogie Nights I couldn't wait for Magnolia.  Although its running time has made at least 20 people leave the auditorium I have stayed for every single second.  The mood and stories and characters keep building and building and building and when it finally comes down I feel this immense sense of relief and wonder at how PT Anderson was able to come up with something so clever and intertwining and wonderous and was able to pull it off.  This movie is not for everyone.  It is thinkinghat required.  I have also never been so excited to look up Bible verses before. The cast as you have probably read is superb.  I have never been so impressed.  This film has restored my faith in the filmmaking industry. To see these actors crew and the writerdirectorgenius at work is inspiring.  These people obviously love their craft and one of my friends even said that the cast was touched by the hands of God... to which I wholeheartedly agree.  He also has said This film not only teaches film makers how to make films but it teaches movie watchers how to watch movies! to which I again wholeheartedly agree a thousand times over. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely outstanding as the only character who is normal.  His performance has made me smile and shake my fist in the air the three times I've seen Magnolia since it opened.  Tom Cruise is also spectacular.  As with every single last character every line he utters is important to his character and what it means for the rest of the stories. Another outstanding performancecharacter is the part of police officer Jim Kurring played by John C. Reilly.  His character is just so perfect and JUST SOOOOO PERFECT that it makes me smile every time he is on screen. Add to all of this one incredible soundtrack and you have something that will go down in film history as legend and probably one of the most underappreciated misunderstood and definitely underseen films of all time.The soundtrack oh the soundtrack.  When listening to the songs I can picture each exact moment as if I was watching the movie all over again and it brings unexplainable feeling.  Aimee Mann's songs especially are a perfect fit to a perfect story and mood. This film is not for everyone but if you want to see glorious filmmaking acting writing and characters in action I HIGHLY suggest you see Magnolia.".

	schema:headline " often brilliant occasionally forced film";
	schema:reviewBody "Magnolia' seems to divide audiences as much as it bewilders them.  Some there are who see it as a brilliant exercise in creative thoughtprovoking moviemaking a film that challenges the notion that modern American cinema is comprised exclusively of formulaic retreads of earlier films or slick mechanical displays of technical virtuosity devoid of meaning and feeling. Others view Magnolia' as the nom plus ultra of pretentiousness and selfsatisfied smugness.  Which of the two assessments is the correct one  or does the truth lie somewhere in between?Actually there is much to admire and cherish in Magnolia.' Writerdirector Paul Thomas Anderson has done a commendable job in putting on the screen a relatively unique vision  a qualification I feel forced to make because it does seem patently derived from much of the trailblazing work of director Robert Altman.  Like Altman Anderson creates a vast canvas of barelyrelated and briefly overlapping storylines and characters that come together under the umbrella of a single major theme and a few minor ones as well.  Anderson's concern is to explore the concept of forgiveness and to examine the part it plays in the redemption we all seek through the course of our lifetimes.  In this film dying characters struggle to make amends with the loved ones they will soon leave behind while estranged characters grope tentatively to establish or reestablish the bonds that must link them to other members of the human race.  Anderson presents a tremendously wide range of characters though for a film set in the northern areas of Los Angeles Magnolia' provides a surprisingly nondiverse sea of Caucasian faces.  However in terms of the ages of the characters Anderson's crew seems more comprehensive running the gamut from a preteen wiz kid to a terminally ill man in his mid60's.  Many of these characters seem to have created any number of facades to help them cope with the miseries and disappointments of life  and much of the redemption occurs only after those masks are stripped away revealing the emptiness and hurt that in many cases lurks so close to the surface.Thematically then Anderson's film is a compelling one.  Dramatically however it suffers from some serious flaws.  Many viewers and critics have called Magnolia' an artistic advancement in both depth and scope for Anderson whose previous film was the similarly dense moderately freeform Boogie Nights.'  I tend to disagree.  If anything Boogie Nights' by limiting itself to a much more narrowly restricted milieu  the 1970's porn industry  and focusing intently on a single main character managed to connect more directly with the emotions of the audience.  Magnolia' by being more expansive paradoxically seems more contracted.  The pacing is often languid and the screenplay running a bit over three hours often seems bloated given the singlemindedness of its basic theme.  Certainly a few of these characters and storylines could have been dispensed with at no great cost to the film as a whole.  By lining up all his characters to fit into the same general theme the author allows his message to become a bit heavyhanded and overemphatic.  Anderson seems to want to capture the whole range of human experience on his enormous and enormously long movie canvas yet because the characters seem to all be tending in the same direction  and despite the fact that the details of their experiences are different  the net effect is thematically claustrophobic.The controversial ending in which an event of literally biblical proportions occurs feels generally right in the context of this film though with some reservations.  It seems perfectly in tune with the quality of heightened realism that Anderson establishes and sustains throughout the picture.  On the other hand the ending does pinpoint one of the failures of the film as a whole.  Given that the screenplay has a strong JudeoChristian subtext running all the way through it one wonders why Anderson felt obliged to approach the religious issues in such strictly oblique terms. None of the characters  not even those who are dying  seem to turn to God for their forgiveness and redemption.  In fact one wonders what purpose that quirky ending serves since the characters are well on their way to making amends by the time it happens.Anderson has marshaled an array of firstrate performances from a talented wellknown cast.  Tom Cruise provides a wrenching case study of a shallow charismatic shyster who has parleyed his misogyny into a lucrative selfhelp industry.  Yet like many of the characters he uses this faade as a shield to hide the hurt caused by a father who abandoned him and a mother whose slow painful death he was forced to witness alone.  The other actors too numerous to mention turn in equally worthy performances. Particularly interesting is the young boy who in counterpoint to one of the other characters in the story manages to save himself at an early age from the crippling effect of identity usurpation that it has taken so many others in this film a lifetime to overcome.In many ways Magnolia' is the kind of film that could easily serve as the basis for a lengthy doctoral dissertation for a student majoring in either filmmaking or sociology.  The density of its vision would surely yield up many riches of character symbolism and theme that a first time viewer of the film would undoubtedly miss.   Thus in many ways Magnolia' is that rare film that seems to demand repeat exposure even for those audience members who may not get it' the first time.  As a viewing experience Magnolia' often seems rambling and purposeless but it does manage to get under one's skin and unlike so many other less ambitious works this one grows in retrospect.".

Particularly interesting is the young boy who in counterpoint to one of the other characters in the story manages to save himself at an early age from the crippling effect of identity usurpation that it has taken so many others in this film a lifetime to overcome.In many ways Magnolia' is the kind of film that could easily serve as the basis for a lengthy doctoral dissertation for a student majoring in either filmmaking or sociology.  The density of its vision would surely yield up many riches of character symbolism and theme that a first time viewer of the film would undoubtedly miss.   Thus in many ways Magnolia' is that rare film that seems to demand repeat exposure even for those audience members who may not get it' the first time.  As a viewing experience Magnolia' often seems rambling and purposeless but it does manage to get under one's skin and unlike so many other less ambitious works this one grows in retrospect.";

	schema:reviewBody "Never have I seen a more smug film than Magnolia. It's a movie that thinks very high of it's self. It's not an important film or the masterpiece everyone thinks it is. I find it funny seeing the defense of this movie because dissecting a movie shouldn't be rocket science. Like the smugness of Magnolia as it's cast seems to wink at the audience saying This is deep material we are covering here the fans of Magnolia seem to say that if you don't appreciate this film you don't have their level of intelligence. Magnolia isn't overly complicated it's a three hour mess about selfhating individuals complaining about how life has been so cruel to them. We are meant to think it is quirky and intelligent by having over the top performances and an overpowering and unfitting soundtrack in the background.The plot if you can even claim Magnolia has one tells the story of loosely intertwined lives if you can even call what these people have lives. All most every character in Magnolia isn't likable. Fair enough Paul Thomas Anderson was able to make a masterpiece with the villain Daniel Plainview as the main character but with Magnolia the characters aren't compelling or interesting either certainly not interesting enough to fill 3 hours screen time.I'll try to explain the story of Magnolia and why each story didn't work. The most popular game show in town is What Do Kids Know? It is hosted by the dying Jimmy Gator who has hosted the show for it's 30 year existence. Jimmy molested his daughter Claudia who has grown up to be a coke addict who is pursued by LAPD patrolman Jim Kurring. What Do Kids Know's record is about to be broken by young Stanley Spector the previous record holder Donnie Smith has become a drunken has been longing for the love of a bartender with braces whom he thinks will love him if he gets braces. Magnolia is essentially two stories because the link between the story of the dying Earl Partridge is very weak. Earl Partridge is dying of cancer he has married a gold digger named Linda. Earl spends most of his time with his nurse Phil who tries to fulfill the old man's dying wish by bringing his miserable son Frank TJ Mackey to his deathbed. Frank is the founder of a self help system which guarantees the men who subscribe to it that they will be able to turn any woman they want into their sex slave.That's the long and drawn out plot and we think it works because there are loose connections. However the connections mean little to nothing in the long run. They have little significance to the characters and how they change over the experience of the film. In fact I wouldn't say that any of these characters change at all. They just suffer even more with or without each other. The beginning of the film intrigued me it suggests that rare phenomena occurs through these sort of connections. Nothing phenomenal happens here though other than the biblical plague of frogs raining from the sky with no explanation other than loose references to the bible passage by repetition of the number 82Exodus 82 through out the film.I can't completely condemn Magnolia though it has potential and interesting concepts but it just isn't executed that well. The performances aren't all bad like any ensemble picture there are characters and performances you like more than others. I was a fan of John C Reilly's character because he is the least flawed of the group and his relationship with Claudia was interesting I think P.T.A could have had much more depth there. I think Magnolia's problem is that it's too crowded. I surely would have removed some of the characters and subplots. If you want the central theme to be the connections between these lives than we have to see it and how it has the ability to change these people. Magnolia would have been a better film if it would have come to a much deeper conclusion with these characters because the audience and the characters need to get something from their three hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "A serious wake up call to the land of cinema has arrived with the incredible film MAGNOLIA. Human pain and suffering as well as the ability to avoid making familiar mistakes are hypnotically explored in P.T. Anderson's intricate motion picture. This is the best movie I've seen in over a year and hopefully will set a new example of realistic cinema depicting real human loss and tragedy. You grow and suffer with each and every character in this huge ensemble movie. MAGNOLIA is indeed a sort of tree with varying branches of people situations and irony. To get into any plot aspects would be absurd. This is a 3 hour film that flies by so fast you want more. You won't like every character but you will find every character extremely interesting. I've rarely ever seen such deep character portraits in a major motion picture. The title makes much sense after witnessing such vibrant different colors of the human spirit.P.T. Anderson has arrived especially after BOOGIE NIGHTS which he parallels with this effort. His prior film had many of the same human aspects of right and wrong life and death but were guised by the porn industry. This guy just explodes with presence and energy swallowing us with the events on screen. His camera roves everywhere and does not miss a beat. It takes place over a 24 hour period with roughly 12 major players whose lives interlock in multiple degrees of seriousness and sadness. Some begin sad and end hopeful but these are the few and the lucky ones in this picture.The standouts of the huge cast in particular were Julianne Moore as the shattered wife of TV mogul Earl Partridge Jason Robards existing now only to watch him die before her eyes of cancer. She is one of the unlucky ones a character who made so many mistakes that she cannot do over. Philip Baker Hall is great as the host of What Do Kids Know? a game show with a truly engrossing sideplot. Hall is also dying and may have done irreparable damage to all around him.John C. Reilly is the centerpiece of this extraordinary film. His cop character is the moral middle at the center of some nasty events. He is also the most likable character because he knows how to treat people unlike most of the others. He sees how mistakes can't always be made up for. I must also mention Tom Cruise in a career altering performance that took some courage to do. He is completely original yet not the end all and be all of a film for once.This particular day as captured and presented by writerdirector Anderson has had a profound effect on me. If you see it you may know what I mean. Some scars last forever in this life and we all suffer and feel pain equally. MAGNOLIA is like FIVE EASY PIECES on speed. We see numerous people just trying to get along under some extreme circumstances in a labyrinth method much like the structure of the film's title.RATING ".

That he does it with an incredible energy and spirit and passion makes the film even more powerful.I got the feeling all throughout Magnolia that directory P.T. Anderson really loves his characters. As the camera moves over each of the characters allowing us to see their lives there's a constant feeling that we are seeing the characters souls laid bare on film. When we see Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in a bar ogling the bartender he loves so much of the character is conveyed in one or two small gestures by actor William H. Macy. In five seconds Macy has conveyed the whole inner life of this character who we then see for three more hours. It's a spectacular moment in a film that is filled with spectacular moments. We seem to see Donnie Smith's soul in that moment. And the film is filled with scenes like that.This film is over three hours long but every scene fits well in the movie. It's hard to imagine anything being cut as every scene adds depth and feeling not to mention the back story for each of the characters. I was entranced all the way through this movie I never noticed the time at all.This film has haunted me since I first saw it. I kept thinking about quiz kid Stanley Spector just wanting to go to the bathroom and the haunting soliloquy by Jason Robards on his death bed and Tom Cruise shifting uncomfortably as he was interviewed. So many amazing characters so many amazing performances. And yes I did think about the frogs. Unlike most people I liked the frogs. It leant a magical realist moment to a realistic film and symbolically acted as a kid of purification for the painful lives of the characters. Anderson included the frogs for a reason and they fit his concept of the film brilliantly.This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I'd give it a 10. It's the kind of film that only comes around once every few years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Magnolia is an exhilarating experience for any film lover who wants and desires for films that go above and beyond what the vast majority of movies produced today will give to the audience. Got to the theaters and all you will see are mainstream productions completely formulaic moneydriven and without any real emotion or power. It is a fair argument that all film producers care about today is making a profit getting the audience in and out as quickly as possible and waiting for the next big thing. Paul Thomas Anderson is not such a filmmaker.Magnolia is not such a film. At over three hours long it toys with the audience giving them just enough characters to make them feel they cannot follow until they realize they are completely immersed. It also deals with seriously heavy issues and themes this is not a film for the immature or childish of heart. At times it can be difficult to watch what is happening because of what isn't being said or done the most powerful elements of this film are what is implied.That being said this film succeeds mostly because of the incredible acting from the huge ensemble cast and Anderson's writing which many feel is too pretentious and selfaware to be taken seriously. However this is a film that is either bought or sold immediately by the viewer. I bought it and once you do you are sucked in for the rest of the film. Of course the acting really brings it home with incredibly powerful performances most notably from Jeremy Blackman Phillip Seymour Hoffman Melora Walters and Tom Cruise who completely upstages everyone else proving once again that he is a viable actor capable of being considered great for his time and not just a boxoffice star.Yet this is an auteur production the whole way through and for that reason people either love or hate Magnolia. Anderson is one of the most unique and talented filmmakers of the past 20 years and to see any one of his five films is to witness a special vision of the world. Here we get his views on forgiveness the power of it and how giving or holding it affects us in life. Of course the ending is complex mysterious and perplexing. There are remarkable coincidences and accidents throughout the narrative. Yet no one can deny the unusual power and potency laying dormant beneath these scenes. All that is needed is for someone to open it up be exposed to its ideas and be held in spectacle for three hours. The rest is up to you.".

Mr. Anderson sets out to show the underbelly of Americana much like Mr. Mendes has done spectacularly with American Beauty. At the end of the century these two films stand as landmarks in the evolution of the American.  What we pursue in name only piety commonness with our fellow man family fame fortune and peace of mind come crashing together in Magnolia in an apex of misfortune misunderstanding forgiveness and renewal.  These two films should scare the living daylights out of Americans especially those living in Los Angeles.  The stories show us that merely giving lip service to morals selfimprovement and camaraderie is not enough we can fake it for only so long before life overtakes us in a deluge of happenstance and retribution.  Mr. Anderson is a wonderful storyteller and Magnolia is the most visually and aurally satisfying film in years.  Ms. Mann's music and the ensemble acting are symphonic.  This movie is as tightly composed as any work in cinema one can remember.  Obviously I highly recommend it.".

The cast looked excellent and I enjoy films that are a bit peculiar often dealing with a wide range of characters and how chance and fate interlaces them. So I continued watching...Then it happened. I started losing interest. Boredom took over. Daydreaming kicked in. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. And it was only getting worse. After an hour and a half I started feeling pains in my back my arms were in agony from the frustration but I gritted my teeth. I always finish a film I start. I checked the running time and discovered there was over an hour left. I couldn't take any more that night.I came down the next morning determined to finish it. And I did. And it was still excruciating. The plot was weak the acting was average and it was far too long. I didn't care about anyone in it. I didn't feel informed by it I didn't enjoy it It didn't make me think about my life from a different aspect. What it did do was make me angry. I'd wasted time.

The manner in which their suffering is documented is unsubtle and often laughable. Several of Julianne Moore's scenes in particular are so unbelievably melodramatic that you wonder whether the critics were watching the same movie as you.  At one point the characters all in different locations and situations begin to sing along to a song from Aimee Mann's soundtrack. Intended to be a classic moment this is so hilariously stupid you have to laugh out loud at it.But you can't get too many laughs from Magnolia as it takes itself so terribly seriously.  The dying man's pointless tenminute monologue emphasises just how lamentably bloated the whole thing is.  Yes there are messages presented so blatantly they'd make Ollie Stone cringe 'loneliness is bad' or as the song goes 'one is the loneliest number' 'love your kids' 'everybody hurts' etc etc etc. Magnolia is no classic.

Maybe it was meant to be mind candy for people who love to dwell on the deep meanings of things...or maybe it really is as bad as I think it is.

	schema:reviewBody "The first encounter that I ever had with Paul Thomas Anderson was through Boogie Nights. I admit I first saw it because of I heard that it was about the porn industry. However I was surprised to discover an intimate look into the damaged lives of several very interesting welldeveloped characters. I also was delighted to have found a new and exciting director whose career and films I will be sure to follow. Anderson's cinematic flamboyance technical bravura and inspired storytelling ability make him a talent who is emblematic of the resurrgence in creative and dynamic filmmaking that has occured in this past year. Like FincherFight Club MendesAmerican Beauty JonzeBeing John Malkovich and the Wachowski BrothersThe Matrix Anderson has created a truly unique film that stretches the boundaries of cinema.Many who I saw the movie with grumbled repeatedly about it's length. Clocking in at about three hours and ten minutes Magnolia is long. Even if you are as strong an advocate of the film as I am you will think that it is long. I really had to go to the bathroom the whole time. But I did not want to miss a single second of Mr. Anderson's fascinating opus. The prologue is very well done doing a good job of drawing in the viewer. It makes an interesting commentary on coincidence wjich segues nicely into the rest of the film. The first half hour of the film is the most wonderfully done I have ever seen. Just as Anderson does in Boogie Nights the prodigy weaves a fastpaced web of intrigue flashing tidbits of the many characters' lives that leave the viewer thirsty for more. The rhythm of the film slows down for the bulk of it as we learn more and more and become more intimately involved in the lives of the wonderfully flawed characters. The film seems to build and build into something bigger than itself. In a way that is the main flaw of it but also the beauty of it. Anderson's ambitiousness is huge but I wouldn't call him an overreacher.This film is so full of great performances. It is probably the best ensemble piece that I have witnessed. There has been much Oscar buzz on Tom Cruise's behalf but I honestly believe that there are so many Oscar worthy performances in this film that it is a futile effort to mention them all.Particularly strong in the movie is the editing which allows for the interconnected stories of the various characters to be placed parallel to each other very smoothly. The cinematography is wonderful obviously influenced by Scorcese. I really don't believe that this film could have been as good as it was if it were any shorter. Seeing it is truly an experience. I was almost sad to see it end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Boogie Nights before Magnolia so I was obviously excited about this film. Three hours later I found that my excitement had turned to boredom.This film's major flaw is the characters. None of them are 3dimensional and we really have no reason to care for any of them. They simply exist to go through random occurrences for the sake of randomness. None of them are given anything exciting to do and none of them are nearly as developed as they should be. In fact some of the characters don't even serve a purpose in the film at all! Julianne Moore's character is the prime suspect of that crime. She's addicted to drugs cries over her dying husband and tries to kill herself. And somehow we're supposed to feel sorry for her. Guess what? Doesn't work. We are given no REASON to feel sorry for her. We are never given any reason to feel sorry for ANOBODY in this movie. They are simply there. They do things and that is it. Seriously why the hell am I supposed to give a damn if some knowitall brat pisses his pants?The beginning of this film showed promise. In an overlong opening sequence three urban legends are examined for their mysterious coincidences. But sadly there is nothing even remotely as bizarre or exciting in the actual movie. People meet other people and that's the extent of it. Speaking of people let's take a look at some of the charactersThere's some kid who pisses his pants a dying old man and his overly emotional male nurse the old man's wife who does nothing a cop the most interesting character mostly because of John C. Reilly a drug addict not the old man's wife a different drug addict the guy played poorly by Tom Cruise unsure of his official title a gay man who wants to get braces to impress a bartender what?! and many more.Instead of actually having any reason to care about these character's unhappy lives we are TOLD to care. Doesn't work. Cinematically speaking this film is actually welldirected edited the cinematography is great but the music is overused. The film could also be shortened by about a half hour by simply not following around unimportant character from place to place before they vanish and are never to be seen or heard from again. What a total waste.If you actually believe that this film is original at all just watch Short Cuts and you'll see the truth. Magnolia is a ripoff. A bad one where everyone has to cry every 5 minutes and sing together at the end before something totally outrageous happens for no reason at all and with no explanation.And speaking of Exodus 82 you will notice a lot of 8's and 2's in the film. Thing is it's too overt. It's pretentious because Anderson is showing people how clever he is instead of actually being clever and letting people see it on their own. I'll even give an example of this whole cleevrness with numbers deal with THE SHININGDanny wears a jersey with number 42 Danny and his mom watch the movie Summer of 42 Half of 42 is 21 There are 21 pictures on the Gold Room wall The July 4th Ball was in 1921 The mirror image of 21 is 12 mirrors play a key role in The Shining The two times shown via screen titles are 8 PM and 4 PM 8412 The radio call sign for the Overlook Hotel is KDK 12 Anderson has a lot to learn.".

Magnolia is definitely the best movie of 1999 and one of the best American movies ever made.Boogie Nights Paul Thomas Anderson's previous effort was already a promising effort but it was a bit too long. Magnolia is even longer but it's filled with such a spectrum of touching stories and such a quantity of wonderful characters that I didn't even notice the three hour length. Magnolia is a mosaic of intertwining and intercepting stories dealing with such issues as forgiveness hurt redemption sin and the role of chance in our lives. And though the film offers a deep emotional catharsis it never loses it delicate humane tone. The people Magnolia displays are not the best of men but none of them are beyond forgiveness. That to my opinion is the most important message the film conveys.As many have already said Magnolia is an ensemble piece. Acting is superb throughout the film and though Magnolia has approximately ten lead role and a bunch of supporting characters there isn't a single member of the cast who is misplaced. My personal favorites are Philip Seymour Hoffman as the sensitive nurse compare this role to the sleazy characters he played in Boogie Nights Happiness and The Talented Mr Ripley and you'll notice what a great actor he is Tom Cruise as the selfmade seduction guru his best performance ever and William H. Macy as the former child prodigy who never grew up his role resembles the one he did in Fargo but in Magnolia he is redeemed of his sins.No film is perfect and even Magnolia has it's flaws but I'm still so stunned by this masterpiece that I haven't even started to think what they could be.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great film. I'm a history major who took several courses in the history of the Middle East and Islam so nothing is going to be good or accurate or trivia filled enough for me but it certainly didn't contradict anything I'd learned for cinematic purposes or otherwise and that's more than I can say for any historical epic I've seen in several years.This film starts with Muhammed receiving the Koran from the angel Gabriel and ends at his death. It was filmed in accordance with Islamic political correctness so The Prophet himself is never depicted visually or vocally. While this is well affected it unfortunately removes him from a lot of the story. I would like to have known a lot more about his life from the film not his mannerisms or speech as depicted by a particular actor but at least the major events of his life his children his wives and so on.Having said that however the film is still a very good depiction of the birth of Islam. The plot focuses on the historical events rather than the Koran itself which contains almost no history from its own period and is therefore different from a lot of Biblical epics which present the historical events IN the Bible. It's accurate in that it tries to present the birth of Islam as most people today probably learn it. Definitely not a propaganda piece but it's not a movie filled with facts truth or fiction more a movie of character and tone. It's more similar to Braveheart than it is to Ben Hur or the Gospel of John. The movie presents a decent snapshot of the times and the attitudes and lifestyles under which Islam developed.The acting is fantastic the music is good won an academy award and the cinematography filmed in Morocco and Libya is beautiful. Costumes are cool and there's a few scenes with a set of ancient bagpipes for you Celtic history buffs.".

When I watch it today it still does! I don't believe anyone can watch this film and not become moved or even shaken by what heshe sees and hears! If the movie has one shortcoming it's that the main character prophet Mohammed peace be upon him is never actually seen or heard as it would have been a deadly sin to have an 'imposter' playing Him in the movie. Although this takes some getting used to and creates some lengths i.e. dialogs which are rather more monologues with pauses the rest of the movie compensates in full! Watching this movie will probably not make you go out to become a muslim although I have read that most of the castcrew involved did so but certainly put some thought and understanding into you.

His death is a great loss to the Muslim world an i just pray that the Islam portrayed in the movie is revived once again.".

His death is a great loss to the Muslim world an i just pray that the Islam portrayed in the movie is revived once again.";

Coming in at not much short of three full hours it doesn't overstay its welcome or dwell unnecessarily. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer and a 44minute making of featurette. There is no language sexuality goes no further than a few costumes and the violence is neither strong nor gratuitous.

	schema:reviewBody "Cinematically it was pretty good. Clearly a lot of work went into the sets costumes  locations. While the acting was adequate I have to disagree with other reviews in that I did not think it was Anthony Quinn's greatest work. Maybe because I viewed it through the lens of Christianity or maybe it was the way the actors talked to the camera when addressing Mohammed i.e. it is against Islam to show the likeness of Mohammed  sort of a parallel to Jews never wring the word God  they spell it Gd the movie had an odd vibe about it. The story itself is difficult to follow much like the Koran itself. Though downplayed in the movie early messages from God conflicted with later messages. It also plays up the 'peaceful' side of Islam but there again the movie has some fantastic battle scenes if you overlook the overly fake looking blood which stands in stark contrast to the evidence we see on the nightly news. Ideally every Muslim would embrace the teachings of this movie and renounce the more radical teachings  not just the modern day terrorist mindset but the way the early Muslims treated women in the early years seems to be quite different than today. I can't think of a Christian equivalent of this movie as most movies about early Christianity only tell a small portion of the story. This movie attempts to explain the roots of Islam from when Mohammed began hearing from God at age 40 in about 610 AD to the full establishment of Islam around the world. It does to a reasonably good job for the early parts of Islam but I kind of got lost in all the who's fighting who scenes. It was apparently all historically verified at the time of its making by Islamic scholarswhich is explained at the beginning and end of the movie which only adds to the eerie feeling the movie being less documentary and more propagandist. So in short the cinematic presentation is quite good but the story is hard to follow and I felt it had a propagandist vibe throughout the movie. If you have 3 hours to kill and are interested in the subject matter you'll likely enjoy it. For me I got restless in the middle when I started to get confused about who is battling who and for what reason.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I am writing this review this film has an IMDb rating of 8.4 which is fairly impressive. However don't let the rave reviews fool you as they fooled me.I think one main reason why this film gets as many kudos as it does is the fact that it's makers took a HUGE risk  they made a movie about the life of the Prophet Mohammed who is generally not depicted in mainstream Islam. Well really this movie did not really change that last point. Mohammed himself is not seen or heard in the film to prevent offending Muslim sensibilities. The idea is that depicting Mohammed will lead to idolatry which of course is supposed to be evil. Instead it is told from the perspective of his uncle Hamza. Also in keeping with Islamic custom none of Mohammed's close companions such as Abu Bakr or immediate family members such as his wives or his daughter Fatima are depicted. In fact these people are either not mentioned in the movie or barely mentioned at all. The absence of Mohammed and company makes this film quite difficult to swallow. Imagine making a movie about Jesus... without Jesus himself. Furthermore there are no disciples no Virgin Mary or Joseph and no Mary Magdalene. Would it be a very effective film? I highly doubt it. Furthermore not depicting the Prophet only makes him seem more divine and actually promotes idolatry! Mohammed's invisible ghostly presence complete with spooky music whenever he enters the scene only makes him seem more godlike. Compare The Message to Ben Hur for instance. In Ben Hur Jesus' face is observed and his voice is not heard as far as I remember. However this is done to make Jesus look MORE not less divine. The Message is very proMuslim which itself is not a bad thing. After all couldn't most Jesus films be described as proChristian? However the script presents the merits of the Islamic faith in such a cheesy clumsy way that it's hard to take seriously. The screen writers of this film probably used every clichd catchphrase about how wonderful Islam is that they could find in a Muslim propaganda pamphlet. It's also Ironic that this movie places so much emphasis on how Islam promotes women's rights considering that it completely ignores Mohammed's close female relatives. Actually depicting and narrating the stories of strong female characters like Aisha Khadijah and Fatima would do more justice to Muslim women than repeating clichd phrases about how Mohammed ended female infanticide! or whatnot. The acting is decent at least by Quinn and the cinematography is quite good. However the script just makes the whole film and even early Islamic history itself seem silly. Both Muslims and NonMuslims alike deserve better. My advice would be to wait until some brave film maker actually has the guts to make a Mohammed movie with the full cast of characters. Watch this film if you are genuinely interested in Islam or Islamic history and want to see a brave if not very successful take on the prophet's life. DO NOT watch this film as an introduction to Islam  buy a book. If you want a great epic film that takes place in the Middle East see Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur instead.".

	onyx:emotionText "As I am writing this review this film has an IMDb rating of 8.4 which is fairly impressive. However don't let the rave reviews fool you as they fooled me.I think one main reason why this film gets as many kudos as it does is the fact that it's makers took a HUGE risk  they made a movie about the life of the Prophet Mohammed who is generally not depicted in mainstream Islam. Well really this movie did not really change that last point. Mohammed himself is not seen or heard in the film to prevent offending Muslim sensibilities. The idea is that depicting Mohammed will lead to idolatry which of course is supposed to be evil. Instead it is told from the perspective of his uncle Hamza. Also in keeping with Islamic custom none of Mohammed's close companions such as Abu Bakr or immediate family members such as his wives or his daughter Fatima are depicted. In fact these people are either not mentioned in the movie or barely mentioned at all. The absence of Mohammed and company makes this film quite difficult to swallow. Imagine making a movie about Jesus... without Jesus himself. Furthermore there are no disciples no Virgin Mary or Joseph and no Mary Magdalene. Would it be a very effective film? I highly doubt it.

	schema:headline " The quintessential Ernest film";
	schema:reviewBody "Ernest Goes to Camp the quintessential Ernest film introduces the mass population to the dim innocuous Ernest P. Worrell Jim Varney.  Many of us had seen the Ernest  Vern commercials prior to the film's release but the movie gave all of us a special glimpse into the life of this simple country boy.In this particular film Ernest is the lone handyman at Kamp Kikakee a summer camp for young boys whose premise is based on ancient Native American principles and traditions.  Ernest enjoys his job and simple life very much but he longs to be promoted to the position of camp counselor so he can shape and mold young minds into a focused world view.  Ernest may just get his chance...The state governor has ordered the camp to take part in his Second Chance program which will allow a group of juvenile deliquents from the State Institute for Boys to take part in the camp's activities and hopefully clean up their acts.The evil militaryminded Counselor Stennis  who is almost reminiscent of Douglas Niedermeyer from Animal House  takes a crack at knocking the secondchancers into place but strikes out when they stage a coup and break his ankle.  Head CounselorManger Tipton is in a bind.  He knows none of his counselors will want to take charge of the deliquent boys now so he enlists naive Ernest to do the job.Ernest takes his new duties and the boys very seriously but the boys could care less about him until the camp nurse sets them straight i.e. Ernest is the only person in the world who even wanted to know you. Meanwhile a strip mining company on the upper part of the river has been trying to talk Chief St. Cloud owner of the campgrounds into turning the land over to them so they can mine the land for petrocite.  The Chief who speaks no english turns the mining company down twice through his granddaughter the camp nurse.  Lo and behold Sherman Krader the mining company CEO cons Ernest  the only other person at the camp who can speak the Chief's native Indian language  into getting the Chief to sign the release papers.The camp is going to close.  The secondchancers will be sent back to the state institution.  This looks like a job for ERNEST!  He and the deliquents devise a plan to scare away the strip mining company which involves blowing up all of their equipment.  The plan doesn't really work because Sherman Krader arrives on the scene with a fullyloaded rifle to shoot ringleader Ernest and...let's face it...in the real world Ernest and the kids would have been sued because of their thoughtless plan.  Luckily though the camp nurse went behind them all and got the judge to issue a restraining order against the mining company.  Later Krader's attorney admits that they bamboozled the Chief so the camp is saved the secondchancers get to stay at the camp yearround and Ernest becomes a fullfledged counselor although he still performs his handyman duties.A string of inferior Ernest films were released up until Jim Varney's death a few years ago he was 51.  Ernest Goes to Camp is the only one worth seeing unless you have children who might enjoy the films. I was nine yearsold when I saw this flick in the theater and I still enjoy it!  Saw it on DVD for the first time today!".

They're mostly uneven but entertaining in a guilty pleasure sort of way and Ernest is the sort of the character one can relate to easily. The sort of character that is a wellintended serial bungler with a strong heart but always finding himself messing up. 'Ernest Goes to Camp' was the film that started it all off and while not one of the series' best to me it really wasn't bad.'Ernest Goes to Camp' is an uneven film sure. It is thin in story which makes the tackedon and ridiculously overthetop evil businessmancompany subplot and ending even more muddled and out of place. Low budget does show in some of the slapdash camera work.Not all the humour and sentimentality work though mostly do. Some of the slapstick is very childish even for an Ernest film and some of the sentimentality is cloying and cornball. Other than Jim Varney and the appealing children the rest of the cast are not all that memorable.Varney however is immensely likable and great fun as Ernest thought he had a lot of charm and to be honest in the 'Ernest' films in general the mugging that he has been criticised for is to me not that apparent. The camp setting is nicely nostalgic for anybody with fond memories of camping will it will be like a trip down memory line and the music is an energetic delight.It was said earlier that not all the humour and sentimentality worked. Most does from personal opinion that is. Most of the time it was a range of being quite amused to being in hysterics in the laughter factor and there are some sweet and touching moments. Also appreciated some of the messagingvalues done without preaching.Overall not a bad start for Ernest even if it's not one of his best. 610 Bethany Cox".

Back in those days movies weren't always readily available. Sadly I wasn't as impressed back then with this outing when I already was in love with the improved sequels.In today's times I'm still on the fence. I did have fun and did laugh a lot with this romp of a camp counselor wannabe but it wasn't as good as I remember his followups to be.What is nice about the character Ernest from the dearly departed Jim Varney was how big his heart was and how well he could connect with children even as an adult. Literally despite the slapstickness of his act he was a genius in his connection with the youth. At the time I was part of that and I will never forget him or his Ernest. Ever.Poor dysfunctional Ernest. He yearns to evolve from a maintenancejanitor at a summer camp to fullfledged Camp Counselor. The kids don't really respect him the staff pities him and yet his pure heart strives on.When the opportunity arises he's assigned troubled kids and does all he can to lift their spirits whilerunning into objects getting bit providing poor advice and eating goo not fit for man. But when the going gets tough he leads the rascals against the big bad man who wants to harvest the camp's land for profit.In all honesty it may not be the best message to send to kids in the climax but it's just for fun. And it is a lot of fun. Even some unintentional sexually explicit statements are made but maybe I twisted those from my warped mind.I digress. I think this is great for young kids and adults who remember him from their childhood. And let me tell you It's refreshing to see a wooded camp movie without a killer on the loose!".

Claire's time in her new 'home' is racked with appearances of the dead little girl and her muddy perpetrator and she finally seeks the help of a Paranormal expert Hunt Forest Whitaker who helps her solve the etiology of Claire's nightmares and provides an exit for the ghosts.Most of the film is dark with poor Claire just wandering around the creepy house with her openmouthedwideeyed frightened look avoiding the flying detritus caused by the angry spirits that haunt her. Gabrielle Anwar is beautiful to look at but is not really called upon to act. Likewise Forest Whitaker is paralyzed by an inept script that even this fine actor can't overcome. The music is the canned synthesizer variety and the camera work is jerky and gets in the way of the story.

This device seemed to be the only means of creating any scares.While this film was very professionally made it was very wellworn and tedious with a series of flashbacks and revelations about something terrible which happened in the protagonist's past. The set in particular was not good and most of the flashbacks centered around a stained glass window in a door which was entirely modern and looked like it could be bought in any home improvements store.The ultimate villainghost that is finally revealed to have triggered the events is actually just a rather misguided and pathetic character so when they came over all demonic at the end it rang really hollow for me.The events themselves which triggered the haunting were once again rather unimportant yet predictable and wholly unoriginal.A bythenumbers money spinner in my opinion".

This device seemed to be the only means of creating any scares.While this film was very professionally made it was very wellworn and tedious with a series of flashbacks and revelations about something terrible which happened in the protagonist's past. The set in particular was not good and most of the flashbacks centered around a stained glass window in a door which was entirely modern and looked like it could be bought in any home improvements store.The ultimate villainghost that is finally revealed to have triggered the events is actually just a rather misguided and pathetic character so when they came over all demonic at the end it rang really hollow for me.The events themselves which triggered the haunting were once again rather unimportant yet predictable and wholly unoriginal.A bythenumbers money spinner in my opinion";

Forest Whitaker preKing of Scotland provides a shot of star value and basically holds the movie together. The special effects are good and the best thing about The Marsh is that's so pretty! The house is pretty the female lead is pretty hell even the ghost is pretty! Its like a Normal Rockwell painting that's been messed with.

A lady children's book author is plagued with nightmares of a little girl disappearing in a swamp and images of an old house. When viewing a television story she notices the house in her nightmare and the surrounding area specifically a marsh where she keeps seeing and following this little girl. She tracks down the property and moves into the house in a small remote area close to a little town. After installing a door she finds in the cellar strange things begin to happen and what were her nightmares are now becoming too real. Yes the house and the marsh hold deep secrets in the town and the house and she enlists the help of a local paranormal consultant played very well by Forest Whitaker. He moves into her house with his equipment and quickly realizes the supernatural is at work. This movie succeeds on every level with excellent performances and a very tight story that keeps you guessing until the final reveal. Are her nightmares really lost memories of a past she has forgotten and if she is the little girl ghost then how is that possible? All the questions are answered and I had a real ball with this one. Highly recommended.".

Its one of those movies that relies on scary sound effects to overcompensate for the fact that little is happening in the scenes. Gabrielle anwar and Forrest whitecker are good actors who are wasted in this boring and lifeless film. There are a few good special effects sequences but even those scenes lack creepiness. The movie tries to build up suspense but doesn't really give us anything to be afraid of. quite frankly it just lacks good scary content. Its production values are very good but that just makes me angrier that the film isn't better. I saw other films at the festival particularly Fingerprints and Last Rites of the Dead that were made for much less money and yet were a thousand times better.".

So it was refreshing when Whittaker's character moved the plot along as quickly as it did.The opening scene was marvelous and the scene with her therapist could have been great with some smoother editing but the flashlight in the dark videography is worthless. The death scenes are waaay cheesy. In the end I'd say the director pulled it off but it was touch and go there for a while.All in all this was a bad B movie but with just enough sunk into the production to make it halfway decent.".

I adored Forests interpretation of the character Hunt that he portrayed quirky and matter of fact a nice touch. Gabriels search was well thought out. What would another have done under those circumstances a life filled with memories and dreams and then to face and even embrace those fears in the search for the truth and to save that little girl. The changing room and the tormented boy. What happens to people who hide the truth. They become trapped in their own lies by being tied to a small town or drowning in drink. So I think this movie is more than a 5 minute scare and more a discussion over dinner about what would happen if you where any of the characters. Fine food fodder. My score kept changing because I thought I had sussed it out and I am glad I didn't gave me much more to think about. I for one am also happy that Ghost stories are making a comeback and I would much sooner jump in my chair a few times than cringe or hide my eyes or be disgusted by the graphic slasher films also doing the rounds.

It says much that my memory of the film is already fading at a rapid pace a mere 24 hours after I watched it. Gabrielle Anwar THE TUDORS fails to bring life to a rather stiff and uninteresting lead character and seems to be trying to get her American accent right rather than delivering a decent performance. Forest Whitaker PHONE BOOTH appears slightly befuddled and is probably wondering what he's doing caught up in this nonsense.Because this is nonsense I'll make no bones about it. Every haunted house clich in the book is played out from the restless ghost of a kid a little blonde girl of course to the vengeful spirit with the scary eyes. The jump scenes are predictable as is the rest of the plot and the effects are poor taking you out of the movie every time they pop up. A dismal effort this.".

There are so many horror movies over the past hundred years that it is unlikely that many are going to come up with a startling new special effect or twist which is going to take the experienced movie goer out of their seat.Rating a movie like this as a 23 reflects unrealistic expectations in my opinion. It is far from schlock. I also appreciated that there was not a reliance throughout the movie on gratuitous sex language or graphic violence. In fact there was no dumpster diving at all  kudos to the director and all involved. I freely admit to lusting in my heart heh during some of the shots of Claire but at least I wasn't forced to endure a cheap scene waggling in my face to sell the prurient interest tickets.The upside was the cinematography atmosphere decent acting by Anwar and Whitaker a fair score Anwar's clothed attractiveness and the somewhat spooky but overplayed power of the devouring misty marsh.The downside was that it retreated into prosaic and formulaic devices by the end of the movie resulting in a desire to fast forward it to completion. There was also a major overreliance on musical cues followed by a noise to try to deliver a jolt. Most of the time it didn't work and by the end the gotcha moments were reduced to annoyances as you learned not to trust the sound track. It was also somewhat disappointing that there was not more chemistry between the leads and the rest of the cast ranged from fair to awful.

	schema:reviewBody "TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN RKO Radio 1946 directed by Kurt Neumann brings forth Tarzan the jungle lord in another Saturday afternoon matine adventure story.The story opens with Tarzan Johnny Weissmuller Jane Brenda Joyce and Boy Johnny Sheffield along with Cheetah strolling through the village doing some afternoon shopping. Tarzan is seen having fun by wrestling with a strong man named Tall Bull the Terrible Tor Johnson while Cheetah watches a snake charmer and nearly getting bitten by one of the snakes. Then comes a wounded man riding on an elephant who soon succumbs from wound scars acquired by a leopard. Tarzan examines the dead man and tells the authorities that the man's death was not caused by a leopard but by people dressed in leopard skins and iron claws. Aside from solving the mystery Tarzan and his family find themselves in danger after taking in Kimba a native boy Tommy Cook who not only happens to be the brother of the evil high priestess Acquanetta of the leopard tribe but trouble to all those around him.The supporting cast includes Edgar Barrier as Lazar Dennis Hoey as The Commissioner Anthony Caruso as Mongo and Doris Lloyd as the Superintendress. Acquanetta best known for her role as Paula the Ape Woman in Universal's CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN 1943 and JUNGLE WOMAN 1944 makes a fine tribe leader this time around.With the Tarzan movies being distributed in theaters on an annual basis the writers attempt to come up with new and fresh ideas surrounding the old familiar characters headed by Weissmuller. Brenda Joyce returns as Jane for the second time while the teenage Johnny Sheffield outgrowing his part appears to be a bit too old now to be called Boy. One scene in the shopping village finds young native girls giving Boy the eye but Boy becomes bashful and passes up on them. The native tribes from the MGM movie days seem to have moved to another part of town thus being substituted by a jungle shopping mall. Another noticeable change finds Tarzan acquiring neighbors with each passing film this time a Leopard tribe who don't seem to be the sorts to be calling on Tarzan and Jane at their treehouse for a cup of sugar this time around. For the first time since TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE MGM 1941 Boy is able to bond with another lad close to his own age but with friends like Kimba who needs enemies? One highlight finds Boy in a fight to the finish with Kimba attempting to endanger Jane with a knife with Boy subduing Kimba having his hands tied behind his back and placing the little demon in a cage like a wild animal. As for Tarzan he's captured by the leopard tribe and held captive by the priestess.Not bad entry in the long running series but by this time the yarns are becoming routine and still quite watchable by fans of the series. Aside from commercial television revivals during the 1960s to 1980s this and the other Tarzan adventures did enjoy frequent reruns on American Movie Classics 19972000 before moving to Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere June 11 2011. TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN has been distributed to video cassette but did become part of the TarzanRKO package on DVD around 2009. Next in line TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS 1947. 12".

Since it's 1946 you naturally are not presented with anything graphic but with nearly all this cast wearing very little the possibilities are all there for a wild sexual fantasy. Johnny Weismueller has long outgrown his days as a lean jungle machine. Here he's big buff and has obviously worked out. We see his pectorals his concave stomach powerful shoulders and thighs. His loincloth is almost a bikini. The glorious Acquanetta looks fabulous in her clinging gowns and robes as Lea the high priestess of the leopard man cult. For once all the male extras in their brief sarongs are handsome and buff and they really show their stuff when they perform their leopard dance. Just as sexy is Anthony Caruso who shows off his muscular torso as Lea's accomplice. Johnny Sheffield is now a handsome teenage boy and he would soon be making his own jungle series as Bomba the Jungle Boy. As has been cited by other reviewers the most erotic scene is when Tarzan is captured and bound to a post in the temple of the leopard cult. HIs handsome body is covered with welts and his chest is thrust out with his hands bound behind him. Lea approaches him slowly holding her leopard club with claws. The scene is played nearly silently. Tarzan's chest is heaving up and down in anticipation and then there's an interruption. The nearly naked Tarzan helpless must have aroused many a fantasy in 1946 and by millions of TV viewers later when it played on TV. The movie is beautifully photographed and cast. This is one Tarzan movie I play regularly. Rarely did Tarzan have so many attractive cast members to play against.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan series continues at RKO with the fourth film tenth overall counting the MGM films. This one's pretty different from those that came before it. There's a different vibe to it particularly in the early scenes where Tarzan acts as a sort of jungle detective. He's asked by a commissioner of what I don't know to look into a series of leopard attacks on travelers. Tarzan doesn't believe leopards are the cause of the attacks and as you might have guessed by the title of this picture he's right. So it's Tarzan versus leopard skinwearing cultists led by Queen Lea Acquanetta.I'm used to seeing Acquanetta in Universal films from around this time. They tried to make her a star in their horror stable but it didn't really work out. She's very attractive but not the strongest actress. This is arguably the best acting job of her short career for what that's worth. Dennis Hoey is amusing as the commissioner. He's best known for playing Inspector Lastrade in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series. Tommy Cook is very creepy as Kimba the Leopard Boy. What a little psycho. Brenda Joyce appears as Jane for the second time and does a fine job although she's nowhere near the presence Maureen O'Sullivan was in the role. Johnny Weissmuller and Johnny Sheffield are both good as usual. Weissmuller's first scene has him wrestling hirsute Tongolo the Terrible whose voice I strongly suspect was dubbed. Speaking of voices Johnny Sheffield's voice continues to change. Puberty's rough on us all Boy. Cheeta is still lots of fun which I'm sure surprises no one.It's one of the better Tarzan RKO films. Personally I like them all but you have some fans who think of the RKO films as nothing but kiddie stuff. Then you have the people who don't like any Tarzan movies RKO or otherwise. I try my best to avoid people like that. If you can't enjoy the adventures of Tarzan and his family you're probably not much fun to be around.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan series continues at RKO with the fourth film tenth overall counting the MGM films. This one's pretty different from those that came before it. There's a different vibe to it particularly in the early scenes where Tarzan acts as a sort of jungle detective. He's asked by a commissioner of what I don't know to look into a series of leopard attacks on travelers. Tarzan doesn't believe leopards are the cause of the attacks and as you might have guessed by the title of this picture he's right. So it's Tarzan versus leopard skinwearing cultists led by Queen Lea Acquanetta.I'm used to seeing Acquanetta in Universal films from around this time. They tried to make her a star in their horror stable but it didn't really work out. She's very attractive but not the strongest actress. This is arguably the best acting job of her short career for what that's worth. Dennis Hoey is amusing as the commissioner. He's best known for playing Inspector Lastrade in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series. Tommy Cook is very creepy as Kimba the Leopard Boy. What a little psycho. Brenda Joyce appears as Jane for the second time and does a fine job although she's nowhere near the presence Maureen O'Sullivan was in the role. Johnny Weissmuller and Johnny Sheffield are both good as usual. Weissmuller's first scene has him wrestling hirsute Tongolo the Terrible whose voice I strongly suspect was dubbed. Speaking of voices Johnny Sheffield's voice continues to change. Puberty's rough on us all Boy. Cheeta is still lots of fun which I'm sure surprises no one.It's one of the better Tarzan RKO films. Personally I like them all but you have some fans who think of the RKO films as nothing but kiddie stuff. Then you have the people who don't like any Tarzan movies RKO or otherwise. I try my best to avoid people like that. If you can't enjoy the adventures of Tarzan and his family you're probably not much fun to be around.";

Beautiful and leggy Brenda Joyce as Jane appears very comely in her micro miniskirt. Cheeta the chimp is an excellent musician. Appearing as the titular Leopard Woman is curvy Acquanetta as Lea. However the main guest star is Leopard Boy Tommy Cook as Kimba who makes the most of the film's bestscripted role.

	schema:reviewBody "Johnny Weissmuller made a name for himself as Tarzan at MetroGoldwynMayer Studio. However and I am not sure why Weissmuller and 'Boy' Johnny Sheffield jumped from this prestige studio to the less than stellar RKOwhere the budgets shrank considerably as did the quality. The scripts got a lot more weird and the films became chock full of poorly integrated stock footage and animals that often weren't even African. Additionally 'Jane' Maureen O'Sullivan remained at MGM and a new leading lady needed to be found. After having the character be 'off on vacation in England' or 'helping with the war effort' in a couple films RKO decided to recast this character with Brenda Joycewho bore little similarity to O'Sullivan.This film about a silly cult of the Leopard. Its followers don't want civilization to encroach on their part of the jungle and so they kill people in caravans who cross nearby. But to hide that people are responsible they make it look like leopards did this. Now here is the funny partthese guys dress up like these big catscomplete with metal claws and silly leopard costumes. It's even sillier when they dance about back at their lairas if it was choreographed by a monkey! Early on Tarzan tells everyone that it is NOT leopards that have been doing the killing. Despite this King of the Jungle ALWAYS being right in the past he is quickly ignored and the idiots in charge just go out and shoot a lot of poor old leopards. Eventually this leads to more attacksincluding one where four hot school teachers are kidnapped. When they kidnap Tarzan who's to save him?! Tune in and see the surprising answer hint it is neither Jane nor Boy.This is fun to watch Cheeta is in rare form but ultimately a pretty dumb outing for the series. While not nearly as lame as Tarzan and the Mermaid by far the worst of the Weissmuller films for RKO its plot is so silly that it can never be taken very seriously. Worth seeing for fans of the series but if you are a novice to them DON'T start with this oneyou'll assume the others are all equally sillywhich they aren't.By the way in the summary I say that this film signals that the series had 'jumped the shark'. In other words it arrives AFTER the series has gone into serious decline and the writers are trying desperately to find some way to convince viewers to watch such as the Leopard angle. Likewise by this film RKO completely gave up on having extras that looked African in any way. There are no black extras and the leopard cult look as if they are from Central America. In fact in the final film of this series just a couple years later the movie was filmed in Mexicowith lots of Mexicans and even Aztec sets!!".

The action is really good but some of the plotting and a few of the performances are a bit odd. The male villain is more Nazi than jungle man. Tommy Cook who played Kimba the young Leopard boy is rather bad and its amazing to think that he's an actor who's career has spanned six decades. I also found the pace a bit slow which made the film seem longer than its 72 minutes. I suspect that its due to some sequences with Kimba that just seem to go on and on.I like the film but considering that that previous three RKO Tarzans were some of the best in the series so far it's kind of a disappointment.I feel I should mention that the ending is rather violent with large number of people dying. I know in the MGM films a couple of the films also had high death rates among the natives but that was a battle and this is kind of... I don't know cruel. Its nothing we haven't seen before but at the same time it just seems nasty.Reservations aside worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman 1946  out of 4 The tenth film in Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan series is without question the dumbest so far as I'm sure a 5yearold could have came up with a better plot. This time out people are being killed by what appears to be leopards but Tarzan isn't so sure. It turns out that a woman Acquanetta has grown tired of the changes going on in Africa so she's brought together hundreds of people who are dressing as leopards and attacking people. Yeah once you stop laughing over this plot you're going to realize that there's really not too much going on in this film. At 72minutes the film seems to drag on longer than ROOTS and for the life of me I can't wrap my brain around what the producers were thinking. The only possible explanation is that there wasn't any money left at RKO to hire someone to come up with a good story so they took the silliest thing they could come up with. The biggest problem is that the story is just so farfetched that it's impossible to ever feel threatened by the killers. Their costumes are all rather silly and seeing dozens of men running around the jungle in these outfits just made one want to laugh. There's never any real drama no suspenseful scenes and even the comedy bits with Cheetah are just downright weak and they never get a single laugh. Weissmuller for the first time in the series appears to be very bored as he doesn't give the character a bit of life and usually you can just see the joy coming out of the actor but that's not the case here. Brenda Joyce is back as Jane and offers up a decent performance but the screenplay doesn't offer her much. Johnny Sheffield is back as Boy and the most shocking thing is seeing how much he has grown since the previous movie which was shot less than a year before this one. Acquanetta best remember for playing Paula the Ape Woman in Universal's CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN isn't given much of a role here but she at least looks good in her outfits. Tommy Cook plays a pretty important role as Kimba a child spy but his character is so annoying that you really can't help but hate him and want to see Boy bash him into the ground. You can tell that RKO had pretty much given this thing as little attention as possible as the sets aren't nearly as good the story poor and there's simply not an ounce of energy to be found anywhere in the picture. TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN is a pretty bland movie from start to finish and what's even worse is how boring it is even in the Saturdaymatine feel.".

	schema:headline " The Leopard Cult A Secret From Tarzan? I doubt it.";
	schema:reviewBody "People in America were kept in ignorance about Africa due to films like Tarzan And The Leopard Women. Even taken at face value the film shows the decline in the series since it left MGM.When Acquanetta says how her leopard god cult has kept secret from Tarzan all these years no one in any theater this was showing could possibly believe that. After all this was Tarzan and in his jungle you don't belch or toot without him knowing about it. How a whole tribe of leopard cultists kept secret from Tarzan until Edgar Barrier came back from civilization as he sneers it no one could buy into that.Barrier's character is borrowed liberally from that other RKO classic Gunga Din. He's the guru of the tribe and he does not want to see the civilization of the whites spread. Especially when its in the form of some shapely maiden school teachers. He's going to have his leopard guys hijack the caravan and steal the teachers. It falls to Tarzan to rescue them. By the way note how Barrier sneers also at the decadence of democracies which the British were as represented by Commissioner Dennis Hoey. A lot of that talk was coming from some recently defeated enemies of said British and their allies. Made Barrier an easy guy to hate.Acquanetta has a young brother played by Tommy Cook and he's looking to become a full blooded warrior. Only he gets a little thing for Brenda Joyce as Jane. For the only time in the series history Johnny Sheffield as Boy gets an adversary his equal. He needs a little help from Cheta in taking him out.In fact in this most silly of Tarzan films Cheta gets to save everybody from the Leopard people. If you care you have to see the film to see how everyone's favorite chimpanzee does it in one of the worst of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman Kurt Neumann 1946  This is a touch better than Amazons with plenty of action quite well done and a lively performance by Weissmuller who'd looked a bit out of sorts in the previous entry. The plot by now following a path through the jungle wilds so welltrodden it resembles a motorway sees the Ape Man battling a weird cult with silly leopard costumes that's really into robbery and human sacrifice. Considering the movies were aimed at kids their marketing is curiously sexualised with the poster art invariably flagging up the boobs of whichever minor character was most wellendowed. Here it's Acquanetta who gets shared billing. Her leopard bikini is at least a bit better thoughtout than those ridiculous capes the other cult members are wearing.I rather enjoyed the film particularly its adherence to near walltowall action but it provides quite a bit of unintentional hilarity. That comes partly from its incredibly low opinion of natives who are all duplicitous hateful savages and partly from the barelychoreographed dance the leopard men do around the fire. They look like drunk clubbers wearing their wives' coats. One interesting element of the film is halfnative Edgar Barrier a Westerneducated cultist who denounces the decadence of the imperialists and leads the fight against them. All the RKO series regulars return here Brenda Joyce is still somewhat onenote as Jane Boy is entering puberty giving him an allnew voice and face and Cheeta hogs the limelight once more. I'm going to be an old cynic and suggest that it's not really him playing that music on the trumpet though.".

It's entirely possible that the reviewer confused this picture with the previous Trinity outing They Call Me Trinity which does not compare to the sequel whatsoever. With Trinity is Still My Name they were firing on all four cylinders. This film is the quintessential parody of the spaghetti western with some of the dirtiest filthiest antheroes ever depicted. When this film was in its original theatrical run in the early 70's it created a huge stir...young and old came unglued equally over the many overthetop versions of the classic western scene. The slapstick gags were spot on and Terrence Hill moves from scene to scene with a rogueish charm that breathes life into the character of Trinity. Bud Spence's understated performance rounds out the cast and his lethargic deadpan delivery mixes well with Hill's enthusiasm. The two actors teamed in several films but this would be their best work.The film is highly visual and Trinity himself is an extremely humorous character with his use of many outlandish contraptions such as the loungechair saddle.The supporting cast also provide a good bit of the humor throughout. Characters such as the family with the windy baby and the one bad guy who loses his mind after receiving one of Bambino's massive head blows come to mind. Scene after scene parodies many of the classic western clichs from card games to gunfights all including the trademark Trinity twist.This film is definitely not academy award material whatsoever but if you're looking for good slapstick fun with plenty of tongueincheek humor you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quite honestly after seeing the first film in this series THEY CALL ME TRINITY I was a little underwhelmed perhaps sold out by my own high hopes. That pic was the breakthrough buddycomedywestern smash that made Hill and Spencer into superstars. I enjoyed it liked its meandering pace and whimsical attitude but was not blown away.Now after having seen the followup I get it. Everything that was kinda shaggy kinda looseygoosey about the first film has been finely groomed here and the difference is notable. The story plays out slowly but steadily with proper amounts of both slapstick and action not to mention some damn fine slapstick action.Spencer's Bambino is introduced first duping a group of crooks out of their freshly cooked beans in hysterical fashion. Not long after the thugs have regrouped from the incident along comes Hill's Trinity to do the same exact thing! These two gags set the tone for things The two protagonists are never cocky or cruel in getting their way rather they use their charm and occasionally Spencer's beefy fists if necessary.The boys head back home in time to hear their father's deathbed wish that they work together to find their way in the world rather than constantly bickering. Their resulting adventures lead them to aid repeatedly a lost farming family pose as federal agents and get involved in a monksversusgunrunners battle.The general spirit of the film is kind and genial and for this reason it reminded me of the films of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong heyday. Much attention is paid to intricate gags several involving food there are numerous wellstaged and complex fistfights even a running bit with a flatulent baby that would have seemed right at home in a JC flick.Terence Hill's Trinity is a happygolucky layabout that is too lazy to even ride his own horse he prefers to be dragged slowly behind on a makeshift cot. Trinity is handsome charming funny  a great character to be sure. Hill is capable of doing intense e.g. VIVA DJANGO so his embodiment of Trinity speaks as much to his acting chops as it does his personal charisma. As for big Bud Spencer as Bambino he is the sour to Trinity's sweet. Perennially grumpy the character owns an underlying air of geniality that seems at odds with his willingness to swing his fists around. You get the feeling Bambino begins each fight with a big resigned sigh as if he'd really rather be elsewhere. The two actors had appeared together in films several times before this series but it was the Trinity and Bambino personas that really clicked with audiences of the day.So if you are curious about the fuss over TRINITY I'd just as soon recommend that you skip right to TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME to get the full gist of Spencer and Hill at their best. 810 stars.".

The gags are still funny except for one or two that better in the original but after 33 years i wrote this in 2005!! they still works also better than in some Hollywood craps...the real problem is in the Italian DVD manifactured by Medusa owned by the Italian prime minister.... The first thing is there are a lot of missing scenes including one LeoneMorricone trumphet one that was in the original theatrical that was quite more than 1 minute long!!!! It was placed after the restaurant and before the one when they meet the bad guys boss that offers them money to keep eyes closed. Maybe was a scene too much political infact if my memory is not wrong was about the people's conditions in the village. The other missing scenes are placed with perfect video restoration and a mysterious bad audio in the Cut scenes section of the DVD. I cannot believe! This is a very bad thing. When the movie passes on TV the scenes are all at their places is more than 3 minutes of unnecessary cuts!. Why on DVD this bloodbath? So my rate is 9510 for the movie and 510 for the DVD. We want the original ones. Thanks".

The story is also good and so are the numerous fighting scenes throughout the film. This is one to enjoy.

As with films regarding historic events and films further back than a few decades Westerns are something that I just don't make it a point to watch unless there's something special about it someone talented at the helm or a major significance to that particular production. I watched this years ago and I must admit that I didn't pay that much attention on this most recent viewing. It's just not really my genre. Some of the situations action and dialog are admittedly good in some of these films though. Technically speaking this is good. Camera editing and sound are fine. The fights look convincing enough it does look as if the punches connectthough I wouldn't guess that they actually did. At one point in the film an unusual and unexpected group dish out some physical violence. One fight plays a lot like a football game. The humor includes some repeated gags and jokes and one running toilet humor joke. The dialog has its moments. I recommend this to fans of Westerns and comedies set in the Wild West. 710".

Now rather than say too much and risk spoiling this movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a fairly amusing sequel for the most part.

If it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies.

Levine and AvcoEmbassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in America as well. Too bad they didn't get very far since the HillSpencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the U.S. and this largely boring drawnout film doesn't help it out any.Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father Harry Carey Jr. that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. They later get involved with armstraffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents. It all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves. And the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well.The opening title music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a fair Bobby Goldsborolike early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good. Not sure if I'd want to buy the CD soundtrack of it but some others might.The film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long. It looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here. In fact I lost interest in it about 23rds of the way through. The DVD is also terrible with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky.A big step down from the previous film.4 out of 10".

Gary Cooper was really a fine actor not only a charming personality and huge star good at Drama Adventure Western Romance Comedy et al.Cooper portrays the idealistic Peter Ibbetson a young man so deeply attached to his childhood memories that he cannot feel fulfilled or happy in spite that he's supposed to have everything a man would wish to find happiness.Ann Harding on the other hand of whose performance regarding this film I've read that she wasn't ethereal enough to play this part Peter Ibbetson's childhood sweetheart Mary I must say that I found her well suited to it as always giving a sincere sensitive natural and restrained performance looking perfect in period clothes.Both lead performers transmit truth into their characterizations embodying the love that transcends all the obstacles or L'amour fou as French defined it giving endearing performances. Beautiful Cinematography by the great Charles Lang and great sets by Hans Dreier.John Halliday plays expertly the stern Duke of Towers Ida Lupino looks pretty and shows her great talent in a supporting role as a vulgar English woman Peter Ibbetson befriends in Paris and Douglass Drumbille is the menacing at first sight uncle of the Title character.Mention apart deserve lovely Virginia Weidler and Dickie Moore who portray the leading stars as children giving impressive terrific performances. Their scenes together have been among the most heartwrenching and sincere I've ever seen featuring a couple of child actors the 1949 film The Secret Garden featuring Dean Stockwell and Margaret O'Brien comes to my mind.If you liked such pictures as Smilin' Through The Ghost and Mrs. Muir I'll Never Forget You Berkeley Square Somewhere in Time or Portrait of Jennie you must see this one.The DVD transfer released by Universal as part of the Gary Cooper Collection is of very good quality.".

From Death Takes a Holiday 1934 to Here Comes Mr. Jordan 1941 we suffered along with sympathetic lovers whose path to true fulfillment was strewn with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. But in the endsomehowthe force of love overcame every problem to ultimately allow for what was meant to be.These stories are ageless and have appeared as recently as Somewhere In Time 1980 and Meet Joe Black 1998itself a reworking of Death Takes a Holiday. Peter Ibbetson may be one of the very best films to explore the force of destiny on young lovers linked from childhood to be together forever. The beauty of this film is in its design execution and performances.Henry Hathaway the director worked with Gary Cooper earlier in 1935 in the rousing action adventure Lives of a Bengal Lancer. Are there two more dissimilar films than these? It is a tribute to Hathaway's skill and artistry that he could make both stories work so well when they were completed almost at the same time.Cooper excelled in portraying sensitive characters Pride of the Yankees 1942 Sergeant York 1941 etc. and Peter Ibbetson was well within his range of projecting an introspective romantic hero whose great love must be found in the world of dreams. It is a fine deeply felt performance.Ann Harding not well known today as a romantic actress captures the complexity and subtlety of the story. Her ability to will the Cooper character into believing that their love must persist even if it exists only in their own imagination is both powerful and enduring.When contemporary critics take shots at the old Hollywood Studio System as nothing more than a glorified factory grinding out entertainment fodder for the masses they ought to take a look at this strange moving and truly unusual film. Its creators probably knew going in that it was not likely to be a box office hit given the nature of the subject matter. The fact that it was made at all and in such a sumptuous manner is an excellent tribute to the taste of the powers that be at Paramount.Seek out Peter Ibbetson You will be transported to a world that no longer existsand into a story that requires the viewer to be a real romantic with great imagination. It will reward you with a deeply touching tale where true love finally wins out under the most extraordinary of circumstances. What more need be said?".

Last Christmas I  missed it but I caught it this time round even though  again  it was put on at a very early time by the BBC. Basically it's a romance   but one which has a great deal of feeling to it. It's aesthetic appeal reminds me of Letter From An Unknown Woman. Yet when I viewed that one again recently it disappointed me. This one though had even more of an emotional impact like when I saw La Strada a few years ago. It isn't really surrealistic but it does have a power and is likely to linger in your memory. The ending is actually positive as well. It has a remarkable ability  to make you believe in it and to therebye become involved.".

Peter Ibbetson  never before released for home consumption not even on VHS and very rarely revived in arthouses since its 1935 flopped release  is now on DVD as part of Universal's new Gary Cooper Collection. On this fivemovie set Ibbetson is clearly the crown jewel though the others are certainly worth a look depending on your degree of interest I've already reviewed on these pages Lubitsch's Design for Living which should interest anybody interested in good movies. Peter Ibbetson is the very definition of the term cult classic its extreme rarity admits only a select club of intheknow members and its surrealist subjectmatter  sundered lovers who communicate to each other through their dreams  especially as realized by such American workmen as director Henry Hathaway and actor Gary Cooper makes this movie irresistible to the cinephile.It also appeals to other disparate types such as the chickflick connoisseur  for what can be more deliriously romantic than lovers who live in their own telekinetic dreamworld universe? It's the kind of movie where Cooper builds Ann Harding a glistening castle in the air made out of clouds and stardust only to see it crumble when he doesn't believe strongly enough in his own dream. For those who will find all of this rather silly or at least doubtful I can tell you that the unremitting sense of tragedy throughout the story's arc helps to keep things grounded and cleans out any extraneous gossamer. The entire movie depends upon the lovers' grievous separation from childhood onward to old age and Coop spends the majority of his adult life shackled in prison for a crime from which he should have been exonerated. Rather than commit suicide or allow himself to die after a savage beating from a jailer he decides to go on living so that he can spend every night with his girlfriend who is sharing the same dream with him. Romantic enough for you ladies? Of course the real points of the story are both the indomitable longevity of the libido and the endless resources contained within the human imagination  fertile grounds for Surrealism. Not surprisingly Luis Bunuel considered Peter Ibbetson to be one of the 10 greatest films ever made. The dreamy setdesign the gauzy photography by Charles Lang and the beautiful score by Ernst Toch contribute to the generally bizarre feeling that the movie evokes. It's a rare American film from any era that insists on dreams having at least as much if not more significance than socalled reality but such is the case here in this mainstream release from 1935. The movie failed with mainstream audiences then and probably wouldn't sit well with mainstream audiences today. Americans have always been practical people even during the Great Depression their need for escapism back then clearly didn't outweigh their reluctance to accept Coop as an English architect suffering the pangs of transcendent love that is stronger than the grave. Their loss. I suspect the same is true of audiences today who when they bother to watch old movies certainly do not want to see one in which Gary Cooper wanders through a Europeanstyle artmovie directed by an actionadventure journeyman like Henry Hathaway. Their loss. 10 stars out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Serious Memorable and Deserving";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1933 Gary Cooper film is highly regarded and mentioned in many film books. It was a serious film in tone and content and also in it's techniques. Initially it seems a rather bland melodrama about two childhood sweethearts who are parted then reunited. The blandness is somewhat heightened by the visual blandness of Ann Harding the female star. She is blonde but very visually monochromatic minimal eyebrows or eye makeup which makes her seem very very plain even though she is pretty. This was the taste of the times for a serious good woman and the reason I have this listed as an 8 is that it is definitely dated and will be much too slow for many viewers.The story is about dreams and architecture so keep an eye on the buildings there are really inventive and beautiful buildings. The stable that is supposed to be horrible is like a forest cottage in a fairy tale. The child casting at the beginning is funny by today's standards of continuity. These actually are pretty good child actors for the time  not cloying or overly precious  but the boy's coloring is quite dissimilar to the adult. Big brown eyes of the boy becoming the famous baby blues of Cooper. But let these things go and the early scenes are an effective and emotionally effective set up for the payoff.The best part of the film comes in the last third. Suddenly we are in an expressive fantasy  completely grounded in the earlier part but also completely different. Not only are the effects here still magical reminiscent of Durer etchings but they are also really overwhelming when we think about how difficult it was to achieve these effects in this time period. Any thing that fades in or out  this had to be done by refilming with the same piece of film etc. While never named it is clearly colored by the astral body theories of the Eastern religions that were popular in Hollywood at the time having a strong influence on art architecture and design during this period.Ultimately this is a beautiful and memorable film about the strength of love dreams and the triumph of pure heart. This makes for a very quiet but powerful film. Quiet and powerful became the hallmark of Cooper's screen character. The strength of this film is its simplicity of message and the really memorable and soulful performance of Cooper.".

A few films in Hollywood history have asked this profound question the most famous of which is 1980's Somewhere in Time in which lovers Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour played time travel with each other in order to be together. In Peter Ibettson Gary Cooper and Ann Harding are childhood sweethearts who are somehow able to have similar dreams that ultimately are the method in which they are able to be together when circumstances tear them apart.Cooper seems like a strange choice for this type of role being too allAmerican for this dashing European character born in France and raised in England. It takes a while to accept him in this part more obviously made for actors like Fredric March or Ronald Colman. Ann Harding a popular leading lady barely remembered today except by obsessive classic movie fans such as me resembles the more famous Irene Dunne In fact the two of them were often cast in similar parts in the early 1930's when they were under contract to RKO. The only difference is that Dunne was able to show off her talent for comedy and was a good singer for operettas while Harding was primarily a dramatic actress. Harding did have some comical skills she gets to show here. The roles of the characters as children are played by the talented Dickie Moore and Virginia Wiedler. Douglas Dumbrille usually cast as the imperious heavy is good as Moore's serious uncle but unlike Basil Rathbone in the same year's David Copperfield his similar character actually means well if not totally sympathetic. The actual villain is John Halliday as Harding's count husband whose actions are understandable considering the time setting and circumstances. It is more the outcome of his actions than the things he does which bring on the tragedy and fantasy of the romantic situation. Donald Meek is also memorable as Cooper's blind employer who sees the world through a different light that instills him with much wisdom.".

There are films that are unique like Salo or that late one from Lars von Trier with Daniel Defoe I don't care to remember its name or some artsyfartsy film which the two just mentioned are not but these films are enough to have seen just once and you seldom find reason to see them again. But then there are films that are so surprisingly mystic that the only reason why you don't see them over and over again is because you want to preserve that mysticism in your memory and not risk having it washed out. Such a film is Peter Ibbetson which I don't revisit in vain but gladly so when my memory of it wears out a little. It's one of those rare films about true love of which the carnal part may be very dear but of very slight importance when considering the whole of it. Again it is that love which will not respect death as its end and which can only end by betrayal. In this there is some similarity with The Enchanted Cottage which otherwise however displays a different part of love's mystery. As other reviewers have pointed out the biggest surprise is that this kind of film was done so long ago and with such productionvalues including the dire cast. The only other film that deals with astral travel that comes into my mind is Basket Case which in production was more like a Cfilm done independently on a shoestring budget.".

	schema:headline " An inventive and utterly unashamed utopian romance here on planet earth";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Ibbetson 1935An unrepenting romance and I mean romance in the sense of two people being in true love for ever and ever no matter what. There is almost nothing less going on here but who needs anything else? The best of it in a way is the fantasia near the end some remarkable dream and surreal scenes with great effect. Also a great treat is seeing a young Ida Lupino as a sweet and somewhat selfabsorbed young woman who is interested in our hero played by Gary Cooper.But Lupino is secondary and once things get fully in gear in the present it is Cooper's romance as Peter Ibbetson with Ann Harding playing his childhood girlfriend that makes it click. And no romantic stone is left untouched. By the time the movie gets to its final third you know what is happening and then it takes a huge turn and things get both crazy and sentimentally moving. A romance turns violent and then a crime turns first dark and then bright and almost religious though never actually religious and a sense of winning against all the odds is the final theme. This may strike some viewers as just wishful thinking and directorial excess but it's so well done this isn't fair. The special effects are stunning better than many recent effects for sure. And what about the filming and acting? All quite first rate. You might pigeonhole this as some kind of Depressionera escapist dream come true kind of film but it really rises above that. It's about an impossible but not quite impossible ideal of absolute love something that rises even above having a young Ida Lupino want you in your youth or above giving up when chained to a wooden plank with a broken back. It's about hoping when it seems there is no hope.But then that's what people were doing everyday in the mid 1930s after half a decade of terrible economic times and without even knowing that another half a decade lay ahead. It's not a great film but it's a great theme handled well enough to make you perk up. Someone else might have played Cooper's part with more subtlety or sophistication but Harding is terrific in her role as rich kid turned angel. And Henry Hathaway directing his heart out for a change pulls off some great shifts in tone and temperament form one section of the film to the next and narrowly avoids the sickly sweetness or downright camp that might have trapped another director. He may not have had a really classic film to his name but among a good dozen very very good ones from these 1930s dramas to some postwar film noirs this is one of his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "While it's obvious that almost all the reviewers adored this film I feel a voice of dissent is needed as I have a different perspective. Although this is one of the loveliest looking films I can think of from the era I was left cold by the film because I felt the plot didn't make much sense and because the characters were jerksyes jerks. To me the film was NOT about true romance but blind infatuation and selfishness but more about that later.The film begins with a prologue. Young Peter Ibbetson played by Dickie Moore looks to be about 5 and he is alternately playing with and arguing with the little girl who is his best friend. Unfortunately soon his mother dies and he is taken to England to live out most of the rest of his life. However the plot demands that this little infatuation with a little girl is not only NOT forgotten but so consumes Ibbetson that decades later he returns to France to try to find this girl. This is utterly ridiculous as was his accidentally discovering this same girl now grown quite by mistake when he fell in love with her all over again while not realizing it was the same person. Talk about straining credibility! But it gets worse. The lady is already marriedyet Ibbetson doesn't give a darn about the husband and demands that she run off with him!!!!!! So they're basing this love that will withstand the ages mostly on the vague recollections of a guy thinking about life at age 5...and this doesn't seem illogical to anyone? Plus now the lady is married to a wealthy titled man and yet this will somehow work out?!! When the husband finds out and tries to kill Ibettson after all this is a matter of honor and it is the early 19th centurya duel or simply shooting Ibbetson would have been the proper tactic the husband is killed in the scuffle...and we are expected to feel bad only for Ibbetson and his lady love? I actually felt worse for the husbandup until then he seemed like a decent enough sort. Sure he shouldn't have tried to kill Peter but can you blame him for trying to get rid of this shameless homewrecker? Now Ibbetson is in prison for the rest of his life. Now here it gets weird...very weird. Ibbetson spends the rest of his life meeting with and loving Mary in his mindand she too can see and experience all these meetings along with him! There is no explanation for this odd symbiosis...it just happens as if by magic. And when he finally dies they meet in some external bliss together. Ugghwhat hooey! These portions of the film are so sticky and tough to watch.So the film is based on a love affair between two dumb and selfish people. Dumb because loving somebody as a small child should NOT be the basis for uprooting and destroying lives. This movie is all emotion and no logic from start to finish. Cooper plays a selfish and mushy character who I had a hard time likingnot a rugged or manly sort of fellow just a jerk.So why did I still give the movie a 4 even if I though I disliked the plot so much and felt it tried to justify adultery? Well I gotta hand it to Henry Hathaway's directionit was a truly lovely film to look at and it was very manipulative. Plus the great sound track really pulled on your heartstrings whatever a 'heartstring' is.".

It gets off to a good start with the principals as children  in fact the child actors are better than the adult versions which is one of my main objections to the film. I am a fan of Gary Cooper despite his limitations as an actor. He's great in action pictures  the strong silent type with a minimum of expression and dialogue. But he's in over his head as the title character and just lacks the required acting range. There are scenes in which a better actor would register the nuance and facial expression necessary but Coop registers... not much I'm afraid. Ann Harding is pretty in a dowdy fatfaced sort of way but is simply not good enough for the part.Having said that the picture has a lovely score and the pacing is brisk. Director Hathaway had a long and distinguished career in Hollywood and does his darndest here but is hamstrung by my second objection the last half of the story which is ah a challenge. I can appreciate fantasy but ladies and gentlemen this is overthetop fantasy and I know when I'm being taken for a ride.I tried Lord knows I tried to go with it but give me a break. I found the first half of the picture hauntingly beautiful as a professional movie reviewer might say. And I am as romantic as the next guy. I found the scene in which they reconnected after so many years very touching. I found the scenes between their parting as children even more so. But not the 'dream' scenes as adults  those were farfetched and let's leave it at that.There is a question that comes with our reviews on the website that asks Did you find this review useful?. This review IS useful even if you don't agree with it. I just think that there is a fine line between romanticism and goofiness.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm glad that Peter Ibbetson has been done as an opera by Deems Taylor because that is the medium that this strange story would most likely be revived. It's a sad and romantic tale that they wrote back in Victorian days but would hardly make it today.Originally a novel by George DuMaurier Peter Ibbetson became a play on Broadway that was written by John N. Raphaelson and starred John and Lionel Barrymore on Broadway during the 1917 season. The notion that people in love separated by man could be united and live a life in dreams would have found great popularity in that year with so many lovers and married folks separated by war.Two children played by Dickie Moore and Virginia Weidler grow up to be Gary Cooper and Ann Harding. Moore and Weidler are best friends and neighbors in Paris a pair of English expatriate families. When Moore's mother dies his uncle Douglass Dumbrille comes to Paris to take him back to Great Britain to raise and the children are separated.Fast forward many years later and Ann Harding is now the Duchess of Towers and her husband John Halliday the Duke hires a promising young architect to do some major renovations on the estate and its Gary Cooper. At some point Harding and Cooper realize who they are and the memories of a bygone carefree childhood cause them to fall in love. When Halliday finds them in a compromising position he tries to shoot Cooper who flings a chair at him and kills him.If all things were equal Cooper at most should have been charged with manslaughter. But Halliday being a Duke gains him celebrity status and Cooper apparently without a good attorney gets sentenced to life imprisonment. But as they are separated now Harding and Cooper connect in their dreams each night and live an incredible life which of course means they never grow old.For today's audience Peter Ibbetson is a bit hard to swallow but the players are so charming and sincere you actually let your cynicism fall away. The story is remarkably similar to the operetta Maytime and no wonder Deems Taylor saw it as suitable grand opera material. In fact Peter Ibbetson's one Academy Award nomination was for its romantic musical score.As good as Cooper and Harding are I think in retrospect the film belongs to Dickie Moore and Virginia Weidler. As the children Mimsie and Gogo the film really belongs to them you remember their performances throughout the movie as you watch their grownup counterparts.Oddly enough even with a French and later English setting Peter Ibbetson's cast is mostly American. No one in fact is more American than Gary Cooper but few also are have as romantic persona and a face the movie camera loved as it did few others. For that reason and others Peter Ibbetson holds up well even in today's far more realistic and cynical age.".

	schema:reviewBody "I imagine this is exactly the sort of film that if you saw it at an impressionable age in your youth it would make a lasting impression on you for the rest of your life. As I am not old enough to have been young when the film came out I cannot vouch for this. Nevertheless I have possessed this film for several years on VHS and generally view it every 24 months or so. Picture and sound quality are below par as to be expected for a film of this age. I see that a DVD is now available but only as part of a boxed set and I don't fancy the idea of having to purchase a whose set just to obtain one DVD !! With repeated viewings I have grown to like the film more. I originally only liked the first half and thought the second half to be a little boring but now I find that it is more watcheable. The thing is there are unfortunately very few of this type of film made the one that immediately comes to mind is of course Portrait of Jennie which had much better picture and sound quality and moved me emotionally far more than Peter Ibbetson. That said the film has good points but I find the grownup passion to be not as strong as I would have hoped given the fusion and complicity between the kids during the first half hour. The separation of the children is an extremely painful moment to watch .. we then jump forward in time and when they meet up again and find out who they are and what they mean to each other I just couldn't feel as much emotion as I would have liked. This may due to the actors involved .. I did not know the lady actress and have appreciated Gary Cooper in cowboy rles but not in the role of an architect though I seem to remember having seen him in a similar rle in a film called the Fountainhead. I also found that his person was well suited to the role of Mr Deeds but here something seemed to be missing without my being able to put a finger on precisely what. Still the film has good moments with the dream meetings in paradisiac places and the end of course is satisfying. The music score is also very emotional and I hope that in the future both sound and picture quality can be cleaned up. I hope this film is not remade as any remake today is bound to overdo the special FX side and all the charm will be lost. The film is therefore quite original in its style and is bound to appeal to those who like a dose of surrealism and escapism without necessarily being completely removed from reality.".

	onyx:emotionText "I imagine this is exactly the sort of film that if you saw it at an impressionable age in your youth it would make a lasting impression on you for the rest of your life. As I am not old enough to have been young when the film came out I cannot vouch for this. Nevertheless I have possessed this film for several years on VHS and generally view it every 24 months or so. Picture and sound quality are below par as to be expected for a film of this age. I see that a DVD is now available but only as part of a boxed set and I don't fancy the idea of having to purchase a whose set just to obtain one DVD !! With repeated viewings I have grown to like the film more. I originally only liked the first half and thought the second half to be a little boring but now I find that it is more watcheable. The thing is there are unfortunately very few of this type of film made the one that immediately comes to mind is of course Portrait of Jennie which had much better picture and sound quality and moved me emotionally far more than Peter Ibbetson. That said the film has good points but I find the grownup passion to be not as strong as I would have hoped given the fusion and complicity between the kids during the first half hour.

It's always surprising to come along a competent child actor in Golden Age cinema so it was nice to have two of them here. The second section of the film has Cooper meeting the girl again this time played by the beautiful Ann Harding. Unfortunately she's married to a Duke. The third chapter I won't ruin but I have to say I wasn't too happy with the fantastical premise of the two characters sharing each other's dreams. It seemed too out there for what is otherwise a realistic film. Still you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it all. Henry Hathaway's direction is fine and the cinematography is often exquisite. The score which is the only aspect of the film that received an Oscar nomination is particularly beautiful. Ida Lupino gives a short but great supporting performance as an Englishwoman Cooper meets on his holiday in Paris.".

It's a most unusual role for Coop certainly but in my opinion he makes quite a fair fist of it. I also liked Ida Lupino but I felt the normally ultrareliable Donald Meek made but a poor impression with his roleadmittedly small but important. On the other hand Douglass Dumbrille is given an elaborate introduction as the colonel but then completely disappears! As for the children  Dickie Moore and Virginia Weidler  they are both absolute horrors though Master Moore is far the more obnoxious of the two.Admittedly I hardly expected du Maurier's Mimsey to be accurately or even halfheartedly translated to film. But even so Miss Weidler is surely the very opposite of the child du Maurier describes the reverse of beautiful although she would have had fine eyes but for her red lashless lids. She wore her thick hair cropped short like a boy and was pasty and sallow in complexion hollowcheeked thickfeatured and overgrown with long thin hands and feet and arms and legs of quite pathetic length and tennity a silent and melancholy little girl who sucked her thumb perpetually and kept her own counsel. Fortunately both Ann Harding and John Halliday are cast more in the du Maurier mold and  what's more important  both display excellent presence and ability.The chief problem for me really comes down to Hathaway. He seemed to me to be a bit out of his element here. Three of the players were so embarrassingly bad it's almost beyond belief that a skillful director could allow such ineptitude to slip by. Especially with such key support players. Admittedly two were children but Hathaway himself was a child actor. You could understand a bitplayer or a minor actor gumming up a scene. He's on the set for a few days at most  and then gone forever. But actors that a director is supposed to be guiding day in day out for weeks on end! Hathaway has stated on more than one occasion that actors are hired to act. It is not the director's job he feels to guide them with their interpretations let alone help and succor actors who have been miscast or are out of their depth. On the other hand Hathaway would know from his own personal experiences the particular requirements of child actors and one would expect him to rise to the challenge. But this was obviously not the case here.If Hathaway is not the man for the players he is also not the man for this type of story. He's an action man not a Lubitsch who can handle fantasy and Romance. That's Romance with a capital R not sex or even just your everyday celluloid boymeetsgirl. The two or three action scenes and the tense confrontation at the dinnertable masterfully shot from six or eight angles and skilfully edited by Stuart Heisler do come across with powerful effectiveness. But elsewhere Hathaway is obviously laboring with difficulty with unfamiliar surroundings and trappings. The fantasy material lacks tight supervision. Its effects are too obvious too heavyhanded.I can understand why many French critics love this movie. Subtitles would not only disguise the inadequacies of Moore's and Weidler's performances but allow freedom to interpret the visuals more imaginatively and romantically. In a foreign language  and for those of us with more sensitive dispositions  Peter Ibbetson would likely emerge as a profoundly moving experience.".

Basically young English boy Gogo Dickie Moore is growing up in Paris and he is very friendly with neighbour girl Mimsey Virginia Weidler. After the death of his mother Gogo is taken to England by his uncle who gives him the new name based on his mother's maiden name he becomes Peter Ibbetson. Now an adult Englishman Peter Ibbetson Gary Cooper works as an architect in Yorkshire his latest project is being hired by the Duke of Towers John Halliday to design and bring restoration to a building for him. Peter is introduced to Mary Duchess of Towers Ann Harding he falls in love with her and although she is already married she develops feelings for him as well. The Duke discovers their love affair and demands they explain themselves in doing this Peter realises that Mary is in fact Mimsey his childhood sweetheart and she realises he is Gogo. The Duke becomes jealous and pulls out a gun to shoot Peter in the scuffle Peter gets the gun and the kills the Duke in selfdefence. Peter is unjustly convicted and sentenced to life in prison for this accidental killing he despairs that he will never see Mary again however they are reunited in their dreams. The years pass but Peter and Mary remain youthful in their dreams in the end Mary dies from old age but she goes to her dream world one last time there she is joined by Peter as they go to Heaven together. Also starring Ida Lupino as Agnes Douglass Dumbrille as Colonel Forsythe Doris Lloyd as Mrs. Dorian Elsa Buchanan as Madame Pasquier Christian Rub as Major Duquesnois Donald Meek as Mr. Slade and Gilbert Emery as Wilkins. The casting of Cooper and Harding is perhaps a little odd but that's partly good it is a slightly strange film anyway lovers who communicate mostly through dreams though it is an oddity it became something of a landmark I don't think it's the sort of thing I'd watch more than once a reasonable classic drama.

Gogo grows up to become Peter Ibbetson a shy handsome young architect and Mimsey develops into a radiant beauty who marries into the aristocracy.  When she sends for an architect to redesign her stables the childhood sweethearts are reunited but with unforeseen results...    This Paramount weepie is Hollywood's second attempt at an obscure George Du Maurier novel the first entitled Forever was made in 1921.  Gary Cooper plays Peter with a thin stiff little moustache and a thin stiff little acting style.  Ann Harding is divine as the gorgeous Mary.  If the 1870's fashions are somewhat sketchy approximations the sets are stupendous  especially Mary's boudoir.  The avalanche scene is impressive but little attempt is made at geographical authenticity.  Peter and Mary walk among wonderful trees and hills but wherever this is it's neither England nor France.  In a similar vein it is sheer laziness to have a rail station entitled simply London.    The children who play Mimsey and Gogo are great Virginia Weidler and Dickie Moore but Peter's recollection of the little wagon is dreadfully overdone.  Cinematographer Charles Lang has consciously evoked Raphael's 'Liberation Of Saint Peter' in the apparition scenes in the prison an intelligent underpinning of the story's mysticism.  The cutting between Peter at the trestle table and the Duke breakingin a horse is director Henry Hathaway's clever comment on the contrasting characters of the two men in Mary's life.    What befalls Peter is a little hard to believe and the chains are a melodramatic exaggeration but the film certainly packs emotional punch.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a huge horror genre fan and this was coming on TV the other day and I thought it wouldn't hurt to give this a try not knowing it had a rating of 3.5 here on IMDb. After watching it I felt it was an OK movie and the plot was very interesting. This is a remake of a Japanese film. I think it would have been even more wonderful to see it in the original version. Also seeing this film in a crowd makes it into a comedy. So watch it alone in the dark and get creeped out.The story begins by the accidental burning up of a hospital and a little girl along with her teddy bear is staring forlornly towards the raging inferno. She has been rescued by the firefighters but she doesn't say a word to them. Many people are dead due to that fire and the girl's sister is also a victim. After that a girl drowns in her own backyard pool along with her cat. But the thing is she didn't commit suicide as everybody thinks. Something dragged her into the water and killed her. Her cellphone starts acting weirdly then. Then the director introduces us to the main character in the film Beth Raymond Shannyn Sossamon and her friend Leann Cole Azura Skye who gets a weird phone call in her own future voice and the date of the call is also in the future. In that she finds out the exact time of her death and a free treat to her own freaked out voice during the death. She thinks nothing of it until she sees ghosts ghouls weird insects on other people and reapers all around her. Beth starts to believe in this weird 'miss call  death time' theory after she watches Leann die in front of her and phone is dialling another number in Leann's contacts after Leann is dead. She notifies the authorities about this enigma but they dismiss her theory. Detective Jack Andrews Edward Burns is in homicide and his sister had also died under strange circumstances see the drowning girl. They team up together after similarly ominous deaths happen to Beth's friends. They find a common factor among the dead and it was that they all were in the phone contacts of each other and they all had an orange candy in their mouth after their deaths. Somehow all this is connected to the mother of the girl who was saved from the burning hospital. Can Beth save herself from the 'phone curse'? I am frankly quite shocked at this rating. Sure the film isn't great but it isn't trash as many of you are making it out to be. Other than the fact that most of the actors who played college kids in the movie looked way older I actually enjoyed this. And also the ending kind of bummed me out. You will see what I mean after you watch the movie. The background score was overbearing sometimes and it was like 'here comes a scary moment jump out of your seats!' The reason for the hauntings of the phone is quite scary actually. This film reminded me a lot of Final Destination movies without all the cool deaths and much more fleshed out story. The acting for the most part is OK not too great nor dumb. They could have just thrown out the mobile or not picked up the call when it rang. But that wouldn't have made it a movie would it? So don't hate it for that and don't watch this with a gang of friends and you will probably enjoy this.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Facts As of 4.27.08 the rating for this movie is 2.9 Nearly EVERY review is negative. The accusations leveled over and over are worst movie ever terrible trash stupid and the like. Here's my sad story about One Missed CallIt was a rainy Sunday afternoon I live in Seattle so I went to the local video store looking for a mindless movie to watch while laying about. While perusing the selections I saw IT  not the Stephen King movie but the most vilified movie in recent memory One Missed Call staring at me from the shelf. I almost felt it call to me and for a fraction of a second my hand with a mind of its own started to reach out for it. Needless to say I retrieved my composure and hurried away. Having read the reviews on IMDb and so KNOWING it was something to avoid at all costs I felt shameful and dirty at having let my guard down as I did. As I walked a little further down the aisle I spotted another movie Reservation Road. Thank goodness! Redemption! I thought as I picked up a copy feeling once again like sensible individual. As I headed for the front counter reading the back of the box it said Reservation Road was something to the effect of being a deep emotional story. Not exactly the mindless fare for a rainy Sunday! So completely loosing my mind and throwing caution to the wind I snuck back and returned the copy of Reservation Road. Then making certain no one else was around grabbed a copy One Missed Call. I quickly tucked THE movie under my arm so that no passersby could read the title and know the poor decision I had just made. As I made my way to the counter I made sure no line of happy movie renters were there so as to avoid their judging eyes. Safely at the counter to throwoff some of my guilt I made a joke with the clerk about how I was going to regret my selection but am a diehard horror fan and therefore excused. He looked completely unaffected. I hurriedly paid and headed out the door with my guilty secret. Once home I popped the disc in settled onto my couch and readied myself for disappointment. Funny thing though About half way through the feature I started thinking about how similar this movie was to another movie I had seen  The Ring. The Ring when it hit the theaters and ultimately DVD got huge rave reviews. Strangely though once I personally saw The Ring  and after all the hype  was ultimately disappointed. The Ring wasn't a bad movie in my opinion but it also was not deserving of all the accolades either  again in my opinion. So here I am watching One Missed Call comparing it to The Ring and now thinking the end has got to be the reason everyone is calling this a stinker. Well I got to the end and was sitting there with furrowed brow thinking What did I miss? Where is the movie that everyone hates so much? I don't feel rippedoff or violated. I don't even feel as if I was condescended to. What happened? I suspect this was a case of jumping on the proverbial bandwagon. I thought we had are OWN opinions and shared them here on IMDb honestly. I have a very hard time believing that the same demographic gave The Ring 7.3 AVP Requiem 5.1 which SUUUUCKED and One Missed Call 2.9. There is a serious disturbance in the force here. I used to trust the opinions and ratings on here. Ultimately this single incident has shaken my confidence in IMDb and the people casting their votes much like the general elections of 2000  2004.I hope one day I will once again be able to enter IMDb with the belief that I will be able to take away from it the knowledge needed to make a sensible movie renting choice. Until then I will have to stumble through the video store alone unarmed and destined to fall into the crags of bad movie selections. A sad story indeed. I fear I will run out of room soon so I'll end here. Cheers! Thanks for reading.".

First the one and only good thing about this movie was it built decent suspense in some parts. That being said the pay off was horrible. We would always get some bad CGI a copy off of something that was in another movie1408 is a clue or an average death that is filmed horribly just so that the movie won't be R. The character development is THE WORST I have seen in any movie and thats including all the very low budget horror movies. The detective doesn't have a personality he's just kind of a machine that spits out dialog. The main character is so stupid its unbelievable. There have been unintentionally stupid characters throughout time but none have been so stupid that I had to shake my head at them. The side characters are worse. You just remember them as hot Latin chick guy friend and the other friend. Of course that means you don't care for their deaths. The plot was pretty stupid they just shove some random crap in their so they could have an ending. When the film ends it made me mad because they took too long to show credits so you think something else will happen but then the credits just roll. And if the screenwriter had a brain he would know that cell phones aren't scary its the idea of hearing your own death. But of course we just have to have a cell phone in every scene and this ruins what could be some good scares. On one last note there was a really embarrassing scene that we're supposed to take serious but you just laugh your head off at the stupidity. Overall a 310".

	schema:reviewBody "Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG13 or R. the hero must then team up with a second hero and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected the characters breathe a sigh of relief only to discover that they were wrong and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue and many times the hero of the story  a college student named Beth Raymond Shannyn Sossamon forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone and when you play it back you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of accident that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings but you have to remember the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG13 rating so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path and introduces our second hero a police detective named Jack Andrews Edward Burns. He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message because his sister was a victim of it too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse and the clues fall right into place leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring The Grudge Dark Water and the like happens and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similarthemed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a predetermined path and what's worse they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in but they're forced to act like idiots because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here but should you see this movie not that I'm recommending you do ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend and actually consider this movie please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom it only causes it.".

Remaking Japanese horror is getting stale if it was ever really fresh that is so with that in mind i feel the hatred and backlash for this latest American remake has a touch of stop remaking already. One Missed Call Japanese original Chakushin Ari is creepy enough from little eerie dolls and grotesque figures to a seriously unnerving ring tone it works as the most basic of chillers when watched alone in the dark. You will find that Final Destination and The Ring will come springing to mind as you watch this one unfold so no great prizes for originality for sure. The acting of course is substandard even Ray Wise seems to be the bread part of a camp and ham sandwich the directing is sloppy and the ending frustrates as much as it intrigues but the picture is creepy and for that alone it's far more entertaining than the ream of gorno slashers that dumb the screens every other week. 510".

	schema:headline " Has Its Moments But Overall A Very Poor Horror Remake.";
	schema:reviewBody "One Missed Call follows a college coed named Beth Shannyn Sossamon whose friend Leann Azura Skye dies in a freak accident after receiving a strange phone message that seems to be a recording of her death that followed two days after it was received. Not only that but another one of Leann's friends Shelley Meagan Good had a similar incident before her bizarre death. When Beth meets detective Andrews Edward Burns who believes there is truth to the strange events the two team up to try and discover the source of the murderous chain of phone messages. And when Beth receives one herself it becomes a race against time before she meets her predetermined fate as well.To get things clear in the beginning I have not seen the original Japanese version of this film so I cannot make a comparison between the two. However I can say that this remake was quite a mess of a movie regardless of whether or not the original was a good film. For one the writing is pretty lousy. The story begins kind of all over the place before focusing on one central character and that initial opening scare scene was flatout ridiculous. There are dozens of plot holes scattered throughout the film and many things that simply do not add up. It's pretty clichd as well relying on a never ending slew of jump scares to get a reaction from the audience  problem is most of them are so much expected that few are even minorly effective. There is little to no suspense as well and I felt this could have been a fairly suspenseful movie.The second area where the script fails is in the characters. We get their names but that's about all. They have no depth little personality and are really overall bland even the protagonists that we are supposed to be caring about. The acting was average but I have a feeling the reason some of the performances lack is because the script was poorly written to begin with and the performers had little to go on. Shannyn Sossamon leads the cast and does decent with what she has as does Edward Burns but neither are anything remarkable. The rest of the more minor characters are even more bland and have even less to go on. Azura Skye is notable in her performance as Sossamon's friend but she suffers from a poorlywritten character as well. I also had a bit of a problem with the chemistry between the charactersthe actors because sometimes things just did not feel 'right'. There is some good to be found in this movie though however little it may be. While some may bash it for it's PG13 rating I don't have a problem with that because it's not a movie that needs to be gory to begin with. I also thought that the general premise was interesting even though it is a remake. It's a neat idea but the execution of it was horrible. I will give it the benefit of the doubt though when it comes to some of the visuals and images  there are a few creepy visuals in this movie and the 'villians' for lack of a better term were pretty spooky as was the sinister warning ringtone. I thought the hospital sequence towards the end was fairly creepy  that is until we are shown a grinning monsterinfant playing with a cell phone in a crib which was not only ridiculous but was supposed to be taken seriously. That bit ruined the good that I saw in that scene to say the least even during that semiscary attack by a reanimated corpse. The ending was a letdown as well and I was really disappointed.Overall One Missed Call is one of the worst horror films I've seen at the theater in awhile. The script is messy the characters are bland the scares are ineffective there is little to no suspense  and the entire film felt like it was carelessly thrown together. It's a shame too because the premise is interesting and this could have been a decent movie but the filmmakers' execution of it was poor. Besides a few creepy visuals I can't recommend much here. You'll probably want to skip this one or wait till it comes to video. 310.".

	onyx:emotionText "One Missed Call follows a college coed named Beth Shannyn Sossamon whose friend Leann Azura Skye dies in a freak accident after receiving a strange phone message that seems to be a recording of her death that followed two days after it was received. Not only that but another one of Leann's friends Shelley Meagan Good had a similar incident before her bizarre death. When Beth meets detective Andrews Edward Burns who believes there is truth to the strange events the two team up to try and discover the source of the murderous chain of phone messages. And when Beth receives one herself it becomes a race against time before she meets her predetermined fate as well.To get things clear in the beginning I have not seen the original Japanese version of this film so I cannot make a comparison between the two. However I can say that this remake was quite a mess of a movie regardless of whether or not the original was a good film. For one the writing is pretty lousy. The story begins kind of all over the place before focusing on one central character and that initial opening scare scene was flatout ridiculous. There are dozens of plot holes scattered throughout the film and many things that simply do not add up. It's pretty clichd as well relying on a never ending slew of jump scares to get a reaction from the audience  problem is most of them are so much expected that few are even minorly effective. There is little to no suspense as well and I felt this could have been a fairly suspenseful movie.The second area where the script fails is in the characters. We get their names but that's about all.

	schema:reviewBody "Like many lousy horror films the premise to One Missed Call isn't half bad though perhaps a bit recycled. In this one Leann Cole Azura Skye receives a strange voicemail message Her own voice panicked terrified and screaming. Two days later she dies in a freak accident uttering the same words and screams that she heard on her cell phone.One by one the members of Leann's circle of friends receive phone messages of themselves moments before death  only to end up dying exactly as indicated. Beth Raymond Shannyn Sossamon witnesses all this but can't explain it. And when her own phone rings Beth hears her coming demise and has barely a day to discover who is placing the calls and why.Whether you liked The Ring or not there was a certain novelty to it at the time. Then came The Grudge Dark Water The Skeleton Key and a dozen others. With One Missed Call Hollywood isn't just scraping the bottom of the barrel they're turning the barrel over and seeing if any residue is clinging to the underside.Andrew Klavan wrote the screenplay based on a Japanese novel and script. I can't speak for the quality of his source material but Klavan does nothing to elevate the story to any level of class. If you thought the original Halloween was ridiculous for having Jamie Lee Curtis run upstairs! and hide in a closet! to escape her supernatural stalker then Beth's foray into a hospital's air ducts will have you groaning in sheer disdain.The acting is decidedly poor. But it's not the kind of lousy acting that speaks ill of the performers. Instead it feels like director Eric Valette actually requested the delivery we see onscreen. It may have something to do with the fact that Valette is a native Frenchman that his last film job was six years before and that One Missed Call is his American debut. He's reaching across cultural and linguistic borders for the first time and it shows.But there's a bigger problem running through the entire film.Every film creates its own universe. Some are worlds just like ours some are complete fantasies. But all of them must create rules of operation including how the spiritual elements function. Even if the audience isn't aware of the rules the writer and director must have them in mind.One Missed Call creates rules and then inexplicably ignores them at random. For example as the victims each get closer to death they begin seeing strange apparitions. These apparitions are the same every time and are actually clues to what is going on. But when one character dies in a Catholic church in addition to the apparitions she also sees the icons of Mary and the Apostles begin distorting into gruesome figures. It may be a cool visual effect but it breaks the rules and has nothing to do with anything before or after.That same death illustrates another violation. All the previous deaths have been made to look like freak accidents but the girl in the church is visibly strangled by a ghostly figure.I would suggest the rulebreaking is because the director cared more about cool shots cheap scares and phony tension. Our evil spirit moves quickly behind frightened characters heard only because the sound crew puts in an overused whhht! to get us to jump. But the spirit proves that it does not need to materialize at all in order to stalk and kill so why bother whhhting around the place? And if time and space are no obstacle why travel through the cell phone at all? Why bother warning people they are about to die? And why do all of Beth's friends get two days' warning when Beth only gets one? Why drag the apparitions into it? Why list one of the stars as Ed Burns in the opening credits and Edward Burns in the end credits?  If they can't even get the credits congruent what hope do we have of anything in between being any good? Instead of playing out the basic premise with care and consistency Valette and Klavan mash various creepy ideas into the story until what's left horrifies us only because of its sheer stupidity.".

	schema:headline " Tense Atmospheric Chiller About Haunted Cell Phones";
	schema:reviewBody "No cell phones don't kill people in the creepy new supernatural nailbiter One Missed Call. Instead a vengeful ghost with a cell phone kills people. French director Eric Valette who helmed the 2002 occult chiller Malfique makes his Englishlanguage film debut and shows strong visual flair with otherwise formulaic subject matter. Teaming up with scenarist Andrew Klavan who penned the 1990 black comedy A Shock to the System Valette and he conjure up a veritable buffet of chills in their atmospheric aboveaverage rendition of Takashi Mike's scary 2003 Japanese ghoulfest Chakushin Ari. The original Asian horror filmtame by Takashi Mike standardsranks only a notch or two above Valette's sturdy remake. Valette's remake wraps things up about 30 minutes faster than Mike's original. A chilling cinematic experience in its own right One Missed Call  out of  will give you more than enough goose bumps and make you dread the prospect of checking your cell phone voicemail. Essentially One Missed Call amounts to another of those damselsindistress epics with Angelina Jolie lookalike Shannyn Sossamon cringing as cell phones chime the same ringtone of death and the corpses stack up. One Missed Call opens with a great 'gotcha' moment. AfricanAmerican babe Shelly Meagan Good of D.E.B.S. and her pet cat are relaxing in their backyard near a Japanesestyle goldfish pond when something stirs up the water. Inquisitive Shelly leans over the tranquil waters to see what is creating the disturbance. WHAM! She's toast! The kitty meows. WHAM! It's gone! Everything has to do with Shelly's cell phone. Like her friends Taylor Ana Claudia Talancn of Fast Food Nation Leann Drew Barrymore lookalike Azura Skye of 28 Days and Brian Johnny Lewis of Underclassman Shelly received a voicemail message that recorded the time of her impending death in the future. Griefstricken Norton University psychology student Beth Raymond Shannyn Sossamon of A Knight's Tale finds herself up to her neck in dead bodies when she crosses paths with Detective Jack Andrews Edward Burns of Saving Private Ryan who noses around the same crime scenes. Jack's sister it seems died under mysterious circumstances involving a cell phone. He discovered a red candy jawbreaker in her mouth identical to similar candy extracted from the gullets of the other victims. Predictably Beth demands that Jack let her accompany him on this occult outing. Things take a nasty turn in the last quarterhour and the conclusion leaves the film open to an inevitable sequel. Over the years the cell phone has become the one virtually indispensable electronic gadget that everybody owns so it was inevitable that horror movie makers would exploit this vulnerability with a haunted cell phone movie. In its weaker moments One Missed Call imitates the Final Destination movies when the victims die. After a victim receives their voicemail death message they begin to hallucinate and see greyface ghouls. One Missed Call qualifies as the kind of PG13 rated suspense saga that scares the wits out of you rather than gross you out with gore.".

	schema:headline " A good horror movie rated PG13";
	schema:reviewBody "When I had first gone to see One Missed Call I didn't think it would be that good. I didn't think it would be all that good because I don't like movies like The grudge and The Ring. I had also kept hearing bad things about it. It turned out to be a very good horror movie. I thought that it kept me on the edge of my seat. It also had some great sudden scares. Some of the faces and weird ghost looking people were also pretty scary as well. For a pg13 movie this was actually pretty scary. I don't get why people keep making fun of this movie. It was 10 times better than any of those movies like grudge or the ring. This movies story line was a little bit stupid but found a way to make it's way up toward the end. You end up finding out a lot more at the end and why people were getting phone calls from dead people. The ending to this movie was really bad though. I think that it kind of dragged on toward the end. The visuals in this movie were pretty cool as well. the movie could have easily been solved by just not picking up your cell phone to see your new voicemails or by throwing your cell phone away. I did like a couple of the actors in it which helped out the movie for me. One of the good actors in it was Edward Burns he played a great role. He played a detective who is trying to save a girl and her friends from the things that are killing them. The other awesome actor was Shannyn Sossamon who played the girl that was trying to protect all of her friends and stop the phone calls. It was so intense every time you saw that someone had a new voicemail it makes you wonder right away can they fight it and survive. This was a remake of the old One Missed Call which was a japan movie. This was a good remake and should be checked out if you like creepy edge of your seat horror movies. Overall this movie would get a 8 out of 10 rating. Go see it I think that you will enjoy this one more than some of those other dumb movies that have been out. Such as The Grudge and The Ring which are just flat out not even worth seeing.".

I didn't think it would be all that good because I don't like movies like The grudge and The Ring. I had also kept hearing bad things about it. It turned out to be a very good horror movie. I thought that it kept me on the edge of my seat. It also had some great sudden scares. Some of the faces and weird ghost looking people were also pretty scary as well. For a pg13 movie this was actually pretty scary. I don't get why people keep making fun of this movie. It was 10 times better than any of those movies like grudge or the ring. This movies story line was a little bit stupid but found a way to make it's way up toward the end. You end up finding out a lot more at the end and why people were getting phone calls from dead people. The ending to this movie was really bad though.

	schema:headline " While not one of Lubitsch's best 'Angel' is still one of his most overlooked films";
	schema:reviewBody "Ernst Lubitsch was an incredibly talented director who to me rarely made a dud with his best films even being masterpieces. Even his lesser films are worth a look even if just once and better than a lot of directors at their worst.'Angel' is not among his best films being not in the same league as 'The Merry Widow' 'Ninotchka' Heaven Can Wait' 'The Shop Around the Corner' and especially 'Trouble in Paradise'. It is however for all its imperfections one of his more overlooked films. Some may say 'Angel' is a gem others may say it's a rare dud. To me it's neither but is much better than its reputation suggests.By all means it could have been better. It does lag in places not helped by a story being a bit thin for the running time with some of the romantic melodrama laid on too thickly at times. Herbert Marshall who is more capable of giving a good performance but has also given some dull ones is rather somnolent in his role. A few of the secondary roles are underwritten Edward Everett Horton while still being very funny in particular is underutilised.With those being said while just lacking the famous Lubitsch touch being on subdued form and lacking the risqu edge Lubitsch does direct with his customary class and subtlety. He also has some beautiful visual touches in a lovingly photographed and designed film that clearly loves Marlene Dietrich judging by now positively luminous she looks.Music is appropriately whimsical in places while also sweeping without being overbearing. The script does have some sparkling humour in the supporting roles and typically sophisticated with a warm charm.

	onyx:emotionText "Ernst Lubitsch was an incredibly talented director who to me rarely made a dud with his best films even being masterpieces. Even his lesser films are worth a look even if just once and better than a lot of directors at their worst.'Angel' is not among his best films being not in the same league as 'The Merry Widow' 'Ninotchka' Heaven Can Wait' 'The Shop Around the Corner' and especially 'Trouble in Paradise'. It is however for all its imperfections one of his more overlooked films. Some may say 'Angel' is a gem others may say it's a rare dud. To me it's neither but is much better than its reputation suggests.By all means it could have been better. It does lag in places not helped by a story being a bit thin for the running time with some of the romantic melodrama laid on too thickly at times. Herbert Marshall who is more capable of giving a good performance but has also given some dull ones is rather somnolent in his role. A few of the secondary roles are underwritten Edward Everett Horton while still being very funny in particular is underutilised.With those being said while just lacking the famous Lubitsch touch being on subdued form and lacking the risqu edge Lubitsch does direct with his customary class and subtlety. He also has some beautiful visual touches in a lovingly photographed and designed film that clearly loves Marlene Dietrich judging by now positively luminous she looks.Music is appropriately whimsical in places while also sweeping without being overbearing. The script does have some sparkling humour in the supporting roles and typically sophisticated with a warm charm. The story is less than perfect but has some fun and charming moments.Dietrich is as aforementioned luminous has a class and elegance and gives her character good comic timing and pathos. In the supporting roles Horton and Ernest Cossart are particularly entertaining with their back and forth standing out of the comedy.In conclusion could have been better but overlooked. 710 Bethany Cox";

	schema:reviewBody "ANGEL Paramount 1937 produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch returns Marlene Dietrich to sophisticated comedy following her amusing role in DESIRE 1936 as a continental jewel thief. As much as this production could very well have been a cute romantic fantasy of an angel assigned from Heaven out to guide a troubled individual on Earth what resulted was a domestic story about a bored wife who acquires the pet name of Angel from a complete stranger while her husband is away. While Dietrich's DESIRE proved favorable ANGEL did not. The story begins on an airplane bound for France where Lady Maria Barker Marlene Dietrich registers at the Hotel Imperial. Coming to the Club De La Russia 314 Rue De La Tour to visit with an old friend The Grand Duchess Anna Dmitrievna Laura Hope Crews the club's owner steps away to take care of matters leaving Maria to step into a private sitting room where she encounters Anthony Halton Melvyn Douglas an American looking to meet someone for an amusing time in Paris. Mistaken for the Duchess Maria agrees to show the gentleman around. After dinner the couple rest on a park bench where Maria refusing to give her name finds herself embraced and kissed by a man who not only expresses his true love for her after only a short time but dubs her Angel. As breaking away to buy her a bouquet of violets Halton returns to find his Angel gone. Sir Frederick Barker Herbert Marshall a British nobleman and delegate to the League of Nations returns from Geneva to his British home and his wife Maria. Unaware of her unhappiness and their dull existence together things begin to change upon the visitation of her husband's wartime friend a man wanting to meet his Angel. Taken from the play by Melchor Lengyel ANGEL contains some variations lifted from Lubitsch's own 1932 musical ONE HOUR WITH YOU where a doctor Maurice Chevalier innocently encounters a flirtatious married woman Genevieve Tobin who turns out to be the best friend of his wife Jeanette MacDonald whom she invited to their home. As with the husband and guest pretending to not to lead on their previous encounter to his spouse Dietrich's Maria and Douglas' Halton do the same but on more on a serious nature. Containing less wit than Lubitsch's previous efforts the supporting cast contains some of the best known comedy relief types on screen ranging from Edward Everett Horton and Ernest Cossart as the household servants to the daffy Dennie Moore playing Cossart's fiance Emma McGillicutty. Interestingly all their roles which might have given the story some life during some dull stretches are sadly limited. For one of the film's better assets there's that fine Angel theme score composed by Frederick Hollander. According to Robert Osborne host on Turner Classic Movies where ANGEL premiered in January 17 2002 during its tribute to Marlene Dietrich Lubitsch and Dietrich both had high expectations for this film. In spite of Samson Raphaelson's promising screenplay the film's box office failure lead to Dietrich's termination from her home studio. Fortunately the label of Dietrich as box office poison didn't last long with her reinvention screen persona in the hit western of DESTRY RIDES AGAIN Universal 1939 opposite James Stewart.Virtually unknown andor forgotten among the film credits of either Dietrich or Lubitsch ANGEL did get some exposure through its 1990s distribution on home video through MCAUniversal. Possibly viewing ANGEL more as a drama than a comedy might help accept the film for what it is rather than what it's expected to be. 12".

Yet this was the film that caused Paramount and Marlene Dietrich to come to a parting of the ways. Marlene would not be back on the screen until she signed a new contract with Universal and made a comeback of sorts in something that would have been unthinkable for her in 1937. That film was a western but the western was Destry Rides Again.Ernest Lubitsch and Marlene Dietrich hit a double dry spell in Angel. The sum and substance of it is that up and coming young British diplomat Melvyn Douglas meets a mysterious and alluring woman at Laura Hope Crews's palace in Paris who he falls hopelessly for. But the alluring as ever Marlene is merely the very bored wife of a senior diplomat who is a member of the nobility Herbert Marshall. It also turns out that Douglas and Marshall are old army buddies.Somehow Lubitsch could not work his usual magic with Marlene. Her scenes with the two men seem to have no spark to them. In fact the ending is a bit of a shock personally I think she made the wrong choice.Where Lubitsch did well in Angel was with the supporting players. Laura Hope Crews is quite a bit different as the worldly countess than as that pillar of southern society Aunt Pittypat Hamilton from Gone With The Wind. Some of the back and forth commentary between Marshall's butler Ernest Cossart and his valet Edward Everett Horton are also quite droll. What snobs those servants can be much worse than the people who employ them.Sad to say Angel is a film with a lot of gloss but no real substance behind it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a movie set in Paris directed by Ernst Lubitsch the masterful director of such Parisian sexual innuendo comedies as Ninotchka The Love Parade The Merry Widow 1934 version One Hour with You and Design for Living. Imagine as the male lead Melvyn Douglas who was so great in Ninotchka. Imagine as the female lead one of the great European stars of the cinema a magnificent beauty like Garbo or Dietrich. Imagine that it concerns a Russian countess living in exile in Paris.But don't imagine that it's another Ninotchka. Far from it. It's Angel in which all those ingredients that two years later would go to make one of the great Hollywood comedies with Garbo and Douglas directed by Lubitsch instead made for one very dull semicomedy.Where to put the blame? The script certainly which isn't funny and never seems to know where it's going. Are we supposed to sympathize with Dietrich's character because she's abandoned by her husband or condemn her for considering infidelity? The men at Paramount who approved it and who should have spotted a bomb in the making. It is seldom funny. We seldom care about the characters. Why did Paramount keep starring Herbert Marshall in pictures? He is just not interesting. One or two scenes are mildly clever which was probably Lubitch's doing. The rest verges on stale melodrama. The end isn't convincing.Taken all together I'd say forget it. This is one Angel that never takes flight.".

Imagine as the male lead Melvyn Douglas who was so great in Ninotchka. Imagine as the female lead one of the great European stars of the cinema a magnificent beauty like Garbo or Dietrich. Imagine that it concerns a Russian countess living in exile in Paris.But don't imagine that it's another Ninotchka. Far from it. It's Angel in which all those ingredients that two years later would go to make one of the great Hollywood comedies with Garbo and Douglas directed by Lubitsch instead made for one very dull semicomedy.Where to put the blame? The script certainly which isn't funny and never seems to know where it's going.

	schema:reviewBody "Angel is an Ernst Lubitsch film with three top actors Marlene Dietrich Herbert Marshall and Melvyn Douglas. Yet despite this the story is amazingly flat and unappealing. It's not a bad film...more one that leaves you expecting so much more. After all Lubitsch is practically legendary as are his movies.When the story begins Anthony Melvyn Douglas meets Lady Barker Marlene Dietrich in Paris and arranges to meet her for dinner. During the dinner Anthony is totally smitten by her and the night seems magical. However the woman never tells him who she is and he gives her the nickname 'Angel'. When the evening is over he has no idea who she was nor how to get in touch with her.Sometime later Anthony meets an old friend Sir Barker Herbert Marshall. The evening goes fine...until Sir Barker's wife arrives and Anthony sees that it's Angel. What next? See the film.Making a romantic film that involves adultery is a major uphill battle. Adultery isn't a romantic thing and despite the Lubitsch touch it all seems a tad tawdry. Tawdrier still if you read between the lines you realize that the place Anthony and Angel met is essentially a highpriced brothel...though it's certainly NOT obvious when you watch the film. In addition to this big problem the film simply is too talky and too flat....which is so surprising. I can see clearly why this is not among Lubitsch's more famous films.".

Also true it's filled with bad theatrical ideas such as combining the heroine of the novel with Austen herself and then casting the role with an actress who can play neither one. And also true it's played less like an Austenian social comedy than like a halfbaked version of Tom Jones. All these things notwithstanding up to a point it's entertaining enough. However enough here means as always in this usage not quite enough. Halfway through the movie not seeing much I recognized on screen I turned to the novel and found one paragraph of it more involving amusing and wise than everything in the movie rolled together. But let that pass.Then came the Social Significance  as if Austen's novels were not full of social significance. Evidently the adapter disliked the nineteenth century and Austen and set out to show them up for what they were. I pretended to miss the insinuation of her father's having molested her and her sisterthere being no other interpretation to be placed on the looks exchanged between the two of them and their mother when he gives Fanny a hug. But then Fanny turns up an album of atrocity pictures showing what her almost foster father his son and his crew were really getting up to with their slaves. This exceeds allowable bounds. Such a device might be imposed on Fielding or on Dickens without betraying the author's purpose too far but not Austen. It obliterates the story or what's left of it. In the face of rapes and beatings and tortures who gives a fig whether Miss Price and her Reverend get together? Yet the comedy of manners continues galumphing along as if the scene had never happened. Having forced it in the adapter makes no changes in the narrative to accommodate it. This is filmmaking for MTV watchers i.e. patients with shortterm memory loss. Ah  the adapter might counter  but that's just the point! The characters act as if these horrors didn't exist! To which I would reply if she felt reading the novel that the squire was just the kind of man who would have done that sort of thing white European male pig that he was and that Austen owing to her famous ignorance of human nature which causes her books to continue to be read two centuries later was too much of a booby to see it whereas the adapter's own superior sensibility makes all things manifest she might at least have done Fanny the justice of having her react to the discovery as she would have given her character. The story turns on her absolute moral rectitude and her rejection of the amorality represented by the Dangerous Liaisons characters. In the face of the dark deeds of which she becomes aware her denunciation of the others becomes itself amoral and hypocritical for she has silently acquiesced in the viciousness of her class. This conclusion must be extrapolated since it is nowhere stated in the film the adapter not having troubled to stir in the muck she has tossed into the pot. But I can't help wondering if her object was to discredit Fanny as well as the monsters around herif she had so little use for the character as thatwhy did she choose to do this book?".

The end result is a mass of confusion which attempts to focus on Jane Austen's book Mansfield Park biographical sketches of Jane Austen herself as well as an historical look back at black slavery issues simultaneously and doing none justice.  As if all this wasn't bad enough Rozema couldn't even decide what time period she wanted to use for the movie.  It's not just major flaws in the script which has the various characters expressing themselves in ways which would have been much more appropriate for a character of today but also the costumes are all wrong. Many of the characters just seem to exist.  As a viewer I find little character development to make me care one way or the other about most of the cast of characters in this film.  Even the leading female and male characters in the film seem lost among the others due to a lack of contrast.  Worst of all is the most unimaginative use of narration that I can recall seeing in any film to date.  Although this was meant to serve as a transition between scenes and to move the plot along it fails miserably.  There also seems to be a large amount of indistinguishable dialogue in this film that was not intentional.  It wasn't until I watched this film with the director's comments which had the actor's dialogue in captions that I even understood what was being said in some scenes despite the fact that I had tried repeated playbacks.  They must have have some audio problems.  Music for this film was too loud in places and poorly chosen.   Speaking of director's comments  Her primary motivation for making this film according to what she said on the film's DVD version was a scene which which utilized sexually explicit and violently graphic pen and ink drawings of slaves. Huh?  For a Jane Austen film?  Yes!  Hear the comments yourself in the DVD version.".

She is a highly moral quiet smart very putupon young lady.  While Frances O'Connor is a wonderful actress she played Fanny all wrong.  She was smiling constantly having pillow fights speaking her mind.  There was no sense of period or restraint in her portrayal.  I think the writerdirector should have had more faith in the characters in the book.With so many storylines to choose from in the book I wonder why new ones were added such as the slave trade and opium use?  It is a shame that Sir Thomas didn't have the character arc seen in the book that has him appreciate Fanny more and show her greater kindness when he returns from Antigua.  In the film he is just always a big mean bully.  Jonny Lee Miller's Edmund is not nearly pious and conflicted enough.  He is meant to be joining the clergy.I am sure I would have thought it was an average film if I didn't know the original source but it was a big disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a romantic comedy this is a good film. The acting is fairly good  particularly Johnny Lee Miller who makes an excellent Edmund. But the story is not that of Jane Austen's wonderful novel. The Fanny Price of the novel is a delicate wallflower intelligent and warm but extremely timid. In the film she's feisty and strongwilled independent and almost rebellious. Fanny Price is not confident and witty she is shy and thoughtful. This new Fanny may fit modern sensibilities but I was severely disappointed by completely altering the main character the whole story seems different. I should very much like to see an adaptation of the novel that remains as faithful to the book as the BBC's excellent miniseries version of Pride and Prejudice the Colin Firth  Jennifer Ehle version or Emma with Kate Beckinsale not the Gwynneth Paltrow version. If you want a romantic movie go for it. But if you're an Austen fan you might want to stay clear.".

Even so I think we are obliged to stay true to the basic tennents of the text. Are the works of Jane Austen as open to interpretation? Maybe but I doubt it Certainly not if MANSFIELD PARK is anything to go by.MANSFIELD was always my favourite of Austen's six novels. Many modern critics while not denying its basic greatness have problems with the book. Many find FANNY PRICE unlikeable many find her judgemental and feel that her Stoic Augustan approach is hard to relate to. Standby do nothing and eventually he'll see the error of his ways and come to love you. Not very modern is it?OK so if you don't like the main character if you don't like what she has to say then what do you do? Look for other aspects of the story you can relate to. In recent years some critics have chosen to see MANSFIELD PARK in PostImperial terms as a critique of Slavery. After all the family's wealth is based on plantations in Antiga which were run by slaves. Is that what the book's about? Is it? I don't know. I think the evidence is a little slim but who am I to deny the possibility? Maybe it plays a part in the subtext of the novel.So I'm a modern scriptwriter who doesn't like the novel it's preoccupations or even Fanny Price. What do I do? I completely rewrite the story to take a possible minor subtext slavery and turn it in to the driving narrative force. I then take smart as a whippet stubborn yet passive Fanny and turn her into a ballsy version of Bridget Jones. With an attitude. I then string together a couple of scenes from the book with a few invented bridging scenes to advance the romance. Et Voila! I have a completely different story!I don't know what this film is but it isn't Mansfield Park. Enjoy it on its own terms but don't ever get the idea that your watching Austen on the screen. But jeeze. I think that if you're going to adapt a novel for the screen you ought to at least like the source material Otherwise what's the point? If you don't like the main character you shouldn't be able to completely reinvent her. Or if you do you should have the decency to be a little ashamed.".

They are usually extremely disappointing so after I had finished reading Mansfield Park and moved on to the 1999 film I wasn't expecting much. What I was expecting was for the film to follow the basic ideas that Jane Austen was trying to convey. This was not the case. From the first five minutes I felt like I must have turned on the wrong movie.William's place was taken by 'Susie' Edmund's role as Fanny's adviser and helper has become a cheesy schoolyard crush Sir Thomas is some sort of vulgar criminal and even Fanny herself isn't the modest and shy persona that she is in the novel.Besides not following the basic elements of the story the actual film is confusing. I am unsure whether the part where Fanny is seen accepting Henry Crawford's proposal was reality or merely a dream sequence. Also the focus on black slavery seems to me so out of place as to distract from the actual story at hand.We must remember that although Fanny Price may seem dull to some it is what she wasn't and what Austen doesn't make her that makes Mansfield Park so interesting.The worst part of this film that I saw was the completely ludicrous sex scene involving Crawford and Mrs Rushworth. At this point I stopped watching. I find it quite ridiculous that we are encouraged to believe that this would have happened under Sir Thomas' roof. It is believable that these sinful occurrences would be able to be screened by the circumstances in London however it is evident that Sir Thomas wouldn't have allowed these two to be in the same room together alone in his own home. This completely cheapened the film.As I didn't watch further than this point I cannot comment on the remainder of the film. I sincerely hope that it did not get any worse if it is possible that it could get worse.I wonder why so many have decided to take a Jane Austen novel to the big screen with little to no regard for the actual story. It seems more appropriate to make your own films based on your own inferior story lines and leave the name of Jane Austen out of it.I feel as though the creators of this film have completely ruined my enjoyment of Mansfield Park the book as I am forever doomed to think of this hideous film instead of one of Austen's most entertaining novels.If you have not yet watched Mansfield Park I urge you not to. Find a better version if there is one but do not waste your time with this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Although I know better than to expect a pure adaptation of a novel when Hollywood gets hold of it I was nevertheless unprepared for the horrible mangling this novel received at the hands of the screenwriter.  Having immensely enjoyed recent renderings of Sense and Sensibility Emma and various versions of Pride and Prejudice I expected to receive similar enjoyment from this film.  I had not read any reviews or advance press before watching it.  I had unfortunately just read the book itself this summer and it was fresh in my mind.  In my opinion this is the WORST rendition of a Jane Austen work I have ever seen.  Perhaps if I had never read the book I might have enjoyed it somewhat more but to me it was unbearable to see a book I thoroughly enjoyed so completely rewritten.  I am astonished at the comments of some of the reviewers here opining that Jane Austen would have approved. Poppycock!I began to feel sick early on.  To me the character of Fanny Price and other major characters bore as much resemblance to Jane Austen's heroine as Danny Devito bore to Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins. The entire invention of Fanny as a budding writer the deletion of her younger brother who was so important in the plot concerning Henry Crawford the image of Fanny as somewhat outspoken and rebellious the depiction of Fanny's aunt as an opium addict and her uncle as a brutish raping slaveowner.... The list goes on and on.  Henry and Maria being caught by Fanny in the house Fanny voluntarily kissing Henry and agreeing to marry him and then retracting. Ugh!I really detest writers who want to mold everything in the modern vein. Fanny Price was not a modern heroine but she fit her time.  There was far too much PC propaganda and feminist hogwash which you might expect in a movie about our society but is ridiculous set against Fanny's time. She was devout loyal quiet humble stubborn only in her keen perception of others' character as measured against her conviction of what was good and what was not possessing an innate strength of character which did not rely on others' perception of her and which she refused to compromise.  Jane Austen would not have approved of this new Fanny for precisely this reason her Fanny did not care about the new conventions of moral thought and permissiveness in her own society.  The movie downplayed the seriously flawed characters of Henry Crawford and his sister.  It portrayed him far too sympathetically made it appear that he truly and deeply loved Fanny and seemed to blame Fanny's nonexistent doublemindedness for his downfall.All in all this is an extremely disappointing film if one cares about what was really written in Mansfield Park.  I think Clueless as a modern version of Emma and which I also enjoyed is more true to Austen than this letdown of a movie.".

She was clever and affectionate but mildmannered sweet and cripplingly shy. In fact it's specifically stated in the book that Henry's persistence is due to Fanny's mildness and sweetness of manner which makes her seem reluctant to refuse him. Not to mention that she was NINE YEARS OLD when she first got to Mansfield. Austen was fond of Fanny  she is the only heroine to whom the authoress refers to as her own my Fanny  but she was not meant to be a representation of Austen herself. From all letters and descriptions written by her family and friends she appears to have been nearer to Elizabeth and Jane of Pride and Prejudice.I have no idea of the entertainment value of this movie as I was too paralyzed with horror at what they had done to one of the most carefullynuanced wellwritten works in the English language by turning it into a disgusting farce.

Some of the acting especially from Pinter is excellent.But the rest resembles those films made from classic novels in the 30s where no one concerned in making it had time to read the book. A quick treatment by a college student a quick script conference then off we go. Rozema has almost no idea of what the book is about but is entirely unembarrassed by her ignorance in her interview on the DVD.Austen fans don't have to wait long to discover just how far off the wavelength she is. The first contact between Sir Thomas and Fanny is a reproof for running through MP's corridors shrieking like a banshee. Lines are taken from Mary Crawford in the book and given to Fanny in the film. How's that for missing the point? One by one characters appear looking no more recognisable than if they were appearing in a literary celebrity edition of Scooby Doo.I agree with other reviewers that if the film was called something else and the characters had different names it would be impossible to trace it's origins to Austen's book which is definitely not a conventional love story about bright young things getting together having overcome a few obstacles.There's very little to choose between the morals of Rozema's characters so nothing of the catastrophic descent into the abyss is associated with the production of Lover's Vows nor do we have any glimpse of Rushworth and Crawford vandalising Sotherton. Mrs Norris is one of the most deliciously evil creations in literature  Rozema reduces her part to a few lines. Thomas Betram is a modern artist  yikes! William Price Fanny's brother and one of the key relationships in the book is missing altogether. Susan her sister has been reading too many Style magazines.Mansfield Park might have been a bit like this had it been written by Georgette Heyer or even Jackie Collins. As an Austen adaptation it is execrable. But it's so far off the mark that as something else entirely it's not all that bad. Maybe they should just change the title.".

In Austen's novel Fanny is true to herself but is a quiet fearful person who dreads change.  While this may not be an interesting focal point for today's audience the character's immobility is intentional.  Fanny represents England at a time of great uncertainty.  Internally the monarchy had been compromised by years of George III's insanity and his sons' frivolity.  Externally the Napoleonic wars were threatening Europe.  England like Fanny was searching for stability and familiarity in a changing world.  This film totally undermines its source.  If you watch this movie enjoy the costumes and the scenery.  Don't be fooled into thinking however that this production has anything to do with Jane Austen's Mansfield Park.  There ought to be a disclaimer on the box warning viewers that this is an adaptation loosely based on 'Mansfield Park'.  This version does Jane no credit.".

There are so many flaws in this version if you can call it a version that I can't name every single one. But why change the plot the characters and their personalities loose some key ones and still have the guts to call it after the novel? The outrageous sex scene and nonsense about slavery was totally unnecessary and out of place. Mansfield Park isn't one of Austen's most admired novels but it is certainly not vulgar nor did she use it as a way to show political convictions. If you really want to enjoy some good adaptations of Austen's novels I recommend Pride and Prejudice Sense and Sensibility and even Emma with its light plot and comical characters. Don't waste your time with this crap!".

I honestly don't know where to start but it is apparent that the makers of this film are unfamiliar with 1800 British decorum. The level of affection that is shown throughout the movie is completely inconsistent with how people composed themselves in that time period and would be looked at as completely scandalous for the slightest thing as kissing in public which made this adaptation completely inaccurate. The main character Fanny's temperament was completely inconsistent with her character in the book. I was completely shocked that in the movie she was so open about her affections for Edmound which was completely not the case in the book she was very demure about it until then end of the book. Main characters were omitted such as William Price. The story line was not followed in true form at all and it wasn't a simple swaying from the original it was a completely different story. They sexualized Fanny's relationship with Mary and her father which was shocking and disgusting. Words can't express how disappointed I was in this film as others have said before Ms. Jane Austen would be shocked and appalled by this adaptation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to wonder if the folks who are praising this film to the skies have ever read the book.  I am not a Jane Austen purist  if I were I could not say that the RootHinds version of Persuasion was my favorite Austen adaptation which it is.  This is Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park NOT Jane Austen's.First Rozema gives us a feisty spirited Fanny Price who tells off Aunt Norris and Sir Thomas who accepts Henry Crawford's proposal and then rejects it the next day a la JA herself with Harris BiggWither. In this MP Sir Thomas deserves to be told off. He is portrayed as a lecherous dirty old man who leers at Fanny and Mary Crawford throughout the film.We have all heard about the additions Rozema made to the film. She deals with the slavery issue in a very heavyhanded way beating us over the head with it whenever possible. Tom Bertram is not the emptyheaded fop he is in JA's book here he is just as much an abolitionist as Fanny and it is his sketchbook filled with incriminating drawings of Sir Thomas abusing the slaves in Antigua that Fanny finds. In fact Rozema's take on Tom is rather bizarre in the book his arguments with his father center around his irresponsibility and his profligacy. In the film while Sir Thomas tries to scold his son for these faults Tom takes him to task for his activities in Antigua. What I found odd was that if Tom is such an abolitionist why would he be so free and easy with money tainted by the slave trade?Rozema left out what I consider to be some very important people and scenes. William Price and the Grants are nowhere to be seen as a result there is no amber cross bought with prize money no distress over which chain to wear to the ball no one to accompany Fanny to Portsmouth. Fanny's dislike and distrust of Henry are never fully explained. We never get to see the outing to Sotherton and while we do see Maria flirting relentlessly with Henry we never see him playing one sister off against the other. Fanny's disapproval of the theatricals is never explained either. In Rozema's version it seemed as if Fanny was simply not invited to be in the play instead of being unalterably opposed to it. The scene with Fanny playing Anhalt to help Mary Crawford rehearse is also completely wrong. Mary starts caressing Fanny while Edmund watches with his eyes almost popping out of his head. So instead of Edmund giving in and joining the play in order to spare his family the embarrassment of publicity we are left with the impression that he takes on the role of Anhalt just so that he can justify having Mary run her hands all over him.Next we have the scenes at Portsmouth. Here we have Henry sending Fanny a display of fireworks and doves and then we see her accepting his proposal and sealing the bargain with some lessthanchaste kisses  in public no less! The  infamous sex scene between Maria and Henry takes place at Mansfield Park rather than in London and because Rozema has played with JA's chronology of events Fanny is already back from Portsmouth and it is she who catches them in the act. Edmund is present for the aftermath where Maria tries to defend her actions.Another thing that galled me no end is that Mary Crawford's defense of her brother's actions is done in person at Mansfield Park. She is patronizing towards all concerned including Sir Thomas who has finally stopped leering by this point. The newspaper item announcing Maria and Henry's behavior to the world is read by Fanny and the culprits' full names are used which is also not the way it happened in the book.A couple of people walked out about 13 of the way through the screening I attended and several others walked out just as the credits began.  The Wishbone versions of Pride  Prejudice and Northanger Abbey resemble the source material more than this trash does.  Shame on you Ms. Rozema shame on you!".

It's disappointing because most of the cast was great Frances O'Connor was a little iffy for me as Fanny but the Fanny in this movie bears no resemblance to the book one so it doesn't matter I guess. Why did Rozema feel the need to make pretty much the whole focus of the movie on slavery? There is a minor mention of it in the novel but she blows it out of proportion here. I know how many people don't like Fanny Price including Rozema apparently because she makes the character unrecognizable. Fanny here is a cross between Jane Austen writing and doing something Jane Austen did but book Fanny would NEVER do and Lizzy Bennet outspoken strong confident etc. Why did Rozema pick this story to film? Couldn't she have made an original movie instead? A lot of people say they like it even though it is so different from the novel but I can't do the same.

So I hope that no one will try to make another movie out of this novel. I love Pride and Prejudice as much as I love this novel but this novel is far different from PP. PP can be captured on screen without boring out the audiences but MP cannot. Nevertheless this does not make the novel any less valuable.Fanny Price may not be as attractive as Elizabeth Bennet. But if these characters existed in real life I would trust Fanny over Elizabeth any day. As witty as Elizabeth is her judgement is faulty as a result the 2nd half of the title is called prejudice. She cannot discern who Wickham is and believed in his good appearance. Fanny is just the opposite her intuition is unmistakable. Who except for Fanny knew that the handsome Henry Crawford was untrustworthy?".

There was a brief moment with Halbarad and young Aragorn that contributed little to the story but still managed to give me chills. It's the little moments like this that make this film truly remarkable.They did an excellent job of scouting locations especially for Taurdal  it really captured how I've always envisioned the Dunedain villages. The story isn't flawless but they did very well provided how little they had to go off of. You feel for every one of the characters and even though I knew how it would end I was nearly in tears. It was beautifully written and beautifully performed.In all I definitely recommend this film. It represents everything that I love about fan films. It's loyal to the original material and captures the feel of Middleearth but it's also a beautiful story in its own right.

There are many little details and moments that Tolkien fans will love and made my heart soar once or twice. It's so nice to see that attention to the detail of Middleearth's history. It is brilliant for the small budget that was available to the filmmakers and it dovetails quite nicely with the Jackson movies. I must say that I enjoyed it even more than The Hunt for Gollum which was also very good. This production had the benefit of not using characters established in the Jackson films which makes everything much more believable in that universe. And it was much better than most of the drivel produced for television. Kudos to all involved in it! A real labor of love and a remarkable effort.".

Sauron had begun to rally the orcs to conduct raids looking for the Ring. Aragorn had not yet been born. Arathorn his father had not yet wed but the small band of human settlers trying to stay ahead of orc raiders were under the protection of the rangers led by him a mighty warrior and expert leader.So begins this story marvelously portrayed in Born of Hope. For a movie made entirely with private funding it is truly extraordinary. There is little I can add to the excellent reviews posted by others. I have seen other fantasy movies made with low budgets from productions in Czech Republic Italy and other places with more buying power I must add that do not portray this much care and beauty in a film of such a complex nature. I was surprised to see how they made it even look expensive a la Lord of the Rings which added to the overall enjoyment of the same.Of course one cannot expect any impressive special effects or big armies or fancy castles or architecture. The battle featured with the troll wasn't too gripping or exciting but perhaps that was the best to be had so one cannot really find fault with that. Arathorn was an impressive fighter! I could not help notice how they carefully prepared those battle sequences. I think Peter Jackson would be proud and with good reason.Despite its short duration the movie feels much longer and every minute was worth it. So get dressed invite your sweetheart or friend drive to the theatre and get some popcorn. Be prepared to relive Lord of the Rings all over again only this time preFellowship of the Ring!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd heard of this film but delayed getting round to watching it . Don't get me wrong I was totally blown away by Jackson's LOTR trilogy when they came out  especially when I wasn't expecting much more than rather average entertainment but we are talking about a film trilogy that came out ten years ago and in the mean time Jackson lost his magic touch . Let's be honest whatever the technical merits of THE HOBBIT it's a cynical marketing franchise that doesn't have to be a trilogy and when watching last year's release I was constantly reminded of how the plot was composed of characters walking along Middle Earth for ten minutes  getting captured  escaping  walking along Middle Earth for ten minutes  getting captured  escaping  walking along ... and you're left with the feeling you're merely watching out takes from the first trilogy and one wonders if this cynicism might actually damage the reputation of the original series . If Jackson can't capture the magic of the first trilogy then what hope for a bunch of enthusiastic amateurs ? I'll give these enthusiastic amateurs great credit . This is a definite labour of love and from the outset the production team capture the look  the feel and most importantly of all the breath taking beauty of the series from 20012003  so much so that I had to constantly remind myself this wasn't produced by New Line Cinema with Jackson at the helm such was the authenticity of the costumes  make ups and perhaps most of all the music which wasn't by Howard Shore . What I also liked was the distinct lack of CGI . Okay there is a scene with a CGI monster which isn't too impressive but at least the Orcs are extras in make up . Compare this with the constant use of it in THE HOBBIT where the audience have to endure umpteen set pieces of CGI sequences that look like they're taken from a not very good video game . Jackson might learn a lesson here that big massive spectacle doesn't equal good cinema especially if the sequence is created on computer software I've got to be honest and say I've never read Tolkein apart from the first chapter of The Two Towers  I think Jackson improved upon The Departure Of Boromir  and really couldn't care less about continuity and the history of Middle Earth . Likewise I have no interest in how BORN OF HOPE fits in to the continuity of the Tolkein universe but the story is lacking somewhat and is a rather simplistic tale of how a village in Midddle Earth defends itself against Orc incursions . That said quest stories as seen in the original Ring trilogy aren't known for their multilayered complex storytelling but THE HOBBIT hardly has a story requiring one three hour film never mind a three film trilogy . I also noticed the acting here is a little bit  off  compared to that seen in LOTR to be honest the acting of the original franchise was one of the best things about it and certainly Oscar worthy from the entire ensemble cast In all this is a very impressive film made by people who care about their subject . It might be because I was expecting a sad bunch of anoraks seen in the infamous  lightening strike  youtube video that my low expectations for this amateur film exceeded what I expected by a long shot . It's certainly not perfect but you have to ask yourself if a bunch of non professional film makers can make something of this quality why is Peter Jackson and his colleagues with their multi million budgets aren't capable of making something much better ?".

As a long time Tolkien fan 10 years and well versed in all of his works I want to say that both movies were a joy for me to watch.The care and dedication by which they were made is visible and I terribly love how the movies succeed in maintaining the atmosphere of Middle Earth the LOTR trilogy gave us in the first place.Concerning Born of Hope Was there place for improvements? There always is no matter which franchise we're talking about but director Kate Madison and her team made a wonderful job with the limited resources they had. The characters are well casted and well written and I enjoyed the original characters immensely mainly Elgarain whom I consider canon and is now one of my favorite Tolkien characters alongside Beleg Cuthalion Erendis Luthien or Elendil let's say.I would have liked more character development scenes the little things that charm the audience towards liking a character... like Elgarain and Gilraen interacting more or Evonyn having a bigger role and a few more lines or a quiet family scene with little Aragorn the sons of Elrond and Gilraen and Arathorn. But I am perfectly happy with the movie as it is.I've seen complaints about the camera work or the decors that I would like to completely dismiss. Last time I checked this is not a Hollywood funded movie but one made by fans for fans. The small mistakes are easy to pass over and for someone who truly loves Tolkien's work and wants to see the two movies with an open mind the way to do this is easy.My opinion? Give it a chance you won't regret it. Were they available to buy on solid DVD I would do it in a heartbeat. Also what wouldn't I give for a Wetastatue of Arathorn or Elgarain in the likeliness of the LOTR ones I have downloaded the soundtracks of both movies from the site of the team and I listen to them as often as I listen to the Howard Shore ones. The two movies as a whole are the perfect addin to the original trilogy. Why the movie the fans always needed? Because there is as much potential for fanwork as both PJ trilogies give us.".

Also what wouldn't I give for a Wetastatue of Arathorn or Elgarain in the likeliness of the LOTR ones I have downloaded the soundtracks of both movies from the site of the team and I listen to them as often as I listen to the Howard Shore ones. The two movies as a whole are the perfect addin to the original trilogy. Why the movie the fans always needed? Because there is as much potential for fanwork as both PJ trilogies give us.";

Sean Connery plays a Saudi aristocrat who as the envoy of his country has the audacity to propose an integration of Isreal and that country's economical and scientific knowhow into the region  signing herewith his death penalty.I find it notable that this movie was released three years before the Camp David agreements five years before Egyptian president Anwar asSadat's assassination. One could even say it was prophetic. It must also be noted and I give the movie credit for this that the motives of all protagonists not least the deadly female are left pretty much in the dark. The victims of the mentioned murders seem to be anything but selfless idealists. Connery's character appears to be primarily a gambler and a pleasureseeker. It is insinuated that underneath all what happens and can be seen there lies a highly complex structure of power relations and interdependencies like a fungus that cannot be overlooked in its whole by any of the protagonists.

	schema:headline " Pedestrian thriller which has a good plot but doesn't quite go anywhere with it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sean Connery has to be admired for refusing to allow his box office reputation to dictate the film roles that he has chosen over the years. Many stars accept the scripts that they believe will result in financially successful films. While Connery has made more than his fair share of box office hits he has also been in quite a few films that did not do huge business during their cinematic run. Connery's attitude has always been that he chooses roles that INTEREST him perhaps roles that he finds challenging as an actor or roles that require a certain amount of emotional depth and research. In The Next Man a 1976 thriller from director Richard C. Sarafian Connery assumes the unlikely but effective role of a Saudi Arabian statesman with a revolutionary political idea that places his life in grave danger. The film itself is nothing special being a pedestrianpaced political thriller with a doubleedged romantic subplot but what is fascinating is watching big Sean playing this visionary idealist with such aplomb. It is a shame that the actor and the character were not given a more interesting film in which to appear!Following three assassinations of Middle Eastern politicians Khalil Abdul Muhsen Sean Connery is appointed by the Saudi Arabian king as the country's ambassador to the United Nations. Muhsen soon has many an Arab heart skipping a beat as he makes a stirring speech to the UN assembly outlining his revolutionary plan to forge a cooperative agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel in the production of petroleum. Formerly bitter enemies Muhsen envisages that the Saudis and the Israelis will unite and create an oilproducing alliance capable of replacing OPEC. His optimistic ideas are met with great opposition from some quarters of the Arab community and it is not long before Muhsen's life is in jeopardy. Little does he realise that a gorgeous female assassin has been placed on his trail with instructions to seduce then eliminate him. The assassin Nicole Scott Cornelia Sharpe captures the heart of the Arabian statesman and allows him to romance her as she waits for the order to erase him. But gradually she seems to fall in love with her target. when the time comes will she follow her professional orders or her heart? Little suspense is generated regarding the dilemma facing Sharpe's character. Although Muhsen is perfectly likable especially as portrayed by Connery not enough is made of the relationship between politician and assassin to generate the necessary sympathies. In the closing scenes when Sharpe may or may not be about to kill her man there is no particular level of interest or excitement. The film is quite a globetrotting affair with various exotic locales nicely lensed by the everreliable Michael Chapman. The script worked on by four collaborators jumps around somewhat messily especially in the early stages but Richard C. Sarafian manages to keep the plot just about understandable.

	onyx:emotionText "Sean Connery has to be admired for refusing to allow his box office reputation to dictate the film roles that he has chosen over the years. Many stars accept the scripts that they believe will result in financially successful films. While Connery has made more than his fair share of box office hits he has also been in quite a few films that did not do huge business during their cinematic run. Connery's attitude has always been that he chooses roles that INTEREST him perhaps roles that he finds challenging as an actor or roles that require a certain amount of emotional depth and research. In The Next Man a 1976 thriller from director Richard C. Sarafian Connery assumes the unlikely but effective role of a Saudi Arabian statesman with a revolutionary political idea that places his life in grave danger. The film itself is nothing special being a pedestrianpaced political thriller with a doubleedged romantic subplot but what is fascinating is watching big Sean playing this visionary idealist with such aplomb. It is a shame that the actor and the character were not given a more interesting film in which to appear!Following three assassinations of Middle Eastern politicians Khalil Abdul Muhsen Sean Connery is appointed by the Saudi Arabian king as the country's ambassador to the United Nations. Muhsen soon has many an Arab heart skipping a beat as he makes a stirring speech to the UN assembly outlining his revolutionary plan to forge a cooperative agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel in the production of petroleum. Formerly bitter enemies Muhsen envisages that the Saudis and the Israelis will unite and create an oilproducing alliance capable of replacing OPEC. His optimistic ideas are met with great opposition from some quarters of the Arab community and it is not long before Muhsen's life is in jeopardy. Little does he realise that a gorgeous female assassin has been placed on his trail with instructions to seduce then eliminate him. The assassin Nicole Scott Cornelia Sharpe captures the heart of the Arabian statesman and allows him to romance her as she waits for the order to erase him. But gradually she seems to fall in love with her target. when the time comes will she follow her professional orders or her heart? Little suspense is generated regarding the dilemma facing Sharpe's character. Although Muhsen is perfectly likable especially as portrayed by Connery not enough is made of the relationship between politician and assassin to generate the necessary sympathies. In the closing scenes when Sharpe may or may not be about to kill her man there is no particular level of interest or excitement. The film is quite a globetrotting affair with various exotic locales nicely lensed by the everreliable Michael Chapman. The script worked on by four collaborators jumps around somewhat messily especially in the early stages but Richard C. Sarafian manages to keep the plot just about understandable. However it is important to note that the film exists in a couple of severely edited versions known as Double Hit and The Arab Conspiracy both of which are so clumsily shortened that they are all but impossible to follow. If you are planning on watching this film at all at least pay it the service of seeing the full length version which while not without its flaws is at least halfdecent.";

She takes on the job methodically winning his confidence with offhanded ease and beginning her standard seduction.But Connery is funny charismatic and a visionary exuding his trademark sex appeal so effortlessly that the film becomes a fullfledged love story with montages so blatantly romantic that they might have been 'lifted' from LOVE STORY itself watch for an iceskating sequence Connery skates VERY well!The film climaxes as Connery delivers an decisive speech at the U.N. about the need for brotherhood between peoples a scene so powerful that you wonder why it is in THIS film...then she poisons him whispering about his beautiful eyes as he dies leaving audiences feeling totally flattened.Even a twist at the end of the film promising justice would be served couldn't make up for the letdown of Connery's death even if it should have been expected.The film bombed and was quickly pulled from theaters. Fortunately Sean Connery's next film A BRIDGE TOO FAR about WWII's Operation MarketGarden would offer one of his best performances and THE NEXT MAN misfire would soon be forgotten. The same could not be said for Cornelia Sharpe however her career quickly evaporated with only a handful of roles in the nearly thirty years since THE NEXT MAN was released. This is one Connery film you MAY want to skip!".

As a coldblooded assassin she was only truly effective in the early part of the film strangling Adolfo Celi best known as 'Emilio Largo' in THUNDERBALL with a plastic bag in a rather distasteful sequence.Her next 'assignment' would be Arab diplomat Khalil AbdulMuhsen Connery whose peace overtures towards Israel were alarming radical Arab leaders. She takes on the job methodically winning his confidence with offhanded ease and beginning her standard seduction.But Connery is funny charismatic and a visionary exuding his trademark sex appeal so effortlessly that the film becomes a fullfledged love story with montages so blatantly romantic that they might have been 'lifted' from LOVE STORY itself watch for an iceskating sequence Connery skates VERY well!The film climaxes as Connery delivers an decisive speech at the U.N. about the need for brotherhood between peoples a scene so powerful that you wonder why it is in THIS film...then she poisons him whispering about his beautiful eyes as he dies leaving audiences feeling totally flattened.Even a twist at the end of the film promising justice would be served couldn't make up for the letdown of Connery's death even if it should have been expected.The film bombed and was quickly pulled from theaters. Fortunately Sean Connery's next film A BRIDGE TOO FAR about WWII's Operation MarketGarden would offer one of his best performances and THE NEXT MAN misfire would soon be forgotten. The same could not be said for Cornelia Sharpe however her career quickly evaporated with only a handful of roles in the nearly thirty years since THE NEXT MAN was released. This is one Connery film you MAY want to skip!";

To ensure this a top female assassin Sharpe is hired to liquidate Connery. However such is the clunky nature of the plot in one scene she actually saves his life when she has ample opportunity to kill him.

Honestly I love you Beth Cooper is not going to be one of those high school movie classics by no mean but I didn't feel like my time was wasted watching it. As predictable and silly as it was I still think this was a decent enough movie that got a few good laughs. I mean who hasn't wanted to go all out on their high school class and just mock them on the last day of school? Not to mention get the hottie of their dreams in the same night that has them just living life to it's fullest. I think that over all the film worked there were certain things that were flawed in the movie like the script could have used a few touch up's here and there and the cast did seem a little off. Paul Rust it's kind of disturbing that he not only looks but is 28 years old and then you have Hayden Panettiere who looks 12 years old it was a little well you get the idea. But still I think I love you Beth Cooper had it's moments enough to make you just sit back and forget reality for 95 minutes.When a geeky highschool valedictorian throws caution to the wind by expressing his love for a popular cheerleader during his graduation speech life finally starts to get interfering for Denis Cooverman who may have brains to spare it's guts that he lacks or at least he did until today. Stepping up to the podium to deliver an inspirational speech to his graduating class Denis decides that the time has finally come to call out his classmates on their peccadilloes and declare his love for the prettiest girl in school Beth Cooper. Much to Denis' surprise Beth responds by accepting an invitation to a party at his house later that day. But Beth's meat head boyfriend Kevin is nonetoopleased that his high school prize is mingling with the biggest dweeb in school and when Kevin shows up at his house and tears the place apart in a fit of rage Denis his best friend Rich Beth and her friends Cammy and Treece all pile into Beth's car and flee for their lives. For four long years Denis sat silently behind Beth in class pining for a way to make his love known. Now over the course of one long night Denis will finally get to know the girl of his dreams better than he ever thought possible. If he manages to survive until morning it's sure to be the story of a lifetime.There were times that I absolutely laughed out loud like when Beth's psycho boyfriend kept going after Denis and just beating the heck out of him each time. Also seeing how Denis was reacting to all of Beth's flaws as a law breaking crazy party girl that he never imagined only the sick fantasy as he has her picture blown up and taped over his bed. I think just the cast the script and the characters needed work in order for this to be a great movie and that's why everyone is freaking out and saying how this is the most horrendous movie ever either that or they're taking it too seriously. I think if you just let go and have a good time you'll get a few laughs out of this movie it's all in good fun and sometimes we need those silly high school flicks to either fantasize or bring us back to the good old days where getting a pimple at prom seems to be your scariest problem in the world. I love you Beth Cooper is worth the watch but more so wait for the rental vs. theater it's just an average teen comedy.610".

This is more Three O'Clock High than Ferris Bueller's Day Off which is not necessarily a bad thing depending on your taste. The humor here is broad and unsophisticated for the most part but fits with the brisk pacing and sunny tone of the film. This movie invites you to have a good time along with the cast. It throws you in the middle of a heightened realityunlikely scenario most geeks do not suddenly grow a pair and profess their love for the hottest girl in school during their valedictorian speech and beckons you to simply enjoy the ride. While the films of John Hughes endeavor to depict a realistic panoramic view into the teenage mind taking stereotypes and turning them inside out this film and its grandaddy Three O'Clock High do not carry such aspirations. They are fantasy pure and true and are all about having a good time. If the characters are two dimensional so what? If the plot is threadbare so what? Character development and story arc are not reasons to see a movie like I Love You Beth Cooper. This is just a classic homespun yarn taking place in Anywhere USA about a geek who outsmarts a bully and gets the girl. If you expected more you're going to be disappointed. This is the kind of movie that could work just as well as a cartoon. It's a zippy predictable ride from point A to point B but the journey is not lacking in entertainment value. If you like me are a fan of Three O'Clock High and on manyaday would watch it over Bueller then you're in for a treat because this is practically a remake albeit with the addition of a love interest.".

It had some heart to it and it wasn't just a bunch of teen comedies with a bunch of nudity and sex. I loved the fact that Hayden Panettiere was the main role and how she was the fantasy girl that every guy dreams of being with but still a downtoEarth girl.There's tons of jokes that aren't idiotic. There's a lot of fun and changing of scenes in this movie and a lot of romantic moments as well. I think the movie would be amazing if it had some sort of moral or real ending. I'll let you figure out what I mean by that. But I don't think the ending is satisfying.It's an entertaining film and if you're in the dawn of graduating or have just you'll probably love it. If you're a couple years shy of graduating you may not relate as much. I think I liked it even more because I graduated recently.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recycle is generally a good word one with positive and favorable connotations. But not in the world of movies. I Love You Beth Cooper is one of those films that horrendously overuses the ideas and not even the better ones of previous entries in the teen comedy genre resulting in an exercise in repetition and failed mimicry. Awkwardly personal advice from a father figure aggressive small animals nude scenes without any real nudity and the alltoofamiliar plot line of the bashful introvert chasing after the most popular girl in school are just a few of the rehashed concepts found throughout the picture. There are really only two reasons the film gets a score of two  and both belong to Hayden Panattierre.During the graduation ceremony at Buffalo Glenn High School bumbling sociallychallenged valedictorian Denis Cooverman Paul Rust professes his love for popular head cheerleader Beth Cooper Hayden Panattiere as well as insulting his fellow classmates and embarrassing his best friend Rich Jack Carpenter. While the illconceived words toward his peers subsequently cause trouble his honest confession appears to strike a chord with the idolized teen beauty. Much to Denis' surprise Beth shows up at his house and a wild night of raucous adventure ensues  one filled with incessant partying reckless driving and Beth's maniacally jealous military boyfriend.It's mildly amusing when the film starts with a rousing rendition of a song entitled Forget Me at a high school graduation. Following is a foodforthought speech comprised of awkward prattling that struggles painfully for even the faintest hope of a smirk. But it doesn't get as much as a smile. As each second ticks away the jokes get more stale the slapstick more pathetic and the plot more unbelievable. It's not that the story is hard to imagine  but it is difficult to understand why the cast and crew of I Love You Beth Cooper ever thought this unimaginably pointless hopelessly generic mess could pass as entertainment.It's very tame excruciatingly PG13 and terribly immature  which means teens won't see it and neither will adults. Denis discusses with his father that the teenage comingofage subject is not a new idea if only director Chris Columbus had taken that advice and stayed away from Larry Doyle's vastly unoriginal novel. The presentation is bland the dialogue is weak and not a single memorable or creative concept is introduced during the entire film. It's as amateurish as the socially inept geeks lumpishly trying to court prom queens. Quite obviously an excuse to put Hayden Panettiere in a movie the sheer lack of humor is the biggest disappointment while the constant references to other films by Rich is an embarrassment to decent movies everywhere. Even the most pitiful have a worthwhile minute but aside from being the first film in which Hayden bares a partial breast I Love You Beth Cooper has not a single satisfying scene. When the film culminates in an allguy wet towel fight Beth Cooper herself sums it up best Who said it's supposed to be fun?  The Massie Twins".

Director Chris Colombus makes it seem like you're supposed to laugh at this kid when it's actually extremely depressing.

	schema:reviewBody "Thumb through a video store catalog and there are a dime a dozen of many teen comedies out there that you'll be hard pressed to find something that either didn't deal with hard partying road trips one crazy night of postgraduation party selfdiscovery friendship and the likes. In fact I Love You Beth Cooper has almost all those clich moments filled with stereotypical characters but under the direction of Chris Columbus this story by Larry Doyle actually came across in quite enjoyable terms thanks to what I thought made the movie  a line that was uttered upon stark realization and the fear as expressed by the titular character which made it quite distinct and standing out amongst the competition.But first the crazy premise that became the catalyst of everything laid out in the film. Imagine if you're nursing a huge crush on the school flower and have absolutely no guts to go introduce yourself to her. On what's effectively the last day of school as valedictorian you seize the opportunity to express your feelings toward her as suggested by your best friend lest you allow not doing so become the largest regret of your life. You buy the idea and declare your love yes even if you have no iota of that person's character at all to her in front of the entire school and witnessed by teachers peers and parents while at the same time insulting your enemies. So on one hand you crafted some mindshare into the object of your desire and on the other you've made a slew of enemies ever ready to bay for your blood.So it becomes one crazy night for Denis Cooverman Paul Rust and his best friend Rich Jack Carpenter who has to battle his school reputation of being gay while getting acquainted with Beth Hayden Panettiere and her posse Cammy Lauren London and Treece Lauren Storm when they turn up for his unhappening graduation party before proceeding to show him and Rich what could possibly be the wildest night of their lives especially for the nerds. It might seem like the usual revenge of the nerds styled comedy with its set pieces but it is not about getting the girl and riding into the sunset or about getting laid as most teen comedies seem to be obsessed with these days. In fact it's more about surviving through the night given the determined pursuit of a psychotic buffed up boyfriend Shawn Roberts high on drugs while getting to know one another.While Larry Doyle had fueled the story with plenty of stereotypes such as the rich proud bitch the lead cheerleader who's all sugar and spice the militaryjock boyfriend of hers the nerds the bimbo posse etc what he managed to do as the film progressed is to smash those stereotypes away well most of them anyway. What was ace in the film were the key characters who you'd probably identify with amongst yourself or your peers. Paul Rust brought out the everyday average brainy teenager without being too whiny or irritate the heck out of you and you'd find yourself rooting for him despite the many losertype situations his Denis got himself into. Panettiere would be familiar to fans of TV series Heroes and her cheerleader is sans powers except that her Beth drives her car like a maniac and managed to stay alive at such throwaway recklessness. And the character which I thought was the icing on the cake was Jack Carpenter's Rich as the movie buff spouting and enacting countless of movie dialogue and references while reliving a classic movie moment from Robin Hood.But all those aside in a story that unravelled itself in one night. Two aspects of the film made it a winner for me. The first was when Denis uttered You're not Beth Cooper. That hit like a sledgehammer because it represented so succinctly the kind of affection that Denis had for his crush  based on a very superficial exterior without any inkling of who the person exactly is which of course sets up plenty of pitfalls as that exterior got stripped away every moment he spent those crazy times with her. That perfect being sprung from his unilateral imagination is far very far from the real thing.The second is when Beth expressed her fear of the unknown which is something that really brought out the sincerity of the character. Her shenanigans for the entire night got addressed and did allow Beth to be a tragic character of sorts knowing her place in this materialistic pragmatic world where her talent or lack thereof sent shivers down her spine knowing that her crazycool persona could no longer hold water once outside the confines of the high school community.These are precisely the moments that sold and I was indeed surprised since what I was in for was one of those mediocre run off the mill teen movies. Larry Doyle's story had a lot more undercurrents going for it than many would have liked to believe and Chris Columbus through a nofrills style had delivered just that allowing one to find balance in being entertained as well as having some takeaways for further mulling over.".

	schema:reviewBody "To confess I normally would not go and see a film like 'I love you Beth Cooper' but given the choice between Larry David's 'Whatever Works' 'The Taking of Pelham 1 23 or 'Cooper' I chose the latter on a recent Jet Blue flight. While not as juvenile as 'Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian' or unimaginative like the recent 'Get Smart' retread 'Cooper' wins hands down as perhaps the least charming comedy in the last decade.'Cooper' begins as we're introduced to the film's protagonist Denis Cooverman who as the high school valedictorian is called upon to present the valedictory speech to his fellow graduates and friends and family at the high school commencement. Cooverman manages to insult most of the student body including his best friend who he accuses of being gay as well as admitting that he is a complete loser. He also pathetically expresses his obsession with the film's love interest Beth Cooper a sexy blonde whose I.Q. is probably close to Paris Hilton.The story has nothing to do with Cooverman getting out into the world after high school but rather follows his misadventures along with his best friend Jack T. Carpenter who has a penchant for quoting favorite movie lines in the hours after their graduation. Surprisingly Beth and her two buddies show up at Denis's parents' house after he invites them to a 'party' where he and Jack are the two lone hosts. Beth is trying to get away from her cokedup boyfriend Kevin who apparently is a member of the Armed Forces.Denis and Jack do everything they can to convince the girls that they are complete losers and one keeps wondering when they are going to turn things around. Denis loses his first attempt to prove he isn't a wuss when resident psychopath Kevin trashes his parents' home and almost decapitates the valedictorian with a sword. Kevin by the way appears to be a crude unfunny combination of a 'roid induced military brat and frat boy gone wild. There is little character development for any of these nonentities especially Kevin who attempts to beat Denis up at every turn since he is basically your classic stalker who cannot stand the thought of anyone hanging out with his beautiful girlfriend.Our hapless nerds flee Kevin and his thugs in a car driven by Beth and the action turns to some lame escapades in the woods including Denis and Beth being chased by a raccoon and Beth ramming Denis' parents' car while his parents are in the middle of making love inside the vehicle. At one point Jack points a rifle at Beth's friends and we wonder if we're about to witness the inappropriate spectacle of someone getting shot in the middle of a film that's supposed to be a comedy.After Jack somehow fends off Kevin and company by hitting them in the testicles with a wet towel the boys somehow convince Beth and her friends that they're not the complete losers the girls at first perceived them to be. Jack manages to bed Beth's friends to prove he's not gay but the lame joke is that the best he could accomplish was a premature ejaculation. Denis gets 'serious' with Beth at dockside blurting out that he no longer perceives her as a bimbo but rather a 'real person'. Beth of course falls for the crap and plants a sensual kiss on Denis' lips. Somehow the film's scenarists tout this as a big victory for their nerdy protagonist who is quite content to go no further with the sexy Beth. Speaking of Beth she loses points for driving drunk all over town but the eyes of the creators of 'Cooper' the Paris Hilton wannabe is beyond reproach.There's nothing wrong with writing a comedy about a teenagerprotagonist who is socially awkward. But when that protagonist exhibits the same unpleasant traits such as acting as a stalker which are attributed to the film's antagonist little entertainment can ensue.For all those you disliked this film as intensely as I did take heart that according to Boxofficemojo.com 'I love you Beth Cooper' had a production cost of 18 million and a total worldwide gross of 15 million. For once the filmgoing public trusted their good instincts!".

I had to leave when it was certain that all the characters were going to stay in their very simple formats. The main character is awkward his friend is badly presented as closeted gay the main girl is sweet and a little crazy her friend is a slut and the other one had not done anything by the time I left.

We arrived anticipating a few censor ships on the more graphic scenes but over all a faithful rendition we could not have been more wrong.We were HIGHLY disappointed in the movie I Love You Beth Cooper. It was pretty much nothing like the book only the character names were the same and the same basic plot. They cut out all the best scenes The end of the book when they're all at the cabin and Rich puts on the bear skin rug and holds the gun the part when Dennis and Kevin fight on the boat in the lake and Dennis almost kills Kevin and the part when the police show up. Also Hayden Panettiere blew chunks as Beth Cooper and played her totally wrong. However Paul Rust and Jack Carpenter were spot on they saved the movie. Some scenes were exactly how i pictured them like when they crash into the parents' car or when Greg Saloga makes amends with Dennis. All in all I'd say if you read the book you'll be sorely disappointed in this movie and if you didn't read it or you have an affinity for Hayden Panettiere you might enjoy it.".

That gets in the way of the main storyline. Rather than it being an incredibly fun or funny night it's painful to watch this trainwreck. Normally I like Hayden but this film is not normal...it's undefinable. I didn't buy him seeing the real girl beneath the Beth Cooper popular girl facade. How can he know her like that?

Much to his surprise Beth shows up at his door that very night and decides to show him the best night of his life...That was the plot of the story. I was very surprised at the things Hayden did on screen as Beth Cooper. I mean she acts so mature in all her interviews  is a good role model for so many young girls. Why did she do what she did in the movie. I mean the nude scene  some cussing. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie. She looked very young to be a valedictorian  the nerd Denis Cooverman frankly looked like he was 30  he is 30  it was very uncomfortable seeing him with her on screen. I know she's not a schoolgirl but she sure looks like it.All those things aside this is a very fun movie. This is not going to be one of those high school film classics by any mean but I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching this. The ending scene with Beth  Dennis on the lake  she's expressing her fear of the unknown in front of her was very moving. Who wouldn't feel like that at least slightly when they are as popular as Beth Cooper was in high school.I love Hayden Panettiere in the TV series HEROES  I liked her performance here. They should have put a younger actor with her to play Denis.710".

I could quibble about a lot of the little things I could for example point out that a big opportunity was missed if the heroine's parents were fans of heavy metal to name her ALICE Cooper instead of Beth especially since School's Out features so prominently on the soundtrack though of course a movie called I LOVE YOU ALICE COOPER would have thrown people off as to what it was really about.That aside what angered me most were the stereotypes especially the nerd ones. I've always hated the very word nerd it's an ugly slur and even sounds ugly and if you ask me it should be considered the other nword. But popular culture continues to condescend to intelligent artistic andor shy people trying to weasel their way out of accusations of nerdbashing with C'mon we're just joking or We're laughing WITH you not at you. Bull. They are most definitely laughing AT us.Actually just about every teen character  and some of the adults too  is a stereotype. There ARE a few bright points it's refreshing for once to see a black character in a movie who's not tough or foulmouthed or talks like Jar Jar Binks. And Beth Cooper herself is a LITTLE more developed as a character...but for a farce like this one that's not saying much.I can't understand why movies like this one are still being made in the 21st century. I thought this was a generation that prided itself on being pardon my cynicism really smug and smartalecky and too cool for the old Hollywood shtick. Well movies like BETH COOPER are not cool at all. And I don't want to hear the we'recoolbecausewe'redoingitironically excuse because that carries no credibility for me.Really the only reason to subject oneself to this movie is for the generous closeup shot it offers of Hayden Panettiere's cute pornstar panties. So I'll give this film a 2 for the panties and also because Panettiere as a whole is a joy to look at. But believe me there is absolutely nothing else saving I LOVE YOU BETH COOPER from a 1 rating from me.".

As a Hughes fan who knows that Chris Columbus worked with John Hughes before this hurts even more. The physical comedy with the Army boyfriend and his buddies and the soulsearching introspective dialogue between Beth and Denis might have worked if this were '85 and Hughes was pinning the script but Larry Doyle is no John Hughes and this certainly isn't 1985. If anything I'm amazed that movies like this are greenlit. If you want teen humor mixed with some surprising character development and intelligent dialogue just rent or buy Sixteen Candles Breakfast Club or Weird Science.

	schema:reviewBody "I Love You Beth Cooper opened with an extremely awkward scene Denis Paul Rust confessing his love for Beth Cooper Hayden Panettiere during his valedictorian speech at his High School graduation. It was so awkward. I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed for him it made me cringe. I didn't want to look but I just couldn't look away. The awkwardness was lightened with a few very funny remarks made during the speech. Luckily this was the only awkward humor. I don't think I would be able to handle a whole lot of that.My favorite character was Rich Munsch played by newcomer Jack Carpenter. He was very funny with his random homosexual comments then insisting he is not gay. Naturally I loved his movie references throughout the film.I Love You Beth Cooper was very stupid but so very amusing. There were countless moments when I laughed out loud. There were hilarious moments such as a towel battle scene a fight scene with Carpenter jumping out a window as means of escape and a scene involving a terrifying raccoon.Though it was stupid and funny there were a lot of serious moments. The two main characters played by Rust and Panettiere did a lot of talking with their eyes. They understood personal and profound moments the other was going through. Oddly enough they had a great connection.Though the acting wasn't fantastic it wasn't a downfall for the film.I am absolutely shocked to say this but I thoroughly enjoyed watching I Love You Beth Cooper. I would recommend it for a good laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "By my recollection this is only the second high school wide release film of the year the other being the equally unoriginal 17 Again. Yet despite it not being worn thin this year the high school genre needs major help. It's a time of life that is of significance to everyone. Obviously for some it is much more prominent than for some others. But at that time the world seems magnified as never before. Why has no film been able to even come close to capturing that sentiment? Of course there are some that are brilliant The Last Picture Show Dead Poet's Society than there's ones that don't really have all that much to do with high school like Rushmore Boyz N' the Hood and oldies like Rebel Without A Cause and a huge collection from the 1980's with Say Anything being the strongest of the bunch but over the course of cinematic history this genre more than any other has been completely butchered. The last ten years has been the worst. The main problem is that every high school film has it in their head that there is this hierarchy that simply does not exist. I don't know if it ever did but in my life and my frequent conversations with others on the topic it has been confirmed that it doesn't. Perhaps in the 1980's there was such division. There were these groups of nerds jocks losers weirdos and well the it girls. Maybe these groups collided in the ways we still see in films you know swirlies and locking freshman in lockers and wedgies too. Jocks are always dumb. Always. Nerds are always picked on and they never ever get the girl. Ask Duckie. It girls are vicious hate everyone especially their parents and their best friend they usually have a really bad life and that's why they hate everyone and all they want is someone to listen to them. Losers are stupid too like jocks. Pretty much you're either stupid or a nerd getting your ass kicked. Thing is high school is nothing like that. Valedictorians are not always nerds. They don't even always give speeches at graduation commencement  I know what about that mandatory valedictorian speech scene. Jocks can be smart. Yes a human can exist that is both athletic and academic. I've seen it myself. I know they might have to reinvent the whole formula. Nerds sometimes drink alcohol other than on the last day of high school. Yeah I know I don't know how that required nerdy kid cutting loose scene is going to happen then either. Sure they're are groups in high school. Some kids you're friends with and others you're not. Sure some kids are smart and some are good at sports but it seldomly if ever defines their entire being. Thing is adolescents are not onedimensional people that resemble how they're represented in the twenty year formula that Hollywood has been using subbing in new role players as they age. The fact that nothing that happens in I Love You Beth Cooper would ever happen in real life isn't that big of a deal if not for the fact that a good movie about the topic deserves to be made. One not at a boarding school one that doesn't involve drug addiction one that doesn't involve being in a gang  one that is just a simple story of what it is really like at that moment when life is changing for everyone you know. That decisions that you're too young to be making end up dictating the years of your life that you haven't really even thought out. Where's that film? It could still be funny. It could still have a beautiful actress on the poster. It would certainly make more money that I Love You Beth Cooper will. That film doesn't exist during any moment of Beth Cooper. Nor does a plotline you haven't seen a character you ever met in real life nor one you haven't met in film an original line of dialogue or anything than justifies its existence as cinema.E  A Reel Perspective".

Unlike the book though this film never really captures the same atmosphere and leaves you wanting more from the characters. Unfortunately due to some poor timing many of the jokes fall flat leaving the film to stutter instead of flow.The film does pick up pace midway through the 2nd act however ultimately there isn't anything overly likable about the geek. A touch of reality may have made his character more believable but it seems the director prefers sight gags over substance. Some of the locations work well to build the atmosphere but the dialog just feels too cheesy and forced to make you feel comfortable enough to just go with the story.Hayden Panettiere is really the only reason you would watch this. It isn't hard to see why Denis would fall in love with her Beth  I kept thinking I'd probably do the same if I went to her school. I found her character to be very credible and I enjoyed every scene she was in.If you like Beauty and the Geek and you're a fan of Hayden this is worth watching. More music faster  wittier dialog and more character development would have improved this ten fold.".

I really like these dark comedies and the cast was pretty good. I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie and laughed throughout but this is another movie where I laughed at things I shouldn't be laughing at. The idea on it's own is pretty morbid but watching it it comes off as more comedy then depressing. There are some really funny lines in this and the running gag about Cal's Caan car is great and I loved hearing what they would say about it next. This is a very funny comedy but is not for everyone.

The credits for this Jonathon Sobol film are cleverly presented as parts of games of chance and from the outset there is that feeling that unlikely things are going to happen and this will be an unpredictable and unusual comedy. The Beginner's Guide was one of more than a dozen options available at the Domestic Arrivals Film Festival in London Ontario and it is one that I almost missed. When so many quality films are offered in such a short time frame sometimes difficult choices have to be made. This film was one of the best decisions I made and everything about it impressed me. The award winning screenplay gave the ensemble cast plenty of material to work with and their performances were all pitch perfect.J.K. Simmons serves as an adviser to the White brothers a family so dysfunctional that they could lower the property values in any neighborhood they chose to call home. Siam Yu manages to deliver up some laughs as a very credible Todd the youngest product of Duke White's many misadventures. While Harvey Keitel doesn't need a lot of screen time as the Duke White character his presence is felt throughout the full 92 minutes. Any casting changes would have made this a different film and it likely wouldn't have been a better different. Everybody needed to be who they were to make it work as well as it did. The shooting locations in Niagara Falls are very familiar to most people but because of the close proximity to London there may have been a stronger connection for the audience here. This isn't a film for everyone but it is one that l will go out of my way to see again.".

The award winning screenplay gave the ensemble cast plenty of material to work with and their performances were all pitch perfect.J.K. Simmons serves as an adviser to the White brothers a family so dysfunctional that they could lower the property values in any neighborhood they chose to call home. Siam Yu manages to deliver up some laughs as a very credible Todd the youngest product of Duke White's many misadventures. While Harvey Keitel doesn't need a lot of screen time as the Duke White character his presence is felt throughout the full 92 minutes. Any casting changes would have made this a different film and it likely wouldn't have been a better different. Everybody needed to be who they were to make it work as well as it did. The shooting locations in Niagara Falls are very familiar to most people but because of the close proximity to London there may have been a stronger connection for the audience here. This isn't a film for everyone but it is one that l will go out of my way to see again.";

Cast of characters acting settings locations etc are completely awesome character development as well.

I really liked it and I think it's one of those movies that's worth to be watched again.

While this plot sounds very sad the film is hilarious due to the very very quirky writing. The dialog is among the strangest and funniest I can recall...other than in Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil.

	schema:headline " Its like Quentin Tarantino directed a pitchdark comedy!";
	schema:reviewBody "As with any good film it's always important to start things off the right way in order to spark your viewer's interest. How funny that a film entitled A Beginner's Guide To Endings absolutely mastered the art of an opening scene. The striking image of OscarNominee Harvey Keitel walking through a brightly lit carnival at night with a noose around his neck immediately hooked my interest in this movie. When Harvey Keitel started speaking his voice over setting the movie's tone it just pulled me in even further. The events leading up to my death were a lot like the rest of my life Keitel says. Things didn't go exactly as planned.Keitel playing Duke White sets up the scene quickly talking about all of the regrets in his life and introducing the few things he doesn't regret bringing his five great boys into the world. Three of the boys are now adults and are introduced along with the rest of Duke's family via a nicely crafted family scrapbook sequence. Between Keitel's opening sequences and the animated credit sequence that immediately followed I fell in love with this movie about five minutes in.The main storyline begins in a local church where his brother J.K. Simmons of Spiderman and Juno fame is the priest residing over Duke's funeral. But in traditional Duke fashion there is no body since it appears Duke went over Niagara Falls. Simmons plays the character superbly and builds up the films offbeat humor. He explains that Duke was never much for the Bible so he instead reads the lyrics to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird. The dysfunctional funeral continues in great fashion when one of Duke's sons Scott Caan of the Oceans Eleven film series shows up late just in time to get in a brawl with his brothers in front of their father's casket. The fight is so bad that Simmons has to break out his first aid kit which the family has used so many times the kit has been given the nickname Old Rusty. It is just a tiny detail that makes this oddball family feel real and made me like them more and more.That is why the news they get at the reading of Duke's will hit me like a sucker punch. It's the crux of the plot and even the synopsis for the movie so I don't feel bad revealing this but writerdirector Jonathan Sobol turns up the heat revealing that Duke had the three oldest boys involved in an experimental drug treatment program that has now cut their life expectancy down to nothing and they'll be dead in a brief matter of time. While many of them find this rather hard to believe one of the boys Jacob Paulo Costanzo of Road Trip and Royal Pains goes to his doctor in an attempt to find out the truth. The doctor tells him about the drug tested on them and is blunt when he asks if there is ever anything he wanted to do followed by suggesting that he goes and does them.Before long we see each brother handle their mortality in different ways. Scott Caan is a womanizer who is afraid of being like his dad who had a bunch of boys from different mothers so he goes on a quest to find the one woman who got his motor going and who he feels he can commit to a total psychopath named Miranda. His brother Nuts a former boxer is just trying to wrap things up with training his younger brother Juicebox for a boxing match before realizing he's gotten his brother involved in something he has no business being a part of. And Jacob creates a bucket list of things he wants to do taking his youngest brother along for the ride as they go from one insane item on the checklist to the next. Their three stories build into a glorious crescendo and the editing pulls their stories together with some wonderful cuts that tighten the tension and milk the humor. What is fantastic is this could have been a dreary movie about regret and people facing their mortality but Sobol injects a little dark humor in every scene and keeps the viewer wanting more.Overall A Beginners Guide To Endings is a beautifully paced movie that unfolds the plot quickly and makes excellent use of the Niagara Falls setting. For a film that could have easily been too morbid or morose it really makes for an entertaining and uplifting story in general. Definitely one of the best narrative movies I have seen in quite a while and one I will be recommending to everyone I know.".

Cal Scott Caan is a womanizer who wants his teenage love Miranda Tricia Helfer back after sleeping with a waitress who also slept with dad. Jacob Paulo Costanzo is the responsible one and completely unhappy. He makes a bucket list to do.Jason Jones is so illfitting as a boxer. If anybody should be the boxer it should be Scott Caan. The three guys don't look anything like brothers. They don't fit together and have no brotherly chemistry. Paulo Costanzo and Jason Jones could be brothers but there is no chance for Scott Caan. The movie is so quirky that it makes it hard to follow and lacking in flow. Newcomer Jonathan Sobol is the writerdirector. I think he has a lot to say and a lot of style. He just needs to rein it in and control it better. The other problem is that the three brothers go off on their own. It would help with the brotherly chemistry if they face their challenges together. I'm all for quirky comedies. It would help if the family is more together.".

The pharmaceutical company had paid each brother 100k as compensation for their impending death but Duke had lost it all betting on horses. The three brothers are sent into a spiral to find some kind of meaning in it all. Uncle Pal J.K. Simmons tries to help each one in his own way.Eddie 'Nuts' White Jason Jones is a failed undefeated boxer who wins only because everybody keeps punching him in the junk. Cal Scott Caan is a womanizer who wants his teenage love Miranda Tricia Helfer back after sleeping with a waitress who also slept with dad. Jacob Paulo Costanzo is the responsible one and completely unhappy. He makes a bucket list to do.Jason Jones is so illfitting as a boxer. If anybody should be the boxer it should be Scott Caan. The three guys don't look anything like brothers. They don't fit together and have no brotherly chemistry. Paulo Costanzo and Jason Jones could be brothers but there is no chance for Scott Caan. The movie is so quirky that it makes it hard to follow and lacking in flow. Newcomer Jonathan Sobol is the writerdirector. I think he has a lot to say and a lot of style. He just needs to rein it in and control it better. The other problem is that the three brothers go off on their own. It would help with the brotherly chemistry if they face their challenges together. I'm all for quirky comedies. It would help if the family is more together.";

He's working now on Mariana Soraia Chaves a famous TV actress pursuing her and taking shots of her. Mariana is famous but she hates all these pink magazines and getting her personal life exposed. One day after she almost hit a taxi she fights with the taxi driver and Joao goes help her. The taxi driver punches Joao and puts him bleeding. Mariana takes Joao to a hospital and a friendship starts rising. She doesn't know who he is of course This film is essentially a romantic comedy about fame celebrities and the troubles some famous people have because of that kind of press. I didn't appreciate this new work from AntonioPedro Vasconcelos that much! I find the movie very predictable short as it doesn't have too much to tell! and not as funny as it tries to be. I heard a few times Vanconcelos saying that he likes the American cinema because it's simple and it wants to tell a story to entertain people it's not as deep andor academic as a great part of the European cinema and in fact we can notice he does such kind of cinema and with a good level of quality. Films like Os Imortais or Call Girl both written and directed by him are good examples of what the Portuguese mainstream cinema should be. But now with this film Vasconcelos went on an adventure to a new genre of cinema the comedy! And the experience in my point of view was not great! Everything happens so easily there isn't a credible explanation for the actions and the motives I know it's a romantic comedy and everything in this cinematic genre is supposed to be light colorful and easy to get but I think in this movie the light factor is exaggerated. And it also lacks some intensity. Everything happens too fast and the end appears without notice in a very flat and unsatisfying way The acting is regular from almost all actors I just don't like the character of Nuno Markl! I think it's not as funny as it tries to be! On a certain way I expected more from this movie as I really did enjoy last AntonioPedro Vasconcelos' film Call Girl. But after watch A Bela e o Paparazzo I definitely can't score it higher than 510 as it's just average!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a hard thing for a Portuguese to comment on Portuguese films whether they please him or not. The thing is Portuguese cinema no matter on which grounds it walks in Portugal the question is reduced to films being commercial or artistic is always to be consumed internally. There is absolutely no international projection for any Portuguese films. Two authors make their way outside Pedro Costa and Oliveira but they are directed to very specific and relatively restricted audiences and even if they had larger numbers of ticket buyers that still wouldn't be mildly enough to carry the rest of the production with them. Part of the problem seems to be in the very equation of the problem. Most of the commentators waste time babbling about how Portuguese cinema taken as an organic autonomous being should be made to sell to as many people as it can or to please the critics who will decide on its qualities. According to this leaderless common sense theory these 2 aspects are incompatible. For those standing for this American cinema another pointless expression given the simple vastness of what it refers to should guide the way.Why does it matter to reference this while commenting on this film? Because among many characteristics its director is someone who spends a lot of time addressing this problem. It's not a light subject. I believe cinema can truly be a blessed medium to address matters of collective identity national concerns. What better document to understand how the American and soviet governments tried to bend the minds of the public during the Cold War than their cinema? So of course i am deeply concerned that in Portugal we haven't been able to sustain a constant narrative of our national themes. Even more that the majority of our films are simply not worth watching.That's the other face of the problem. The true thing is not that each director chooses to be commercial or to be an author. That's just fireworks to consider it. The real problem associated with the dreadful distribution devices is that the films simply aren't good enough to deserve the attention of a national crowd less more of an international one. I admit the Portuguese public is much harsher on a Portuguese film than it is on an American one. In other words people will be willing to admit certain things in an American film that will promptly dismiss in a Portuguese one. But even if it's that not fair it should raise the bar and produce a reaction on Portuguese filmmakers. Now we have Vasconcelos. He's been around for quite a while now. With his effort and his merit he has been able to shoot throughout the years. Not as much as it would be desirable for a professional director working under a healthy film industry but he's had his chances. What legacy does he leave? What qualities has he brought? He imported models and made them worse by not adapting them most of the times. His recent work for the last 12 years has been to grasp one after another American genre and deliver it as unchanged as possible. As American as possible. Filmmaking by the numbers. Trying to achieve recognition by doing exactly the same as others did somewhere else. What's the merit of that? It's not about where you place yourself within the world of film. It's about whether you work as a hack or as a genuine creator. You don't have to be a genius. If you take Hollywood or the french new wave 2 dear references for this filmmaker most of their protagonists are pretty far from being geniuses. Most of them simply adapt to the circumstances and go with the flow. But competence is necessary honesty in the adaptations as well.This film isn't honest and thus fails. As a Portuguese i see nothing here. I'll admit a similarly targeted film coming from the American market because i'll see it as a piece of the puzzle a bit of its industry. And most of those films even the worse ones are still more apt than this one. To do this to use an always rare chance to do a genuine Portuguese film no matter how it would be done and to blow the chance away doing this that annoys me. That irritates. There is no speech to make up for the pain to watch it. film is more fiction than life i've always stood for that. But in lying about real life it conveys a larger notion of reality. That was true about the Portuguese comedies of the 30' and above all the 40' those films so dear to this author which references them here at the beginning of the film with a character literally watching an old Portuguese classic. While being politically sponsored films cleverly twisted to become a critic to its own sponsor those films became the propaganda and its reverse a fine portrait of the contradictions and tensions of those days. Where is that here? What is the point of entering the contemporary world of stupid soap operas that dominate Portuguese television and dumb people only to produce a film which is as vapid as any of those soaps. To talk about the problems only to become part of the problems that has been the latest developments of this filmmakers career.I usually am annoyed when i watch a bad film. Sometimes i amuse myself with parallel things related to the film. But nothing hurts more than to comment like this on a Portuguese film.My opinion 15httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Kirk Honeycutt film critic for the Hollywood Reporter and host of the UCLA film course where we previewed this movie immediately compared it to Vittorio De Sicas's 1948 classic film The Bicycle Thief . In it a man and his son search for a stolen bicycle vital for his job. Fast forward to the present time as Carlos an undocumented immigrant played by Mexican super star Demian Bichir and his teenage son played by Jose Lulian an American making his acting debut  are on a similar quest. They are searching for Carlos' stolen truck which he bought with borrowed funds to give him his one chance to make a decent living as a gardener and pay off his debts. Where the original Italian movie painted a picture of the poverty in post war Italy this film provides an insight into life in East Los Angeles with its poverty gangs immigrants desperate for work and living with constant fear of being deported. It captures the poignancy and the dilemmas of hard working immigrant families in cities like Los Angeles who are trying to survive and provide a better life for their children while one step away from being arrested and sent home. The screenplay by Eric Eason is short on words but crystal clear in the emotional impact which it provides not only with the stark reality of the situation that the father and son are faced with but in the emotional struggle that each of them must feel. Bichir's performance could not be better as his face tells his story as does his words in both English and Spanish with appropriate subtitles. Veteran director Chris Weitz teamed with award winning Spanish cinema photographer Javier Aguirresarobe to put together a realistic vision of the characters and environment which was filmed in 69 different locations in Los Angeles. Despite the effectiveness of the film there are no clear villains and no new calls for action. While there may be a morsel of hope there is also the depressing possibility of a never ending line of people with crushed dreams. The film itself is an amazingly powerful and authentic glimpse into the human story that is part of the intractable immigration issue. The emotional pull precludes over intellectualizing. 2011".

They are searching for Carlos' stolen truck which he bought with borrowed funds to give him his one chance to make a decent living as a gardener and pay off his debts. Where the original Italian movie painted a picture of the poverty in post war Italy this film provides an insight into life in East Los Angeles with its poverty gangs immigrants desperate for work and living with constant fear of being deported. It captures the poignancy and the dilemmas of hard working immigrant families in cities like Los Angeles who are trying to survive and provide a better life for their children while one step away from being arrested and sent home. The screenplay by Eric Eason is short on words but crystal clear in the emotional impact which it provides not only with the stark reality of the situation that the father and son are faced with but in the emotional struggle that each of them must feel. Bichir's performance could not be better as his face tells his story as does his words in both English and Spanish with appropriate subtitles. Veteran director Chris Weitz teamed with award winning Spanish cinema photographer Javier Aguirresarobe to put together a realistic vision of the characters and environment which was filmed in 69 different locations in Los Angeles. Despite the effectiveness of the film there are no clear villains and no new calls for action. While there may be a morsel of hope there is also the depressing possibility of a never ending line of people with crushed dreams. The film itself is an amazingly powerful and authentic glimpse into the human story that is part of the intractable immigration issue. The emotional pull precludes over intellectualizing. 2011";

If you do not feel touch by it you're surely made out of stone.The direction by Chris Weitz captures the essence of East LA in a second. There's a scene in the movie where in a matter of 3 minutes you can see how many cultures collide in this side of Los Angeles and how this story can repeat itself in several cultures.This is also a story about true love between a father and a son and how you can forget about everything and try every little thing to give your child the things he deserves.One of the best little movies I have seen this year.PS If you like this one and you're not afraid of BW cinematography no it is not in 3D either run and rent De Sica's Umberto D. a great masterpiece of Italian neorealism.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carlos is a good man. He is raising his 14 yearold son doing the best he can trying to make sure he never gets seduced by a gang of society's worst. Things couldn't be stacked worse against him because he lacks legal documentation to work in the United States and his son holds a grudge against him for not being around to nurture him and there is a back story about his exwife.The plot is simple as it gives you a deciding week in the life of Carlos who reaches a fork in his life and must make a choice in order to improve his family's life. Most likely because of his trusting nature things get even worse as father and son soon become involved in a quest to recover some lost property.Some people have argued that Weitz hasn't been able to connect with his material but I completely disagree as Weitz and his team have done insightful and accurate research about Carlos' world. He has carefully put together a film that tries to explain some subtleties about the various differences among the various Latinos subgroups. The viewer has an opportunity to explore the lives of legal and undocumented immigrants from various countries. It explores how choices are made and some people stick to their roots and continue their traditions here but those might not all be common for all the groups involved. There are telling lines in the conversations between father and son and one tries to sever the ties to the past while the other reminisces.There are amazing scenes in this film. Some deal with the relationships between Anglos and the undocumented workers. Others have the various Latino groups interact with each other and at times they feel uncomfortable because they are raw and honest. Most importantly the work of Demian Bichir's truly remarkable performance a bilingual turn from an actor not afraid to reach deep inside his own experiences to show a range of emotions many award winning performers can only dream of. The scene at the detention center will move every member in the audience as he must bare his soul in a matter of minutes for an opportunity to connect with his own child.Bichir hopefully will be rewarded later in the year for a job few could have pulled off. The film is not apparently very complex. Many might dismiss it as a cheap soap opera attempt to pull emotional strings. Every feeling we experience is the result of daring explorations into groups that might not even be minority groups in the United States. They are part of the fabric that makes up contemporary America and many might choose to ignore them. That would frankly be a mistake because they have their own interconnected dramas and eventually those will reach and affect everyone else. A Better Life is part of a universal dream  nightmare something that touches the universal quest for acceptance in all of us. five stars".

	schema:reviewBody "A BETTER LIFE is one of the more understated films to come out of Hollywood a film that has the courage to tell a story that is so politically charged  the immigration debate  that releasing it now is on the one hand asking for negative responses and on the other hand offers to the public the real truths behind our quandary about immigration. This country consists of immigrants  all of us  no matter how far back we have to trace our ancestry the only people who did not begin their family history as immigrants from every country in the world and the Native Americans and look how we are treating them! If this film does nothing else than plead the case of human understanding it will have accomplished more than legions of films that touch this subject too lightly.Carlos Galindo Demin Bichir in an extraordinarily fine performance crossed the border into the US with his new wife looking for a way to improve his life. Upon arriving his wife gave birth to their son Luis Jos Julin and then promptly left Carlos in search of a better life leaving Carlos to raise Luis alone. Carlos is an honest caring man who must live in the shadow of being illegal he cannot have a driver's license or papers that allow him the benefits of other people. Carlos has a steady job as a gardener with Blasco Joaqun Cosio who owns a truck and the two men work hard as gardeners. When the film opens Carlos is saving is money from working with Blasco living in a tiny house in the smarmy side of Los Angeles trying to provide better schooling for his 15 year old Luis. Luis is of the age when he is easily influenced by his peers his best friend is Ramon Gabriel Chavarria who is waiting to be of age to join the gang and forget about school in lieu of making money and living high. Luis is tempted to follow him but he still attends school despite frequent absences and disinterest in education. Carlos is faced with a dilemma Blasco wants to leave the business of gardening and suggests Carlos buy his truck and tools and start his own business. While Carlos sees the future in owning his own business he can provide hope for a better life for Luis he doesn't have enough money saved to buy the truck. His sister indebted to Carlos for his protection and help brings him her savings and Carlos buys the truck. Luis is surprised and then proud of his father's courage but the happiness is short lived as one of the day laborers Carlos befriended  Santiago Carlos Linares  steals the truck sells it on the black market and sends the money to his family in Mexico. It is this moment that provides an important turn for the relationship between Carlos and Luis. Luis bonds with his father and together they manage to locate the truck and take it back only to be caught by the police for driving without a windshield. Carlos is jailed Luis is devastated but as Carlos is deported Luis pleads with him to 'come back home'. The film's ending tests the credibility a bit but it is heartwarming nevertheless.The story as written by Eric Eason and Roger L. Simon is genuinely real and never veers toward the maudlin. They have created characters who not only demonstrate the importance of father son understanding and relationships but they have approached the entire gamut of immigrant challenges and the manner in which this country deals with current immigrants in an honest manner. Without waving banners for or against immigration problems director Chris Weitz offers us the opportunity to see life from a different angle. One of the reasons this movie is so powerful in its impact and message is due to the brilliant performance by Demin Bichir hopefully a candidate for an Oscar and his performance is beautifully balanced by that of Jos Julin as his son. The film is scored by Alexandre Desplat and the music greatly enhances the rhythms of the story. There is such worth in this film that it would be wise for everyone in this country to view it  and remember our individual heritages and histories. Grady Harp".

The situation is changed when Carlos's truck is stolen. From the time Luis changed his mind and helped his father to find the truck and respect his father.

After thinking about it for a while I decided that one shot pretty much summed up Carlo's feelings and how he views America. You see being born in this country we sometimes take it for granted.

I connected with them in part because I know too much of the hardships of these kinds of people. My parents have had similar obstacles to overcome as well and living not too far away from the area shown in this film I know what it can be like. This is a good film but then there's Demian Bichir. This never once feels like acting and it wasn't until the final scene between Bichir and his son that I realized how effective this film had been. In that final scene I actually let out tears. For the first time the writing didn't feel contrived or the dialogue weak. It all came together for Bichir and in that final scene you break down with him. It is one of the best acted scenes of the year and one of the most effective. It isn't until that final scene that you realize how much he has lured you in to his inner feelings and how much he has made you care. It all sounds cheesy and many times the film is but that final scene between father and son is the only scene from 2011 that actually made me weep like a child. Powerful performance by Bichir and completely deserved his nomination. I also want to mention that Jose Julian is also quite effective.".

	schema:reviewBody "I very much liked A Better Life. Myself being an immigrant who grew up in the United States and raised by a single immigrant mother bore witness of the difficulties that the characters of Carlos Galindo and his son Luis Galindo had to bear as a part of their immigrant experience while trying to create a better future for themselves. A Better Life is a touching portrayal of a hardworking gardener father who despite living in a poor neighborhood never deviates from the real reason he decided to come to the States  to live a better life than what he felt would be awaiting himself and his son in Mexico. A Better Life shows how when a parent raises their child with care and love the child will usually not stray off into a life of crime and violence but will act on his own better judgment in life and will return that care and love to hisher parents because that is also what the child has been raised with  love and care. 'A Better Life showed how far a parent will go to create the best possible situation for hisher child even if it means sleeping on the couch to allow the child to be more comfortable on the bed  as Carlos did for his son Luis.".

Audiences are intimately thrust into the world of an illegal Mexican immigrant trying to survive in the land of freedom through invisibility. Father and son relationships have always been a difficult subject and this film touches the subject beautifully. Growing up in Los Angeles all of my life I did not stop to think twice about people like Carlos but this film has allowed me to understand illegal immigrants in ways I was not able to before. The acting by Demian Bichir was so well done that it is almost impossible not to sympathize with his character. A story representing illegal immigrant and immigrant people is one that should be told on a wider scale in the US because a vast part of the US population is made up of illegal immigrants. The representation of illegal immigrants is rare so films like these are hard to come by and even more rare for them to be as well done as this moving film.".

I never had the feeling that it was preaching judging or taking sides. Instead it tells the story as a realistic portrait of the life of illegal immigrants in that area.Carlos is a 40something man from Mexico without papers or drivers license. He is in the USA illegally. We eventually learn a little of his back story he and his girlfriend crossed the border had a child a boy and she soon left probably because the excitement had worn off. He now lives in a small place and barely makes ends meet.The son Luis is 14 and growing up in the USA speaks excellent English but very little Spanish. Luis' commitment to school is low when he gets in trouble and is expelled for a short time he doesn't seem to mind. He even considers if it might be time to join a gang. A bright boy with no direction and little respect for his Mexican father.Carlos works at odd jobs like yard work and tree trimming. The fellow he has been working for wants to sell Carlos his truck and let Carlos take over the regular customers. Carlos is hesitant but eventually does it with the help of money his sister loans him.The movie's title A Better Life is mostly a reference to what Carlos wants for his son. Carlos knows he will never get beyond a laborer and hoping not to get caught and deported. But he wants his son to have a better life that is really all he cares about.When he bought the truck I said to my wife There is no way he can expect to never be stopped by police. Anyway a pretty good movie very well acted directed and filmed. Gives us a glimpse into the life of illegal residents trying to stay out of trouble and make something good for their families. It is a tough situation.SPOILERS After Carlos buys the truck he goes to the spot where illegals congregate for day jobs. We have those here in Houston also! He selects a man who appears to need the work but when Carlos is near the top of the palm tree to do a trim the man steals the truck. Carlos tracks him down rather quickly but the man had already sold the truck for 3000 and sent the Money to family back in Mexico. Carlos eventually gets the truck back stealing it from a chop shop but is stopped by the cops and in a few days deported. His son is cared for by his sister who is a legal resident. Flash to 4 months later Carlos is with a small band of others about to cross the border and go back to Los Angeles. The cycle of life for illegal residents.".

	schema:headline " A waste of some pretty girls.....";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is like a rocky boat that sets off boldly but soon makes water and in the end sadly sinks like a stone.The ingredients are OK five pretty girls high on hormones who go out partying in this luxurious remote villa some creepy locals one lecherous one retarded a mysterious but hunky bachelor boynextdoor who flirts with the girls and an abandoned haunted house in the vicinity. But it's like the pieces of a potentially good puzzle that are put together in the wrong way they just don't fit.First of all these five girls all are more or less interchangeable there's no characterdescription or development whatsoever so you have hardly any reason to sympathize with anyone of them. Are they really cheerleaders? They never once talk about it. What in the world makes them go to that remote place?! There's absolutely nothing to party at all just a house and a pool so that's all they seem to do swim sunbathe sleep. No visible boozing no drugs no wild music and dance no nothing. Then they are supposed to be sassy but all they do to prove this is that they play some lame version of truth or dare that could have passed censorship in a catholic convent even though they're in their underwear and in the company of the hunky boynextdoor. That's the next improbability that made me suspect him from the start. Here you young and handsome stud are in the company of a bunch of partying young girls that circle around you in their flimsy bikini's and underwear and you have nothing on but your baggy wet shorts and then you behave like you're someone's little baby brother?!? Every other selfrespecting horrorflick should have comeup at this point with some hot scenes of making out and bare boobs but not here.The other ingredients of the story don't ever seem to blend during the bulk of the movie they're only tied together in the end as if the writer suddenly thought that there shouldn't be any loose ends when the audience goes home. The lecherous mechanic from the beginning of the movie doesn't play any role in the rest of it we just find him back in the end as a corpse. The flash back of him butchering some other lost kids is totally superfluous to the story. The weird man in the haunted house who's kept hidden for some time as the mysterious force that's responsible for the disappearance and killing of some of the girls come's totally outoff the blue it's noone we've seen before so how can we relate to his presence and actions? Movies like this traditionally have to have a last grand twist that should make you jump up just before the lights go on again and they DO give it a try here but I saw it coming from the beginning and I'm mostly the last to know things like that.The only decent thing in this movie is the flash backs to the kidbrothers where the vicious one plays prove how much you love me! and really causes some chills on your spine. But the rest of the supposed horror was lost on me. We never see a real graphic kill and the victims just hang around a table in some sort of comatose way while being drained of their blood what's the use of THAT??. The acting and the direction are mediocre at best it's like noone really believed in the whole thing and just went through the motions the director asked them to.But hey I DID like the house the neat villa not the haunted one. It deserved a better movie.".

But it's like the pieces of a potentially good puzzle that are put together in the wrong way they just don't fit.First of all these five girls all are more or less interchangeable there's no characterdescription or development whatsoever so you have hardly any reason to sympathize with anyone of them. Are they really cheerleaders? They never once talk about it. What in the world makes them go to that remote place?! There's absolutely nothing to party at all just a house and a pool so that's all they seem to do swim sunbathe sleep. No visible boozing no drugs no wild music and dance no nothing. Then they are supposed to be sassy but all they do to prove this is that they play some lame version of truth or dare that could have passed censorship in a catholic convent even though they're in their underwear and in the company of the hunky boynextdoor. That's the next improbability that made me suspect him from the start. Here you young and handsome stud are in the company of a bunch of partying young girls that circle around you in their flimsy bikini's and underwear and you have nothing on but your baggy wet shorts and then you behave like you're someone's little baby brother?!? Every other selfrespecting horrorflick should have comeup at this point with some hot scenes of making out and bare boobs but not here.The other ingredients of the story don't ever seem to blend during the bulk of the movie they're only tied together in the end as if the writer suddenly thought that there shouldn't be any loose ends when the audience goes home. The lecherous mechanic from the beginning of the movie doesn't play any role in the rest of it we just find him back in the end as a corpse. The flash back of him butchering some other lost kids is totally superfluous to the story. The weird man in the haunted house who's kept hidden for some time as the mysterious force that's responsible for the disappearance and killing of some of the girls come's totally outoff the blue it's noone we've seen before so how can we relate to his presence and actions? Movies like this traditionally have to have a last grand twist that should make you jump up just before the lights go on again and they DO give it a try here but I saw it coming from the beginning and I'm mostly the last to know things like that.The only decent thing in this movie is the flash backs to the kidbrothers where the vicious one plays prove how much you love me! and really causes some chills on your spine. But the rest of the supposed horror was lost on me. We never see a real graphic kill and the victims just hang around a table in some sort of comatose way while being drained of their blood what's the use of THAT??. The acting and the direction are mediocre at best it's like noone really believed in the whole thing and just went through the motions the director asked them to.But hey I DID like the house the neat villa not the haunted one. It deserved a better movie.";

How stupid are those girls really want to visit an abandoned house were some atrocities happened. 1954 and 1955 back flashes huh who are those kids? the names never appear in the movie. The end what the hell see it coming miles away. And what about the conversations between the girls so stupid you see them wait until one has finished her sentence. This is no acting. At the end suddenly there is light in that house but still they think no one lives there. No blood flows just in snap shots that's the best part some frames included with blood.

The blood is only thrown against a wall and implying that something bad happens. The worst part is in the beginning there is some crazy gas station dude that has during one of the MANY flashback scenes that just have no bearing on the movie anyway this old guy kills a dude and them starts taking photos of the girl with a stuttering young man who is the only cool character in the film. They take photos of her with the guy kissing her and sorta leading to a perversion that would be cool in itself if the real story didn't have to happen. Over all the writers need to go to school and learn how to write something entertaining because nothing ever happens in this film. Absolutely boring. The only bright spot is the stuttering guy who actually did a pretty good job. This film makes ED WOOD films look like masterpieces. Horrendous.".

	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED IN 2007 A Brush with Death is a horrorslasher about five cheerleaders on retreat at a vacation home in the country of California. There's an abandoned house nearby that has an infamous history and the girls are intrigued by it. Meanwhile a couple local guys come sniffing around the girls.There are three basic types of film Grade A films are professionallymade theatrically released films which includes everything from moderatebudget to blockbuster Grade B films are lowbudget movies that are either madeforTV or directtovideo and these include independent films or indies Grade C movies are everything below this which means they have microbudgets or nobudgets and have an amateurish vibe to them they'll often strike you as more of a student movie than a legitimate one. A Brush with Death 2007 is definitely a Grade C film.Sometimes Grade B films can be Grade A at heart because of the hard work and professionalism of the filmmakers and cast like 2010's Monsters which only cost around 800000 but was so wellmade that it came across as a Grade A film which doesn't mean you'll like it of course. I point this out because sometimes Grade C movies can theoretically be Grade B films at heart or possibly even Grade A albeit unlikely. Another Kind 2013 is a good example. It only cost 120000 but it smacks of a modestbudget theatrical release.I point all this out because even though A Brush with Death is a Grade C film it doesn't mean it HAS to be a stinker. With a budget of 200000 the creators had considerably more resources than Another Kind. So I viewed it with an open mind in the hope that it would rise beyond its limitations. Unfortunately it didn't. I'm very merciful when it comes to acting. I don't care how noname the cast members are if the acting is satisfactory it'll be convincing if not it won't. A lot of the acting in A Brush with Death is just unconvincing not all of it but too much of it. And some of it is downright laughable. Especially when the gas station man abducts  kills a girl and takes loads of pictures of her and later when the five protagonists break down on a country road and the man from the gas stations stops by to offer help. These were the first bad signs and the movie never really recovers from this lowlevel of filmmaking.The only reasons I'm NOT giving A Brush with Death an F is because there's barely enough filmmaking talent here that the story moderately kept my attention for the first 50 minutes or so plus there are some quality visuals like the haunted house at night and a few of the actors aren't bad like the mentally challenged guy moreover a few of the girls are decent Ali Thurlow as Candice Nikki Cordell as Hillary and Seanna McDonald as Amber. Blonde Candice is easily the most beautiful but she's inexplicably gone by the 25minute mark. The script was really lame in parts and it clearly needed more time to work out the kinks and flush out its potential like George Romero did with Night of the Living Dead 1968. Unfortunately it was rushed and this shows in the finished product. The flick should have never been released to video because it's that poor of a Grade C film.THE MOVIE RUNS 81 minutes and was shot in San Joaquin Valley which is just east of the Bay Area in Northern California.GRADE D 2.510".

At first I thought it was Hillbilly Wayne the auto mechanic with his camera but rewind shows otherwise.The continuity in this film was possibly the worse I have ever tried to follow in a B movie. Flashbacks fast forwards trying to tell a story but it is so disjointed it really makes it hard to follow. Cute if not entirely predictable ending.I have to say it still puzzles me why 5 girls would want to party in a dilapidated old house. Especially these 5 who seemed like they walked out of a Teen Glamour shoot and would not be caught dead pardon the pun in a run down haunted mansion.I don't think the movie is a total loss I still enjoyed it for what it was. Since I cannot make a movie I don't feel I should be critiquing others so harshly. Small budgets sometimes are the blameother times it's the writing or the acting. In this case probably a little of all three.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on UK's 2000AD. My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up till this point I'd really only seen the Shaw Bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to the movies of Tsui Hark pronounced apparently Choy Huk.Yet for all the smoky backlit exteriors and ambitious special effects Stopmotion? In a Hong Kong Movie? at the heart of Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of Leslie Cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life! and the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Granted Joey is gorgeous but it's her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that's hard to analyse. And though Joey is now almost 20 years older gawd which of us isn't? this will always be the enduring image of that actress.Some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but they're missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! That's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet has a predictable ending and just copies WEST SIDE STORY. For me Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessential romantic tale. It has high tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about becoming mature for none of us can mature until we've experienced great loss. It's about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential component of True Love. And the comedy stylings of Wu Ma don't hurt a bit either.Enjoy Chinese GHOST STORY by trying not to view it through a filter of Western culture and you'll get on with it just fine.".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic A Better Tomorrow' Zu Warriors' and the classic Mr Vampire'. Jackie Chan was having international success on video but it was with A Chinese Ghost Story' that HK cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the West for many years.Western filmgoers had never seen anything like it. It was a film that took various ingredients that HK cinema had used for years flying swordsman wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look feel and execution. Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned this is the original and best.Director SiuTung Ching still best known as an Action Choreographer on such films as Woo's A Better Tomorrow 2''The Killer' has under the watchful eye of legendary Producer Tsui Hark created a masterpiece of FantasyHorror cinema. And with such an expert crew at his disposal no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable.The editing by the amazingly prolific David Wu who wrotedirected The Bride With White Hair 2' and edited such classic titles as A Better Tomorrow 123' Hardboiled' and the cult hit The Club' is quite simply a work of genius. His crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best HK cinema has ever created. Fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the pinnacle of their art.The crew of cinematographers have also done miracles. This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting. Where wonderful blue tinged night sequences shrouded in an everpresent ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold. It's a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty. Even the silken robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen. Even a simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act. The sets are also amazing giving an other worldly sense to the forests and the temple and harshness to the scorched flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale. The production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise.Another major factor to the films success is the music by Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on A Chinese Ghost Story' the music is quite simply vital. From the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters.The score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments. Drums bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect but it's in the slower achingly romantic pieces that it comes into it's own. Here flutes strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an HK film. Add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over Tsaushen's and Hsiao Tsing's love making nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful. This is lovingly innocent movie romance and you have a shining example of the power a film's music can have.And we of course have the acting talent. Leslie Cheung A Better Tomorrow 1  2' and a very popular singer is outstanding as the innocent tax collector. His work in the thankfully mild comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence.Joey Wang who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the Chow Yun FatAndy Lau classic God of Gamblers has never looked more radiant than how she does here. She is the epitome of ethereal beauty. Her portrayal of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is stunning. She shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma Mr. Vampire' Swordsman' is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy Yen. He treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease. And what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable.But what about the monsters and beasties? I hear you cry. Well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motionanimatronic zombies that inhabit the temple resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting Tsaushen to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective Lord Black. Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work. Most of which has to this day never been topped.But the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirit's killer tongue. We first encounter this thing with an Evil Dead' style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal French kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks. But later it's shown in all its crazy glory. It can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees wraps itself around buildings and coils it's slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks!! It can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth! It's an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldn't work. But it does to fantastic and unforgettable effect.So what all this adds up to is a classic example of Hong Kong movie making. A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie. It's a film packed with wit invention action monsters martial arts ghosts fantastic ideas lush visuals beautiful music and most important to it's enduring charm one of cinemas most moving romances.".

Its my life. My all times favorite movie. My words will fall short of true meaning what I have inside for this movie. I follow this movie. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror erotic scary and martial arts. The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm. It's a masterpiece of Hong Kong Cinema.Sinnui Yauman is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film. Written by Songling Pu and directed by SiuTung Ching A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near. The trek alone is perilous with wolves and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple.Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple. She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love.Ling Choi Sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods. There's great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms. The movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics with magic and flying through the air leaping from tree to tree with elegant long gowns and scarves but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective.Tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice.In the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring Ling's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation.A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details. One is touched in many ways by this movie you'll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. And though at the end Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow we never know if Tsing was afforded a reincarnation but we do know her.".

And though at the end Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow we never know if Tsing was afforded a reincarnation but we do know her.";

And who could forget the hilarious looking Lau Siu Ming as the transvestite tree demon. This film is very funny thrilling romantic erotic and scary. Every scene looks great and the main theme song and the haunting love song are unrivalled. This film is a great tribute to the late great Leslie Cheung who's recent suicide shows the world the acting talent we will miss.I would rate this film 10 out of 10.".

The trek alone is perilous with wolves and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple.Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple.

There's great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms. The movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics with magic and flying through the air leaping from tree to tree with elegant long gowns and scarves but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective.Tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice.In the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring Ling's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation.A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details.

Of course it happens to be haunted as well.What I wasn't expecting the first time I saw this film is that it's one of the most touching love stories I've ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches. Unlike some films of Asian cinema A Chinese Ghost Story isn't hard to swallow for those that aren't versed in Chinese culture. Indeed it plays on timeless cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance.Think Evil Dead 2 if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. This film is for real despite being overlooked by many. It's absolutely among the best I've ever seen. It's ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic. Highly recommended 1010.".

The sorely missed Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple. While staying at the temple he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen Yin Wu Ma and Hsiao Hou the Tree Devil and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen played by the lovely Joey Wong.To free her from the clutches of the evil Tree Devil he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon.Enough good things can't be said about this film. The pacing is perfect with a great combination of romance action fantasy and humor and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung whose legendary career ended much too soon really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. Indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life I would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His overthetop persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score lush cinematography with eye popping colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung round out this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere you can. 1010".

The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung whose legendary career ended much too soon really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. Indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life I would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His overthetop persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score lush cinematography with eye popping colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung round out this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere you can. 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "After going through some reviews I feel the need to differentiate Liao Zhai from Wuxia and Western and JapaneseFantasy. The awareness of Liao Zhai among audiences is far far from enough which partly explains why this film doesn't meet expectation from some people. This film is loosely based on a short story from Liao Zhai which is a collection of nearly 500 strange tales dated back to 17th century serving to implicitly criticize human society. Unlike many ghost stories Liao Zhai portrays most ghosts as likable and humane females and has underdog scholarsauthor's class stand ridiculous government officials as well as feudal principles as recurring themes. Although the story line has been changed this film hasn't depart from the core of Liao Zhai mocking brain scattered officials revealing heartless stallkeepers and crowds. Its attitude is fully exposed through lines of the TaoistI hate dealing with people so I hid in this temple. Ridiculous. I don't want to be a man but Hsiao Tsing wants reincarnation. I don't understand all this nonsense! In these times an unlucky man may fare worse than a ghost.  Those who thought it was Wuxia may find the supernatural elements corny those who thought it was a fantasy may find it structurally and cinematically timid. With all that said Liao Zhai as a film genre might never become phenomenal mostly due to its own limitation. In the nihilist moment of depression and quiet anger scholars like the author of Liao Zhai had never detected the crux of the problems nor come up with effective solutions just like the last feudalism of China itself.Hopefully a brief look into Liao Zhai betters your understanding!".

	schema:headline " OverTheTop Fun";
	schema:reviewBody "A Chinese Ghost Story is the first of a trend of supernatural horrorthrillerromancemartial artscomedy films made in Hong Kong. It was incredibly successful in Asia and is one of the most iconic Hong Kong films ever made easily up there with films such as A Better Tomorrow and Infernal Affairs. It's hard to review a film that's already received so much praise and accolades and not let that cloud your judgment but with that said this is a really fun movie!The plot follows a timid debt collector by the name of Ning ChoiSan whose job requires him to travel to rural areas around ancient China. He arrives at a town but fails to find a place to stay so resorts to staying in a deserted temple where he finds the beautiful seductive ghost named Nip SiuSin who he eventually falls in love with.What works about A Chinese Ghost Story is its blend of horror romance action and comedy. Hong Kong films are notorious for being uneven in tone they often blend a bunch of different tones in one movie. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't but here it completely works. We have the overthetop horror the extremely sappy romance stylized action and tongueincheek humor and they all compliment each other extremely well. The reason it works is because everything feels consistently exaggerated and blown out of proportion. If we went from realistic human drama to overthetop horror the change in tone would feel very abrupt but since everything feels very overthetop and unrealistic it feels like you're just being immersed into the film's world. The film's romance is extremely sappy and melodramatic but it works because the story IS a melodrama. The concept itself is very melodramatic in the first place so the filmmakers just went with it and made it as sincere as possible. The actors do it with the utmost passion that you can't you help but appreciate them for it. The romantic moments in the film are often very funny and affectionate and even touching on a few occasions. You can get away with a lot of silly stuff in your movies if you do it with sincerity and this film is a perfect example of that. The action is very creative and fun to watch throughout and the horror while not exactly scary makes you feel like a kid again while watching it with the goofylooking creatures foggy scenery and overall spooky atmosphere it's all good fun. The comedy is probably gonna be the most divisive thing for Western audiences. Hong Kong Cinema has a very BROAD sense of humor that won't necessarily appeal to everyone but I myself found it amusing throughout and it never goes overboard it always comes organically into the script and it never feels disruptive of the overall flow of the film.The cast is surprisingly effective in this zany overthetop world created by Ching SiuTung and Tsui Hark. Leslie Cheung plays Ning Choi San as a bumbling bafoon who makes a complete fool out of himself in every scene and we love him for it. Cheung is very funny throughout but he also handles himself well in the dramatic elements his love for Nip SiuSin is incredibly genuine and heartfelt. Joey Wang is incredibly sexy as Nip SiuSin but also a believable sympathetic side as well. But for me the biggest scene stealer is Wu Ma as swordsman Yip ChikHa. His character is fascinating throughout as his motives are very opaque and confusing throughout and we don't really know how to feel about him. But he's also shown to be a bada swordsman and a sympathetic character as he's a loner who doesn't belong in neither the world of the living or the dead. The rest of the cast is good too although Lau SiuMing does look a little goofy as the tree demon but that's about it as far as complaints go in the acting department.Lastly this is a pretty wellmade film for an 80's Hong Kong production. The cinematography has a great spooky look to it with a lot of blue backlighting for the nighttime scenes and the camerawork is very inventine and dynamic with a lot of effective POV's for the tree demon. The special effects while a bit cheesy and fake today are nonetheless really cool to look at and fun to watch. Overall A Chinese Ghost Story is a overthetop fun with a sappy yet sincere romance fun action spooky horror amusing comedy an effective cast and solid production values. 810".

There is a good bit of drama and romance between the scholar and ghost mixed in with some comedy and horror scenes from the tree devil. To top it off the film has a beautiful music score composed by James Wong and features two songs sung by Sally Yeh and the film's leading protagonist Leslie Cheung. Mu Wa plays the daring swordsman and Joey Wang plays the beautiful and tragic ghost. My only issues very minor are that the movie seems too fastpaced at times especially in some of the action sequences. And it appears that some bits of comedy are forced into certain scenes to lighten up what is supposed to be a dramatic story. Other than that this movie is an outstanding source of entertainment with all the magic spells enchanting spirits creepy demons enthralling heroic action and unending journeys and is one of the more popular movies made in Hong Kong bringing you back to the nostalgia of the movies in the 1980s which is in my opinion the best decade of films made in HK.Grade A".

First I must say the effects look cheesy compared to what is possible today but then again this movie is 25 years old now and on a tight budget compared to Hollywood. As mentioned by some one else yes there is a cheap beard sticked to Wu Ma the taoist monk. Yet this is a more of comedy reference to the older HK movies this movie is a remake of a Shaw Brothers movie from the 60's named The Enchanting Shadow.This is one of the best Wuxia movies out there tons of swordplay and magic. Thrown in is a tale of romance some horror taoism and Buddhism comedy and the main character Ning Choisan played by Cheung sings a song too. The story tells of a young taxcollector who can't get his job done. Thrown in the violent reality of rural China he seeks a free sleeping place. He is told of an old temple but what he does not know is that it is haunted. When he arrives a sword fight is taking place between an old taoist monk and a younger swordsman that wants to prove himself. The monk tells Ning Choisan to go somewhere else to sleep. Ning Choisan decides to stay at the temple and he meets up with a young woman Nip Siusin while the younger swordsman who lost the sword fight meets up with a demon after being tempted by Nip Siusin. Ning Choisan falls in love with Nip Siusin but he finds out she is not alive anymore but a ghost. Nip Siusin and her sister died and now are slaves of a demon that is using the Nip Siusin to lure men so they can be devoured by the demon. Ning Choisan wants to free her and asks the monk for his help.He is were a lot of people fail to read between the lines and see this movie as something told in western tales a 1000 times before. Thing is western tales always have a happy ending. Guy battles demons rescues girl girl is no longer a ghost and they live happily ever after. Not here. This is HK cinema.The main character is facing a dilemma. He can be with Siusin at night and live out their romance during the day she needs to return to her urn. Or he can save her soul and she will reincarnate yes this is about Buddhism but they will never meet again. Will he choose for love or her freedom?But before the can think about what to do he first needs to rescue Siu sin from the Dark Lord. The monk decides to help him and they go on to battle the demons that stand in their way.For the fans there is a 2011 version now. It was rereleased digitaly remastered after Leslie Cheung died. Also there is a 2011 remake but it seems nowhere as good as this one I did not see it yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story about a tax collector Ling who was a little down on his luck. He was caught in the rain and scared off by bandits and as such lost all of his records. So he was caught in a town and could not get the revenue because he did not have the records. As such he was broke and had no place to spend the night so he was sent up to the monastery.This monastery was haunted though. Not only did a ghost haunt the monastery but a whole heap of ghoulish creatures did as well. The ghouls were quickly disposed of by accident but the ghost posed a different problem. She was being controlled by a tree demon to bring her men every night. The demon is also forcing her to marry another demon prince who she does not particularly want to marry.I enjoyed this movie for two reasons the romance and the fantasy. The one thing I enjoy about Hong Kong horror films is that they are far more fantastic that their western counterparts. This film is set in medieval times and there is lots of monsters and magic around. The eastern fantasy is focused more on spirits and the undead rather than monsters like dragons. There are also Taoist monks who are both warriors and wizards.Wizards in Hong Kong movies are far better than their western counterparts. The spells are much more organised and not composed of fancy wavings of the western ones. As such they suspend my disbelief much more. The magic is far more pronounce with explosions and flashy effects flying everywhere. A demons die very well usually in a huge explosion.There is also a romantic element here. Sui Sin the ghost is compelled to lure men to their deaths but these men generally are very lustful and treat women like objects. As such they land up with what they deserve. Ling is a medieval SNAG he respects Sui Sin and as such Sui Sin respects him and seeks to protect him. As he does not want to force himself upon her she finds herself attracted to him and as such is able to plead to help her. It is such relationships that I find enjoyable. It is one that there is a deep love but one that cannot happen because one is dead. Even so Ling puts his life in danger which is a big step for his cowardly character to prevent her from marrying the demon prince.Just a thought on Chinese ghosts. They seem solid unlike western ghosts that are noncorporeal. As such it is very easy to mistake them for the living which Ling does. Anyway enough of writing this as I want to go and watch the second movie.".

Even so Ling puts his life in danger which is a big step for his cowardly character to prevent her from marrying the demon prince.Just a thought on Chinese ghosts. They seem solid unlike western ghosts that are noncorporeal. As such it is very easy to mistake them for the living which Ling does. Anyway enough of writing this as I want to go and watch the second movie.";

The acting is good the female lead is gorgeous the action scenes are typically frenetic and yet possess a clarity not often seen in mainstream Western films. To be honest I wasn't expecting any action scenes at all before I started watching not that I'm complaining. The film was also quite funny in places as well as romantic but not necessarily scary at least by today's standards.Something I should say is that the film is fairly fast paced yet we manage to keep track of the story but it moves so fast that we don't really get the chance to feel for the characters and they don't really have the chance to develop. The pacing itself was often uneven but now I'm merely splitting hairs.Worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once in a while a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre. A film of this caliber will influence many  films following its release for years to come. A Chinese Ghost Story' falls in this category. It is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980's possibly one of the best ever made.The filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan. The story is engrossing and original. The villains are appropriately menacing and frightening. The sets are creepy and atmospheric. There is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house. But don't let the horror' label scare you off if you're not a fan of the genre. This film easily fits into many different categories.The screenwriter has deftly blended the drama comedy horror kung fu and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza. A Chinese Ghost Story' is a beautiful epic love story told thankfully without the gratuitous nudity andor explicit sex scenes that have ruined many Hollywood love stories'. Those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fastpaced swordplay and wirefu'. If that's not enough actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy. This film offers something for every film fan.Director SiuTung Ching and Producer Tsui Hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I cannot possibly think of a performer other than Cheung who could have portrayed Ling Choi Sin better except maybe Chow Yun Fat. Joey Wang is enchanting as Lit Su Seen the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of Cheung's character. Her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantankerous Taoist who aids the young lovers.On technical level this film is very impressive even by today's standards. The direction is superb. I wish that today's Hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like SiuTung Ching rather falling back on the usual MTV video or Pepsi commercial directors'. The cinematography is gorgeous. You have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night. The special effects makeup is topnotch. In fact most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy CGI ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films.Since its release A Chinese Ghost Story has spawned two worthy sequels a fulllength animated movie and countless imitations.  None of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic however. This film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "After the resounding success of A Chinese Ghost Story a second part had to be made. And what a sequel it is! This time our bumbling taxcollector finds himself in prison fighting stacks of rubber monsters and befriending a Taoist who likes to travel underground! It's nice to see all the cast back too. This movie is very funny and never takes itself too seriously. For some who didn't quite understand the first movie this is great to clear up any confusion. For the others this is lighthearted entertainment.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie sort of follows on from the first one. It opens with a rehash of what happened in the previous movie and then Ling and the Taoist part ways. As Ling journeys through the land he comes to notice that there is an excess of thieves and robbers and escapes with his life after entering an inn run by bandits who cut up their guests and eat them. Unfortunately he is captured by guards and locked up in jail and sent to be executed. While in gaol he impresses an old man who gives him a symbol and shows him the way out. He take this way out and comes upon a group of outlaws who behave as ghosts. One of them reminds him of Sui Sin and throughout the movie he is constantly seeing her as Sui Sin. It becomes evident though that a great evil is menacing the land and this evil has taken the form of the high priest.Chinese Ghost Story 2 attempts to out do what they did in the first movie. In the first they fight and kill a demon lord while in the second one they are confronted by Buddha himself. Buddha is far more powerful than the demon prince but the strange this is that Buddha is behaving very evilly. The characters in the movie including the general and the Buddha's servants appear far more dangerous than those in the earlier movie but this is not surprising considering what Ling has previously been through. First he fights and destroys a demon lord so to send him up against something less threatening would not be a challenge.These movie should really appeal to roleplayers as there are a lot of fantasy elements in them. They leave the Western Fantasy movies for dead for in these magic is magic and the monsters are real monsters. Magic is far more common in these movies  they are the providence of the Taoist monks  whereas in the Western movies sorcerers are few and far between. The encounters are far more interesting as well such as humans who can burrow through the ground demons that can turn people into beasts and soldiers that can turn invisible at will.This movie does go far better than the first but it acts more to build upon it rather than outdo it. With the Chinese Ghost Stories I think it works far better if we watch them all rather than say one is better than the other and ignore the others. I have not yet watched number three so I cannot comment on that yet. What it does do though is that it remembers what went on before. Ling is a character that has depth to him. He is pinning for Sui Sin his lost love  one he knows he cannot see again. He holds tightly onto the painting and enamoured with the woman who looks a lot like her.I find that these movies are very well done. Tsui Hark the producer for these movies did a lot to bring the special effects in Hong Kong up to a equal level with Hollywood. What happens in Hong Kong movies though is that the film makers tend to push for much more and generally arrive at that place as well. Hong Kong horror is not horror in the Western sense but more fantasy.".

There is a good balance of drama and romance as the character of Windy reminded Ling Choi Sin of his beloved tragic ghost Lip Siu Sin from the first movie  bridging a touching connection between the two stories.This film also has a beautiful music score composed by James Wong and Romeo Diaz and crazy specialvisual effects of the magic spells seen in the film you would have to suspend your imagination to believe. Though very wild the magic somehow works very well and fits in this story. Lastly the acting was great provided by a cast of very memorable characters.While this film does not surpass the original Chinese Ghost Story in story and quality this movie is still entertaining and fun and certainly one of the better sequels to come out of Hong Kong.Grade B".

There's also what seems to be some kind of political allegory near the end that doesn't fit the rest of the story  maybe you have to be more familiar than I am with China to appreciate it? Oh maybe I'm griping too much it has its good moments especially a scene concerning a slowly 'thawing' monster...just not nearly as many as 1987's SINNUI YAUMAN.

This time Buddhist Bai Yun Shun Lau and his disciple Fong Tony Chiu Wai Leung try to transport a golden Buddha idol across town getting themselves hounded by thieves and then taking shelter at the haunted Orchid Temple. There Fong encounters Lotus Joey Wang a female ghost at the evil bidding of the Tree Devil SiuMing Lau awakened 100 years after the events of the first film.This sequel's story is more in line with the original film having a traveling leading male character meet a beautiful female ghost at the Orchid Temple who's spirit is binded by the evil Tree Devil. But this movie is still fresh nonetheless with it having a fastpaced plot chock full of crazy magic spells and action sequences seductive and spellbinding female ghosts hairraising demons and nonstop adventures. There is also a touch of humor drama and romance following the tradition of the previous two films. The female lead is once again played by Joey Wang. Although a different character the ghost she plays in this sequel is a touching throwback to the first film Wang portrayed all three different characters from each of the three movies with ease charm and uniqueness.This film has another beautiful music score composed by James Wong and Romeo Diaz and crazy specialvisual effects galore! The acting by another memorable cast was great albeit a tad goofy sometimes. And the breathtaking scenery and period costumes were a treat  very colorful and vibrant. Hats off to Producer Hark Tsui and Director SiuTung Ching for putting together such an awesome and timeless trilogy in all three films! Overall this sequel holds up well on its own. Like the first sequel this film does not surpass the original Chinese Ghost Story some scenes are rushed some drag on too long a bit but is still very entertaining and fun  one of the greatest sequels I've seen.Grade A".

I do not know if there are going to be any more made but Des Mangan seems to think that by this one the story is being stretched at little thin. There is little that I can say about this one that I have not said about the other two but I will talk about this movie nonetheless.Chinese Ghost Story 3 has a very similar plot to number one. At the end of number one the tree demon was defeated but was laid to rest for 100 years. Now 100 years have passed and a new generation walks the earth. The characters have changed but the tree demon is still there. She awakens gets some more ghosts and begins her terror anew. This in essence the plot returns to that of the first movie.The second movie digressed a lot because it dealt with a wider area and a greater evil but Chinese Ghost Story was not really about ghosts. This movie returns to the ghosts but there is a slight difference in the characters. In this movie the main character is a Buddhist Monk traveling with his master. They find shelter in the temple and the master learns that there are demons about. While the master is out a ghost comes into the monastery and attempts to seduce the young monk but she fails as the monk has vowed to refrain from the pleasures of the world. The monk goes to kill the ghost but decides to set her free. The ghost Phoey live a life and death or decadent slavery and prostitution. She had never know love or friendship and is surprised when the monk shows this to her.The monk is similar. He never had a family and was brought up by the master to reject the world and focus on the spiritual. The monk is a bit of a bumbler and is constantly breaking things and getting him and others into trouble. The one thing is that he learns to love and to care of Phoey and the conflicts between these two characters is what this movie focuses on.In essence this movie does not let down on the Hong Kong action nor does it let down on those cool effects like people flying everywhere. My friend Joanne Chong who also watches Hong Kong movies says she doesn't like these dark movies with people flying around but I personally think that they are great.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've never seen a stage production of A Chorus Line no small feat since it was not only once the longest running show on Broadway but has had extensive touring and regional exposure then the movie version is perhaps better than nothing. However an acquaintance with the source material makes one realize how much the film falls short of the power of the original.Michael Bennett's magnum opus was conceived as a tribute to gypsiesBroadway chorus dancersand in a way to the every bodies and nobodies from all walks of life. The characters in Chorus Line are not rich or famous nor are they likely to be and over the course of the story they bare legs heart and soul just for the chance to be one body in a unified faceless corps. Bennett brought out each dancer's individuality making each a loving welldefined portrait of a human being with all the hopes and dreams problems and shames that everyone has but nobody ever sees. But director Richard Attenborough undermines this essential concept in two very distinct ways.First there is the presence of Michael Douglas as Zach the choreographer who puts the auditioning dancers through the paces. Granted if one must have a name actor in A Chorus Line then this is the place for itZach neither sings nor dances and exists mostly as a Godlike voice issuing from the dark of the auditorium. But Douglas' very presence overshadows the dancers who should be the heart and soul of the show. True his name is listed in the credits alphabetically with everyone else's but every time the camera's on him we go Hey that's Michael Douglas pulling our focus from where it should be.Also pulling focus is the undue emphasis Attenborough puts on Cassie the veteran dancer who was once Zach's lover. Although Zach and Cassie's relationship is a part of the stage show it is but once facet among the many stories told over the evening. Attenborough makes Cassie the central part of the film shortchanging several other characters in order to provide flashbacks of her life with Zach and her former glory days as a featured dancer. She's even given the eleven o'clock number What I Did For Love a song that originally was written as the dancers' anthem to pursuing the dream of Broadway without regret but is here employed as just another torch ballad. Composer Marvin Hamlish and lyricist Edward Kleban have expressed dissatisfaction with this song claiming the lyrics were too generalized its misuse here unfortunately proves their point. Near the end of the film when Cassie tells Zach that all the dancers on stage are special the words ring hollow not only because of all the screen time she's gotten but because unlike the stage version she's been backstage and away from the audition for the majority of the proceedings.Now and then one gets a glimpse of what A Chorus Line should be. The dancing is good and photographed well and the music though over synthesized for the film and sung by mostly mediocre voices still has impact. But this landmark musical deserved a far more memorable and worthy screen incarnation than it has been given.".

Bennett brought out each dancer's individuality making each a loving welldefined portrait of a human being with all the hopes and dreams problems and shames that everyone has but nobody ever sees. But director Richard Attenborough undermines this essential concept in two very distinct ways.First there is the presence of Michael Douglas as Zach the choreographer who puts the auditioning dancers through the paces. Granted if one must have a name actor in A Chorus Line then this is the place for itZach neither sings nor dances and exists mostly as a Godlike voice issuing from the dark of the auditorium. But Douglas' very presence overshadows the dancers who should be the heart and soul of the show. True his name is listed in the credits alphabetically with everyone else's but every time the camera's on him we go Hey that's Michael Douglas pulling our focus from where it should be.Also pulling focus is the undue emphasis Attenborough puts on Cassie the veteran dancer who was once Zach's lover. Although Zach and Cassie's relationship is a part of the stage show it is but once facet among the many stories told over the evening. Attenborough makes Cassie the central part of the film shortchanging several other characters in order to provide flashbacks of her life with Zach and her former glory days as a featured dancer. She's even given the eleven o'clock number What I Did For Love a song that originally was written as the dancers' anthem to pursuing the dream of Broadway without regret but is here employed as just another torch ballad. Composer Marvin Hamlish and lyricist Edward Kleban have expressed dissatisfaction with this song claiming the lyrics were too generalized its misuse here unfortunately proves their point. Near the end of the film when Cassie tells Zach that all the dancers on stage are special the words ring hollow not only because of all the screen time she's gotten but because unlike the stage version she's been backstage and away from the audition for the majority of the proceedings.Now and then one gets a glimpse of what A Chorus Line should be. The dancing is good and photographed well and the music though over synthesized for the film and sung by mostly mediocre voices still has impact. But this landmark musical deserved a far more memorable and worthy screen incarnation than it has been given.";

	schema:reviewBody "For those who never saw A CHORUS LINE onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film this film is OK as movie musicals nothing special just OK. I have seen the show on Broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that I don't even know where to begin. First of all for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production let me assure you that IRL when you audition for a play the director producer and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer. A real theatrical audition whether it be for a play or a musical rarely takes more than five minutes. If you're auditioning as a dancer you get shown a 64bar dance combination once you do it and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out. Michael Bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little. The play is about these dancers. First of all director Richard Attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the CassieZach relationship and by casting Michael Douglas as Zach. In the play you NEVER see Zach...he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with Cassie is barely touched upon. Cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to Larry a character who is not even in the playwas all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about. Major musical numbers were cut or rethought. The opening number in the play I Hope I Get It shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated. In the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance can you say Audrey Landers. Goodbye 12 Goodbye 13 Hello Love a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as Surprise Surprise mainly a vehicle for the late Gregg Burge as Richie. The show's most famous song What I Did for Love which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance becomes just another standard love song in the film performed tiredly by a miscast Allyson Reed as Cassie. Jeffrey Hornaday's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to Michael Bennett' original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers the choreography has to be special. There are a couple of good dancers in the film the previously mentioned Gregg Burge as Richie Michelle Johnston as Bebe and Janet Jones as Judy but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do yet Audrey Landers who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time is given one of the show's best numbers Dance 10 Looks 3. I will admit that the finale One is dazzling but you have to wait almost two hours for that. I would say that if you never saw A CHORUS LINE onstage this film might be worth a look but if you are a devotee of the original Broadway musical...be afraid...be very afraid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Attenborough's totally ordinary and exasperating screen version of Michael Bennett's brilliant stage musical A Chorus Line is a classic example of how to do everything wrong in a stagetofilm adaptation. First off hire a director who has absolutely no idea how to stage a musical or judge musical talent.  Allow him to hire a cast based on looks and youth as opposed to actual talent update the setting from 1975 to 1985 then let him throw out the original production's groundbreaking choreography as being dated and hire the Flashdance choreographer to create '80's style dance routines that will look ridiculously dated 20 years later. And don't worry if the director doesn't even understand the meaning and purpose of the original show after all the show really isn't about aging dancers hoping for one more show so they can cling onto their dreams for a while longer. No no no.  As he said at the time the show is about kids trying to break into show business.  As a result he doesn't have to even think about hiring the original cast as they are now in their thirties and forties. Note  all this is recounted in the book On the Line by Thommie Walsh and Baayork Lee.Then to top it off allow him to change the focus from the dancers themselves to a corny backstage love story between Zach the choreographer and Cassie the fallen star who has come back to beg her old flame for a job.  Finally take the show's showstopper the beautiful and unforgettable What I did for Love away from Diana give it to Cassie and turn it from an anthem about giving up your life for your dreams into a love song to a jerk.  And make sure you cast a star like Michael Douglas as Zach and then cut to a reaction shot of him a dozen times during the dance numbers even if it is incredibly distracting.  After all people came to see him and not the dancing.I could go on and on but why bother?  The truth is with a couple of exceptions nobody in this cast sings or dances convincingly on a Broadway level and my bet is most wouldn't make it on the dinner theater circuit either.  The exceptions?  Vicki Frederick is a hoot as Sheila the senior and most cynical of the dancers.  Gregg Burge has a fun dance solo in the original tune Surprise Surprise but then they ruin it by having him joined by the rest of the cast.  And Alyson Reed is very good and convincing as Cassie the star.  But why oh why did they replace Cassie's  brilliant solo The Music and the Mirrors  with the terrible original tune Let Me Dance With You?  This and the bowdlerization of What I Did For Love alone sink the film.  Not to mention that the show's other showstopper Dance Ten Looks Three is ruined by the terrible performance of Audrey Landers who was obviously hired due to her gorgeous looks rather than her obvious lack of talent.Any way A Chorus Line is an major disappointment especially now that Rob Marshall and company have shown us how to adapt a musical with his marvelous film version of Chicago which seems headed for a Best Picture Oscar. Ironically both musicals debuted on Broadway the same year 1975 and while A Chorus Line was the bigger hit because they got the film version of Chicago right and this one so wrong Chicago seems destined to go down in history as the better production.  Maybe if they'd waited for a more appropriate director with a real vision for this film things would be different.  Oh the possibilities   out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "On Broadway A Chorus Line was pure magic. From the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged  captivated by the intensely personal stories some funny some clever some stirring of this chorus line. The movie is another matter entirely. The focus is now on the director  and WHAT an ogre he is! Every time the film switches to Michael Douglas there he is with a bitter sour expression barking out questions and orders screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance. Yikes!! That changes the dynamics of the story. On Broadway the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strongfragileintriguinghilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity. There is a reason this work won the Pulitzer Prize! And actually in one of the only moments the director appears he is there to comfort the young Puerto Rican Dancer after we hear that dancer's heartbreaking story. He appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for Cassie. But in the movie from the second Douglas' director starts bitterly barking orders the chorus line members' stories become secondary. It's like they are in a lousy profession where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show is jaded exhausted furious at having to audition these chorus members. On stage there was ALWAYS the excitement of the show. Here in the movie practically from the word go you feel sorry for everyone involved. During the course of the musical we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job! But of course that couldn't happen. But in the Finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage sometimes reflecting us in the audience in our hearts and we know also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much bringing magic to the theatre. In the movie after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis that magic becomes totally diluted. All we feel even with the exact same curtain call is that some of the members got a job with a meanspirited director. So they all come on the screen and are dancing again. Big deal.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Broadway musical A Chorus Line is arguably the best musical in theatre.  It's about the experiences of people who live for dance the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make.  Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite. The film version though captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance whatsoever. The biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to Sir Richard Attenborough whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for Gandhi. Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?Which brings us to the next problem.  A Chorus Line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes.  It's the least flashy of Broadway musicals and its simplicity was its glory.  However that doesn't translate well to film and no one really thought that it would.  For that reason the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers and should have left the theatre and audition process.  The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet jazz or tap class.  Heck they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations.  Yet not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film as Attenborough's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director Michael Douglas whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear and to whom he has no patience. While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play some heretical changes were made.  The very beautiful Hello Twelve Hello Thirteen Hello Lovea smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescencewas removed and replaced with the dreadful Surprise a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar.  Adding insult to injury Surprise simply retold the same story as Hello Love but without the wit or pathos.There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film.  If you want to see a film version of this show the next closest thing is Bob Fosse's brilliant All That Jazz. While Fosse's daughter is in A Chorus Line HE is the Fosse who should have been involved as director.  He would have known what to do with this material which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort.".

The film version though captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance whatsoever. The biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to Sir Richard Attenborough whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for Gandhi. Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?Which brings us to the next problem.  A Chorus Line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes.  It's the least flashy of Broadway musicals and its simplicity was its glory.  However that doesn't translate well to film and no one really thought that it would.  For that reason the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers and should have left the theatre and audition process.  The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet jazz or tap class.  Heck they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations.  Yet not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film as Attenborough's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director Michael Douglas whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear and to whom he has no patience. While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play some heretical changes were made.  The very beautiful Hello Twelve Hello Thirteen Hello Lovea smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescencewas removed and replaced with the dreadful Surprise a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar.  Adding insult to injury Surprise simply retold the same story as Hello Love but without the wit or pathos.There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film.  If you want to see a film version of this show the next closest thing is Bob Fosse's brilliant All That Jazz. While Fosse's daughter is in A Chorus Line HE is the Fosse who should have been involved as director.  He would have known what to do with this material which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort.";

	schema:reviewBody "For anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical A CHORUS LINE the movie is a shoddy substitute. Not only are songs cut but unnecessary plot twists added new dance sequences choreographed and let's face it Richard Attenborough just doesn't know how to film dancers.Onstage Michael Bennett's A CHORUS LINE was just that Michael Bennett. His idea his choreography his direction his gift to Broadway and the rest of the world. It was two hours of hardhitting inyourface realism that really made you feel for these boys and girls. The movie however lacks empathy and depth the actors look like they are auditioning for A CHORUS LINE rather than actually auditioning. Every move every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned Michael Douglas especially as Zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer. Even when he throws his temper tantrums you never quite believe him because every gesture every accented word every nuance is so obviously rehearsed. And as for him not dancing Kevin Kline auditioned for the role of Zach on Broadway. Michael Bennett loved his reading but Kline couldn't dance and ultimately lost the part. How I wish they had done the same for Douglas! A CHORUS LINE is supposed to be a show about nobodies and aside from a few recognizable faces Vicki Frederick who played Cassie on Broadway as Sheila and Khandi Alexander of TV's NewsRadio as one of the many auditioning dancers you're not supposed to KNOW any of these people. Because you DO know these people. Having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision when you focus on Michael Douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories you lose something.It is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show Montage Hello Twelve Hello Thirteen Hello Love is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled Surprise Surprise that surprisingly received a nomination at the Oscars. Cassie's mirror dance has a new song and tragically boring choreography  one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.For fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved. For those who never got to see the original production either on Broadway or on tour this movie is the only reference they will have to go by. And they'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longestrunning musical in Broadway history  until a little show called CATS overtook it in the late 1990's. But THAT is a different story and don't even get me started there.".

Attenborough's direction isn't great either I love Attenborough as a director but his heart didn't seem to be in it here. And personally I didn't like Audrey Landers she was pretty yes but her dancing and such left you feeling someone else could have done the role and better. Finally the pacing is very uneven.

I mean it has to be since the movie is A Chorus Line and that's a big part of it.The actors who portrayed their characters well were Audrey Landers as Val Clark Michael Douglas as Zach and Alyson Reed was pretty okay as Cassie.It was just an okay movie know what I mean? I liked the Broadway version better.";

The lead's girlfriend with their infant son is up from London for the night wanting sex interruptions are constant. Scenes are shot reshot and discarded. The purpose of the project is elusive.

Well you can either make it up as you go along as David Cronenberg did with Naked Lunch or you take this approach and make a film about a film crew making a film of an unfilmable book. The tricky tome in question here is The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy Gentlemen  a bawdy work of wit and wonderment penned in 1760 by clergyman Laurence Sterne.Steve Coogan plays Tristram  even though he's not born by the end of the book  as well as Tristram's father Walter... and himself. Or rather a semifictional version of himself. Rob Brydon also stars as himself and Walter's brother  Tristram's Uncle Toby. There are lots of other familiar British TV actors either playing themselves playing other characters or simply playing characters who interact with the stars of the filmwithinthefilm for example Ian Hart plays the screenwriter but doesn't play Ian Hart. And Gillian Anderson makes an appearance. Confused? Don't worry you won't be.As the writer and director strive to retain the spirit of Shandy compromises have to be made to allow for star egos historical accuracy Mark Williams is excellent as a paininthearse military consultant and a miniscule budget. In one cracking scene the crew watch the 'rushes' of the underwhelming battle scene Look at that! There are literally tens of people... leaving the director in despair and the costume designer in tears.The seemingly complicated setup actually makes a lot of sense with Coogan sending up the naughtyboy persona created for him by the British press and Brydon sending up Coogan while the film itself sends up the moviemaking process. Viewers will be frequently amused but never bewildered as Michael Winterbottom pulls it all together with panache.Anyone unfamiliar with the novel won't learn much but it matters not. Bawdy and barmy A Cock And Bull Story embodies Sterne's work perfectly. Coogan gamely shows his vulnerable side or maybe that's just good acting? and shows terrific rapport with Brydon who steals the show with marvellously mundane banter and spoton impersonations of CooganasAlan Partridge and Roger Moore. Give that man his own movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film so postpostpostmodern that Steve Coogan steps out of the screen and hits on your girlfriend in the theater lobby  I won't say if this is true or not  Tristram Shandy is a meticulously controlled work that despite the filmwithinafilm conceit is very faithful to its impenetrable source. Just like Sterne's book the engine of Winterbottom's film is bittersweet melancholy but the engine noise drowning out what some might consider to be a nihilistic message is bawdy musichall veddy veddy English humor.For Americans to get anything out of this movie you will need to understand a bit about both Tristram Shandy  at least enough to know that Coogan is playing Shandy's FATHER and that Shandy himself is only the narrator  and about Steve Coogan's mythology. For those who are too lazy all you need to know is that Coogan doesn't have a reputation for being led around by his brain. I have briefly met him in person and found the experience uncanny. He is so fully what he is that he seems to have a forcefield around him that separates him from the more amorphous mass of humanity. In the future when you say the word Coogan it will instantly paint a picture of a certain type of male. A type that women are drawn to irresistibly because he is both a child in need of mothering a grown Linus Van Pelt perpetually clutching a security blanket and aggressively sexual and dirty. He's the bad boy and the baby all rolled into one. And yet far from being a jerk or a cad he is intensely likable.All of which goes to show that rarely has any actor been more perfect for a role than Coogan is here. Posing this hapless manchild next to a bull with a huge bazoing pretty much says it all. You see Sterne is not a fan of the procreative arts  and judging by his last few movies neither is Winterbottom Everyone's kid is so special says Samantha Morton in Code 46 Makes you wonder where all the ordinary adults come from.  The title character of Tristram Shandy remains famously unborn and the only characters that Sterne truly loves and who truly love each other are a eunuch and a widow all of which goes to show that Sterne considers death to be a blessing and human existence to be largely unnecessary nothing but the byproduct of mindless sexual flareups that would be quickly forgotten except for the babies they produce who in turn have more sexual flareups and so on. In the film these flareups come courtesy of Steve Coogan playing both himself as a father  and constantly attempting to cheat on his wife as he is famous for doing in real life you may even recall the false alarm that he'd knocked up Courtney Love!  and also the reluctant Shandy's paterfamilias. Between these two Johnny Appleseeds both of whom look like Steve Coogan entire planetary systems could be populated and repopulated.The film is short but dense  every scene has so many dimensions that the end result fans out like a peacock's tail. There are infinite details to sift through in its 90 minute running time and there is a very beautifully done telescoping of time periods to match Tristram Shandy's 18thcentury milieu with that of Steve Coogan's and our own modern day. When Coogan haggles over a script in the lobby of a trendily underlit London hotel you feel somehow transported back to Shandy's father's palatial home and its elegant candlelight. The central scene of the film comes when Coogan escaping from a costume party where the 21st century briefly crashes into the 18th tells his wife I just had a nightmare. That nightmare is called our world reality human as opposed to divine love the world controlled by time yet where nothing really changes except the clothes and the hairstyles and that despite its obvious wretchedness and pain people are too afraid to give up yes the very same cock and bull story of the title. It is not every comedian who has something to say about the human comedy. But Coogan certainly does under Michael Winterbottom's expert and disillusioned hand.".

I've tried to get past the first page of the book but I find that I go into brainfreeze my thumb seeks solace in my mouth and I scrunch into a fetal position not unlike Steve Coogan in the movie. I've come to the conclusion that when a work is so far ahead in the future to be rendered the apex of postmodernism it's probably best to let it alone and have people think you're an intellectual because there it stands in plain view a book with a handsome cover in your bookshelf.An unfilmable novel. Hell an unreadable at that! But here it is the first critical success of 2006 A COCK AND BULL STORY is the film to crack the shell and open the merry chaos that is Lawrence Sterne's crazy universe. Knowing that this novel is no walk in the park for anyone Michael Winterbottom comes up with a mockumentary that details the creation of the movie we're watching which itself is about the adaptation of the book. This loop sets the stage for a flurry of events which transpire at a crazy pace parallel to the events of the book. Star and costar clash on who's the bigger star Tristram's own birth needs more and more takes and then there's the minor issue that Widow Wadman a major player of the novel is nowhere to be seen in the screenplay and in walks Gillian Anderson who is cast as the Widow who's scenes wind up in the cuttingroom floor anyway.Parallel to these events are others that mirror the ones in Federico Fellini's 8 12. Steve Coogan the actor in the movie is married to wife Jenny who has arrived to be with him during this filming with her infant son who will play a part in the movie. Their relationship is not as strained as Guido and Luisa Anselmi but they are seen as on the cusp of being estranged. Carla's equivalent is her polar opposite a film buff who's also part of the production crew also named Jennie who like Carla talks on and on about intricate almost elaborate subtext of symbolisms that Steve succumbs to in one flirtatious scene when she comes on to him. He like Guido returns to his wife though and despite the odds the movie becomes reality  a very skewered one at best and one that leaves the audience saying Huh? That is the main irony and in borrowing the original music score composed by Nino Rota it grounds A COCK AND BULL STORY in 8 12's sense of the absurd that continue even after the credits roll.".

Coogan and Brydon are fantastic. The scene with Coogan and a hot chestnut down his trousers is worth the price of admission alone! Although the film may not be to everyone's taste  it darts around and has little respect for narrative logic or continuity as does the book it is a freeform little gem that really does cement Winterbottom's reputation as the most exciting British director out there. Any person who can make In This World Code 46 9 Songs and then this in a row is worthy of respect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tristram Shandy the complex novel by Laurence Sterne comes to the screen thanks to the adaptation and direction of Micahel Winterbottom a man that likes to take risks. The idea of mixing the goings on of a film being made based on the novel and the people behind the project presents some original ideas about what goes on behind the scenes.This film within a film showcases the talents of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon two funny English comedians that haven't been seen much on this side of the Atlantic but who are quite well known in the U.K.The Sterne novel is just a pretext for making sense of the book which presents tremendous challenge to the movie makers. On the one level we see the story of the birth of the hero of the novel and on the other we watch a somewhat conceited actor going through the process of the filming as he and the company socialize in a posh hotel.The basic premise of the film presents a problem with American audiences drawn to the film by the good notices it received from the local critics. Judging the reaction of the audience the other day at the Angelika one wonders if the film was understood as almost no laughter could be heard in response to some of the clever and funny things happening on the screen. In fact it seems baffling to this viewer the response of what appeared to be an audience of mostly cool NYU students.What Mr. Winterbottom gets is excellent acting from most of this multi talented cast. Steve Coogan with his deadpan delivery and Rob Brydon his sidekick come out as the winners. Their timing is impeccable and their chemistry is real. Some of the other people in the cast include Shirley Henderson Stephen Fry Kelly MacDonald Ian Hart Jeremy Northam Naomie Harris Gillian Anderson and some other talented English actors too many to mention all.The excellent musical score by Michael Nyman enhances all what we are watching. Marcel Zyskind's cinematography gives the right look to the film. Ultimately all credit for making the film the fun it is goes to Michael Winterbottom.".

The DVD and it's extras were mentioned a lot but nothing was said about it being released at the cinema...so I don't know if that's still happening? I was extremely surprised by the whole thing actually as I have tried several times to read the book and I just don't understand it...so was expecting to not understand the film either but it was great...it did jump around a bit but he told you when he was getting ahead of himself so you always knew where you were and it was easy to follow.The blank page was discussed when they were talking about how to make the film longer...and they showed a blank screen for a few moments before deciding that the audience wouldn't find it that interesting...it was then that they decided that they would include the Widow Wadman scenes and talked about who should play her.Rob Brydon then had quite a funny scene with Steve Coogan saying that he couldn't possibly do the love scenes with Gillian Anderson as he has posters of her and owns the entire XF collection and she is his absolute complete ideal woman and how he has sexual feelings for her which I found rather funny.So yeah it was incredibly funny! I have never laughed that much at a film in my entire life. The funniest parts were between Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as themselves and as Michael Winterbottom told us in the QA afterwards they were pretty much adlibbed. Also liked the scene in the barn where they lowered Steve Coogan upside down into massive fake womb...and then proceeded to have an argument with him about how realistic it was! ".

Hard to imagine that anyone could come up with an idea to bring this unusual book to the screen and Michael Winterbottom hasn't been the most consistent of directors lately or ever really but this is a winner. The story is told in several layers a film is being made of the novel Tristram Shandy starring Steve Coogan as both Tristram and his father Walter Shandy but the behind the scenes drama of the making of the film is an important component. And lots of parallels with the various players real lives Steve Coogan and lap dancers etc. Incredibly clever. Definitely check it out.".

	schema:headline " Messy and a bit too postmodern and smartarsed for some I'm sure but for me it was just a great deal of fun and a lot of laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "Before getting on to what I thought of the film let's just get some of the big problems out in the open. Firstly those looking for an adaptation of the book will be disappointed to find that very little of the content is on the screen because the script uses it more as a frame and a guide for essentially a behindthescenes mockumentary about making the film of the book. It does go someway to backing up the claim that the book is unfilmable because this film certainly hasn't managed it. Secondly by being all postmodern and having actors playing a version of themselves the film will alienate viewers who don't get it and feel that it is all too clever for its own good likewise it may have people feeling that it has all been done before  indeed by the very same people in fact.However that said it is hard for me to ignore the fact that it was tremendous fun. Taking its lead from the novel's constant digressions the film cannot stick on anything long and as we open the film jumping around the events around Tristram's birth we soon find that we have jumped behind the scenes and into the lives of those involved. It is a brave move and one that doesn't totally work but it is surprisingly easy to go along with. In terms of the treatment of the novel I felt it did well because it made me want to read the book. We are told enough about the novel to develop an interest in it and know what it is about and it may be a very wise decision to have avoided tackling something that everyone says couldn't be done. Some parts of the book are told as they would have been in a proper filmed version but some are not  one scene is actually Coogan's nightmare and features Brydon playing his big scene with Gillian Anderson with a Roger Moore impression.In the place of a straight adaptation what we get is a wonderfully funny look at stars period dramas British filmmaking celebrities and so on. It has very little structure to speak of but what it does have is a natural development humour and delivery that makes it interesting and constantly fresh. I wasn't laughing every second because it isn't that type of comedy but occasionally it was very funny producing some great scenes and some great dry wit. The story if there is one focuses on Coogan  his pedantic fame his exploits and generally the exaggerated version of himself that he has played before. This keeps the film moving forward by providing one central point of reference for everything else to happen around so although it does feel very fragmented and distracted really it is more structured than it appears. The most amusing moments do come from the postmodern looks at Coogan's insecurities the contrast of his family life with the exploits with the stripper etc and generally it makes the film interesting because it does convince as a reality of a sort. Having said that though the film does have some hysterical bits that just hang there by themselves for example Brydon's Coogan impressions are hilarious as is the Al Pacino discussion over the end credits.The cast list reads like a who's who of British film and television  some in main roles but many in semicameos who do the goods and then move on. Coogan is naturally the star no matter what Brydon thinks! and although he has played a version of himself or addressed the camera in a postmodern way before it still works well here. He is convincing and natural and it helps the film produce this reality that it really does heavily rely on. Brydon perhaps relies a bit too heavily on impressions but generally he is just as good and the scenes he shares with Coogan tend to be some of the funniest. Although she has largely been overlooked as the critics name names and hand out praise I think that Naomi Harris deserves a lot of credit for her performance here. Left with a more serious thread to carry she turns in a totally convincing performance to the point where I could easily believe this is who she is. She also produces an engaging thread around her desire for Coogan despite having little to work with. I'll admit that I have liked her in most things I have seen her do find her very attractive and did slightly fall for her chilled cool dressing film buff character ok a bit more than slightly but I still thought she was easily the best performance in the whole film.The rest of the cast work well within the reality of the film and generally produce laughs. Faces like Moran Fry and Walliams provide some comedy but are little more than cameos. Northam and Anderson are good and support is generally very good from people like Macdonald Hart Henderson and others. Winterbottom pulls off the seemingly impossible of holding it all together as director and moving well within the novel and reality  both in terms of story telling but also visually.Overall this will please as many people as it psses off I think. Taking the manner of telling of the novel distracted and digressing the film moves from a straight telling into a spoof of reality. Saying it like this sounds dull and seen it all before but it is an impressive piece of filmmaking that is brave and even better works. As brilliant as it is flawed this is certainly worth a try whether you know the book or not because simply put it is tremendous tumultuous fun.".

	schema:headline " Lots of Cleverness and some Wit but  I do fear  not quite enough Shandy";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Winterbottom's movie is an Altmanesque production depicting an English crew shooting Laurence's Sterne's eccentric eighteenthcentury literary classic. It begins wittily and appropriately with Steve Coogan exchanging mocking banter with costar Rob Bryden and then Coogan with cosmetically enlarged and crooked nose and proper costume becomes Shandy introducing himself. The essentials of the book are sketched in  first of all Tristram's meandering account of his childhood and birth not in any logical order  nor should they be  and intersperced with Coogan's caustic comments on the child actors playing him at earlier stages  which perfectly fits in with Sterne's tendency to interrupt himself on the slightest pretext then Uncle Toby Rob Briden and his obsession with his exploits at the Battle of Naumur which include an injury whose location he studiously avoids explicating. The mishaps surrounding Tristram's birth start with his name and move on to the forceps  then a new device  whose clumsy use by Dr. Slop cause the altered nose. A falling window caused even more crucial damage. The moment of birth is dwelt upon  then the camera cuts back to the crew and the focus shifts to the CooganBryden rivalry again Steve's girlfriend and their baby his own problems in bed his flirtation with a palecoffeecolored lady crew member who's a great film buff. Coogan wants his shoes made with higher heels so he's taller than Bryden. The filmmakers hold endless confabs over how to do a battle scene and whether to bring in the romance with Widow Wadham to be played by Gillian Anderson who agrees from Los Angeles with comic alacrity. Anderson's presence brings in more money for the battle and then both the battle and the romance are left out of the final cut. Much hilarity accompanies these details though the main focus is on Coogan's stardom and inability to have a minute to himself. Unfortunately once Winterbottom pulls away from the birth scene the Sterne novel which pretty much ranks with Fielding's Tom Jones for brilliance and humor somewhat falls by the wayside never to be recovered till just before the end when it seems tacked back in as a hasty afterthought. And hasty is one thing Sterne never is impulsive and quirky but never never never  oh my Heavens No!  not rushed. At novel's end his main character after all has still not been born. Maybe it means something that only one member of the cast is reported to have ever actually read Tristram Shandy through to the end. Neither Coogan nor Bryden seems particularly eighteenthcentury in their role and Bryden's isn't a particularly inspired recreation of Uncle Toby. Nobody is amiably eccentric to the right degree. Winterbottom has made an intermittently quite funny movie that never loses its pace but he has recreated Robert Altman rather than Laurence Sterne and when you realize this if you care at all about the novel the whole enterprise despite its frantic energy becomes for all its wit and good humor a little bit of a drag. This is an enormously clever film but what seems brilliant on paper doesn't always play for keeps.".

Coogan wants his shoes made with higher heels so he's taller than Bryden. The filmmakers hold endless confabs over how to do a battle scene and whether to bring in the romance with Widow Wadham to be played by Gillian Anderson who agrees from Los Angeles with comic alacrity. Anderson's presence brings in more money for the battle and then both the battle and the romance are left out of the final cut. Much hilarity accompanies these details though the main focus is on Coogan's stardom and inability to have a minute to himself. Unfortunately once Winterbottom pulls away from the birth scene the Sterne novel which pretty much ranks with Fielding's Tom Jones for brilliance and humor somewhat falls by the wayside never to be recovered till just before the end when it seems tacked back in as a hasty afterthought. And hasty is one thing Sterne never is impulsive and quirky but never never never  oh my Heavens No!  not rushed. At novel's end his main character after all has still not been born. Maybe it means something that only one member of the cast is reported to have ever actually read Tristram Shandy through to the end. Neither Coogan nor Bryden seems particularly eighteenthcentury in their role and Bryden's isn't a particularly inspired recreation of Uncle Toby. Nobody is amiably eccentric to the right degree. Winterbottom has made an intermittently quite funny movie that never loses its pace but he has recreated Robert Altman rather than Laurence Sterne and when you realize this if you care at all about the novel the whole enterprise despite its frantic energy becomes for all its wit and good humor a little bit of a drag. This is an enormously clever film but what seems brilliant on paper doesn't always play for keeps.";

I'm a fan of Steve Coogan and have been for years but this film was absolute rubbish. I watch many films sometimes 3 a day and this is one of the few times i had to consider switching off before the end like Ultraviolet and HPGoblet of Fire.Granted there are several funny scenes and granted its based on a book.BUT FOR GODS SAKE why would you make a film this boring ? I'm not sure if its the editing done in the style of the book but i would happily agree that Tristram shandy is indeed impossible to make into a film so why would they bother ? All i saw was Coogan and Brydon making mediocre jokes sometimes doing the same joke to death in one scene and supporting cast with no real characters in apart from Mark Williams of the Fast Show as a detailmad Historian.Maybe Coogan should hang up his traffic cone ? Only funny bits for me were Brydons impressions of Coogan and Pacino and the Hot Chestnut incident. But they are not enough to save this crap film. Finally after reading other reviews id like to add Anyone who berates the viewers intelligence for disliking this film or blames it on the fact they haven't read the book is a pretentious moron who obviously thinks too highly of themselves even those with the lowest IQ should be able to appreciate a moving picture.Avoid it like the plague.".

TRISTRAM SHANDY is a thinking man's comedy with jokes inside jokes inside jokes.For those who aren't familiar with the title THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENTLEMAN this is in reference to the 18th century literary paperweight composing nine volumes written by Laurence Sterne famous author John Updike has been quoted as saying It's the one novel I want to read before I die. Considered a comedy ahead of its time it caught on quickly with the upper class and became quite a success. But as times changed so did the literary climate and now the volumes are seen as ...well ...voluminous. Attempting to make a coherent film out of something so incoherently nonlinear certainly would present a challenge too so I was quite surprised to see that the books had been translated to the silver screen.Or so I thought...The amazing thing about this movie is that it did something completely unexpected it stayed true to Laurence Sterne's style being possibly the first example of stream of consciousness writing but did so by not attempting to tell the story of Tristram Shandy at all. I found this to be one of the funniest aspects of the movie. I could picture the directors and producers in a room talking about the impossibility of turning the books into film and then someone saying Hey why don't we not even try? So in the spirit of its original author that's exactly what these film makers did.The story starts out with a film maker Steve Coogan director trying to tell the story of Tristram Shandy while living a life within the movie itself. Basically it's the story of a man trying to make a film about a film within a film. It can seem somewhat confusing as the audience is ripped through scenes unsure of where and  most importantly  when they are. To try and tell you how the movie flows would be absolutely impossible because it has no flow ...and yet it does. The laughs are surprising and often hidden so a watcher might have to view it several times before connecting with all of the gags the only exception being when they try to show how funny the film's going to be by dropping a hot chestnut down a man's pants ...seeing that might be worth the price of admission for some.I was surprisingly riveted to the screen throughout the movie worried that I might miss something Is the battle scene over? Will it be in the film they're trying to make? Will there be a love scene with Gillian Anderson?.I think this film might get panned by quite a few professional reviewers because it is so different than anything we're used to as moviegoers. But the high comedy can't be denied. It's sheer genius how it all came together and watch for the running joke on poor British dental hygiene throughout the film.".

	schema:headline " Please read the book don't bother with this smug shallow film";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw A Cock  Bull Story at the London Film Festival last year. The film should do well it's been very heavily publicised has wellknown comedy actors in it and  when I saw it  the packed house loved it. The film is enjoyable primarily because of Steve Coogan's and Rob Brydon's seemingly adlibbed comedy but as a version of  or even tribute to  Sterne's Tristram Shandy it fails miserably. The film barely grasps the character of this anti novel at all. I blame director Michael Winterbottom for this. The book's tangential narratives are too briefly handled in the first half to leave the viewer with any real sense of Tristram's gargantuan project. The film's first half races along at breakneck pace presumably to suggest a madcap hilarious confusion to Tristram's narrative  but all I was left with was the feeling that the director was terrified Joe Public might be bored by the boring old eighteenth century. The alltoojaunty pace suggests a lack of faith in the novel's comedy and a lack of faith in the viewer's intelligence. Tristram Shandy is a very funny book and the humour is evident without such forced jauntiness. Sterne is a notably playful and generous novelist he loves his readers and never displays a lack of faith in them. The film's lack of faith in itself as well as in its audience is also evident in its rendering of the famous black page  discussed by director writer and actors as to whether it is possible to put the trope of a black page into a film at all. Suddenly the screen goes black! ... but the soundtrack remains and the discussion continues for five seconds before the audience is reassuringly given back the visuals again. If Winterbottom had Sterne's resolve and experimental touch he would have kept the screen black without sound for say fifteen seconds. Making your audience uncomfortable doesn't mean you don't respect them! And what of the actual discussion of the viability of putting the black page in the film? A more courageous experimental filmdirector wouldn't have flinched from doing it let alone chat about it in an ohso funny way. Can you imagine Godard having such qualms? The other big problem with this film is its filmwithinafilm conceit. It's all about the impossibility of getting a film made and of faithfully rendering Tristram Shandy which itself is about the impossibility of faithfully rendering the complexity of life  geddit? If you don't Stephen Fry is on hand to explain this to you in the manner of a patient uncle at the end of the film. Not only is this a wretched simplification of the book's theme about art and artifice but this theme is itself just one amongst many themes in the book. Tristram Shandy handles these themes with humour and experimental elan but A Cock  Bull Story sticks rigidly to its one theme wearily restating it again and again rather than going any deeper in a way that is more listless than joyfully experimental. What follows on screen is a sort of comedy soapopera of the prurience that is wrapped up with celebrity something that has nothing to do with the novel. Some of this soapopera is indeed very funny but not as funny as say Marion  Geoff or Alan Partridge. If Winterbottom had tried to stick to the novel  a truly courageous and difficult undertaking  instead of heading into the usual fundamentgazing about media and celebrity that masquerades as analysis and filmic experimentation then A Cock  Bull Story would have been wonderful. As it is the film is rather like what Steve Coogan put on the spot by Tony Wilson says about the novel 'I suppose it's kind of ... a postmodern masterpiece before er there was any modern to be post about.' A nice joke but one that resounds hollow when applied to the film itself. In other words the film is generally a load of Bull read the book instead! Corporal Trim".

Always forced to miss events out unable to capture the emotions there's loads of reasons why particular books can't be turned into cinema. Still that's no reason not to try.Rather than trying to actually film the actual book of Tristram Shandy director Michael Winterbottom has hit upon a superb idea. Turning the trial of the filming into a film in it's own right Winterbottom has created a fun piece of entertainment. At the same time however as a result of the participation of Steve Coogan far too many jokes are a direct reference to his former comic hit Alan Partridge. This in itself is a direct stab at how people perceive him but it's only really needed once not however multiple times we get it.Michael Winterbottom Jeremy Northam is filming the unfilmable. Hiring Steve Coogan to play Tristrum Shandy and Rob Brydon as Captain Toby Shandy he's gathered two great actors to play two great roles. How much of the film actually needs to be made though and is it really that possible? From the offset you can tell the film is going to be funny. Thanks to the magnificent pairing of Coogan and Brydon you've fallen off your chair in laughter five times before the film has even properly began. It's a daft affair and that partnership really drives the story perfectly.That is the film would be hilarious if we could get past Alan Partridge. The Coogan character of many years for so much of the film we are constantly given Rob Brydon's impression. The first time we hear it there is a knowing laugh. After multiple times though and the joke begins to get lame. It's a repetitive joke and even for those in the know it gets incredibly tiresome.Still aside from the injokes the film can be funny for long periods. Aiding Coogan Brydon and Northam are the best of British comedy. Ronni Ancona Keeley Hawes Dylan Moran Shirley Henderson and David Walliams the list goes on. Add to the magnificent list a brief appearance by Gillian Anderson and thus a few XFiles jokes and you know the story is going to be good.Often funny but perhaps too focused on the repetitive poke at cast history Tristram Shandy is a clever enough film. It'll keep the audience entertained and it'll leave you with a smile on your face. That's all you need really.".

Thanks to the magnificent pairing of Coogan and Brydon you've fallen off your chair in laughter five times before the film has even properly began. It's a daft affair and that partnership really drives the story perfectly.That is the film would be hilarious if we could get past Alan Partridge. The Coogan character of many years for so much of the film we are constantly given Rob Brydon's impression. The first time we hear it there is a knowing laugh. After multiple times though and the joke begins to get lame. It's a repetitive joke and even for those in the know it gets incredibly tiresome.Still aside from the injokes the film can be funny for long periods. Aiding Coogan Brydon and Northam are the best of British comedy. Ronni Ancona Keeley Hawes Dylan Moran Shirley Henderson and David Walliams the list goes on. Add to the magnificent list a brief appearance by Gillian Anderson and thus a few XFiles jokes and you know the story is going to be good.Often funny but perhaps too focused on the repetitive poke at cast history Tristram Shandy is a clever enough film. It'll keep the audience entertained and it'll leave you with a smile on your face. That's all you need really.";

	schema:reviewBody "The publicity and acclaim for this film circles round the notion that director Michael Winterbottom is filming an 'unfilmable' novel Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy' making a witty postmodern exercise in cleverness with injokes references to other films and echoes of other films about the making of films Fellini's 8 12 inane comic banter etc. But for me that that smacks of defensiveness and selfjustification a worry that the way this book has been approached is something that might have sounded good in practise but doesn't work well in theory because it is too flimsy a way of working too narrow a view of what the book is about to construct an entire film around. I'll expand in fact the first 20 minutes or so make a decent stab of filming the book switching backwards and forwards in time breaking the linear narrative structure that most films tend to use in a far more complicated way than the flashbacks you sometimes get having Steve Coogan as Tristram give direct to camera addresses as he narrates the story of his character's life and with different actors playing the same characters Coogan as Tristram announces that he is also going to play his father as there is a 'family resemblance'  a nice touch whereby he acknowledges that he is acting but remains 'in character'  certainly not that conventional but not as irrelevant as the rest of the film which comes across a bit like an episode of Ricky Gervais' TV series 'Extras' without the sharp social observation and cringeworthy brilliance. The problems start when without warning in a pregnancy scene we suddenly hear 'Cut' and see the film crew whereupon we are rushed backstage as Coogan now playing himself goes to various meetings doesn't have sex with his girlfriend deals with a journalist who knows that he DID have sex with a poledancer this a particularly puzzling incident treated in a surprisingly casual way cracks jokes with costar Rob Brydon complains about his costume and so on ad infinitum. We see Coogan and and Brydon sitting in a viewing theatre along with various other people involved with the film's making commenting on the rushes of the film they're making that battle looks like it's been filmed with about 10 men  of course this is a scene which is actually in the film we're watching  oh how clever and postmodern...  such touches abound. It's all very obvious and must have sounded good in theory  we'll echo the dislocation of the book by making a dislocated film but it really doesn't work in practise. In one scene Coogan is being interviewed about the film he is makingTony Wilson Why Tristram Shandy? This is the book that many people said is unfilmable. Steve Coogan I think that's the attraction. Tristram Shandy was a postmodern classic written before there was any modernism to be post about. So it was way ahead of its time and in fact for those who haven't heard of it it was actually listed as number eight on the Observer's top 100 books of all time. Tony Wilson That was a chronological list. The problem with this is that we're not sure how seriously to take it. Is the joke poking fun at Coogan's lack of knowledge of the project he's at work on merely there for a laugh? Is Winterbottom making his points through interviewer Wilson's mouth in which case wow. Yes we know it's aheadofitstime but is there any intrinsic value in that? Is it a comment on the way we try to categorise and pigeonhole 'greatness'? Such ambiguity characterises much of the film  nothing wrong with ambiguity but it helps if it has a discernible purpose even if that purpose has to be dug out carefully with an intellectual scalpel. To me what we have is ultimately the sight and sound oh! filmrelated reference! did you notice? of a smug and selfsatisfied director making yet another injoke to be trendy and postmodern about being trendy and postmodern...This impressions is exacerbated by the glimpses we get of what they're filming a battle scene Stephen Fry as Parson Yorrick Coogan as Tristram suspended in a giant womb which suggest that it would have been a much more satisfying viewing experience to make 'the film of the book' rather than the faked behindthescenesacted film masquerading as documentary of the making of the film of the book...So to sum up. The plot summary here on IMDb says this interruptions are constant. Scenes are shot reshot and discarded. The purpose of the project is elusive. Fathers and sons men and women cocks and bulls. Life is amorphous too full and too rich to be captured in one narrative. This last sentence is roughly what Stephen Fry says when he suddenly pops up to explain what the novel is 'about'. It's a bizarre moment  almost as if Winterbottom is worried the audience won't 'get' what he's doing so he's trying to smooth their brows and reassure them that there's a point to all this. But I'm not convinced it needed to be done this way  for me all the behindthescenes ramblings doesn't really get us anywhere. The book was packed with incident and character  this has a fair amount of incident but few very interesting characters especially as we know that Coogan and Brydon are playing fairly unsympathetic versions of themselves and are thus 'not really like that' and if all it's there for is to say if it can condense the whole book into just the one idea  that life is too full to be captured in one narrative  then I'm not convinced it's worth doing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tristam Shandy A Cock  Bull Story is one of the better movies I've seen in recent memory about the mix of filming the reality of a period piece. Actually it's a hilarious piece with director Michael Winterbottom and star Steve Coogan at the top of their games and in a movie within a movie no less. At first one might scoff at the idea of their being a movie about a movie of the novel Tristam Shandy as it's such a prestigious book but it works because of the filmmaker's abandon with the material it practically becomes a master's class in what to do with the reality of British humor on a situation. Coogan knows when it's right to play the card of the 'oh I didn't know that was happening' hand and Winterbottom knows very well how to interject the Fellini 8 12 style into a novel that is according to all other accounts practically unfilmable. This challenge ends up making it one of the more delightfully done films about the art of moviemaking. Bottom line Tristam Shandy is a period novel set in the 19th century where war and birthright is made paramount in a world of British aristocracy and where that first gets lampooned with Coogan and his cohorts sitting back as his 'wife' gives birth to what is really his character as well with a very cooked nose what follows that is a deconstruction of how to adapt a book into a film and how that becomes almost as interesting as the book they were originally basing it on.Now this ends up sort of making the film clever more by half but not quite. There's a lot about this that the filmmakers intentionally take from other movies while commenting on the very real process of making movies where 8 12 music fits in very well alongside selections from Fanny  Alexander and Barry Lyndon. Coogan becomes a character unto himself as he did in Coffee  Cigarettes as does his lovestruck assistant who is attached to foreign films and there's even a very touching scene where Coogan in real life changes a baby's diapers and takes care of it for a moment. Life mirrors the ridiculousness of the film's absurd selfreflection however as Coogan in one of the funniest moments I've seen in recent memory has to prepare to climb inside of a fake womb meant for the production I'm climbing inside of a womb he says I think. But meanwhile the actual adaptation tried to wedge in room so to speak into the film about the film itself. So Tristam Shandy ends up like it or not fansofthebook as a reflexive take on what it is to adapt something to really get under the heels of a work in filmmaking and attempt it and even come close but that what goes on behind the scenes probably has an equal level of interest as the actual material does itself.Watch for the injokes and other movie references including a dropdead funny end credit sequence with Coogan imitating Pacino and a one little scene involving a certain object when Coogan tried out a nut right near his genitals. It's extremely sharp filmmaking and one of the better films of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story review by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating 2 out of 4Director Michael Winterbottom Cast Steve Coogan Rob Brydon Kelly Macdonald Screenplay Frank Cottrell Boyce MPAA Classification R language and sexual contentMichael Winterbottom is in the business of brilliance. He hops about the lilly pads of every genre continually attempting to innovate how we view the cinema. With his latest outing Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story Winterbottom tries desperately to bridge a character through two stories. His goal as simple as it may initially seem is to translate Laurence Sterne's 1759 novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy a book infamously named the unfilmable book. And if there's anything clear about this film at all it's that whoever mentioned the book to be unfilmable was assuredly correct. The film opens in the makeup department with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing themselves before heading out to the Tristram Shandy set remarking on the discoloration of Brydon's teeth. We then cut to the actual Tristram Shandy film with Tristram also played by Coogan walking about explaining the film's title. We then flip back to the set where Coogan's juggling a strained relationship with his wife Jenny Kelly Macdonald and another Jennie Naomie Harris who works as his assistant. The film continues like this flipping back and forth between movie and set ignoring any attempt to form a linear narrative. Winterbottom's challenge is to blend Coogan's on and offscreen character into the same Tristram Shandy to blend Sterne's novel across the set of the film and the actual film. Confusing isn't it? Well it's actually not that confusing in reality. It's just annoying. Winterbottom has a smart idea on his hands but doesn't have a clue how to make it work. The film comes across scatterbrained and ridiculous without direction or a care in the world. It's random in its narrative and fails to bridge the gap between mockumentary and straightcut adaptation. It seems to be stuck in second gear without any interest to shift up or down. That said second gear isn't the worst of places for a film to be. Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan are both worthy entertainers and each have enough precision with their comic timing to keep the audience smiling. Coogan reprises his role from Coffee  Cigarettes where he also played himself arrogantly striding about and taking advantage of his celebrity status. The relationships Coogan deals with throughout the film thankfully take an air of realism. He's often stuck between playing a dad a lover and an actor. He deals with each poorly and the consequences are skillfully handled by screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce. And although the film is fragmented and frankly irrelevant Boyce's dialogue is never indulgent and rings true with crispy clean comic clarity oh the alliteration!.Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story is in truth a difficult film for a critic. There's talent behind the pen of the writer and talent behind the camera and talent also in the actors' performances. But it's as though all these talents failed to agree on the proposed outcome. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy is not adapted here. There are only remnants of that work and fragments of dozens of other works scattered about the film's 94 minute running length. We can laugh at times and feel the sting of pathos in moments of the romance but when looked at from afar Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story is an ocean that was divvied up into a thousand little puddles none of which wanting to have anything to do with the other. www.samseescinema.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story review by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating 2 out of 4Director Michael Winterbottom Cast Steve Coogan Rob Brydon Kelly Macdonald Screenplay Frank Cottrell Boyce MPAA Classification R language and sexual contentMichael Winterbottom is in the business of brilliance. He hops about the lilly pads of every genre continually attempting to innovate how we view the cinema. With his latest outing Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story Winterbottom tries desperately to bridge a character through two stories. His goal as simple as it may initially seem is to translate Laurence Sterne's 1759 novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy a book infamously named the unfilmable book. And if there's anything clear about this film at all it's that whoever mentioned the book to be unfilmable was assuredly correct. The film opens in the makeup department with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing themselves before heading out to the Tristram Shandy set remarking on the discoloration of Brydon's teeth. We then cut to the actual Tristram Shandy film with Tristram also played by Coogan walking about explaining the film's title. We then flip back to the set where Coogan's juggling a strained relationship with his wife Jenny Kelly Macdonald and another Jennie Naomie Harris who works as his assistant. The film continues like this flipping back and forth between movie and set ignoring any attempt to form a linear narrative. Winterbottom's challenge is to blend Coogan's on and offscreen character into the same Tristram Shandy to blend Sterne's novel across the set of the film and the actual film. Confusing isn't it?

The pretty complex story with a lot of strange and maybe almost unbelievable coincidences. And you don't get a simple positive character for identification. Exact the same way many french thrillers from the good old times were working especially those of Clouzot. Though sometimes these films seem a bit too overconstructed and I must admit I had this problem when I first saw Clouzot's Les Diaboliques 1955.

He can't move with his life so his neighbor Emmanuelle Bart who has a crush on him tries to help him by trying to find this killer. Easy? Maybe. So she picks a random taxi driver Harvey Keitel and starts to get involved with this strange guy and she's gonna invent that this guy is really the killer of Vincent's wife. And then...The story behind the movie A Crime is one of those intriguing stories where the next movement the next step is always awaited. There are many surprises not in that clichd sense of plot twists but just in the way that you can't see the obvious it doesn't exist here. A quiet and slow paced story where the development of the characters and their actions is more important than to really know if they're gonna find the killer or what's gonna happen with Roger the taxi driver. But this is not a perfect screenplay there's few things wrong with it the beginning was way too fast in one moment Vincent see his wife dead and then the movie leaps three years later and his first moments with his neighbor are quite strange not well explained. But besides that the movie floats very well and leaves the viewer wanting more of it. A Crime runs about 100 minutes but I think that it could be more longer specially in terms of characters development mostly Vincent showing the previous life of the main characters and things like that because these characters are presented and we're feel like Can we like these characters? What's their reason behind their actions? It misses much.The performances are good most notably Harvey Keitel How come this guy gets incredible roles where he has to perform erotic scenes at the age of 60? Things that even younger actors don't do frequently and I'm even comparing him with his young costar Reedus who only has one scene with Bart and it's not even close of Keitel's seductive scenes with Bart. Bart was quite convincible in some parts as the desperate woman who wants to be with Vincent but instead she got trapped and got romantically and sexually involved with the taxi driver. I really liked Norman Reedus mysterious performance here but I wished he could have more scenes and a better character development. Most of his lines are whispered so I advise you to turn up the volume or you're probably miss what he's saying. A surprising effective and great film to watch. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to admit straight off of the bat that the only reason I watched this film was because I'm a huge Norman Reedus fan. I'm also going to immediately admit that the only reason I continued watching this film once I got past the half hour point was also because of Norman Reedus.The plot of the film has plenty of potential and perhaps in another director's hands could have been a thrilling emotional drama. What we actually receive however is a film sorely lacking in emotion and character development. This applies to the plot as well the murder of Vincent's wife which should have felt like the driving force of the story was really more like a brief point. In addition the entire movie seems to be lacking in motivation many aspects that could have been explored further are left unexplained or simply ignored. I also had to suspend realism at a number of points especially regarding Alice's seduction of Roger basically happening in one night.Of all the characters Alice's was most underdeveloped and it almost feels like the writers didn't even make an attempt to make her likable. Indeed over the course of the film the only things I truly felt towards her were anger and childish annoyance. This is a role that could have been written much much better and that improvement alone most likely would have changed the entire film. Every movie does have a highlight however and the highlight of A Crime happens to be the acting of Norman Reedus and Harvey Keitel. The latter gives a quietly menacing slightly creepy performance as cab driver Roger and Norman although underutilized plays his role to the best of his ability.Overall if you're a Norman Reedus or Harvey Keitel fan or are extremely bored on a weekend give the film a try. Otherwise there are much better 'noir' films that you could view.".

Indeed over the course of the film the only things I truly felt towards her were anger and childish annoyance. This is a role that could have been written much much better and that improvement alone most likely would have changed the entire film. Every movie does have a highlight however and the highlight of A Crime happens to be the acting of Norman Reedus and Harvey Keitel. The latter gives a quietly menacing slightly creepy performance as cab driver Roger and Norman although underutilized plays his role to the best of his ability.Overall if you're a Norman Reedus or Harvey Keitel fan or are extremely bored on a weekend give the film a try. Otherwise there are much better 'noir' films that you could view.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yes Harvey Keitel is in this. Yes he gets naked.Yes Emmanuelle Beart is in this. Yes she gets naked.Yes this is a European production of an American crime drama. Yes it sucks.A Crime attempts to weld together a US style psychological thriller complete with a couple of big twists that anyone can see coming with a existentialist examination of love and obsession right out of French cinema. Maybe that's not such a bad idea but this movie is the worst of all possible worlds. It's as boring and pretentious as any art house Euro flick while also being as vacuous and preposterous as any other piece of crap that gets cobbled together in the States. As a general rule I try to watch a movie straight through no matter how bad it is. It's the best way to capture the full effect and it's only fair to the folks who made it. Every so often though I run into a motion picture where I can't stand it. I have to stop the film at some point get up out of my chair and shake off the despair and ennui. A Crime is one of those movies.Vincent Harris Norman Reedus is a man whose wife was murdered 3 years ago and the only lead is the taxi he saw leaving their home a gash in the side and the driver wearing a red jacket and a big shiny ring. Now Vincent lives in a Brooklyn apartment and races his pet greyhound that never wins. Alice Parker Emmanuelle Beart is Vincent's neighbor a frequent drunk who's desperately in love with him. Or at least some desperate approximation of what she thinks love is. Vincent is fixated on finding his wife's killer. We know that because Alice and a police detective Joe Grifasi specifically describe Vincent in those terms. For his part Vincent doesn't do anything to justify that description until the film is almost halfway over and then he doesn't appear to be fixated. He acts like he's utterly off his rocker but I guess the filmmakers realized they had to do something to demonstrate Vincent's alleged obsession or the 2nd half of the movie would make no sense at all.Convinced that Vincent will never be her's until he locates his wife's murderer Alice heads out and seduces a cabbie named Roger Culkin Harvey Keitel. She beds him gets him to fall off the AA wagon puts a gash in the side of his cab and has him don a red jacket and a big shiny ring. Then she pushes Roger and Vincent together andbingo!So to sum up at this point in A Crime we've got a pathetic wretch who manipulates a crazy guy into killing another guy who has a headband and a boomerang. Oh yeah. I forgot that Roger Culkin has a headband and a boomerang. It wouldn't normally be a big deal but those two things pretty much define his entire character.It turns out that Alice's scheme works and she and Vincent wind up in each other's arms. Then Roger resurfaces and although I sorely hoped that he was a ghost or Alice's hallucination he's real and his brush with death turned him into some sort of taxi cab supercriminal who exists outside the law. He demands Alice run away with him or he'll turn Vincent in as an attempted murderer. But then it turns out that Roger was the guy who killed Vincent's wife after all and Alice slays him after Roger suddenly turns into the dumbest man alive. Vincent and Alice reunite only for Vincent to discover what Alice had done and they both lived happily ever after. Or at least that's what I got out of the ending.There's a frickin' cornucopia of things wrong with A Crime. It's slow. It has no energy or rhythm. Vincent and Alice are barely two dimensional. It's too long. Both of the twists involving Roger can be seen coming a mile away. It's too quiet. The success of Alice's scheme is so improbable that I at first thought it was evidence that the film's POV had shifted to her delusional perspective. Too much time is spent on Alice and Roger's contrived bar conversations. A headband and a boomerang!What A Crime smells like is some arrogant Euro effort to class up an American genre flick that founders on a poor grasp of genre mechanics and a lack of interest in any of the characters as human beings. It is dreary and dreadful and if you can view the whole thing in a single sitting then you're a better man than I am Gunga Din. For all us lesser folk skip this loser.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK this was never gonna be Citizen Kane... Hell it was never gonna be Out For Justice. But I am happy to confirm that Seagal's latest DTV opus is one of his best in a long time fulfilling on the promise of Urban Justice and Pistol Whipped as an upturn in his descent into cmovie hell. His last movie with writerdirector Waxman The Keeper was enjoyable enough with some fun character stuff for a Seagal flick that is! and competent film making although there were issues with pace and a lack of action. Here the movie starts hard and keeps on going only lagging slightly in the second act.Big Steve resurrects one of his DTV staple characters  the wrongly accused embittered ex con. There is also reference to a Special Forces history to explain away his awesome ass kicking ability this time. The plot is fairly straightforward not as convoluted as they can be despite warring criminal factions and a crooked cop conspiracy. There are a few concessions to the lowbudget but on the whole it is fairly well edited and well paced.But let's face it... what fans wanna know is how the action fares. Well I'm pleased to report it's pretty action packed especially for a DTV. Seagal is in hardhitting bonesnapping bloodily violent form. The frequent fight scenes are let down by some tooclose camerawork and jumpy editing but we still get the sense that big Steve can still pull out the stops there is no noticeable stunt doubling during the fights and he even brings back some of the old school Aikido throws and locks. A highlight is a fight in which Seagal makes deadly use of a chopstick that has to be seen to be believed.There is some dubbing involved unfortunately but the guy doing so is a lot closer to Seagal's voice and delivery than ever before and as I said no noticeable double work. He actually seems engaged in the flick particularly in the second half coming across as natural and relaxed. There are a couple of cool supporting characters in particular a Russian Gangster with a code of honour and a hatred for cops. It's not going to win any new fans over but for those hardcore fans that have stuck with the Tall Guy it's a welcome return to some sort of form and for those old school fans that have skipped his recent work and I don't blame you! is well worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Fastpaced action movie spoilt with dubbing issues";
	schema:reviewBody "THE PLOT Seagal stars as Shane Daniels who we first see defending his wife from a carjacker within the first minute or so of the movie and after beating him up a little Shane gives chase after the crook. Skip forward to the next day and the carjacker is found dead not to mention brutally mutilated and Shane given his 'special forces' history is imprisoned for the murder. The opening titles kick in and they're pretty stylish showing scenes from the movie to introduce the actors and giving them a kind of pastel coloured background around themFast forward 6 years and it seems that Shane's wife can't wait any longer for him whilst he's still in prison and writes him one of those 'Dear John' letters. Daniels is now all alone but the good news is that vital evidence in his appeal proves that he did not actually murder the carjacker and he is released although understandably angryIt seems that whilst this is going on a gang of Chinese crooks are smuggling immigrants into the U.S and they take one special refugee aside more on that later Anyhow Daniels now released calls into a liquor store and is soon back in trouble when two foolish hoods try to rob him. Despite pleading with them to leave him alone before he quote fks them up ugly Daniels gives them both a severe and brutal beating drives off in their car bottle in hand and heads to what he thinks is a deserted wasteland to remember about his wife with some quite 'sexy' flashbacks....so prepare to get jealous girls! Also driving through this wasteland are two Russian youths who stop to unload empty beer cans from their van. Suddenly a deputy sheriff in his policecar pulls up another car and interrogates two Chinese drivers who are reluctant to say whats in their boot and promptly shoot the officer dead and notice the two witness Russian youths. One of the young Russian men is killed Daniels intervenes killing one of the Chinese criminals and knocking out the other one. Looking in Chinese car boot Shane finds a carrycase full of money and a tied up Chinese girl. Daniels the girl and the surviving Russian drive off with the money. The Chinese girl wakes up and tells Shane that her uncle is an important business man who has been smuggled into the country by the Chinese gangsters but upon realising that he's a VIP they've double crossed his niece and are now holding him hostage. Daniels agrees to help her if her powerful uncle can secure him a visa out of the U.S. The grateful Russian man also thanks Daniels and points out that his father is a powerful Russian mob boss who will gladly help him out should he need it? Daniels and the girl part way with the Russian but soon realise that there's a 'tracking device' in the bag of money and Shane finds himself killing more Chinese hoods intent on retrieving it. The Chinese hoods are also working with a corrupt U.S cop who's only one step behind nailing Daniels himself. With the net closing in Daniels visits the Russian mob boss who thanks him for saving his son and swears undying loyalty but soon the Chinese hoods are blasting the mob bosses mansion so Daniels The Girl the mob boss and his son take the war to the Chinese and attack their HQ to rescue the girls uncle.....THE MOVIE A Dangerous Man is a fastpaced action movie that even in the nonSeagal scenes moves along at a brisk pace with rarely a dull moment. The cinematography is crisp and the camerawork is great. As previously mentioned the opening titles are really good and get the viewer pumped up for the next 90 minutes The film has numerous fight scenes explosions profanity....everything a good 'Seagalmovie' should haveSEAGAL Steven gives an OK performance better than THE KEEPER on par with DRIVEN TO KILL He performs most of his fights and dialogue read more about that later and still has amazing handspeed and his usual 'baddass persona' is present and correct.FIGHTS As mentioned there's a well spread out series of fight scenes again probably on par with DRIVEN TO KILL and more basic 'bangforyourbuck' action than THE KEEPERDUBBING Probably the worst aspect of the movie. Seagal is dubbed throughout although not as bad as KILL SWITCH or ATTACK FORCE it's all the more infuriating that the dubs are actually the same dialogue that Seagal is wording anyhow i think the directors should tell him to speak up during takes? I'd say about 2030 of Seagals dialogue is dubbedDOUBLES Yes we tend to know that when you see a shot of Seagal from the back it's usually a 'double'. This happens quite a lot and in a few of the fight scenes. But it seems to be SEAGAL doing most of the good stuff.OVERALL A dangerous Man is another good movie for Steven Seagal had the dubbingdouble issues not arisen....i'd rate it higher As it is the casual viewer would probably not notice these gripes and enjoy it for what it is....a simpleminded fastpaced action thriller. It's nowhere near as good or as flashy as UNDER SIEGE 2 but for a DTV release it's a pretty good movie. If BORN TO RAISE HELL is 80 as good i won't consider it a failure and gladly welcome MACHETE when it hits the big screens.Big Lee gives this movie a solid 8 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "THE PLOT Seagal stars as Shane Daniels who we first see defending his wife from a carjacker within the first minute or so of the movie and after beating him up a little Shane gives chase after the crook. Skip forward to the next day and the carjacker is found dead not to mention brutally mutilated and Shane given his 'special forces' history is imprisoned for the murder. The opening titles kick in and they're pretty stylish showing scenes from the movie to introduce the actors and giving them a kind of pastel coloured background around themFast forward 6 years and it seems that Shane's wife can't wait any longer for him whilst he's still in prison and writes him one of those 'Dear John' letters. Daniels is now all alone but the good news is that vital evidence in his appeal proves that he did not actually murder the carjacker and he is released although understandably angryIt seems that whilst this is going on a gang of Chinese crooks are smuggling immigrants into the U.S and they take one special refugee aside more on that later Anyhow Daniels now released calls into a liquor store and is soon back in trouble when two foolish hoods try to rob him. Despite pleading with them to leave him alone before he quote fks them up ugly Daniels gives them both a severe and brutal beating drives off in their car bottle in hand and heads to what he thinks is a deserted wasteland to remember about his wife with some quite 'sexy' flashbacks....so prepare to get jealous girls! Also driving through this wasteland are two Russian youths who stop to unload empty beer cans from their van. Suddenly a deputy sheriff in his policecar pulls up another car and interrogates two Chinese drivers who are reluctant to say whats in their boot and promptly shoot the officer dead and notice the two witness Russian youths. One of the young Russian men is killed Daniels intervenes killing one of the Chinese criminals and knocking out the other one. Looking in Chinese car boot Shane finds a carrycase full of money and a tied up Chinese girl. Daniels the girl and the surviving Russian drive off with the money. The Chinese girl wakes up and tells Shane that her uncle is an important business man who has been smuggled into the country by the Chinese gangsters but upon realising that he's a VIP they've double crossed his niece and are now holding him hostage. Daniels agrees to help her if her powerful uncle can secure him a visa out of the U.S. The grateful Russian man also thanks Daniels and points out that his father is a powerful Russian mob boss who will gladly help him out should he need it? Daniels and the girl part way with the Russian but soon realise that there's a 'tracking device' in the bag of money and Shane finds himself killing more Chinese hoods intent on retrieving it. The Chinese hoods are also working with a corrupt U.S cop who's only one step behind nailing Daniels himself. With the net closing in Daniels visits the Russian mob boss who thanks him for saving his son and swears undying loyalty but soon the Chinese hoods are blasting the mob bosses mansion so Daniels The Girl the mob boss and his son take the war to the Chinese and attack their HQ to rescue the girls uncle.....THE MOVIE A Dangerous Man is a fastpaced action movie that even in the nonSeagal scenes moves along at a brisk pace with rarely a dull moment. The cinematography is crisp and the camerawork is great. As previously mentioned the opening titles are really good and get the viewer pumped up for the next 90 minutes The film has numerous fight scenes explosions profanity....everything a good 'Seagalmovie' should haveSEAGAL Steven gives an OK performance better than THE KEEPER on par with DRIVEN TO KILL He performs most of his fights and dialogue read more about that later and still has amazing handspeed and his usual 'baddass persona' is present and correct.FIGHTS As mentioned there's a well spread out series of fight scenes again probably on par with DRIVEN TO KILL and more basic 'bangforyourbuck' action than THE KEEPERDUBBING Probably the worst aspect of the movie.

I rented A Dangerous Man because I read a positive report on it at another web site.To my surprise I found the movie to be a decent way to spend an hour and a half. Oh sure the movie is filled with flaws. Seagal is still using an obvious double for his fight scenes and in one shot of a sex scene the movie doesn't manage to disguise the British Columbia shooting locations as American there are long chunks of the movie where Seagal is nowhere to be seen and the climax goes on too long. But I was still entertained. The action sequences and there are quite a few of them are pretty brutal and bloody at times and you do get to see less of Seagal's double in the fight scenes than in other recent films of his. The plot goes by at a fairly brisk pace and the various villain schemes and actions by the other characters actually kept me interested in what would happen next. The movie's no classic but it does provide an acceptable amount of entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Poor poor Steven. How sad it is that you still consider yourself a serious action star. I just watched this turkey and now feel I have truly seen the demise of Mr Segal for my own eyes. In one word this STINKS! Don't get me wrong about Steven Seagal. I was a fan of his early stuff  'Above the law' 'Hard to Kill' 'Out for Justice' and even 'Under Siege' were worthy action flicks in a time when all we had was an aging Stallone a monosyllable speaking Schwarzenegger and an almost getting there Van Damme to appease our need for loud rocking violent movies.Seagal came out as a slick  stylish type of action man a martial arts Bond who had a smooth voice and even smoother moves to impress the current crop of action fans. We had never seen Aikido used in film the way he was using it. A subtle  gentle fighting style that when put to professional use could be totally devastating  ultra cool. Hell we even began to forgive  accept that silly little ponytail he persisted with!But then came the rain of hurriedly made b graders that were a pathetic attempt to ride the gravy train and flood the market with quantity not quality. 'Belly of the Beast' 'Shadow Man' 'Urban Justice' and the infamous 'Against the Dark' were an assault on the senses unparalleled since the 'Police Academy' sequels.Now 'A Dangerous Man' is here to add fuel to the quickly fading Seagal fire.. In terms of budget this movie is not lacking. It's where it's used that is the problem. No amount of cinema photography baggy wardrobe or body doubles are going to hide the fact that this hero is a very overweight man. Especially for an EXspecial forces commando who has razor sharp fighting  weapons skills that didn't diminish whilst serving six years for a crime he didn't commit. I mean really how did he stay so well trained in there yet gain 60 pounds? Do they have Pizza Hut delivery to state penitentiaries these days?To the fight scenes which are numerous and quite bloody yet Seagal never seems to get any blood on his heavily pounded hands. Are they made of Teflon perhaps? The hand to hand combat is fast. But the producer Seagal himself still sees the need to speed up the frame rate constantly during every conflict so much so that you are left with a dizzying vertigo type feeling as you try to make sense of who is hitting who. This is quickly cleared up as you realize the hero himself is NEVER touched by any of the bad guys. Even the hardcore looking Kung fu dudes. I couldn't remember any one of them so much as laying a hand on him.Besides Seagal the acting isn't that bad. Just some of the situations the writerdirector puts these characters in should have been properly thought out. A cop pulls over a perfectly looking car for no reason at all asks the occupants to get out and starts to body search them. All for no apparent reason other than to get attacked by these guys and therefore involve Seagal who is sitting in the darkness nearby trying to drink away his sorrows. Remember this man was a career warrior and successful  devoted husband. I wonder if this upstanding and well disciplined citizen acquired his taste for alcohol while in the joint? Whats more baffling is his willingness to help a cop after he was put away by these guys for nothing at all..?? And even more disturbing are the sexy flashback scenes of a 57 years old Seagal fondling his naked wife who looks to be about 40 years his junior... CRINGE!!!At the end of the day this is just another sub standard action movie. But why then does poor old Steve take it and very clearly himself SOO seriously? Truly if you want to see an overweight old man who is covered in too much fake tan  badly choreographed fighting moves then you'll be better off watching some old wrestling tapes of Hulk Hogan vs Andre the Giant and enjoying it for the humor it is meant to portray rather than wasting your time on this over produced vanity affected past his used by date actor who looks as if Botox will be his next costar. No thanks Steven. Again CRINGE...  out of TEN".

	schema:reviewBody "Paunchy martial arts action star Steven Seagal finds himself trapped in a hornet's nest of murder and mayhem in the aboveaverage contemporary crime thriller A Dangerous Man. Sweepers director Keoni Waxman keeps the action lively in this fastpaced profane bullet opera with a high body count as rival Chinese drug smugglers triggerhappy Russian mobsters and corrupt cops lock horns with automatic weapons in the great Northwest. Caught in the middle is a poor Asian girl who wants to rescue her uncle from the Chinese gangsters. The uncle knows everything about the Golden Triangle drug trade in Southeast Asian and some Asians want him dead. Meanwhile the girl escapes with a bag of Chinese drug money that contains a transponder like the one in the Cohen brothers' classic No Country for Old Men. Seagal plays Shane Daniels a 14year veteran Special Forces soldier who knows how to terminate people with extreme prejudice. One night an assailant attacks his wife in their car as Shane is coming to meet her. Shane kicks the stuffing out of the carjacker. Later the authorities discover the carjacker's corpse and convict Shane for the assailant's murder. Shane spends six years behind bars until he is acquitted of the crime based on DNA evidence. The court plans to award Shane the sum of 300thousand but Shane wants his life back more than the money. When he walks out of the courtroom he looks like he is metaphorically toting a giant tree on his shoulder. No sooner does he go back out in public than he roughs up a couple of car thieves trying to sell him a 'hot' ride. The fights are brutal and accelerated for spice.Incidentally A Dangerous Man amounts to a homage to the classic Alan Ladd western Shane particularly in the final confrontation. Not only does Waxman keep things turning over but he creates compelling characters. The Russian mafia chieftain stands out in the crowd of equally ruthless gunmen who have no qualms about shooting first and posing questions afterward. When the corrupt cops try to question him the Russian mob boss points that the police can do nothing to him. American prisons feel like paradise to him and he used to sodomize the Russian police on a regular basishe claimswhen he couldn't rape livestock. Inevitably as in all Seagal shoot'em ups the proud egotistical villains appear front and center to devastate our hero. Here there is a Dadu warrior an invincible combatant who cannot be defeated until he is forced to eat humble pie Seagal style. A Dangerous Man ranks one of the Seagal's best straighttovideo releases and rivals some of his lesser theatrical efforts. If you're a hard boiled Seagal fan this would be a good one to get in BluRay.".

Vlad doesn't like Ritchie or any other cops on his turf and soon has a war on his hands..Sergey whose life was saved thanks to DanielsDaniels happened to be in the vicinity where Mao and another goon were killing the cop will hold his savior in his debt. Because Sergey's life was saved Vlad offers Daniels a hand of friendship and protection. Even more threatening than Chen is The ColonelByron Mann a Danu warrior who has special plans to take Tia's Uncle himself. So Daniels has much to contend with joining forces with Vlad they will attempt to get Tia's Uncle away from The Colonel by any means possible. Two major action sequences include the shootouts at Vlad's mansion and Chen's lumber mill with Seagal looking superhuman thanks to camera speed and editing. Daniels' kicks send opponents hurling in the air and through windows shelves and other furniture. Daniels' arms move impressively quick about as fast as a hummingbird's wings. Mao and The Colonel neither one are able to withstand or combat Daniels' staggeringly swift hands and stunning power. Directorwriter Keoni Waxman makes Seagal look really good though and I think it's all too clear that cinematic techniques contribute mightily to this effect. Notice how camera speed for instance adds impact to Daniels' blows and movements. While an aging Seagal is no longer in his ABOVE THE LAWHARD TO KILL prime thanks to proper editing it looks like his Daniels is a dangerous killing machine without an equal even though we can figure that his standin stuntman carries a lot of the load with less appreciation. Still there are moments where we see Seagal's hands engage with the enemy and that does add value to the fight sequences.".

The ending once again is extremely corny and it was as if they couldn't think of anything else  how did Shane Daniels have to leave the US anyway? Didn't get it despite his wrongdoing Ever heard of exoneration?

Seagal does his own fights no Obvious Stuntman or stupid scenes where his voice is dubbed by another actor. remember crap like Submerged?. But Seagal has learned and his last five films including Pistol Whipped Urban Justice The Keeper and the surprisingly good Driven To Kill are certainly of much better quality with good production values an entertaining story and a solid cast.

This one was pretty good. Oh you had the negatives  an overweight oldlooking Seagal with labored breathing and a weird toupee' like Little Eddie from The Munsters. Also Seagal insists on having that phony southern accent in all of his latest films. Then there's his hot wife at the beginning of he film who's at least 35 years younger than Seagal and she gives him a nude lap dance while he grabs her boob. The things actresses will do to get a part! Then we have Tia an attractive 20 year old woman and Sergey a goodlooking young man of around the same age. They have good chemistry together as they face danger throughout the film. But guess who gets Tia at he end? Here's a clue not Sergey. Yuck! The villains were wellportrayed and the acting was very good. The cinematography was great  very welldirected and included some breathtaking Canadian scenery Okay the huge parking lot in front of a majestic lake with snowcapped mountains  then again everything in Canada is snow capped. The dialogue was pretty funny. Seagal actually told Tia to shut the  up. Then the head Russian dude told a dirty cop what they do to cops in Russia..I can't repeat it here but it's classic. Seagal went over the edge in this one early on in the film when he tells a guy he's going to  him up ugly. Then he proceeds to do with the barrel of a handgun what Joe Peschi did with a Bic pen to that guy in Casino. Then here was the unintentionally funny scene where the Chinese commandos under the cover of darkness and faces painted black lay siege to the headquarters. One small error  they have highbeam flashlights that would make them visible mile away. The climactic gun battle was a bit too long  it actually lulled me to sleep and I had to go back.".

	schema:reviewBody "It all starts out with Steven beating the crap out of a guy in the first scene of the movie inflicting a devastating brutal beat down in order to apparently protect his wife. And now he is wrongfully accused and sent in prison for a good 6 years... until they finally find out that the DNA to the killer and his wrongfully accused for victim didn't match. Tough luck Steven 6 years is a long time especially when after the 6th you receive a letter from your wife that she has to move on just before your release! What a tease! You definitely convinced me when your portrayed your attachment to her with gratuitous scenes of awesome barenaked breasts! Now you've lost everything and on top of that you decline the courts offer for tons of money to get you back on your feet That bag full of dough you just so happen to find later will do the job besides it's a faster more efficient way of piling it up and it involves killing lots of bad Asian American's to get it. Anyway Steven doesn't need the court's help he's an ex special ops. Military agent and he can do things on his own. Nothing spells tension like the past 6 years of your life spent wrongfully accused in a prison. It's a good thing that on the way to a convenience store Steven gets to liberate some of his anger on unsuspecting gangsters by turning one of the two's faces into ptchinois.Things pick up quickly as Steven is caught in a pit stop turmoil with angry Asian dudes who drive around with lots of money and a chick in their trunk. Thing's also go from bad to a lot better when Steven absolutely obliterates a Chinese guy and run's of with the girl the money and this Sergei fellow who apparently has no emotions because his friend just got raped with bullets and he never seemed to notice or care. Oh! and he just so apparently happens to be a big Russian mafia boss's son Didn't look Russian to me.So Steven has a meet and greet with the Russian mob boss and in a minutes time after Steven has a flawless victory over his Russian barman buddy become brothers to the dept he owes in exchange for the life of his son. Steven has the option to move out of the country but chooses the path of I never leave a fight unfinished  and quickly ops to recapture the girl's uncle being smuggled into the country Surprise!. I can understand him though the girl and he seem to harness such a chemistry together... she could even guess Steven's name  Shane  before he even told her motel scene.What follows is a brilliant brew of Russian versus Asian American violence with a few cops involved who fancy being openly crooked cooperating with gangsters all the while running around in a police cruiser and in uniforms Makes sense to me. Steven's rampage leaves no thirst unquenchedinvolving a few Steven Seagal Special Moves SSSM such as spawning a rope out of nowhere to defend himself from a sharp knifed attacker using chop sticks to defeat a Chinese opponent I always knew those things we're better at killing then eating and of course last but not least beating an opponent to near death but finishing him off by blowing up an entire building instead of putting a bullet into his unconscious body.Immediately following the glorious final battlein which Steven is left completely unscathed yet again which included no less then  13 times The Face 10 broken bones 12 brutal beat downs and 15 kills the movie wastes no time to roll credits in fact it takes exactly 51 second's for the movie to end after the fighting is over. We are treated to a sight of a nice resort in the mountains to which the scenery looks to be cleverly taken out of a post card and to Steven in a kick ass looking suit.Amen.Bless you Steven Seagal may god speed you on your way to your next movie for I will be waiting.Emmanuel".

	schema:reviewBody "I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars. Now before you laugh let me explain myself. In the Seagal world from 19882002 Seagal made theatrical quality films ending with Half Past Dead. Now people that grew up with Seagal as an action hero Under Siege came out when I was in high school then you also understand what happened next. In 2003 Seagals The Foreigner was pulled from Theatrical Release and release direct to DVD. Seagal fans were in shock at how bad this film was. Along came the DVD release of Ticker which was filmed in 2001 and shelved before being released. We all know why. The Foreigner was followed by the atrocious Out For A Kill and Seagal fans got worried. Then Belly of the Beast was released and Seagal fans let out a collective sigh. Not a great film but by no means was it as bad as the aforementioned films. It can't get any worse right? Well it could. Seagal fans went numb watching the likes of Out of Reach Mercenary for Justice Today You Die and Submerged. Seagal fans rewatched Exit Wounds to remind themselves what his films used to be like. The all time low came in 2007 with Flight of Fury which was an outright joke. I had given up. Then came Urban Justice and Pistol Whipped and slowly I became interested again. In line with The Keeper A Dangerous Man keeps up the hope as it is probably his best Direct to DVD film yet. The action is solid and the fights are terrific. Yeah the story lags in the middle a bit but you barely notice amidst the bone cracking martial artist overweight I might add doing his thing. So 8 out of 10. Not because it compares with a Tarantino film by any means. If you are a Seagal fan like I am then compared to Flight of Fury this truly is an 8 out of 10. Bring on Machete!".

	schema:reviewBody "For fans of John Waters' films A DIRTY SHAME will be a dream come true.I saw this at the Provincetown premiere last night where John Waters was there in person giving a QA after the film had finished.Tracy Ullman plays a sexually conservative and uptight suburban housewife who works with her husband Chris Isaak at his mother's convenience store. Their daughter Selma Blair has huge mummies and I emphasize HUGE who works at a strip joint but has been sentenced to house arrest after being indicted on several accounts of public indecent exposure.Her husband's mother Big Ethel Suzanne Shepherd is against all kinds of sexual perversions and is consistently disgusted by the shameless vulgar acts of sex committed by the residents of her community. Those who are against these acts are labeled neuters and once and for all Big Ethel decides to lead an uprising against all of the deviants in her community with a little help from Marge Mink Stole who noticed the shaved crotch of a pervert whom she caught masturbating on the public bus!Soon enough Ullman is sexually liberated by RayRay Johnny Knoxville after her car breaks down and she is struck against the head by a tool in the back of his tow truck. Her concussion causes her to discover her inner whore and she begins a new mission to sexually liberate those around her by using none other than her vagina!Many of John Waters' fans will recognize many actors he has used in his past films. Patricia Hearst SERIAL MOM PECKER CECIL B DEMENTED as a recovering sex addict in a 12step program Jean Schertler PECKER as a disgusted bus commuter and Jean Hill DESPERATE LIVING as an angry wife who fends off Ullman's sexual advances towards her equally horny husband with a rolling pin in hand!A DIRTY SHAME is funnier than PECKER and the abysmal CECIL B DEMENTED and finally gives Mink Stole a role that offers more than just a walk on. Unfortunately John Waters has alienated himself from the mainstream audience which is a good thing AND a bad thing yet again. I feel that the only people who will admire and appreciate this film are either exclusive John Waters fans or gay men!Some interesting points that John Waters raised during the QA session was how he fought the MPAA for an R rating but lost in a 74 vote. He also seemed to be mystified by the NC17 rating and tried to defend it by saying that most of the nudity was in the context of comedy and not porn but I would say after seeing this movie that that is hardly the issue! There is a very STRONG theme of sex especially where it concerns the more alternative side such as defecating felching and public ejaculation! Not that there's anything wrong with it!Many of the things that are said are very sexually laden like when Ullman declares Now that's what I call sneezing in the cabbage! or My puy's on fire!. He also mentioned that the community he filmed A DIRTY SHAME in was very friendly and that they all posed next to the trees with prosthetic vaginas and sphincters with their families for photos! He said that Jean Hill was very ill during her small cameo in this film and that in her scene there were three men behind her propping her up and that there was an oxygen tank and mask just offscreen. Sitting in the screening right next to me was Max Mueller who played baby Noodles in PINK FLAMINGOS. This film has everything. From gay bears and horny squirrels to food fetish and upper deck floaters watch the movie to find out what this means to a lessthanembarrassing cameo appearance by David Hasselhoff that involves him and an airplane toilet!Everyone applauded when the film ended. It was John Waters' return to disgusting trash and we all loved it! Unfortunately I don't think ANYONE outside of the abovementioned demographic would want to touch this film with a 10yard pole and that is what I meant in reference to where I think that the alienation of the mainstream audience was a bad thing. I think everyone should see this!".

	schema:headline " All in good humour...or not";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't say I've seen many of John Waters' films but I've seen enough to get an idea of what he's about and A Dirty Shame would appear to be a typical John Waters film. All of the jokes in the film come from sexual perversions and it's not hard to see why a number of people don't like it  as if you thought Serial Mom was a difficult film to get along with wait until you see this one! To be honest I'm not completely sure of whether I liked it or not on the one hand I respect the director for daring to go further than many directors would dare...but on the other hand it's amazingly silly and the central ideas behind the plot don't hold much weight. There are some really good oneliners in the film however and the surreal nature of the way the plot plays out is a delight. The story follows a prudish housewife named Silvia who hates sex and the fact that her daughter is a sex symbol named 'Ursula Udders'. However after hitting her head one day she comes into contact with a man named Ray Ray a 'sexual healer' and it's not long before she discovers that she is in fact a sexaddict.I'm sure that the main reason why John Waters has so many fans is because of his willingness to take risks. This film is full of risks some of which work. The cast list isn't typical with popular American comedienne Tracey Ullman taking the lead role and performing well in the more lurid scenes. Selma Blair stars alongside an enormous pair of fake breasts while there are support roles for the likes of Chris Isaak and Suzanna Shepherd. The biggest risk where the cast is concerned is undoubtedly Jackass' Johnny Knoxville who is a lot better than you would think. Waters has seen fit to have a lot of scenes play out to music and this works well some of the time. The way that certain words such as 'Whore' pan out across the screen is good but personally I didn't like the use of CGI. The film gets off to a really good start and I laughed more in the first half hour than in any film I've seen recently but it takes a bit of a downturn in the middle and never fully recovers. The film is good because you never really know where Waters is going with it and the full on orgy of the last twenty minutes is bound to divide audiences. Overall this film is in extreme bad taste but it's also a great laugh. However if you haven't liked whatever Waters' films you've seen so far  I wouldn't recommend seeing this one.".

Well I soon found out that it was a bit too simplistic to see them that way. You know if you look at Warhol's Cambells soup paintings you'll see that they are different types of Cambells soups. Well that's the same thing that's going on in his films. They may have similar flavors but the content is different. well minestrone is different from clam chowder..okay bad soup analogy The point is that John Waters has something to say and although trash is the reoccurring theme of his films he always adds something new to the subject.Before it was just about the freaks against the normal people and all the tabboos that were broken in the film as a result. Then there was the trash of films and art versus the norm and here we have sex politicized as the deviant and immoral act versus the neutered normal people. The irony is that none of the characters in this or any other Waters film is actually normal. He pokes fun at just about everything so it is a celebration of being freakish whether you're from Baltimore or anywhere else. John Waters knows how to be overt without being too mean about it. He is anything but pretentious in fact he loathes it. There is something absurd about cultural hierarchy and without Waters we would'nt be able to feel good about all the filth that exists in this country. We have to hand it to John Waters. Its a miracle that he can make these films and have large audiences see them. John has brought the underground to the surface of mainstream and allowed audiences to either shake laugh think get sick or all of the above. In my mind John Waters is a real treasure to the art of American cinema and A Dirty Shame is a reason why.".

Masterbating while being choked with a pay phone sex in public lesbians gays trees and plants that resemble sex organs and it goes on.Tracey Ullman was so perfect for Sylvia. Johnny Knoxvile as the Jesus of the sex addicts and his twelve apostles that are trying to free people to their sexual awakening is so over the top its perfect. Selma Blair takes the cake being able to show breast that large must have been a big job. Chris Isaak is good as the husband as well. And all the sex addicts are just awesome and show no shame.This holds no bars. There isn't much of a message only a black and white theme your either a sex addict or your a neuter. From what i had read all John Walter films target the Middle Americans in Baltimore and it hits hard here in A Dirty Shame.And of course this film wasn't complete until David Hasselhoff takes a dump in an aeroplane.Do see this film.

That scene has to be up there with Divine's eating doggiedoodoo in Pink Flamingos. A Dirty Shame will be a classic in the same league as Waters' preHairspray films. Still the concept of getting horny just by banging your head is weird to say the least. Especially as the movie goes on more and more people are realizing that fact.

I picked up the John Waters DVD boxset for a steal on Amazon and popped in A Dirty Shame having never seen it before. I was dissatisfied with the results. Unlike Waters' previous forays into film there is not one likable character to encounter. Nearly everyone grated my nerves throughout the film and I did not laugh until well into the second half of the film a good fortyfive minutes in. I found even Mink Stole to be dull and unsatisfactory which was wholly unnerving to me. The phrase Let's go sexin! uttered throughout made my stomach turn whenever I heard it because it became so Godawful annoying. Every single character is flawed and undeveloped which is unheard of in any of Waters' other films. A few moments with Selma Blair Ursula Udders made me chuckle but main players Sylvia Sickles Tracy Ullman and RayRay Perkins Johnny Knoxville were bland and nearly unwatchable in their roles. Although Shame garnered an NC17 rating it is tame at best a bad move on the Ratings Board in my book. I've seen COUNTLESS Rrated films that are a million times worse. Shame on the MPAA in that regard. Although the purpose of this film was largely to recapture the essence of Waters' earlier films Pink Flamingos it lacks the dialogue and the characters that made those films fantastic to view. A weak film altogether but I am definitely looking forward to Waters' Fruitcake.".

Selma Blair is Ullman's daughter who has mutilated her mammaries Chris Isaak is Tracey's husband who also gets a knock on the head and dreams of musclemen posing Johnny Knoxville is a sex guruauto mechanic Suzanne Shepherd is Ullman's mother Big Ethel who runs the Park and Pay. Relatively short film isn't compact the final reel is just a lot of hamming and running around but the firsthalf has some laughoutloud moments and the whole picture benefits from Ullman's workshe's a stitch. 12 from ";

Blair Knoxville and Ullman's families should all be instructed to love them less after starring in this dreck.Not only is the movie not on par with the usual atmosphere of Water's past classics it's just downright stupid and not even in a turnyourbrain off amusing sort of way. People get knocked in the head and are all of a sudden sex fiends....and not only that soon the whole town is walking around with head injuries and trying to hump anyone that moves.....sigh. Blair sleep walks campily through this film as a stripper with nightmarishly huge boobs and little else. Why she after proving that she had obvious talent in other roles ever agreed to this is beyond me. I can appreciate well known actresses wanting to do a cult or B movie because of love for a character or franchise ie Bridget Fonda's cameo in Army of Darkness. But not after reading this script and saying Let me get this straight I talk about how good promiscuity is and having huge knockers and pole dance through the entire thing? Where do I sign?! Ullman was a shocker. Was she hard up for cash? She should stick with the skit shows. Knoxville well i'm not real surprised at it seems to fall into the category of everything else he'd been in up to the time this came out. He's probably suffered enough head injuries from his Jackass days to explain his participation. Although he's subsequently had some significant and decent roles go figure. I wish there was more I could tell you about the plot but there's not. Some group tries to redeem the sexually deviant only to in the end become them themselves. Great. I was actually angry for wasting my time and rental fee on this trash. I know Waters is known for controversial trashy movies but the difference between this and his others is that they're fun.

And why anyone would want to make themselves look ugly through cosmetic surgery is another mystery. It is very sad that people are prepared to act in such rubbish and even sadder that people will pay to watch it. The fact that residents of the area where this garbage was filmed were happy to take part in it is an indication of the low esteem in which they hold their community.".

	onyx:emotionText "Bad taste in Baltimore. Unfunny sexual shenanigans are an indication of the depths to which popular American films have sunk. It is quite incredible how insanitary activities by unpleasant people are supposed to be entertaining. The general impression from the little of this film I was able to stomach was that morality and good neighborliness had sunk without trace. And why anyone would want to make themselves look ugly through cosmetic surgery is another mystery. It is very sad that people are prepared to act in such rubbish and even sadder that people will pay to watch it. The fact that residents of the area where this garbage was filmed were happy to take part in it is an indication of the low esteem in which they hold their community.";

A lot of the language was censoreddubbed !?! In a John Waters film!?! to make an Rrated version that looked more like a G version I think it could be shown on TV as is! The R version is called the Neuter Version and Waters authorized this watereddown film. Why? Starring Tracey Ullman Johnny Knoxville Selma Blair Chris Isaak and Mink Stole and with this description on the rental box from Blockuster When a head injury awakens Sylvia Stickles' longdormant sexual urges the entire town gets caught up in the conflict between decency and depravity and knowing it's a John Waters film I figured it would be great! Wrong. It wasn't even funny except for a few of Ullman's and Blair's moments and the censoring and dubbing of even the blandest nudity and profanity was completely distracting and annoying. I felt as if I were watching a regular editedforTV movie! I hope the NC17 rated version is better but I guess the video store won't be carrying it. And since I've been hoodwinked by this ridiculous rental version I don't plan to go to the trouble and expense to see the NC17 version. And this disappointing film just makes me want to pull out our copy of 1994's Serial Mom and watch over and over the scene with Kathleen Turner letting loose with her hilarious phone call.The only reason this film deserves even one star is because of Tracey Ullman's great noholdsbarred performance particularly in the scene in which she does the Hokey Pokey in an old folks' home.".

I'd heard that Dirty Shame was going straight to video in the UK but it has actually gotten what studios call a limited theatrical release. This is what sometimes happens when they realise they've got a turkey on their hands but one that might make a few bucks with a cult audience they slip it out quietly to a handful of cinemas and forget to advertise it. So this latest John Waters movie gets a week on two screens in London and no publicity. And boy can I see why. Sqwark! Yep. You got it. Bernard Matthews Turkey Farms would be proud. Now that Waters has finally hit Broadway mainstream with the hit Hairspray show and can get his movies bankrolled by Time Warner nobody expects him to still make'em as if they starred Divine but this one I'm afraid is really feeble. The plotsuch as it is could be considered a welldeserved IMO poke at the new puritanism currently running rife in the US. Prudes vs. perceived perverts that kind of thing. Plenty of mileage for satire there then! At least you'd think so. For the first twenty minutes here whilst the characters are being introduced the film shows promise but after that it's as if Waters changed his mind and decided to ditch any attempt at storyline and just go for grossout to get some easy laughs. Trouble is there aren't many. The material is weak and although the actors do their best it's just embarrassing. The same situations get recycled over and over as the film confusedly grinds on there's an incomprehensible religious subplot and the whole last section of the film is one gigantic outdoors raveup that might be intended to be a homage to the old zombie movies Night of the Living Dead et al but really just had me checking my watch and wondering if the end was in sight. I'd lost track of what was supposed to be going on at all by the time of the welcome climax literally and phew I thought now we can all leave. Good points it's faithfully shot in Baltimore it uses a lot of real locations and there are cameos from several of the surviving Dreamlanders. There are a few funny lines and snatches of some good tunes on the soundtrack and the Candice Stickles daughter character with the inflatable bazoomers stolen straight out of a Russ Meyer movie is a fun character. But that's about all I could find to like here. Not recommended. Go see Female Trouble again instead. No tacky animated squirrels in that one either. Beat it hon.".

	schema:headline " Laughingoutloud even HOURS after watching it funny!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to review a movie like this without giving anything away and I don't want to write any spoilers. So to start I recommend everyone tries to see it. One can already see how hilarious it is by the trailer and the few clips on the show but let me tell you... it gets even BETTER!! The acting is great but if you're a fan of the Stargates then you already know that. And Kate Hewlett the female star has theatrical experience and I guess good acting is genetic in the Hewlett family. Along with the sense of humor. The sibling rivalry in the movie is great to see and even funnier knowing that David and Kate actually are brother and sister. I can't even comment on Paul McGillion 'cause I'd be giving away stuff but let me pause for a second and giggle madly!! ROFLMAO OK back. The other roles were fairly short all the actors were great and I personally hope that we'll get to see Starcrossed  the space opera in the movie that is to become a real TVshow soon so we can see what Paul and Rachel can do in a comedic role and even if that's not the direction it will take and even if Paul and Rachel weren't in it I'd still want to see it. It was so cheesy it was hilarious!!. A special mention goes to Mars the posterdog for the movie. Handsome very natural and apparently all he asked to do his job was a little doggie biscuit from his friends! Again it's hard to say more without giving bits away and every little clip from the movie is worth watching without knowing what will happen... even though the second time you watch the movie personal experience you'll enjoy it even more. For one you'll be able to hear all the lines you've missed from laughing to hard the first time around and you'll be able to see things without the blur of tears again from laughter. And you'll notice all the funny details that you couldn't focus the first time when you were focused on the main story. It is a lowbudget movie but you'd never know if they didn't tell you. The way it's shot everything makes perfect sense and I really don't see how a lot more money could have made any difference expect of course in making people happier!. And I wish I could say more but again I'd go into spoilerarea.So from giggling to laughing out loud from going ewww to seeing a lot more David Hewlett than you've ever wanted to see or finally enough! depending on your point of view! you'll want to watch this movie again and again ask for a REAL theatrical release by MGM or at least that the DVDs come out soon!! OK I just reran a little clip in my head laughed and the people around me looked at me as if I were nuts. Hope that if you've seen the movie you aren't reading about it in a public place!".

Basically the entire story is about what the dog played by Mars is having for breakfast. And boy will you be surprised and possibly a little grossedout to find out just what he is having! This uproarious black comedy is a mustsee for anyone who likes to laugh and have a good time. It is also a mustsee for folks who like a darker side to their humor.This movie is appropriate for children of all ages. My guess is that it would be rated PG for some content.

You can also catch him in Stargate Atlantis he can steal a scene with just his posture. I hope that A Dog's Breakfast gives him a wider audience. I also hope he expands his horizons as a filmmaker. Write more please! Kate Hewlett is also very good and this sibling pairing worked well. Kate plays the straight man wonderfully. She might not have a lot projects under her belt but she was equal to David on screen. She is a strong charismatic skilled actress. She has the chops to carry a film on her own.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tiny hints at spoilers alert!Being one of the lucky few to see this film at the time of writing I am excited for everyone who hasn't seen this and hope you get to see this soon. I am going to make an attempt to talk about it without spoiling it much and will attempt to detach myself from Hewlett fangirly rantings.I can safely say that this film surpassed even my expectations unsurprisingly high and did not disappoint. Given that it this is David Hewlett's directing debut no doubt under the watchful gaze of long time Yoda and chum Vincenzo Natali among othersHewlett exhibits a creative flair that marks this film out as distinctively his own. Natali et al were not the crutch for this project that I had feared. Newbie Hewlett seems to have successfully navigated what was probably a mle of creative advice well.David himself does not hide the fact that he has had to beg borrow and steal resources to get this film made and producer fiance Jane Loughman has done a remarkable job bringing this film to fruition on such a tiny budget. What this man could do given bigger budget doesn't bare thinking about . He does seem to have wet the appetite of DVD only distributor MGM who have commissioned a pilot of 'starcrossed' the spoof scifi featured in the film. Lets hope that this relationship continues.What it may lack in polish it more than makes up for in wit style of expression and originality. An entertainment focused screenplay it has no pretensions and does not take itself too seriously. It doesn't make too many demands on the audience but it doesn't require you to leave your brain at the door either a perfect balance. The film is a real testament to the director's ingenuity and understanding of his medium. I would like to see him in the future try out some different genres. Perhaps horror.I personally love extremity of character and Hewlett's performance as the endearing Patrick demonstrated well paced comic timing and relished in the sort of classy but not too crude slapstick that Peter Sellers would have been proud of. Similarly Paul McGillion as Ryan plays well off of Hewlett. Cynics who have not seen the movie! may say that their on screen chemistry is already well known and preestablished outside of the film's parameters and that this assumption is a requirement to fully enjoy the film. I would answer by saying that this film dispels the myth that you would to have seen Stargate Atlantis to appreciate 'in jokes'. There simply aren't any. Where would we be if that same argument were levied at anyone 'writing and influenced by what they know'?. Many who have never heard the word Stargate have absolutely loved it.I also wondered whether one of the more memorable scenes involving THAT dressing gown and McGillion had been at all influenced by Cary Grant in 'Bringing up Baby'?I hope this is the first rung on the long ladder of Hewlett's directing career with preferably Jane supporting the ladderyup the boy done good!".

	onyx:emotionText "Tiny hints at spoilers alert!Being one of the lucky few to see this film at the time of writing I am excited for everyone who hasn't seen this and hope you get to see this soon. I am going to make an attempt to talk about it without spoiling it much and will attempt to detach myself from Hewlett fangirly rantings.I can safely say that this film surpassed even my expectations unsurprisingly high and did not disappoint. Given that it this is David Hewlett's directing debut no doubt under the watchful gaze of long time Yoda and chum Vincenzo Natali among othersHewlett exhibits a creative flair that marks this film out as distinctively his own. Natali et al were not the crutch for this project that I had feared. Newbie Hewlett seems to have successfully navigated what was probably a mle of creative advice well.David himself does not hide the fact that he has had to beg borrow and steal resources to get this film made and producer fiance Jane Loughman has done a remarkable job bringing this film to fruition on such a tiny budget. What this man could do given bigger budget doesn't bare thinking about . He does seem to have wet the appetite of DVD only distributor MGM who have commissioned a pilot of 'starcrossed' the spoof scifi featured in the film. Lets hope that this relationship continues.What it may lack in polish it more than makes up for in wit style of expression and originality. An entertainment focused screenplay it has no pretensions and does not take itself too seriously. It doesn't make too many demands on the audience but it doesn't require you to leave your brain at the door either a perfect balance. The film is a real testament to the director's ingenuity and understanding of his medium. I would like to see him in the future try out some different genres. Perhaps horror.I personally love extremity of character and Hewlett's performance as the endearing Patrick demonstrated well paced comic timing and relished in the sort of classy but not too crude slapstick that Peter Sellers would have been proud of. Similarly Paul McGillion as Ryan plays well off of Hewlett.

Kate Hewlett is most definitely a talent that we will hopefully get to see a lot more of in years to come. She commanded the screen and as a female I completely related to her and was with her all the way. David Hewlett as always completely nuts and pure genius from a comedy perspective. All in all a 5 Star rating from me. If you want a genuinely fun and relaxing evening this movie is the one to get. For those with no sense of humour?  it may just educate you!".

What followed for the next two hours was a fascinating story of a bigoted Mississipi tractor salesman who finds out that he is half black. While this might not sound like a big deal let me explain a bit.  I grew up down in the delta near the location that this movie was filmed.  It is a big deal down there.  Unfortunately the majority isn't quite as colorblind as they are in other parts of the united states and bigotry is still a pretty common thing.  I'm sad to say that there is still a little bit of a barrier there and if more people were to see this movie then I'm sure things would be a little bit different.You see Robert Duvall plays a fellow not the most openminded of sorts named Earl.  In the opening we get to see the events that make up a typical day for Earl coffee drinking shooting the breeze and selling tractors. We also learn that Earl's Mom isn't in the best health as she passes away ten minutes into the film.  She also leaves a note behind telling Earl that she isn't his real mother.  His real mother was black and Earl is the result of an affair that costs his blood mother her life.  Since Earl came out looking white he was raised up like nothing ever happened.I can see it as a shock.  One Earl appears to be in his midfifties. that's quite a big shock to a guy in the prime of his life two he discovers that not only is he a btard child to a mother he never knew he also has an older halfbrother.  After all of this Earl needs to take a roadtrip to get himself together and maybe meet the brother he never knew. What follows next is a journey both physical and spiritual that will show ol'Earl a thing or two about life and love.Written by Tom Epperson and none other than Ol' Billy Bob Thornton himself A Family Thing is one of the best feel good movies I have ever seen. I highly reccommend it.  It's pretty rare that a movie comes along that is good enough to change one's life.  This oughta be required viewing for highschool students.  What a film. 1010".

Sure the same old southern stereotypes are portrayed as well as the same for the innercity black culture with many being quite accurate. Some parts were a little over the top like the birthday party in the bar that Earl crashes as a total stranger. But that being said not a lot of negatives I can say about this movie.".

An Arkansas man gets a note from his deceased Mother that she is not his real Mother that he is actually the product of a sexual encounter between his Father and the family's black maid. The letter urges him to travel to Chicago to find his halfbrother who is a black man. Sounds like a scenario Hollywood would dream up for a broad comedy I'm white you're black but we're brothers? Cue wacky music or a liberal social piece on how we all should just get along.A Family Thing takes neither road. Instead it examines the realistic reactions the characters would have in such a situation. It services the racial element without getting preachy and it finds comedy in unlikely places but mostly it deals with the topic in a frank straightforward manner.Robert Duval plays the bewildered Earl Pilcher a hardworking equipment rental store owner and self described redneck who suddenly finds the very foundation of his life shaken by his Mother's startling postmortum revelation. His Father's silence on the matter confirms the story so Earl hops in his truck and drives to Chicago. He locates his halfbrother Ray a goodnatured Chicago cop nearing retirement played by James Earl Jones. Ray is polite but cynical about the whole matter with some deep rooted hatred for Earl's Father that he manages to keep from spilling over to much on to Earl. They part ways but Earl is carjacked and ends up in a hospital with a concussion and the only thing they find on him is Ray's phone number. Thus the stage is set for an unorthodox family reunion.Duval and Jones hit all the right notes as the perplexed brothers discovering each other despite their distaste for their shared history. Duval's flawed but decent Earl is reminiscent of his performance in Tender Mercies subtle and understated. Jone's Ray is a kindhearted man who has nursed the wounds from a hard life and come out better for the experiences. In a touching scene beautifully underplayed by both actors the two men talk about their experiences in the Korean War while preparing to bed down for the night. They are two unlikely brothers sharing a room and sharing their lives.Michael Beach plays Ray's angry son Virgil a divorced bus driver who lost his chance at athletic stardom to a knee injury. But the most fascinating performance is delivered by Irma P Hall as Ray's and Earl's Aunt T. Aunt T is a cranky but soulful old woman who happens to be blind but she sees things the other characters can't and teaches them all a thing or two about the meaning of family. A scene where she recounts the night of Earl's birth is the emotional highlight of the film.Don't expect any fireworks or explosions. A Family Thing is mostly a quiet characterdriven story. Do expect to be touched by the simple drama of human lives relayed by a talented director Richard Pierce two insightful writers Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson and some very skilled actors.".

	schema:headline " Improbable because....";
	schema:reviewBody "I would like to give this movie a higher rating but there is something that detracts from it's quality. Duvall is a brilliant actor but perhaps the whitest guy in Hollywood. His complex is pale and he doesn't have any curls to his hair. Now it is hard to believe that Nicole Ritchie is halfblack but you can see she has a darker complexion. Therefore it is impossible to believe that Duvall's character is halfblack.If Duvall's character grew up in this very white small town people probably would have suspected he had American Indian Italian or Hispanic blood. Duvall's character may have been aware that he was not totally ScotchIrish. If he were in the Bayou perhaps it wouldn't be as big a deal. But in farm country of the South highly unlikely that he wouldn't be aware of something.I didn't like the fact that Duvall's character goes to the big city and all of a sudden he is being considered halfblack. It would be more of an adjustment than the movie portrays. In addition his nephew probably would have resented him giving advice to him. Why wouldn't James Earl Jones' character be the one to give him advice.The movie was interesting but this point severally detracts from it's credibility. I have a better idea. Why not make Duvall's character 100 white and have the Father having an extramarital affair that produced Jones' character. Jones' is definitely light to medium brown complexion. He could be a believable mulatto.The Father could be the one dying. On his deathbed he can confess that he had an extramarital affair and that there was a halfbrother to Duvall's character.

Duvall could have been conflicted because he was so white but now he had to accept that his brother was halfblack. In addition Jones' family would deal with their own fears and reluctance in accepting Duvall's character. This would have been a more meaningful scenario. It would have forced both races to accept that they have a father in common.".

	onyx:emotionText "I would like to give this movie a higher rating but there is something that detracts from it's quality. Duvall is a brilliant actor but perhaps the whitest guy in Hollywood. His complex is pale and he doesn't have any curls to his hair. Now it is hard to believe that Nicole Ritchie is halfblack but you can see she has a darker complexion. Therefore it is impossible to believe that Duvall's character is halfblack.If Duvall's character grew up in this very white small town people probably would have suspected he had American Indian Italian or Hispanic blood. Duvall's character may have been aware that he was not totally ScotchIrish. If he were in the Bayou perhaps it wouldn't be as big a deal. But in farm country of the South highly unlikely that he wouldn't be aware of something.I didn't like the fact that Duvall's character goes to the big city and all of a sudden he is being considered halfblack. It would be more of an adjustment than the movie portrays. In addition his nephew probably would have resented him giving advice to him. Why wouldn't James Earl Jones' character be the one to give him advice.The movie was interesting but this point severally detracts from it's credibility. I have a better idea. Why not make Duvall's character 100 white and have the Father having an extramarital affair that produced Jones' character. Jones' is definitely light to medium brown complexion. He could be a believable mulatto.The Father could be the one dying. On his deathbed he can confess that he had an extramarital affair and that there was a halfbrother to Duvall's character. The Father could leave out the fact that his brother is halfblack. Then Duvall's character shows up and is completely shocked.This would have been a better idea. Duvall could have been conflicted because he was so white but now he had to accept that his brother was halfblack.

One of the memorable highlights of this film is the conversation the two brothers have before going to bed in the same room for the first time ever during which their bonding process begins.So much has been said about the leading members of the cast that there is not much to add.

I heard the magnificent voice of James Earl Jones as that of Darth Vader in Star Wars and later on I saw his acting abilities.

Richard Pearce's A Family Thing is a modern day fictional example of such racial mixing. The film is a comedy but has serious overtones in its thoughtful look at America's racial divide. When 60yearold Earl Pilcher's elderly mother Carrie dies she leaves him a letter that the local pastor Nathan Lee Lewis delivers to him after her death. The Arkansas equipment rental manager is shocked to read in the letter that his real mother was Willa Mae Patrice Pittman Quinn an AfricanAmerican who was impregnated by his father James N.

Needless to say this piece of information does not sit well with Earl who was raised by the Pilchers and never questioned his heritage. To compound Earl's confusion and disbelief he also finds out that he has an AfricanAmerican brother Ray Murdoch James Earl Jones who lives in Chicago. When Mrs. Pilcher implores Earl to find his brother Piclher suddenly takes off to Chicago in his old pickup truck without telling his family the reason for his departure. In Chicago he discovers that his brother Ray is a cop who works in the office of Chicago's mayor that he knows all about him and is not happy about seeing his brother again blaming him for his mother's death.Finding himself in a dangerous part of town Earl is held up mugged and has his truck stolen. After getting out of the hospital and needing a place to stay he is reluctantly put up by his brother who lives in a flat with his son Virgil Michael Beach and his elderly blind Aunt T Irma P.

There is also a wonderful scene with Earl and his blind aunt shopping at a supermarket where she has memorized the inventory and a moving flashback to Earl's birth.

As the plot progresses the viewer is often subtly taunted to question their understanding of the story so far.I'm a fan of Dylan Moran's standup work and he has lived up to my expectations of him on the screen as well.

Dylan Moran while perhaps  reprising many of the other characters he has played previously was  very enjoyable to watch as was Keith Allen though his part was  predictably small.  A few cameos at the end really were well placed especially Johnny  Rhys though the context of his cameo was a little close to reality so  I'm not sure what way he will come across to auds in Ireland.  Throughly enjoyable film the industry in Toronto reacted extremely  positively to it and it along with Kisses really showed us all that  Ireland can when it wants produce good product.  Well done to all involved and I hope it goes well on its release.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black comedies don't come much darker than this little gem from Ireland. Audiences who loved last year's Death At A Funeral will get lots of laughs from this very funny comedy about a couple of hapless wannabe film makers and their attempts to cope with a couple of accidental deaths in a small flat. Mark Mark Doherty is a struggling out of work actor desperately looking for a decent role in a film. He shares a poky basement flat with his girlfriend Sally Amy Huberman and his paralysed wheelchair bound brother David David O'Doherty. However the rent is three months overdue and there are a number of repairs to be made. However their landlord Jack Kevin Allen is reluctant to do any work until the rent is paid. And Mark's slacker best friend Pierce Irish comic Dylan Moran from the TV series Black Books etc is trying to write a film script drawing upon their experiences. And then the first fatal accident occurs and their situation gets markedly worse. As the unusual situation begins to get out of control Pierce's helpful suggestions actually exacerbate things. There is a fine art to black comedy as filmmakers have to walk a fine line between tasteful and tasteless but this is the type of comedy where the British excel. Director Ian FitzGibbon and writer Mark Doherty get the delicate balance right here and they push the material about as far as it can go without overstepping the boundaries of good taste. There are plenty of laughout loud moments throughout some nice sight gags and a running joke that eventually pays off. The film is a little slow to get going as it spends a lot of time in the early scenes establishing the characters and setting the scene. But patience is rewarded once the hits its stride as it delivers big laughs. The film combines elements of top British films like the wonderful Withnail And I and Shallow Grave. FitzGibbon and Doherty follow one outrageous implausibility with another but the whole thing ultimately works. To reveal too much about the film's plot would spoil its surprises. The small but effective cast are attuned to the tone of the film and their performances match the material. Doherty maintains a wonderfully deadpan style throughout and is quite fetching as the sad sack slacker hero. Moran brings charisma and charm to his unsympathetic and selfcentred character. There are brief but telling from film director Neil Jordan and Jonathan Rhys Meyers that add to the film's idiosyncratic and offbeat flavour. A Film With Me In It is an unexpected delight and a film not to be missed!".

Nothing in this film makes sense or is logical but it isn't supposed to each ridiculous twist and turn can be amusing. To me it was amusing and I had a few laughs but they can be a little sparse. And in the end it leaves you feeling a bit empty. While that may be the point of the film it also feels a bit like a television episode that was dragged on. Overall I found it a good experience.The characters are stupid and illogical. Entertainment depends on whether or not one can get over this fact. At times I could laugh but at times I was just dumbstruck. The actors also did a pretty good job of appearing similarly dumbstruck. Huberman particularly did quite well. Moran is his usual self.Not only is it hard to develop any kind of connection with the characters but they can induce hate. At times I just can't turn off shoeswitching. WHY YOU FOOL! I scream in my head but they never seem to hear me. Sometimes inducing this kind of emotion is good but they overdid it and it can definitely begin to shift to annoyance ruining the suspension of disbelief. The screenplay was absurd in a good way but could have flown better. The characters are introduced haphazardly and the buildup is very slow. Eventually I began wondering where the dead bodies were. The clear foreshadowing does create an interesting little whose gonna get it atmosphere but they needed to anchor more of the script around it. If it was worked and teased a bit more it would've been great. It got better as the bodies began piling up and the absurdities amounted.The tone of the film started off teetering between funny and serious so some parts left the viewer uncertain as to how to feel. The ending expunged on the humor created and is a hate it or love it thing.The cinematography on the other hand was surprisingly aesthetic.

In the performancesthe character of the escape convict was convincing enough. I also thought the roll of the Sheriff was intense but funny.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not entirely sure why this movie has a less than stellar rating. I watched it on Netflix and honestly was not expecting much but wound up being very pleasantly surprised. The opening of the movie has such great physical comedy I was laughing out loud. It was a really refreshing change from all the sex and fart jokes most movies have which can totally be funny but let's face it are way over done and overrelied upon at this point. I grew up watching reruns of I Love Lucy so I'm a big fan of physical comedy which just isn't used as often anymore particularly with female characters for some reason.What I really loved about this film was that while it was completely laugh out loud funny it actually made me care about the characters. Most straightup comedies non romcoms don't do that. But at the same time it wasn't so over the top that it felt like it was changing genres or anything. I just actually cared what happened to them while of course laughing at their ridiculous predicaments.I've seen a good number of Jaime King's films and in my humble opinion this is one of her best performances both for the comedy and the softly stated drama of her character. Usually when I've seen a lot of one actor's films it takes me out of the world and I just think of the character as the actor. That didn't happen here. While I generally like Josh Cooke I will say that I'm not entirely sure he was the best choice for his role. He did a good job but something just felt off in believing he was this criminal that could go off at any moment. And IMHO it is necessary to believe that in this film. The plot started to get a little stale towards the end and I think some of it could have been left out but it moved along quickly enough that I wasn't bored and ultimately it didn't detract enough from the film to make an impact on my overall opinion of it.A Fork in the Road is a great movie to watch if you just want something funny that isn't plain stupid or a stonerslacker movie.

I feel kind of bad hoping that neither of these two actors ever get a really big break so that they don't get super spoiled and transparently egotistical like most major Hollywood actors tainting their future performances because I liked them so much here. I would encourage you stick with this movie and let it develop because it really just keeps getting better as is it builds steam with the odd turns in the plot. Some suspension of disbelief is required of course but it's not too unreasonable at all for a movie. This comedy really just simply succeeds with very winning main characters in a convoluted plot with a lot of intelligent laughs. I don't want to sound like an old geezer whining about the good old days I'm not even that old but a basically wholesome movie like this at least for the times we live in with such likable performances from essentially unknown actors without the distractions of a bunch of mindless special effects is just the kind of treat I'm always looking for and have such a hard time findingpersonally I would take a movie like this over a typical Hollywood blockbuster every single night of the week.

There are implausible events sure but everyone and everything is working together so well that we are willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.And what a ride it is! The actors appear to have a lot of fun making this and every performance is strong. Jaime King is very appealing as the distressed damsel kind of like a taller version of Reese Witherspoon and she has us on her side immediately. She and costar Josh Cooke work very well together and we can feel their erotic chemistry slowly catalyze. Josh the scruffy antihero turns in a very strong comedic performance intimating there is a lot of talent here for future leadingman roles perhaps along the lines of Belmondo. Silas Weir Mitchell is very effective as Jaime's violent scumbag husband. His redneck rage is augmented by a loud comic percussive soundtrack that blasts forth every time he bursts into vengeful action.Also very praiseworthy was the decision to cast Missi Pyle as Jaime King's sister. First of all these actresses resemble each other so that they could easily be sisters. Missi is a wonderful presence on screen whenever she is cast. She is quite sexy and glamorous but there is something strange in her glamor something just a little bit off so that she seems to be almost a caricature of herself. This oddness is at the core of her appeal as a comedienne. If I see Missi's name in a film's cast of characters it gives me additional incentive to seek that film out and I am rarely disappointed. A Fork in the Road is a good example of that.All in all Hooray for A Fork in the Road. I've already watched it three times and I will watch it again in the future. Highly recommended!".

Skillful and energetic direction and editing especially for such a low budget a really dark comedic script good pacing fresh scenery and enough twists and turns kept me glued laughing and impressed all the way through. You can definitely see a bit of the Coen brothers or Spike Lee in this although the violence is toned downmore suggestive than in your face. I read that some people thought the acting was subpar. Not for me although the wacky events that cause leads Josh Cooke and Jamie King to stomp around with their arms in the air in total frustration might make them appear to some folks to be performing over the top. But I liked that I thought the performances fit with the tonality of the film.".

Skillful and energetic direction and editing especially for such a low budget a really dark comedic script good pacing fresh scenery and enough twists and turns kept me glued laughing and impressed all the way through. You can definitely see a bit of the Coen brothers or Spike Lee in this although the violence is toned downmore suggestive than in your face. I read that some people thought the acting was subpar. Not for me although the wacky events that cause leads Josh Cooke and Jamie King to stomp around with their arms in the air in total frustration might make them appear to some folks to be performing over the top. But I liked that I thought the performances fit with the tonality of the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film was on late night mid week BBC television last week and I found it fairly easy going in general. It wasn't complicated at all although in some ways it attempted to be so due to the sex subplots involving  British diplomat Colin Friels who also bears a passing resemblance to Ewan MacGregor strangely enough. Those subplots of course came second to the themes of corruption incompetence and confusion which I have to say reign supreme in Africa. The seemingly intelligent progressive leader is actually corrupt to the core and is well played by Louis Gossett I thought.The film also took a somewhat farcical view of African culture and politics which is completely over exagerrated but funny nonetheless. For example the names and words of certain things amused me like 'newly independent' Kinjanja for example. The local currency was the 'janjan' ? the capital city was unpronouncable and the locals believe in a god of thunder called 'Shango' which in a way becomes the driving force of the plot and causes our hero Friels all sorts of amusing moments. If struck by lightning the victim also had to be 'cleansed' by a 'juju' man??!!!  True the locals are portrayed as simple god fearing useless idiots which is something of a Eurostereotype of Africans in general it has to be said. But the British diplomats played by Friels and Lithgow are also given rough treatment......they bend over backwards for a corrupt leader can't deal with local politics are xenophobic and bumblingly incompetent. But from these situations I did draw a certain degree of amusement if only due to the fact that I lived in southern africa for over ten years and some of the stereotypes and mishaps were classic Africa.Some good looking female actors also help the film along although the  likes of Diana Rigg are underused. Connery puts in a forgetful performance but both Friels and Lithgow are entertaining. The sticky atmosphere also comes through as does the general hurly burly life of a foreign diplomat in Africa..........I'll give it 6.510 easy going and good for a few laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very much lighter and more humorous version of The Ugly American this film spotlights the misadventures of a naive and utterly clueless diplomat as he attempts to assume the role of foreign diplomat in an unnamed African country.  The lead character is vacuously played by no one that most audiences would recognize or remember for that matter.  I found myself hoping to see Sam Neill come creeping up in the next scene.  Brilliant performances by Diana Rigg Joanne WhalleyKilmer and Sean Connery along with several other known and unknown actors provided intriguing counterpoint and kept me watching.  As with any good satire I was enticed to confront many assumptions beliefs and contradictory feelings.  There is much original humour and more than a few tributes to revered filmography  enough to keep me laughing smiling andor trying to remember what movie was being referred to for most of the movie.  Comedysatire may not be Beresford's best long suit but I'll take this over just about any Hollywood comedy movie I've seen in quite some time.".

And also that it were to take place in legendary Salem.While watching it it because painstakingly clear that this movie was not really all that great. The story was good enough though there really wasn't anything new to be seen here. Nothing to revolutionize the horror genre. So don't expect to be surprised and be sitting in awe.The one thing that this movie had going on for it was the atmosphere. The house itself was really nicely done lots of really great details here and they had managed to carve out a really greet feel to the house and its surrounding. Old houses are genuinely creepy.As for the cast well I didn't recognize a single one here. And in itself that was good enough because I enjoy watching a movie with new faces in it. However the bad thing was that there were no really overly convincing performances here. It was as it almost all people were in this movie halfheartedly. The most memorable though were the two teenagers Jenna Stone and Nicholas Harsin.My low rating of this movie is because it just wasn't scary. The movie trotted on at a really slow pace despite things happening what happened wasn't scary. It was a dread to look at sometimes because I wished more scary stuff would happen. There was only a single time in the entire movie that I got spooked and without saying too much then it was the scene where the sheriff was laying down on the bed to go to sleep.And one thing did puzzle me. What was the thing with the sheriffs and having to douse everything in gasoline to torch it all down when they found their families dead? I am pretty sure that kind of behavior is not what people do much less trained police men in such situations. That was just downright ridiculous.If you like horror movies then A Haunting in Salem is not really a great choice because you will be sorely disappointed.".

This film just reminds me of an old fashion Stephen King miniseries like I use to watch back in the day.Before HDTV satellite got so popular and even those films were not that great looking back on them now The acting in this film is pretty solid but still it's kind of fun to watch the story unfold. Like I said I'd say it's maybe ABC television quality but it still has some merit as a good little watch.If your looking to see a massive budgeted horrorspook flick your in the wrong place. It's just a film that you would want to watch if nothing is on television. The acting in this film is almost too good for the simple story line and I think that's what ruins it a little. These actors and actresses need to be in a bigger budget film. But all in all it's a simple story with 1990's low budget television horror quality. I think some of the very few Ghost Faces were well done especially when the New Sheriff roles into bed with his wife and turns off the lamp and then turns back towards his wife to only see a disgusting rotting slimy corpse next to him. The only downfall is that I kept getting the daughter and the mother mixed up they both look the same age. That's my main complaint. Also the son is kind of a bad actor.Not that I could do better But they could of picked a teenage male with a little more talent. He just seemed to be a little too fake for me.In turn I'd say this film should be viewed in the mindset of not taking it too seriously and just letting it role. No it's not a giant budget film and the quality is not the best.TV movie grade But it still is worth a watch. I gave it a 6 out of 10 because of it's basic story line. It's simple and to the point if your in the mood for a no brainer.Thanks for readingJeffrey J Turner Sarnia Ontario Canada".

The acting was okay. Definitely not the worse I've seen from watching many many horror movies. The movie was filmed nicely. The music was just right. The movie definitely kept me interested the whole time and trying to work out exactly what was going on.Yes there were a few corny scenes but nothing to turn me off the movie completely. I give this movie a 7 out of 10".

It'd be a good movie to sit around and make fun of or scare jumpy people. But for horror buffs its all the same stuff we've seen before but insulting the Salem witch hunt. Fun stuff. Basically a lot of camera views where at first there's nothing but then suddenly there's a face! Ahh! It has some creepy moments i'll admit but nothing that will keep me up at night. The main character the sheriff has a bit of a neat persona in the movie which is slightly entertaining BUT I did give the movie a 5. I've definitely seen better.".

His direction has a very slapping things together sort of quality and with no subtlety or skill in short amateurish. But there are other things outside of Van Dyke's directing that makes A Haunting in Salem as bad as it is. It does look as though it was made in a rush with slapdash special effects and makeup that is even less convincing than badly done children's face paintings. The dialogue doesn't have sense of life flow or sense and the actors certainly seemed to think so because apart from Jenna Stonethe only halfway decent thing about the entire movie they give incredibly halfhearted performances. Bill Oberst Jnr doesn't deserve the unfair personal comments he's gotten but as an actor here he shows little charisma or passion. The story was especially bad here that it's slowmoving wouldn't have been a problem if the scares were interesting and the storytelling compelling enough. But because the scares are so predictable and the story so lacking in tension horror suspense thrills or fun the pacing just felt interminably dull so it was difficult to maintain interest. All in all a real bore and a poorly done movie all round excepting Stone. 110 Bethany Cox".

The couple have silent unresolved issues the eldest daughter hates the house the realtors obviously know something and with each new manifestation the family deteriorates.Along with the bythebooks script the casting here is the main problem. The mismatched couple never look like they've shared more than a few months together even though they have two kids. The wife is much too goodlooking for her husband and there's not one spontaneous sign of love throughout. Also there's no interaction between the kids so you're left with 4 characters that just don't gel.On the plus side the show moves rather briskly with barely a dead moment once the characters are established and the cinematography looks professional. As previously mentioned by another reviewer this would make a nice TV movieoftheweek. In other words it's slick but sorely lacks ambition.".

Additionally why kill the historian? She shows up twice once to hand out a welcome packet to the family and when she returns boils her face in water and then the body disappears. Why?? She must have been dating someone or just needed the screen time to get credit or something. The actors did a decent enough job with the material but the editing was bad the script was bad.. I wouldn't even recommend this for bad movie night.In the end the film comes off as a college project not a sequel to the A Haunting in.. series. The concept was good but I can definitely see why this film went straight to video. It was pretty much craptastic. Better luck to all the actors in their future endeavors and hopefully they can stay away from this kind of drek in the future. I guess everyone has to start out somewhere.".

One of the better features here comes from the film taking place in the typically creepy and chilling house which manages to utilize a great mixture of both the classic and more modern elements. The main house full of the creaking wooden hallways and panels sharp corners and the general air of history seeping through the walls really looks like the appropriate old school historically chilling house that maintains a suitable setting for the modern appliances that are at play here. Those more modern influences from their ability to interact with the teens over the computer messenger or appearing to manipulate their visions really begins to drive him insane as these tactics come off really well. These deliver some great hauntings as the scene of them pulling the hair from the shower drain with a tooth embedded in it the gagging daughter hallucination or the different flash visions that keep occurring around the house showing them strung u in a hangingstyle scenario which springs up quite often here to torment him. These scenes here provide the great framework for the actions leading up to the big finale in the actions of the possessed over the rest of the family which gives this one some great scenes of her utilizing the supernatural antics to attack and torment the others by popping up around them or launching attacks that are really much more impressive than expected to generate some nice bloody deaths immersed into the fine action. These here are what really works though there's a few flaws to be found here. The biggest issue to be found is the really weak and halfhearted storyline that manages to be quite a clich as well as goes for the copout explanation of everything which makes for a wholly simplistic affair. What should've been a thrilling exploration of the history of the house and the things going bump inside is instead glossed over in such a quick fashion that it really loses a lot of potential here by simply spelling everything out in one quick scene gives this one quite a lame buildup. It really could've given this one a greater sense of fear and suspense had this one gone for a more realistic route that allowed for the film to pace itself a little more. Even more to the point is the way this one goes for the overly familiar route of the ghostly haunting being presented here from the troubled figure driven insane by what's going on to the point of madness against the disbelief of his family the townsfolk who know it all and the ghosts coming back to seek revenge on such wrongdoers which gets targeted by their rampage all being quite familiar elements that are at play here and all told the story here is quite disappointing. As well the lowbudget look here is another factor to hold this one back from the crampedin feeling of the house and the early attack scenes to the CGI and the effects in general this one tends to have the lowbudget feel that's hard to get over.

I'm a straight male so I'm usually indifferent to an actor's appearance but I couldn't get past the fact that the lead actor looked like a fleshmuppet in a fright wig wearing his dad's oversize sheriff costume. The victims are supposed to be living in a home from the 1600's in Salem Mass. but there is clearly an orange tree in the background and the house looks to be from the Victorian period. Practically every victim is murdered by stabbing but when their bodies are found they are actually hung. I'm pretty sure that was an unnecessary hassle even for ghosts. There were a few scares but the type of scares I get by yelling boo at my dog. In fact they should have named this movie Boo! You're dead! and they could have avoided the whole 'obviously not Salem' problem. I could elaborate about the various ridiculous plot holes the cheesy makeup the shoddy foley work like in the climactic scene where the possessed daughter's bat makes a swinging noise before she actually swings but why run up the score? This was just a dumb movie. Not the guilty pleasure type of dumb either.".

The IM conversation that the daughter was having with Salem started to get on my nerves and I thought that point was useless. Not sure what type of computer she has where it cuts on and off by itself like that. The day and night scenes all in the same take was obvious bloopers and editing issues. The chic coming in the house and killing herself with the extremely fast boiling water scene should have been cut out. Not one time did anyone ever find her body in the Kitchen nor did the scene or lady ever come back up in the movie. Very bad editing...The part that really did it for me was when the wife was hanging by the rope towards the end of the movie and the husband comes in there to pour gas on her and hug her..Her eyes are blinking and I just died laughing at that point..I mean please cut that scene out and let her get some blinks in if she can't keep her eyes closed long enough..LMAO..Also not sure how the husband fell from three floors and gets up and walks around again.

	schema:headline " One of Cronenberg's best and most accessible films";
	schema:reviewBody "Cronenberg's adaptation of a Wagner and Locke graphic novel places a simple American family man and his allAmerican family into a new and disturbing context which has them questioning everything they think they know. Tom Stall Viggo Mortensen owns a little diner in a small town and has a nice house on the outskirts of town where he and his wife Edie Maria Bello raise their two kids apparently living the American dream in their own way. One day at the diner two murderers pop by at closing time for some cherry pie and Tom's heroic defense of his diner his customers and himself sets off a series of events that threaten his family his sanity and his life. The eerie tension never lets up in this powerful examination of identity honesty and violence.David Cronenberg has directed some of my favorite offbeat films  the masterpiece Naked Lunch Scanners Videodrome. I have watched these films many times and I still find them interesting. I can't really call myself a fan however because there are also just as many Cronenberg films out there which I found difficult to get through the first time Crash eXistenZ Dead Ringers. Cronenberg enjoys creating disturbing situations and imagery and wants to get under your skin and to stimulate your mind on as many levels as he can. In most cases he pulls it off masterfully but sometimes his emphasis on the bizarre can come across as pretentious and forced.Like a lot of very creative and intelligent people Cronenberg sometimes leaves his signature virtually everywhere in his work. And sometimes a director needs to make a film which does everything they want to accomplish but leaves off the signature. For example  the brilliant David Lynch showed us his ability to jump out of his own skin with Elephant Man and The Straight Story. These are still very much Lynch films but they also appeal to the wider audience of mainstream cinemagoers. A History of Violence is in some ways Cronenberg's most straightforward film. A key to its success is that it is very easy to forget that you are watching a Cronenberg film no matter how aware you are of Cronenberg's many quirks idiosyncrasies and trademarks. It is so masterfully directed that although the plot is not entirely unpredictable you are right there in the action with the characters and feeling what they feel so that though you may know what's next you never exactly see it coming and you never know how it will take you there.Viggo Mortensen in his best mainstream role since Aragorn and Maria Bello one of the actors who made The Cooler worth watching head an impressive cast in this adaptation of a Wagner and Locke graphic novel. Nobody in the cast slips up at all. The script is intense realistic and probably did nothing to make the performances easy. The plot if described without the plot and the context created by the script would seem somewhat absurd but like Woody Allen's Match Point it's absurdity does not make it impossible to believe. Editing directing and pure performance combine to make flawless performances for this cast. Backed up by veterans Ed Harris and William Hurt and very strongly supported by the excellent Maria Bello Mortensen is shockingly excellent in a difficult role. I can't explain why without giving too much of the film away. Although the rest of the cast did exactly as they were supposed to I want to single out Ashton Holmes  an actor I was completely unfamiliar with but who I will look out for in the future.I recommend A History of Violence highly. It is one of my top five reasons for considering 2005 to have been a great year in North American film.".

Viggo Mortensen proved he's one of the finest actors to come along in a long while. Maria Bello carries so much on her talented shoulders. With Mortensen she shines with alternately warming and heartbreaking truthfulness. Ed Harris was delightfully menacing and William Hurt gave the liveliest and best performance I've seen from him.This movie is about truth and redemption.

The screenplay is exceptionally tight and wellwoven  no image is wasted. The subplot of the son's troubles with a school bully parallels the main plot. The very existence of the son is there to show the inheritance  the history  of violence. The sex scenes are there to show the proximity of lust and violence. The end can be nothing other than what it is as someone else on IMDb has commented the genie is out of the bottle. This is true for the family in the film the society we see surrounding the family and it's true for our families and our society. It's about the inexhaustible rage of humans.

In the film violence lurks in every corner and the characters are forced to defend themselves. Definitely my favorite Cronenberg film also his most mainstream I might add. It's a modern Western and reminds one of those great Western films. As the title indicates it's a very violent film but guess it will be toned down as usual specially the sex scene. All the stars are in peek form and perfectly cast. William Hurt makes a comeback to better roles. He was also great in The King. It will and should get some awards at the end of the year from critics and etc.".

Not long after facially scarred Carl Fogarty arrives in town proclaiming that Tom is actually a former gangster from Philadelphia who needs to go back to pay his dues. As Fogarty and his Hench Men put the pressure on Stall and his family are in danger of being overwhelmed with violence and mistrust. One thing that can never be said about David Cronenberg is that he is a very predictable director his output of course if we are all honest is very up and down bewildering critics and fans in equal measure. Thankfully A History Of Violence finds Cronenberg on particularly devilish form taking the graphic novel origins of the piece written by John Wagner  Vince Locke and crafting a modern day Western that is using violence as some sort of escalating disease. This is the point surely? The graphic violence handled with morose tension by Cronenberg is the main character in the film regardless of any past history that Stall may have had the violence arrives into this family totally unwanted and unexpected and then latches on to them to maybe destroy them? With that point of interest to note A History Of Violence can be seen as a blood brother to Cronenberg's wonderful remake of The Fly the unwanted entering the fray and spreading its disease to the point of no return. There is the use of the husband and wife's ongoing sex life as a seriously smart strand in the escalating story where once at the beginning there is fluffy erotic intercourse then the on going danger in their lives brings darkness and borderline sadism it's very relevant as is the son axis as he goes through a dramatic change when the violence and threats engulf the family. Cronenberg gleefully ties all the murky threads together to ask us for a reaction to the violence up there on the screen. The cast with the exception of a fish out of water performance from Ashton Holmes as the son Jack is fine. Viggo Motensen plays the duality of the role as Tom Stall with much verve while Maria Bello shows exactly why she shouldn't be working for food in hopeless miscast assignments like The Mummy 3. Ed Harris gives us a nice line in villain duties and William Hurt crops up late in the piece to almost steal the film with his darkly disturbing menacing point of worth. Peter Suschitzky's photography enhances the primary colours for added impact when the mood swings down dark roads and Howard Shore's musical score is constantly ominous where he blends his own score for Silence of the Lambs with a sort of Berlioz like edginess. All in all it's a very interesting and sneakily crafty picture that above all else shows that when on form Cronenberg still has very much to offer modern age cinema. Now about Straw Dogs? 8.510".

Peter Suschitzky's photography enhances the primary colours for added impact when the mood swings down dark roads and Howard Shore's musical score is constantly ominous where he blends his own score for Silence of the Lambs with a sort of Berlioz like edginess. All in all it's a very interesting and sneakily crafty picture that above all else shows that when on form Cronenberg still has very much to offer modern age cinema. Now about Straw Dogs? 8.510";

Let's set aside the perfection of expression. For what it is it surely is competent. What's disturbing is how his notion of drift has been compromised. This time it is drift from one conventional movie world to another from the fiction of a happy family to the similarly artificial fiction of an invulnerable killing machine. There's no basic reality it starts with one artificiality and goes to another.The one it goes to is wholly conventional and could have been lifted from several hundred movies intact.

	schema:reviewBody "How one views a movie often deals with one's approach to the film. I made a mistake with this movie. I went in having had difficulty securing a Cronenberg movie before waiting to get an introduction to his style. I went in expecting based on what I've heard about Cronenberg a stylized film. I came in expecting a theme.I was mostly disappointed on all three marks. What I ended up with was a fairly straightforward identity thriller and that surprised me.Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall a docile man in a docile world. Viggo Mortensen's style of acting judging by Lord of the Rings Hidalgo and this film is to whisper when he's getting dramatic. This works well with the film in that everyone in it is either just as docile as Tom or trying to be smooth and stoic which involves an outward appearance of docility. Tom Stall owns a caf has a good family has no worries but that he can't get his truck started. Then some violent criminals decide to mess with his coworkers during closing and he shows a side of himself nobody in the film expected the ability to kill with relative ease. So thus the audience is in the search for his identity who he is and where he came from.This film started many things and decided to give them up. At first it seems a film to look into the undercurrent of violence in even the most domestic of communities. Then it seems to be a film of mistaken identity and bad fate. Then it just decides to be another story of a man escaping a past he didn't like and finding out that he can't... as in what we've seen many many times before.But it's a Cronenberg film. This means that it's stylized interesting and special right? Honestly I saw nothing in this film that struck me particularly as something only Cronenberg could do. Sure there's some pretty detailed gore effects but they're sporadic random and worst of all not needed for anything. Sure there's some strange sexual encounters but they don't really seem as anything except for sex they don't develop the characters they don't add anything to the story they just exist in a sort of acceptable state of Well might as well find a way to show these characters having sex. They do reveal that Viggo Mortensen doesn't have that great of a body if anybody cares about that.Speaking of the writing indeed it doesn't seem real care or interest was put into the script. Nothing particularly new is given us the dialog could have been cut and pasted in any other movie of this genre and the character development was again straightforward and unappealing.As I mentioned before I thought a large part of the lethargy in this film had something to do with the theme of violence as an undercurrent but my mistake was thinking there was a theme. Even during moments when the action starts to pick up it feels like the actors are really just sleepwalking through their roles. Only Ed Harris seemed to have any fun at all everything else about this movie seems as though Cronenberg forced the cast and crew to stay awake for 24 hours before filming began to make everything seem lazy. Even the cinematography seems lazy after the wonderful long take at the beginning. However stuff like the closeups never really added to drama but more made me frustratingly want to take the director's chair and say All right move back a couple of feet give us some room! It's not a bad film. It's just that the ending credits came up after an exhaustingly long ending sequence of no importance and I couldn't help asking Oh? So what? This film is a good film to have some fun over the weekend with but it's not really anything that can stick with you.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "In the middle of the night young Sarah Heidi Hayes wakes from a nightmare. Her father Tom Stall Viggo Mortensen comforts her saying There are no such thing as monsters Director David Cronenberg's A History of Violence questions whether human monsters are truly born or trained to be so. Based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke Josh Olson's screenplay offers a provocative answer. Though for Cronenberg and Olson  the power of A History of Violence lies in its character study. Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall is commanding and powerful as the center of this character piece. This is one the year's best movies.Cronenberg creates the idyllic setting of a small Indiana town. Tom Stall Mortensen is a mild mannered and community respected family man. He has a loving and beautiful wife Edie strong and smart Maria Bello. His daughter Sarah likes shopping for shoes. His teenage son Jack Ashton Holmes is sucking as a baseball player and a target of bully Bobby Kyle Schmid. Tom owns Stall's Dinner in town. Then one day ruthless killers evil Stephen McHattie and Greg Bryk draw their guns in a robbery attempt at Tom's diner. Tom kills both like they are not even there. He dispatches them with awesome deadly force and brutality. His actions are warranted and seemingly instinctive. Tom becomes a town and national hero. His photo even appears on CNN.Soon after returning to work a mysterious man and his henchmen visit Tom in his diner. The man Carl Fogerty menacing Ed Harris reveals a disfiguring injury and claims to know Tom as Joey Cusack. Tom really does not seem to know Carl and kindly asks him to leave. Things don't seem to add up regarding Tom. Carl later asks Tom's wife Edie Why is he Tom so good at killing people. Cronenberg brilliantly lulls us in a sense of normalcy then launches in a predetermined direction and tone. He hints at his answer with son Jack's explosive actions. Also his A History of Violence is a study of extremes likely intentional. The violence is graphic controlled brutality and merciless. The sex scene with Tom and Edie on the stairs is raw and erotic. Cronenberg also manages an unexpected resolution.Viggo Mortensen is electrifying. He uses his classic good looks and understated charm to play the gentle family man Tom Stall. Mortensen also displays a powerful and explosive presence as Tom's darker persona. Mortensen is athletic and expertly performs the amazing martial arts and fight scenes. Maria Bello is awesome as Edie. Even with her glamor subdued she is stunning and sexy. Her Edie is strong willed enduring her own doubts regarding who her husband really is. Her reaction at the story's arc is both believable and heartbreaking. She and Mortensen have amazing chemistry. Ed Harris is calculated evil as Carl Fogerty. Newcomer Ashton Holmes is impressive as young Jack. His portrayal leads us to believe it maybe truly in the blood. William Hurt's turn in a pivotal role is unexpectedly shocking and completely effective.Cronenberg has fashioned a fable about character and fate in A History of Violence. This is one of the best movies of the year. Viggo Mortensen is simply powerful. A History of Violence is worth seeing and worthy of thought.".

While the violence is quite graphic as to be expected with Cronenberg the camera does not linger on it at all. The real story is told through the emotional dynamics in the family as the plot unfolds. Mortensen's performance as Tom Stall is brilliant and wonderfully nuanced and the entire cast is first rate. Maria Bello as the wife and Ashton Holmes as the son and Ed Harris as the heavy are spot on. William Hurt's scene is a standout. There are moments in the film where you laugh and then are horrified within seconds. DC doesn't dumb down to the audience but enjoys the complexities of human reactions to issues of identity violence and society's view of good versus bad violence. I still can't get this film out of my mind. I'm definitely planning on seeing it again when it opens widely. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leaving this film just an hour ago now I heard a phrase rolling over  and over again in my head Wow.  Wow. I cannot find adequate words  to relate. I found myself saying Why?...Oh my god!...How?...Wow....  The film touches it festers crawls all over and inside you. The film  does I think what Cronenberg intended it to do frighten. I'm  speaking of real fear that is not spoken out loud not discussed or  screamed aboutor even fully understood. The best and only word I have  to describe the film is that it is unsettling.  I won't discuss the points relating to the sexuality of the film but  will quickly address the violence. I read Cronenberg's answers to some  questions raised by the film most relating to the violence itself. He  mentions that it is intimate nasty brutish and quick also going on  at length on the utilitarian nature of the violent acts in the film.  This is perhaps the first film I've seen to display violence in what I  consider to be a true sense. It is over so quickly and before one can  marvel at it the guilt and terror washes over like waves in a storm.  It's relatively refreshing albeit downright sickening to see a film  that can still shock the hell out of what is thought to be a  desensitized generation.  That being said one must remember that an author poet director etc.  NEVER has the final say on what a book poem or film's meaning is or  what its symbols or set pieces are about. Each person in turn must have  his or her take on the medium. I'd like to close with my final and  wholly overriding thought concerning A History of Violence It is a  film which I desperately wish to see again but equally compelling is  the urge to never ever see it again. Never have such strong yet  equally conflicting views about something so trivial as a film entered  my psyche.  The rating of 10 is based on my personal experience with the film not  necessarily the merit of the film itself.  You may interpret that as you will.".

	schema:headline " one of the best movies of Cronenberg";
	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg's films seem to be obsessed with the coexistence of the extremes of bad and evil  in the same body as in 'The Fly' on the same highway as in 'Crash' in the same game as in 'eXistenZ'. In his latest film he seems to be saying  evil is here among us it is dormant in any of us it can be awaken and maybe put to sleep again but at a price.The story is told with minimal means. Tom Stall is a midage midbusiness owner in a midstate the type of environment which is the fabric of quite and conservative America. One evening two killers enter his coffee shop and he does what any good American hero should do  kills them to defend his property and his coworkers. Having become a local celebrity life does not turn to the good for him as mobsters come to visit him pretending that he is a hidden criminal which he denies convincingly and intending bring him back to a crime life. When he again will do the hero act to defend his family his dexterity in holding a gun raises everybody's suspicion.Viggo Mortensen is doing a remarkable act. His only previous big time role was in 'Lord of the Rings' but there is nothing here to remind Peter Jackson's epic. His role reminds more Bill Murray's 'Broken Flowers' he is filling the screen with a calm that hides intense feelings. Another couple of great secondary riles are being filled in by Ed Harris and Willian Hurt.It's not a perfect movie. ALthough it lasts less than 100 minutes which is quite remarkable in today's Hollywood it still has a good 15 minutes of redundant stuff including a secondary story thread involving the hero's son highschool conflicts and two 'steamy' sex scenes unneeded for the logic of the movie. On the other hand the film ending is so memorable that I can already place it among the best endings in the history of cinema close to the one of 'Casablanca'. 'A History of Violence' is worth seeing one of the best of Cronenberg and one of the best of 2005. It's a shame that the Oscars seem to have ignored it totally.".

Mortensen was okay though it seemed like he was repeating every other sentence that came out of his mouth. perhaps this is trying to portray Tom talking for his own benefit as well as others convincing himself of that things he's saying are right  for the best but even if that is the case it just came off as downright annoying. Maria Bello should stay on TV Ed Harris was... well Ed Harris and William Hurt  what's the big deal? he was on screen for all of five minutes and at no point during that period of time did i see him do or say anything of worth or as some have suggested amusement. he should have stayed on the set of 'lost in space'.now the violence and sexual content. put simply i really didn't care. not at one moment in the movie did i feel any emotional contact with any of the characters' violent actions and their reasons for committing them save for  SPOILER  the son knocking the crap out of his tormentor at school and that was simply because throughout i found the bully character so utterly pathetic and laughable that for all i cared he might as well have been put in hospital. END SPOILER  none of the violence really offended me. sure i was shocked in a few places but that was simply because within a matter of seconds  SPOILER  one of the 'bad guys' had the front of his face hanging off. END SPOILER  so in this respect Cronenberg doesn't hold back with or indeed glamorise the violence and certainly shows the immediacy and horror of it all but to be honest so what? it's hardly a difficult task to accomplish especially for someone of Cronenberg's abilities. some of the sexual content also struck me as crass. SPOILER  now don't get me wrong i'm always down for Maria Bello with a completely untied dressing gown in fact i waited what felt like years for that to happen in ER but in the context of the film for the love of god WHY? so her and Aragorn get busy on the stairs in an odd 'what's going to happen' moment then he's sitting in the bedroom she comes out naked closes her dressing gown and runs away in disgust. so now they can't have sex anymore. END SPOILER  does Cronenberg regard his audience as complete morons? or was there really no other way to indicate Maria Bello's feelings towards Mortensen's character? on this evidence David Cronenberg is turning into Paul Verhoeven sans the wit.i don't often say this about movies but going to see 'a history of violence' felt like a waste of money. usually there's something in a film i can invest in be it a character the cinematography or even the score something that actually going to the movies really accentuates but this picture had none of the aforementioned redeeming features. that said i probably wouldn't let other people's opinions form a basis on whether i shouldn't bother seeing a movie. all i'm saying is if you have to satisfy your curiosity wait for the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Title A History of Violence 2005 Director David Cronenberg Cast Vigo Mortensen Ed Harris William Hurt Maria Bello Ashton HolmesReview David Cronenberg. The name is synonymous with films dealing with violent and sexual content matter. Films like The Fly Videodrome Rabid Shivers eXistence Scanners and Crash all deal with the dark violent and sexual side of the human nature. Of course all those movies were sprinkled in one way or another with sciifhorror elements. I personally became accustomed to seeing Cronenberg address his usual themes mixed with some sort of fantasy yet here comes A History of Violence a film without a single creature monster or decease to be seen. What is this new fiction less Cronenberg like? Do his films still rock without a fantastic element to aid them? The story in this film revolves around Tom Stall. A guy who lives a seemingly perfect family life. He has a beautiful wife a cute little girl and a happy go lucky teenager. He has his own little diner in a small town in the middle of hickville USA. Basically the guy lives a quiet happy life with his family and friends. But one day a pair of certified evil doers walk into his diner and decide to rob the place. Things get a little hairy when Toms heroics make him an instant celebrity and a part of his hidden past begins to resurface.The strength in this movie are the incredible performances. We have a very strong cast filled with seasoned veterans that bring these characters to life. Viggo Mortensen does good as Tom the guy you'd love to have as a neighbor or a boss. The all around nice guy. Of course the guy has a dark hidden side to him and Mortensen played well the role of a guy trying to repress those darker impulses. Ed Harris playing a gangster type in search for Tom does a very memorable job as one of the villains in the film. He truly devours this role and portrays a cool and calculating villain who means business. And in this movie we don't get just one memorable villain but two since in an interesting turn of events William Hurt actually plays a villain in this film. I'm used to seeing Hurt play the nice guy the caring father not the cold hearted villain. And this makes the character all the more interesting.Maria Bello as Toms wife did a fine performance as a sexy wife who will go out of her way to make her man happy. Even doing some role playing games when in bed. If you're a guy you'll love the scene where she dresses up as a cheerleader to make Tom feel like he is a teenager all over again. And speaking of teenagers Ashton Holmes playing Toms son did a very good performance as well as a kid trying to avoid violence in school but ultimately succumbing to it. So all in all we get some really good performances from everybody involved.And how about that good old fashion Cronenberg violence? Well it is toned down in this film when compared to the all the gore seen in his previous films. This movie focuses more on its themes and story and performances then in shocking you with its gore. But when violence does occur its very significant and yes still shocking. Like the short controlled burst of a machine gun in this flick Cronenberg controls the levels of violence but when he does fire them at us the are just as shocking as anything he has ever done. There are some truly intense moments on this one.This is one of Cronenbergs best films. And this comes from a guy who has seen almost all of his films. This movie demonstrates a sure steady hand in storytelling. This is one dose of sex and violence you wont want to miss. Nothing bad to report on this one.Rating 5 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Are you in the mood for a fastpaced actionpacked thriller? Well so was I. Unfortunately you won't find it here. However if you were extremely interested in A History of Violence after watching the trailer and you're in the mood to be disappointed then by all means knock yourself out with this one! I simply don't understand why everybody is praising this one to the high heavens. I was looking forward to it and I hate to say that it's simply the biggest disappointment of the year. It starts off on a promising note when Viggo takes care of the bad guys who enter his diner. For a few brief moments it looks like it's trying to be a wellcrafted mysterythriller. But once it starts inducing unintentional laughter thanks to scenes that look like they came out of a bad after school special or a soft core madeforlatenightCinemax film we realize that this is just a complete mess.The sex scenes? Gratuitous and completely out of place. I have to believe that Cronenberg's desired reaction from the audience was NOT chuckling and shouts of Someone fast forward please! And the acting of the secondary characters? Laughable. What was up with the high school bully? This Randy TravisPatrick Swayze hybrid sashays onto the screen sportin' a nice 80s mullet and a flipped up jacket collar looking like he just tried out for a rejected pilot called Son of Fonzi.Viggo's son isn't much better spitting out completely ridiculous lines like Hey dad they want to interview you because of what you just did! Thank you Captain Obvious. The lion's share of the bad dialogue goes to this cue card reader and I sure wish I could expose more of it to you. Unfortunately doing so would reveal too many spoilers and I refuse to do that no matter how much of a letdown the movie is.I dare you to try to avoid erupting into laughter when William Hurt's mob character appears and plays the clich card so close to the vest that you're left waiting for him to say something like Youse wants I should trows youse a beatin'? Were these supposed to be caricatures? The movie takes itself way too seriously for me to believe that's the case.I started to lose all hope once the mystery that was crafted at the beginning produced an unfortunately predictable payoff but I thought there was a chance we'd be served a nice big slice of knockout ending. Thought wrong. Viggo's fighting at the end is pretty cool but it only occupied maybe 5 minutes of screen time. So what do we get rather than a slam dunk finale? Well the closing scene of the movie might as well be called The History of Silence because the audience is forced to sit there and watch Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello just stare at each other for what feels like about half an hour. I'm sure plenty of turtleneckwearing movie critics will find some sort of hidden meaning in their glares but had I been at home I would've been trying to find the remote so I could make use of the friendly fast forward button.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg is a very accomplished director  what with The Fly 1986 Naked Lunch Scanners and of coarse Dead Ringers he has done a marvelous job directing numerous pictures with different subjects and genres. However all his films carry on thing through and that is emotional impact of events on the individuals depicted. A History once again follows through with that in images and feelings almost on par with Dead Ringers. This is a study of violence through an incident and how it's effects play on those affiliated with the committer. Viggo Mortenson turns in a tourdeforce performance as Tom Stall without his acting abilities the film would fall under the weight of it's subject matter. The script is a wide breathing and alive it conveys and allows every emotion to weave through it without detouring from the main theme. Cronenberg's directing is as excellent as ever and though some may argue this is his most mainstream film his style and presence is felt throughout. From the beginning lingering shot of the hotel room you will be hooked and entranced throughout. The only negative thing available to be said would be that the son's Ashton Holme's acting is very stilted throughout and when he is set to deliver an emotional outcry he falls slightly below expectation especially amongst such well equipped and experienced actors as Maria Bello Edie Stall. Howard Shore's score is very subdued but it should be and it elevates the ever encompassing dread and tension that is on full display through the film aside from the beginning. All in all I just must say great film.".

This is a study of violence through an incident and how it's effects play on those affiliated with the committer. Viggo Mortenson turns in a tourdeforce performance as Tom Stall without his acting abilities the film would fall under the weight of it's subject matter. The script is a wide breathing and alive it conveys and allows every emotion to weave through it without detouring from the main theme. Cronenberg's directing is as excellent as ever and though some may argue this is his most mainstream film his style and presence is felt throughout. From the beginning lingering shot of the hotel room you will be hooked and entranced throughout. The only negative thing available to be said would be that the son's Ashton Holme's acting is very stilted throughout and when he is set to deliver an emotional outcry he falls slightly below expectation especially amongst such well equipped and experienced actors as Maria Bello Edie Stall. Howard Shore's score is very subdued but it should be and it elevates the ever encompassing dread and tension that is on full display through the film aside from the beginning. All in all I just must say great film.";

It turned out to be a very refreshing experience indeed. Although this is easily Cronenbergs most accessible film one that may disappoint old fans but will certainly win him lots of mainstream viewers it's still a long shot from the clichridden thrillers one usually gets to review. A clever manipulative take at the titlegiving topic oscillating between relaxed midwestern realism and the extreme almost comic brutality one has got used to in the wake of Lynch Woo and Tarantino. Very minor plot spoilers in the following two paragraphs A History of Violence is the story of simple good  not to say goodlooking though his filmwife Maria Bello calls him just that in a slightly ironic moment typical of the film's many Hollywoodreferences  family man Tom Stall Viggo Mortensen who's suddenly faced with a couple of brutal killers walking into his coffeeshop with every intention to wreak havoc. He rises to the occasion surprising himself his employees and the audience by deftly finishing the villains off and becomes the rather unwilling allAmerican hero of the day. Unfortunately in the wake of Tom Stall's sudden fame an evil bigtown gangster Ed Harris shows up black limousine scarface bodyguards and all who insists on recognizing Stall and mistaking him for someone else  someone with precisely a history of violence behind him.

And of course eventually the situation gets out of handWhat really distinguishes this mistakenidentity plot of the type innocentmanisfacedwithviolenceandhastoact from other similar films Dirty Harry and many Westerns come to mind is the way Canadian David Cronenberg manages to deconstruct the USculture of visual violence and armed selfdefense by seducing his audience to embrace that culture to like his characters in spite of their brutal actions to have fun and feel uncomfortable about it at the same time.In addition to that Cronenberg also takes his audience on a ride through the total range of human emotions from loving tenderness to blazing hatred portraying every possible human relationship each of which features an aspect of violence at some time  sexual relations certainly included though those may not feature in fulllength in the US theatrical versions... Man and wife parents and children brothers and sisters boys and girls old friends and young bullies  you get it all portrayed by an excellent carefully chosen cast of actors that manage to make their characters come realistically to life in spite of  or rather in juxtaposition to  the topical story. Cronenberg in fact took pains to choose actors who aren't just charismatic glamorous stars taking care of their image but who have a reputation for embracing their roles for being somewhat eccentric and therefore willing to go beyond the usual acting limits. Next to Viggo Mortensen Maria Bello and Ed Harris there is also William Hurt who appears later on as a criminal and who quite obviously really enjoyed his role. The final scenes between him and Mortensen are easily the most drastically violent ones in the movie reminiscent of the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke this film is based on. They are also the ones that had the critics laughing  although it was the kind of laughter that sticks uncomfortably in the throat.".

Although the acting is decent the lines are clunky and there are big plausibility issuesand little ones like a TV reporter who is completely foiled by I don't want to talk about it and a sheriff who says things like We're good people around here. But maybe most importantly the movie just proceeds dutifully from one scene to the next where people say and do things that are completely obvious that reveal no emotional depth and that really have no purpose. Anyone who has seen the TV ads knows that Tom was probably once a ruthless killer and yep sure enough he was.

This results in the real Tom StallsJoey Cusack emerging who violently pins her down before she consents to having rough sex with him. What the hell was this movie trying to say at this stage?

In fact it couldn't be more bollks if it was wrapped in hairy skin and hanging from the back of a bull! It was just a crass attempt to inject some sexual interest into a horribly stale script.If this was all that was wrong with the movie you may partially overlook it but sadly no it manages to sink to even worse depths.

How we are supposed to suspend our disbelief trademark Basic Instinct  possibly the last time I felt this angry about a movie! to believe that a professional gangster can miss shooting someone five times from 4 foot is beyond me.The best gauge I can give you of how poor this movie was is that of a fairly full audience at my particular screening there were howls of laughter at the poor acting in seemingly dramatic and gripping moments of the film. At first this annoyed me as i really wanted to give the film a chance but as the film progressed I couldn't help but join in. As the film faded to black at the end and the credits began to roll there was a deep intake of breath by the whole audience before universal laughter and derision. People were reacting their favourite poor scenes in the lobby after as a homage to the level of crap it reached!

The movie is plagued with bad acting bad dialogue miscasting and a clich plot. I've read comments that the movie is introspective. But I failed to see an introspective moment on screen.SPOILERS The sex scene between Viggo and Maria on the stairs was realistic but the sixtynine sex scene supposedly to show how into each other they were didn't work. While it's a great position between partners it looks ridiculous when trying to show intimacy. Especially when they acted like they were snacking on each other.Maria Bello Cast as a small town attorney. Miscast maybe. Her look speaks to big city lawyer but not small town.Viggo At least Maria tried to act. Viggo looked like someone was feeding him his lines from behind the camera. I really love his wooden acting when he tries to tell Maria that he thought he buried Joey a long time ago. It looked like he was going to laugh at one point. Plus it's hard to take a middleaged man named Joey seriously.DirectionViggo's limping scene as he tries to race home to save his family. Crazy. Viggo snapping a flunkie's neck on his way out of his criminal brother's office. HIlarious. Or even the choice to have all the mob guys wear black like a vampire convention.I could maybe forgive those scenes or not but I couldn't stand the obvious metaphor with the weak bully who preyed on Viggo's son. The bully was really a wimp at heart and Viggo's son was just waiting for his burst of motivation to take on the bully and his flunkie in the spirit of his father's heroism. Haven't seen that before.But the worst was no not Ed Harris hamming it up as Mr. Fogarty but Viggo's daughter. She had to be one of the most grating child actors ever cast. She was horrible.In summary from the moment Viggo's family crowded around the little girl because she had a nightmare and all were there to console her in Cronenberg's hackneyed attempt to show Tom Stall's initially perfect existence to the end when TomJoeyMichael Myers comes home to find his family tensely sitting at the dinner table and little girl Sarah pulls out a plate to show daddy TomJoeyJason X is still part of the family the movie was a complete package of one terribly directed clich after another.".

Possibly because he's an actor rather than a star and doesn't Stall in a showey manner  just an average family man wanting to get on with his life and the film does emphasise his everyman nature . The film does three distinct acts  Tom the family man  the mystery involving Tom and finally the showdown featuring Tom the man with a violent past The problem is that the first third is slightly slow which isn't necessarily a criticism  the second third is very intriguing and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats but the final third is fairly daft . Fair enough it's not too difficult to buy in to the idea that Tom was once involved with the mob but the violent climax at the home of mob boss Richie Cusack is rather ridiculous as he dispatches bad guys who in these type of movies stand around watching their colleagues get beaten to a pulp and not intervening till the good guy manages to get hold of a gun and only then does the bad guy pull out his own shooter only to get shot by the good guy . You've seen this all too often in straight to DVD releases and for two thirds of the way through you're aware that this is too far good to be anywhere near a Steven Seagal straight to DVD movie".

	schema:reviewBody "Family man Tom Stall runs a coffee shop in a quiet town. The shop is visited by two criminals and through an act of bravery and unprecedented violence Tom becomes the local hero. As he and his family attempt to return to normality in walk another group who do not belong headed up by a Mr Foggarty demanding Tom admit he is not who he claims to be. It is the calling into question of Tom's identity that sets the stage for this Cronenberg classic.The film's strengths are numerous. First there is not a weak link in the cast even the people we haven't seen before most notably Tom's son Jack turn in great efforts. Maria Bello may as well be married to Viggo Mortensen Ed Harris is his usual intimidating brilliant self and in a role that can't take up more than ten minutes' screen time William Hurt almost steals it with a character unlike any he has played before. Then we have the formidable Viggo giving a clever studied subtle utterly convincing performance as Tom. Just how studied and subtle it is in fact becomes clearer on repeat viewing. He is the new master of the understated performance understanding the power of lowkey finesse in a way that echoes the likes of De Niro and Spacey. The theme of violence being fundamental to the human condition joins the more common ones in Cronenberg's work questions of identity and the complex duality of human nature. The latter of these is examined at its closest with two very different very deliberate love scenes which Cronenberg put into the film himself they were never part of the original graphic novel. The first is a scene that shows us just how beautiful and fun sex should be between a couple this deeply in love and is a pure joy to watch the second is a superb juxtaposition that properly challenges the audience.From a technical perspective there really isn't anything wrong with this film. It looks great the score by long time Cronenberg collaborator Howard Shore does exactly what it is supposed to do underpinning every moment of tension and drama. Cronenberg's talent allows him to work through a few different tones including at points dark humour. There is in fact a scene you could believe had been written by Tarantino which doesn't sound like it should work in such an otherwise serious film but it is perfect.The review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the violence of course. It is straightforward without glamour or sheen instant sloppy and always justified. It is this that interests Cronenberg how we justify violence and even applaud it. We fully appreciate the violence we see is necessary but he wants us to acknowledge it isn't a light subject we just brush over. Regardless of how right it seems real violence is never pretty and should stay with you it should change you. The technique of manipulating the audience making them complicit in the violence is not a new one Kubrick and Tarantino are both famous for it but when Cronenberg does it it is to ensure that whilst cheering we understand what we're cheering. This ties nicely back in with that Croneberg theme of duality.A perfect provocative film for a mature audience with a closing scene that may disappoint those who haven't been paying attention. It haunts and provokes.".

As he and his family attempt to return to normality in walk another group who do not belong headed up by a Mr Foggarty demanding Tom admit he is not who he claims to be. It is the calling into question of Tom's identity that sets the stage for this Cronenberg classic.The film's strengths are numerous. First there is not a weak link in the cast even the people we haven't seen before most notably Tom's son Jack turn in great efforts. Maria Bello may as well be married to Viggo Mortensen Ed Harris is his usual intimidating brilliant self and in a role that can't take up more than ten minutes' screen time William Hurt almost steals it with a character unlike any he has played before. Then we have the formidable Viggo giving a clever studied subtle utterly convincing performance as Tom. Just how studied and subtle it is in fact becomes clearer on repeat viewing.

	schema:headline " Moodysson's increasing challenge to his audience";
	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilers about plot This is not by any stretch of the imagination an easy film to watch or then to attempt to explain and defend after watching it. It is quite likely that the most common description of it will be made with words such as 'gross' and 'disgusting' which are examples of what I've overheard in movie theatre lines during the rest of the week at the Toronto International Film Festival Sept 9 18 2004.In fact the reactions of 'gross' and 'disgusting' against the actions on display in the film are likely the very ones that Moodysson is hoping to provoke but I don't think that many will love the film itself for doing it.At the world premiere screening in Toronto on Friday September 10 2004 projected onto 2 screens in 2 separate theaters simultaneously to Moodysson's amusement the director gave a brief greeting at the beginning and brushed off festival programmer Steve Gravestock's introductory comments of it being 'an unforgettable film' and then dedicated the screening to his children as he said he was missing them.We were then rocked for 98 minutes with a barrage of various scenes usually revolving around sexual images and actions several of which can only be described as being of a perverse and sadomasochistic nature and which were also sometimes accompanied by a soundtrack resembling electronic feedback and static white noise although sometimes it was conventional poprock music and it ended blessedly with Bach's St. Matthew Passion.The plot in brief involves Rickard who is shooting a homemade porno film with his friends Tess and Geko inside the very apartment he lives in with his teenage son Eric. Most of the scenes for the amateur porno start to veer from the realm of any sort of conventional pornography into simulated violence and degradation to the disgust of the son who is the only voice of reason in the apartment but often retreats into his room to listen to music on head phones. Fortunately several of the worst actions are performed with or on dolls and rubberlatex sexual organ molds. Rickard the filmmaker has some personal demons which are revealed during the course of the film and although he is supposedly the main instigator of the porno he is not portrayed as being evil but rather as pitiful. Tess the young woman in the porno is desperate for fame and dreams of making a career whether through reality TV she auditioned but didn't get on the Swedish 'Big Brother' TV programme or pornography she asks Rickard if he has sent the tape yet to a supposed porno distributor he knows in Los Angeles. Geko the porno actor is at a loss as to how people really connect with each other when Rickard asks him for advice on how he should relate to his son Geko suggests taking him to a gun shooting range but has some sort of innate joy in life as he runs around in a field perhaps making crop circles. Even when Rickard and Geko go too far and start to terrify Tess with simulated violence for the porno she eventually returns to the apartment joyous and full of mothering and bringing food and drink back for everyone. The feast soon deteriorates into a disgusting food fight however. Tess is barely out of her teens herself and eventually connects with the teenage son Eric on a playful childish level as they go off to the laundry and each try to climb inside the washingdrying machine likely a metaphor for returning to the womb.We were mostly all too stunned to know how to react at the end and to even know what to ask at the QA session after the film. One audience member's question of whether the film was a statement against reality television was answered by Moodysson saying that they were very close to one of the statements being made by the film of which there were eleven in total. Moderator Gravestock's quick take on that was to ask whether anyone wished to try to guess the other ten. No one did at the time but here is an attempt in no particular order after thinking about this film for several days already.This film is a statement against 1 Selfabasement of self and others for the purposes of garnering a temporary and illusory fame through the media. 2 The degradation of women in various media not only pornography. 3 Violence against women. 4 The objectification of women in various media again not only pornography. 5 The superficiality of modern day pop psychology 6 The gluttony and greed of the Western World 7 The waste of food and resources by the same Western World 8 Selfmutilation via cosmetic surgery in order to supposedly improvebeautify one's appearance. 9 Gun 'culture' andor any other sort of violence oriented entertainment pasttime 10 The indifference of people to other people who are in crisis or need. 11 The abuse of children And finally an all encompassing statement that Everyone has to potential in themselves to do evil things so don't go looking to blame others for the problems such as the above you yourself are part of the problem especially if you are not actively working against it.Due to the extreme subject matter and images it is not likely that this film will receive a wide release distribution outside its production countries of Sweden and Denmark and the film festival circuit so if it is of interest you should make the most of any rare opportunity to see it.Moodysson continues the provocation and raging that he kicked into overdrive with 'Lilja 4ever' but that even began with the portrayals against intolerance and narrowmindedness and stereotyping in 'Show Me Love' and 'Together' I have not seen 'Terrorists'. It is difficult to imagine that he will ever do a more difficult film but with Moodysson every film has been an increasing challenge to his audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having loved 'Together' and admired for the most part 'Lilya 4Ever' as well as his short films I was dreadfully disappointed with this new work from Moodyson. In an interview about 'A Hole On My Heart' Moodyson stated that he thought it was his best and most complex film before saying that he didn't know what the film was supposed to be about not offering any explanation other than 'it has many layers'. Such statements reveal entirely the reason behind the film's failure. Depsite Moodyson's assertion of complexity there is simply nothing in this 90 minute film that could not have been adequately communicated in a short. Simply juxtaposing unpleasant images of cosmetic surgery and action men figures with homemade pornography does not constitute a complex statement on anything. In fact the film is hopelessly meandering and one has the increasing feeling that it was 'discovered' in the editing room. I'm very interested in nonnarrative filmmaking and I don't need a 'story' to communicate events to me but it is evident to me when there is a severe paucity of drive and ideas and that feeling was evident throughout a viewing of this film. It concerns me that this film will be defended by people who feel that sitting through the unpleasant content constitutes some sort of test of intellectual rigour and that those who didn't like it are not prepared to 'face up' to the reality this film purports to present. In fact the simple truth is that this is an empty film with a painful lack of understanding of how to dramatise ideas. I really hope Moodyson comes up with something better next time  I think his talents outstrip nonsense like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "A HOLE IN MY HEART... I was surprised disappointed and most of all shocked! Though the contents of this film both images and themes sure are truly disturbing it weren't really those that shocked me the most. The endresult did and even more What has become of Lukas Moodysson! It seemed like Moodysson after LILJA 4EVER skipped a few phases in his evolution as a filmmaker and then suddenly came up with this experiment which is what it is actually an experiment NOT a movie. During the first 15 minutes I had the feeling this just might end up being a 910 movie. By the time it was finished I felt like rating this movie 410 would still be too much.So what is it about? Well you can forget about a plot because there is none. Just four characters and the stuff they do in an apartment. Rickard lives in his apartment together with his timid son Eric. The latter appears to suffer from some sort of autistic disorder or something whatever it is he's got mental issues. He also has a deformed hand and some very weird hobbies he has worms for pets he seems to collect dirt and junk in his room don't ask me how it got there since he is never seen leaving the apartment and likes to listen to electronic noises and distortions through his headphones. Other than that he does nothing. Rickard himself is into making homemade porn videos. Other than that he too does nothing else. Geko is his friend and fellow porn actor who spends most of his time at Rickards place. Enter Tess a quite attractive young blond girl who is into hard sex makeup taking a lot of showers and snorting coke amongst other things in general. Now prepare yourself for a disturbing descent into the depraved minds of these four characters. Admittedly this might seem fascinating or intriguing but however due to the lack of any form of coherency whatsoever also prepare for boredom to kick in about halfway through the movie and best expect it to never go away.Despite the nudity and pornographic subject matter in this film no clearly visible shots of penetration are shown though a rather explicit female masturbation scene does grace the screen for a minute there. However a lot of other offensive images are being shown along with plenty acts of the disturbed. Needless to go into them now and besides that I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but I'll just name one random fact You'll never look at a raw steak the same way again after having seen this film.But now for the worst things about this whole experiment. There wasn't a real script to begin with one page of the script according to Moodysson had only written the word excorcism on it. Moodysson clearly had no clue what the hell he was doing while shooting this 'movie'. Neither had his longtime director's assistant the crew nor the actors. Moodysson only gave vague directions like Don't act be yourself or It's a documentary not a movie. He sure might have had a lot of ideas but it was clear to me that in no way Moodysson was able to communicate them to his actors. At one point Moodysson even shut down and left the set leaving the actors to continue spewing out their confused thoughts on this project. Source Published interview Discussion on setfeaturette. True thing might be that a lot of metaphors and statements are to be found in this movie but as a viewer you just have no clue what to look for. So if anyone says to you This movie is about this or that or This is what Moodysson is trying to say then be careful and take it with a big grain of salt. Because you will never be sure until you've asked the director himself and I even doubt he can give you a straight answer himself.But I'd like to add just a few more positive notes though. On a technical level this movie is pretty interesting. Especially the editing is remarkable and progressive. The same can be said about the many sound effects and the way they blend together with the on screen images aswell as the complete absence of any sound in some scenes. It also strangely leads to the conclusion that both editor and director might have been on drugs which actually could be a good thing in experimental filmmaking. And that just was another keyword here Experimental filmmaking instead of the word Amateur some people like to apply on this film. No matter what's being said Moodysson is an experienced and gifted filmmaker so why he decided to throw all his knowledge overboard is beyond me. Indeed A HOLE IN MY HEART might have worked very effectively as an experimental shortfilm but as a full length feature it fails after about 45 minutes.But love it or hate it This still remains an unforgettable piece of film. I have a difficult time recommending this to anybody as I have a lot of trouble with liking much about it myself. But people who have seen Makavejev's SWEET MOVIE Lars von Trier's THE IDIOTS Harmony Korine's GUMMO or maybe but to a lesser extend Dylan Bank's NIGHTMARE might be interested in seeking out this Moodysson effort. But keep in mind that all the aforementioned movies had at least some sort of story as where A HOLE IN MY HEART doesn't even try to tell one.To end this all I feel I just might want to suggest something to Lukas Moodysson himself Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to go and visit a psychiatrist and get some good medication. Then please come back and make another movie this time telling another decent story. Otherwise I'd suggest going back to your first love and start writing poetry again. Good luck either way.".

	onyx:emotionText "A HOLE IN MY HEART... I was surprised disappointed and most of all shocked! Though the contents of this film both images and themes sure are truly disturbing it weren't really those that shocked me the most. The endresult did and even more What has become of Lukas Moodysson! It seemed like Moodysson after LILJA 4EVER skipped a few phases in his evolution as a filmmaker and then suddenly came up with this experiment which is what it is actually an experiment NOT a movie. During the first 15 minutes I had the feeling this just might end up being a 910 movie. By the time it was finished I felt like rating this movie 410 would still be too much.So what is it about?

I must confess that I also spend some time in those! sites and although I have assumed from time to time that many tragedies lie in the background of the porno event I understand now that I have never fully seen the whole picture.Lukas Moodysson has made a wonderful movie in many aspects the characters are so human unlike the stereotypes of the most commercial movies the shootings are so simple yet moving and the visual and verbal links between different events and ideas like surgeries violence and gunlove and loneliness of the humanbeing in this world are very wellestablished. These altogether leave a very sad and bitter taste in your mind. I think art and movies as the most widespread art form of our age should not only entertain us but it should also take a step into reminding us of our not so much spoken realities and situations. This movie is a brave and big step taken into the heart of the isolation and alienation of the man of our age.".

I have seen most of Moodyson's previous films Fucking Amal Together Lilya 4everand they all left their mark on my heart and this one is no different except it was a hole. This movie is different and yet very similar to his other works using different means to achieve its objective. It's about very sad people and their very sad lives about broken relationships lack of communication the desire to escape from all of the madness through sex alcohol violence. But in spite of the very graphic images of violence and perversion the film as the director stressed is not about HATE but about LOVE which can be found in the most uncommon places and survives all of the filth and decadence. All the characters are broken in some way a father who was abused by his own father as a child and is unable to find the path to his son's heart his teenager son with a defective hand who lives in the darkness of his room with only his earthworms as pets and constantly listening to strange music the star of the homemade porn movies concerned with his ability to perform his role and the new girl in desperate need of attention who dreamed all of her life to become a porn star. They are all confined to a small apartment indifferent to the world or even afraid of it. They all lead almost subhuman lives but they are just as frail anyone could be they all search for acceptance for love for something to patch the holes in their hearts. They could be me or you or the people we pass by on the streets we all have our holes we have all been bruised by life or we will surely be. But in spite of the hardships we all save some innocence something that keeps us from losing our humanity. We all want to go back to the primal state of happiness back to warmth and darkness back inside the womb even if it is just a washing machine. Yes it's hard to watch this movie but once you had it will stay with you one way or the other. As Moodyson himself admitted some 80 of those who see this movie will hate it while the remaining 20 will love it. And I agree with his words It's more fun to be in the minority ".

They are all very sad people.

I have never been able to stand that kind of moral in movies. After a while I understood that I was completely wrong. This was for me a movie about good people not being able to do anything but bad things because they have been broken down by different tragedies. If you want to see a chocking movie this one contains plenty of chocking material but nothing that is disgusting in any pleasant way. I have watched too many sick movies to be disgusted by anything that i see on the screen but the disturbing scenes in this movie didn't bring out a smile like they usually do when you watch something really sick in a movie that is intended only to gross people out. No they really added to the sad feeling and made me think about all the tragic lives out in the real world. The movie grew on me in a way no movie has ever done before and those who call it pointless must have just failed to see the point of it. This movie is definitely not for everyone and if you truly understand it you will feel like the title after watching it.".

The dialogue although perhaps improvised is at least free from clich. The editing is a little annoying but not really distracting. It's mainly the soundtrack that grates with its casual use of white noise and drone. The film is essentially a day in the cramped flat filming Rickard's amateur gonzo porno movies while he tries to connect with his introverted goth son  the son has a tentative yearning for the girl  the girl discovers that these people who can be so hurtful are still better than 'normal boring ugly' people  and the actor who is slightly insecure and has a confusing  frustrating habit of falling asleep but has quite a close relationship with his friend the director. There's more to it particularly with Rickard the fatherporno director and the ending is characteristically upbeat relationships resolvingissues in the open coming off a real emotional lowpoint.The film itself occasionally jumps forward  back in time and there are a few dream sequences. The surgical cuts literally and editorially are scattered through the film along with blurry outofcontext 'organic' shots and a parallel version of what's happening in the porno film as performed by Barbie and Action Man. I'm just not 'deep' enough to understand or care what all these bits mean.Yes the film is pretty graphic  not so much in the sex but there is nudity on all counts although not in a sensational way there are intimate surgical shots and one quick scene following a food fight which may make you feel ill and will burn itself on your memory whether you want it to or not.Although I can't be bothered trying to understand or analyse the use of the surgery bits and other possible motifs the film is mostly pretty straightforward and  if you stick with it  a fairly 'okay' plotresolution develops by the end of the film. It just takes a while for the characters to reveal enough of themselves because they all start out as fairly unlikeable.".

The surgical cuts literally and editorially are scattered through the film along with blurry outofcontext 'organic' shots and a parallel version of what's happening in the porno film as performed by Barbie and Action Man. I'm just not 'deep' enough to understand or care what all these bits mean.Yes the film is pretty graphic  not so much in the sex but there is nudity on all counts although not in a sensational way there are intimate surgical shots and one quick scene following a food fight which may make you feel ill and will burn itself on your memory whether you want it to or not.Although I can't be bothered trying to understand or analyse the use of the surgery bits and other possible motifs the film is mostly pretty straightforward and  if you stick with it  a fairly 'okay' plotresolution develops by the end of the film. It just takes a while for the characters to reveal enough of themselves because they all start out as fairly unlikeable.";

Not far away is the son overly thoughtful a shutin quiet...and simply appears the polar opposite to the three on the other side of the door. And whatever story this movie was trying to present in my opinion lies within comparing the two sides to another other and hoping they would find a common ground. And even that was hard to do as all the characters even the son were rather unlikable and all relied on pity.Was the film intriguing? Yeah I guess. Was it well directed? I thought so. Was it entertaining? Not really. Is there a deeper meaning than simply comparing the people to one another and not trying to look at them as useless human beings? Maybe. But if you really want to do such a thing I think you're already fighting an uphill battle.From my point of view there's not much to learn from this film as it was mostly full of negative things. And I'm curious to know Lukas's point of the film. I would guess it was a very simple idea. I could easily say this film's underlying message is to get an education. But I could be dead wrong.

Since we had no clue about the film before we saw it name of the film misdirected us pretty much cause we thought that it was a romantic film or an ordinary drama.

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with Lukas Moodysson is that while he is a talented and daring director a lot of times his logic is flawed or at least terribly onesided. Similarly A Hole In My Heart could be great. It's not often you see a director making such a risky career move. Hole is raw unique disturbing when it comes to major films anyway but also so terribly onesided in it's depiction of the sexes.In a Freudian twist you really have to giggle as Moodysson presents sex from the male point of view as men trying to emulate the murder of their mother. Or from the female point of view as a suicide attempt. Whatever Lukas.It might be irony but the only person to not have enjoyed female affection the deformed young son Eric his mother died when he was 4 Tess rejects him is also the one to feel more sympathetic towards females. Thus he declares his father a homosexual because he likes to have gangbangs and therefore getting closer to the other male with only one layer of skin inbetween. OK. Also we are told that the common link between people who torture wage wars and generally behave in a mean way is that they are all men. Hohum.Rickard and Geko give Tess a good scare in a brutal sm session. She's soon out crying and depicted as a martyr with blood running out of her hands  Jesus style. But after a while she's back in the apartment to resume her role as a pornstar and happier than ever. In the meantime Rickard and Gecko fire manically with airguns on posters featuring what else? naked female bodies they play with marbles like the big children that they are and treat poor Tess like dirt in a bulimic sex session in the end.So there you have it men are creeps and women are great. Which probably leaves Eric somewhere in the wasteland. Probably the same wasteland that Moodysson occupies.".

In this what? Movie? Hell no if this is a movie then I'm the queen of England. It's a video shot by a semiprofessional cameraman filled with pointless dialogues which consist of nonsensical rubbish. It doesn't deliver the feeling of porn it doesn't deliver the feeling of depression it doesn't doesn't doesn't....!!!! All it does manage is to bore the hell out of the viewer by showing absolutely nothing.Where are the characters? Where is the story? The answer is They're not subtly hidden they simply don't exist. Either way you hardly have time to look for them while you're busy looking for the sophistication and the art that qualifies a video as a movie which you'll never find in this so called feature.The sad thing is this feature is brought by my favourite director Lukas Moodysson. I can't believe he's done something oh so very bad! Seriously the video of your niece's 15th birthday party would certainly be more profound than this film by all means. The acting isn't bad though but why? Simply because there is nothing to act! This movie reminds me of the football teams who never succeed in spite of their expensively established squad. Everyone involved has some sort of quality to show but the lack of a team soul ruins everything. They have no common goal other than making money how would they achieve anything? Same goes for this movie the actors are acting what's given to them but what's given to them is apparently dogmatic as the bible yet empty and pointless as a teenager's blog.I happened to read the earlier comments. Should I laugh or should I cry? Where is the brilliance in this flick? If it's brilliant to manage to hold the camera without imposing any story at all then yes it's fabulous. But that's not brilliance that's just dullness and weakness. Shooting a movie like this isn't much more complicated than taking a shower I'm so very disappointed by Moodysson.The only reason I'm giving 110 to this movie is that it is not allowed to give 0.".

Well acted and well directed this is a more mature and deeper thriller than we're accustomed to.

It is a thinking person's film and I appreciated that.One other thing I wanted to note on was the tone dark bleak isolated and barren. From the acting to the cinematography the director really nailed this feeling in everything from the characterizations to the visuals. Just something I really noticed.".

Filmed primarily in Iceland with some scenes in Hastings Minnesota the mood is dank and dark and cold  and so is the story.We first meet insurance investigator 'adjustor' Abe Holt as he listens to his boss Frank Peter Coyote explain to a new widow why she will not receive full death benefits because the insurance company took photos of her husband smoking the apparent cause of his death. Abe just sits in the background but we know he is in tune with the fraudulent activity of the insurance company. Almost immediately he is assigned to a new case an excon with a million dollar life insurance policy has apparently been found dead in a car crash burned beyond recognition. Abe drives to the tiny snowy desolate village where his questions of the townsfolk reveal that the victim was Kelvin Anderson the brother of Isold Julia Stiles who is married to a low life type named Fred Jeremy Renner a man who we have seen in flashbacks as the one responsible for arranging the car crash and setting the car on fire. Abe sneaks around the town spies on Isold and becomes involved in the investigation in more ways than the honest one. It is the interplay of the three  Abe Fred and Isold  that provide the intrigue and mystery of the apparent framed insurance scam.The screenplay is so full of holes that it is difficult to follow the case's development. The actors are superb artists Forest Whitaker made this film almost simultaneously with his Oscar winning 'The Last King of Scotland' yet here his character is plagued by an affected accent and by the lack of substance that might make us care about his plight Julia Stiles does her best with the little she is given to do and Jeremy Renner is convincingly menacing without any factors that make us find him worth caring about. The supporting actors Joanna Scanlan as a sleazy bartender Iddo Goldberg and Philip Jackson as the police Alfred Harmsworth as the 'son' of Isold and Vladas Bagdonas as the coroner actually fare better than the leads as far as material available.The strong aspect of the film is the visual imagery due to the decisions of picture composition by Kormkur and cinematographer ttar Gunason and Mugison's musical is apropos for the mood. But the film remains grounded and a bit on the confusing side because of the director's lack of unity. One wonders why Whitaker Stiles and Renner signed on to this little film. Grady Harp".

But then he stumbles upon a messed up couple who are trying to file a claim over a dead brother. Our protagonist feels that there is something wrong and he dives in the lives of the two to find any sleaze and dirt. And as expected  he does find something that can stir things up.This movie reminded me of ''Fargo'' and '' A simple plan ''. Like in those flicks ''A little trip...'' deals with the brutalities that people will do to each other out of pure greed. It's also about the cruel way of thinking that a life insurance can make up for the loss of a human life and how insurance companies like you to believe that. It's a modern film noir with an excellent cast a beautiful soundtrack and atmospheric sequences in the rain or snow. Maybe the tone is a bit too sad and nihilistic for the big crowd it definitely deserves more than the meager 6 it's receiving here.".

Perfect complexion glowing skin color simply too healthy  it didn't fit the role. The ending was also way too manufactured so as to keep commercial audiences happy. She's a single mother with a son who needs money to survive  let's make sure she gets it even if we have to totally change the lead character's actions to ensure it happens.One thing I will say in its favor is that the car crash stunt towards the end of the film is absolutely fantastic  that really came from nowhere.

Forest Whitaker does a good job and displays a determination to resolve the case that if were true to life with the income he displayed within his character i am not sure would be there?i notice a lot of 1010's for this movie and think this is unwarranted but having said that this was a worthwhile effort and should be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great cast does what it can with ludicrous details.The most intriguing aspect of this story is that the audience is constantly in search of a hero or victim but all of the characters are villains to varying degrees.The real problem is the basic premise. It would have been nice if the writers would have actually done some research instead of making up ridiculous lies about the insurance industry.For starters attempting to deny or reduce legitimate claim payments is a practice called Unfair Claims Practices and is prohibited in all states. Secondly no insurance company would issue a life insurance policy to a known con man especially for 1 million. And you can not blame it on a particular office  all policies go through a central underwriting department at the main office. Thirdly once a life insurance policy has been in force for 2 years it becomes incontestable. The only thing that would cause an investigation is if there is a question of the deceased's identity or there is an accidental death benefit that might not be an accident. Furthermore insurance fraudsters are notorious for NOT selfinflicting real damage to themselves. Lastly a claims investigator agent... can NOT do what James Whitaker's character does near the end of the movie or even throughout the movie.The ending was rather unusual. Afterward it does make sense in a strange way. But this is a strange film. Give it a try if you have nothing better to do and like strange plot twists.".

Unfortunately the story falls flat because of some pretty big credibility flaws things that just WOULD NOT happen in real life during an insurance investigation. Too bad because the acting is great. However the story just lacks coherence and credibility so however great the acting is it still falls flat. With a more credible story this could have been a very suspenseful con movie but unfortunately now only the directing and acting is left to be praised. What's good though are the many plot twists and turns that kept me curious about how it would all end. Not bad but not good either. 6 stars. Funny endnote the end credits of this icelandic production were rather special because it featured the names of ALL the extras that acted in this movie. That is never done in any other movie. I would love to be an extra myself. Knowing that I have NONE acting skills whatsoever I would be thrilled to play as an invisible extra.

	schema:reviewBody "Even though this movie completely falls apart it's still an interesting piece of work. There's genuine talent on both sides of the camera but the story is such a mess that they just can't make it work.Forest Whitaker plays an insurance investigator who goes to a small town investigate a seven figure claim involving a life insurance policy. What he finds is a variety of local eccentrics a father and son police force that is ineffectual and an incredibly muddled storyline that goes absolutely nowhere.What's good about it Great music well visualized great cast. It's character driven enough that I can see why Whitaker and Julia Stiles would sign on for it.But the story is too muddled for film. On stage or in the pages of a book these sometimes nonsensical events could possibly be accepted. Film is very unforgiving. A barn is a barn. A clinic is a clinic. We're so rooted in the real world even though the role of Minnesota is played by Iceland that the behavior of these people is beyond belief. The protagonist first sees the leading lady while staring through her window in the middle of the night. He has a habit of breaking into houses and clinics possibly being a cat burglar is one of the requirements for working for an insurance company.Logic flies out the window when Stiles and Renner manipulate a huge truck to crash into their car and they and the car goes flying off a cliff into the ocean and they emerge unscathed.There's potential for a strong film out of this material. It shows the film's makers' dedication to their task by the strong cast they've assembled including Phyllidia Law in a short but effective scene and Jeremy Renner as Stiles's brother or husband or accomplice or whatever.One thing that was dissatisfying was the fault of The Sundance Channel I saw this on cable. It was filmed in widescreen 2351 ratio but a full screen version was broadcast. So in a critical scene in the third act there's a moment when both characters speaking are out of camera range. That's why I prefer Independent Film Channel because they're not afraid to letterbox.This is worth watching but don't let the strong cast get your hopes up too much.".

The commercial for the insurance is really and oddly eye catching and artistically done. Julia Stiles does a fairly good job as an abused lifeless mother and Jeremy Renner does good as the abusive husband. Forest Whitaker as usual does an excellent job bringing character and color. The movie overall is really well done its not great but well deserves more attention than it does. Its got hear and emotion which a lot of thrillers like this wouldn't usually have. Highly recommended. I rate this 820. Rated R for language some violence and disturbing images".

It is about a man who seems to live his life running scams to get insurance money but this time he runs up against one of the better insurance investigators who tries to minimize payouts.The lead role is played by Forest Whitaker as Abe Holt who seems very good as the insurance man. When a man insured for 1Million is found dead and burned in a tragic car wreck Holt is dispatched to see if there is fraud involved. Basically he tries to find the victim alive. The rat is Jeremy Renner as Fred who apparently is married to the sister of the deceased man and she is the sole beneficiary of the 1Million. But not all is as it seems to be. Julia Stiles is Isold the sister and the young son is Thor. Interesting movie something different from Hollywood blockbusters.SPOILERS The man Fred who appears to be Isold's husband is really the man supposed to be dead Isold's crooked brother who found a drifter to kill in the wreck. Holt figures this out a key piece of information is finding the real Fred was already dead. Holt arranges the policy so that Isold will get 1Million but when he tried to get the brother to justice both end up dying in yet another car crash.".

A lot of Holy crap! moments almost from the start and the insanity just builds as more characters are introduced and the intensity is matched by the pure mystery of just what in the hell is going on in these mountains.Of course like most cases of such a promising start as we get more answers to who these people are and what their motivation is things become significantly more mundane and lead to a final act that just equates to waiting for what you know is going to happen to happen.

Expecting something that might be OK I actually saw a very good movie indeed. The crazy thing is that I'd never heard of it before. I don't remember seeing any reviews of it and it certainly never had any exposure in the British press. But why? It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it's much better than the average Hollywood blockbuster that has a budget twenty times bigger than this. I have a pretty jaundiced view of the state of British film making but when I see a really good one like this then I think perhaps there is hope.The Highland locations and the cinematography grabbed my attention right away. The plot surprised me remember I knew nothing about it beforehand and kept me guessing as to what genre it was. Was it a thriller adventure film or a horror film? Could be any of these. I've subsequently read reviews that classify it as a horror film but whilst it has elements you'd associate with horror I wouldn't put it in that genre. This is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. If you are in a single genre then you have to follow the tropes of that genre to be true to it. If you aren't making a genre film then you have more flexibility to be different.It isn't perfect what film is? One sequence seems to feature the most incompetent pair of sharpshooters ever seen in a film and some of the dialogue is difficult to make out in places. It might work on The Wire but it doesn't work in a film with little dialogue in the first place.There are clear influences from other films and in particular a sequence that owes much to The Wicker Man but these are done well and add to the viewing experience. A great British film not a phrase you often hear from me. I just wish I'd been able to catch it in the theatre".

Unafraid to take the film in unexpected directions director Gilbey had the audience gasping in surprise at multiple moments and I noticed a man in front of me leaning further and further forward as the story progressed. A great cast handled the nuanced script with real skill. The characters are presented with many layers and it's clear that they all have pasts and various human weaknesses but the film doesn't take the time to explain things out clearly. It is up to the audience to infer  if they are interested  in what might have happened in their pasts. This is genius scripting in what is essentially a simple action movie. There is depth if you care to look for it otherwise just hold on to your seat and be prepared for some serious excitement.

	schema:headline " A wonderfully disconcerting experience earning itself a place amongst the other hidden gems of the British horror market.";
	schema:reviewBody "With British horror now returning to the peak it previously reached so many years ago at the height of the Hammer Horror fame it's slowly but surely become one of the freshest genres around. With such original titles as 'Severance' 'Eden Lake' and most notably 'The Descent' gracing our screens with their deeply chilling presence as of late all eyes have been transfixed on Film4's Frightfest Britain's leading horrorbased film festival for the latest slice of truly horrifying cinema. As this year's closing night film 'A Lonely Place to Die' found itself walking in the footsteps of some true hidden gems but could it live up to expectations? As the brainchild of previously uncelebrated brothers Julian and Will Gilbey 'A Lonely Place to Die' will most likely not register on many people's radars. The untraditional location and lack of star power will mean many shall overlook it's existence but hidden behind the shoestring budget the relatively unknown cast and the oddly basic sounding plot lies a deeply disturbing and involving thriller with little use of exhausted clichs and an unbelievably unpredictable narrative. Despite a rather breezy but nailbiting opening the Gilbey brothers hold off on the majority of the shocks until at least halfway in allowing the basic emotional structure and tone of the picture to fully take hold first. A rather basic introduction is rather quickly washed over the dialogue clunky but acceptable and the mood settling nicely. However when the script does begin to take off and lives are lost in the blink of an eye the film truly kicks it into overdrive. What the Gilbeys to do so well is to capture the shock of loss. The sickeningly fast pace of death and how quickly it can creep up on you. It is here where they truly reach their winning stride a solid 30 minutes of the movie bang in the middle providing incredibly alarming and startling fresh thrills literally appearing as if out of no where. One second the mood is calm then a second later another life lost. Doubtlessly marvellous. Veteranhorrorchick Melissa George leads the pack of otherwise unnoticeable climbers assassins and lost little girls her performance both solid and believable but never once bordering on the outstanding. Her fellow cast members too tow the line ably but none particularly shine their characters becoming nothing more than nicknames but likable nicknames at that. It is more the presence of certain characters than the characters themselves that begin to command the scares one powerfullystomached assassin becoming almost an unstoppable force and a true sense of fear within the viewer's mind. Following the rather intense and erratically unforeseeable events of the second act the plot begins to flesh itself out a tad unfortunately losing much of the suspense and fear that so dominated the previous section. Much more of the Gilbeys' obvious dialogue and sudden character appearances are thrown in in an attempt to fuel some rather strange and disconcerting explanations forcing the thumping pace back down to a general saunter sadly wrecking the previously unpredictable tone. When the finale does eventually come however it thankfully manages to mimic the truly demented tone of the second act at least partially creating a nailbiting yet slightly foreseeable conclusion. Although it might not be the painfully dark and sinister climax many may hope for it's certainly a fitting end to a surprisingly thrilling and incredibly shocking piece of British cinema. Although filled with pointless landscaping shots which remain beautiful for all of a minute and shamefully poor dialogue 'A Lonely Place to Die' succeeds in creating an astoundingly rickety and worrying tone in which no character's safety is guaranteed leaving you both unsettled and gasping for more. It's far from perfect but exists as a wonderfully disconcerting experience earning itself a place amongst the other hidden gems of the British horror market 'A Lonely Place to Die' demands and deserves your attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had high hopes and I wanted it to baffle and thrill and excite me I really did. Instead I found myself cursing and muttering at the ludicrous implausibility of the storyline. If as a member of a group of innocent mountainclimbers you suddenly find yourself under attack from an unseen assailant above you would you run into the most obvious place to be seen and keep shouting Anna! at the top of your voice? No you would creep under cover and keep very very quiet.At one point there was the choice to take one route which was an easy walk of about 12 miles to go back or to take the other which was only 4 miles but risking life and limb by climbing down a really perilous drop. The 12 mile route would take a bit longer but would be risk free. Everybody was in OK shape for the walk so then why do the crazy thing? Didn't the producer believe that one of them might just realize Hmmm...whoever put her there might be a bit annoyed when we set her free so we had better keep a look out for bad guys...? Nope not for one moment. And as for staging a Riotype Carnival in the middle of a highland backwater I don't think so. As soon as the dancing girl emerged a local Kirk elder would have nipped out and thrown a woolly rug over her to cover her up before chasing the rest of the troupe out of town.And this was the problem throughout  the constant irritation that people just do not behave like that in real life unless they are really really dumb or if the producer thinks that we are really really dumb so we will accept it. It was impossible to develop any kind of sympathy for the protagonists because I kept wanting to give them a good slap and tell them stop being so stupid. It reflected a total contempt by the producer to credit the audience with a shred of common sense. And once that respect was lostit was impossible to regain it because the implausibility hits just kept on coming.So if you like aerial views of Scottish mountains you will have a ball. If you like thrillers with a remotely believable plot you will have a real problem with this one.".

To my surprise only one out of three cinemas was showing this movie and on arrival noticed the lack of people in the theatre Three couples including us. I started to think that we had made a wrong choice. How wrong I was. The sheer scale of the opening scene was breath taking and really drew us in ready for the rest of the film. The pace of the film was perfect and the element of surprise was always there. There were 1 or 2 minor continuity errors but these were cleared up within the next few minutes. The level of violence was just right for a film like this not being glamorised or pornographied. I have to point out also that the child abuse issue is handled very well and the bar is set at what may be considered to be a 'comfortable movie level' if there is such a thing it could have been a lot worse but the director clearly has morals and making it quite clear it is not that type of film although it could have quite easily been. The excitement runs consistently throughout and the musicsound effects add to the overall excitement. Although a few of the actors are slightly wooden this is quickly and cleverly counter actedcovered up by the good ones and fast passed action. Good story cleverly layed out in a gorgeous but deadly setting. Who could ask for more.".

	schema:headline " Great great outdoors thriller!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Just seen this and have to say i really enjoyed it and that it a great wee British action thriller set in the hills of Scotland and that it rattles along at a good pace. Director Julian Gilbey has created a tense fun little game of cat  mouse about a set of hillclimbers who are pursued by two maniac kidnappers through the glens and woods streams and rockfaces after finding a little girl buried alive in a whole in the ground and attempt to get help from the nearest village.

Director Julian Gilbey has created a tense fun little game of cat  mouse about a set of hillclimbers who are pursued by two maniac kidnappers through the glens and woods streams and rockfaces after finding a little girl buried alive in a whole in the ground and attempt to get help from the nearest village.

	schema:reviewBody "What's to me has been a pretty lackluster year for gripping thrillers A Lonely Place To Die is a refreshing and well executed one that has a solid payoff. The acting was solid from everyone though their accents kind of got in the way and was distracting and sometimes hard to understand but the highlight here was Melissa George in her best leading performance yet. The balance of themes like survival kidnappingransom stalk and kill cat and mouse revenge and action was stellar and close to perfection and though most of that is all too familiar by now it hasn't been as effective as this one in as long as I can remember. When it gets down and dirty it doesn't hold back and I'm not saying that it's overly graphic but just very intense and suspenseful which is most of the time way better than a splatterfest but just good old fashioned. The filming of the raw haunting atmosphere was fantastic and has edge it was breathtaking in intensity and beauty and the fact that it jumps to different locations and not stay at one the whole time added to the thrill in a rollercoaster ride of a chase and fight for safety in a lonely place where no one can here you scream very harrowing stuff. Overall this is the best thriller of the year and deserved to be a wide theatrical release because to me it puts the wide released ones like Drive Hanna and the Straw Dogs remake to shame studios back this one up now so it can get a proper wide release that it should certainly earn. Recommended! 7.5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a film that I didn't know much about prior to watching. It had fairly good reviews so we gave it a go. The cast is pretty much unknown actors with the exception of Melissa George. Although I have no idea why she chose this film as it is not what we are used to seeing her in. This is not to say she is bad she is very good in this but I was just surprised as I guess I am expecting bigger roles in bigger movies for her. You may also recognise Ed Speleers from the title role in the film Eragon.The film starts off well after a little too brief introduction to the climbers they set out on a climbing expedition in a remote part of Scotland. Soon they stumble across a young girl locked in an underground wooden box. They free her and the group split up the fastest two of them head off to find help while the remainder follow behind with the girl. The kidnappers pursue them in an attempt to recover the girl.This is a good film the camera work is used well to show off the locations and emphasise the peril the climbers are in. The characters are believable for the most part. There is one scene where a character sacrifices themselves that for me didn't make sense. I have a theory but won't reveal what as I try to avoid spoilers. The stand out performance for me was Sean Harris as Mr Kidd The Kidnapper. His portrayal of the character was chilling and ruthless. You believe that he will do anything to accomplish his goal.This is a good film. It is no Hollywood blockbuster but a very well made well acted British film that doesn't try to take the story too far and keeps things believable. There are plenty of twists and parts that keep you guessing but you won't always be right.".

It was shot entirely on locations in the Scottish Highlands in Northern Scotland and is a UK production which was produced by producer Michael Loveday.

While notable for its naturalistic rural milieu depictions the fine cinematography by Syrian cinematographer Ali Asad editing by Julian Gilbey and his brother William Gilbey and use of sound this characterdriven plotdriven and somewhat violent action film contains a good score by English composer Michael Richard Plowman.This forebodingly atmospheric crime story which is set against the backdrop of the majestic Scottish highlands is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure multiple viewpoints and the fine acting performances by Australian actress Melissa George Czech actor Karel Roden and English actor Sean Harris.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts out as the the mountainclimbingsurvivalhorror you might expect after seeing the DVD cover as your familiar set of city people on their holidays on Mount Nophonesignal in Farfromcivilisation County gets introduced badly finding a child in the middle of nowhere. You will be surprised when after the blunt first half of the movie it suddenly switches genres and you find yourself in the city of Bruges in a third class gangster movie with an all new set of people that you have no reason on earth to care about either.I usually don't devote so much time to a BFlick but this train wreck of a script deserves detailed analysis. So  as Director and writer Julian Gilbey has no idea what to do with any of his characters besides showing them chitchatting about irrelevant mindless crap  people that you know next to nothing about are chasing this child that you know next to nothing about while other people that you know next to nothing about are protecting it with all their lives for no apparent reason besides the fact that you don't just leave a child alone. Which is a valid point but doesn't work out if you have no actual reason to emotionally connect with the child or with the people who now one by one sacrifice their lives for her. And not even their deaths matter as Gilbey is killing even his more important characters off like extras in a Chuck Norris movie. It just happens and we never see them again and not just the director and you but not even these people seem to care. Appearantly besides one couple these people aren't even bonded apparently they don't even like each other too much which  besides the fact that five of the four mountaineers don't like humor and one doesn't like smoked fish  is just about the only thing computable from Gilbey's dumb pointless interludes. Now meanwhile it also turns out that the girl is the offspring of an easterEuropean warcriminal responsible for the deaths of millions or so who already arranged a handoff willing to pay a lot of his abundant drugmoney or whatever making her involuntary rescue team as well as both kidnappers two random hunters an innocent police officer as well as some civilians basically having died to save the retirement fund of a mafia boss. As Ed points out what if the only thing they have done is prohibiting a clean handover? And this is exactly what happened flushing the significance of all these deaths right down the toilet.But Gilbey apparently has no idea about the basic rules of scriptwriting anyway as he produces detailed setups frequently spending significant screen time on them just to nullify them minutes later basically just adding totally redundant crap to an already pointless movie. Here a whole scene on one person showing a picture of a mountain proposing to climb it giving detailed background information on it to the point where he explains how long you fall from it's top. Will they climb it later? No. Will they even see the mountain ever again? No. Will the guy when eventually falling from another mountain think over his life in midair? Of course not. So here a minute of screen time for the lead mixing different alcoholic beverages against the warning of her colleague. Will she be incapacitated for the rest of the movie due to a severe hangover that she'll have to overcome to save people's lives? No. A minute later she explains that she took aspirin so she's fine. So what was the point then? Product placement? Mere stupidity? Here a scene of two hunters inserted in a way so you think they are the kidnappers but then they aren't. A red herring? Not really as a minute later they get killed by the actual kidnappers I guess cause they're potential witnesses. But then why introducing them in the first place? Just so the kidnappers can steal their guns? Appearantly they are pretty cunning guys don't they have money for their own guns? Here guy breaks his leg. But he can still walk. Then he offers to stay behind anyway. Then heroine convinces him not to so he doesn't and can walk again. What difference did it make that he broke his leg? Why was it necessary? Here a whole plot device on the assumption that the police officer is corrupt because guy mentioned above accuses him of being corrupt. But then again he really isn't. Guy was wrong. But now that you assumed he's corrupt and don't like him anymore lets suddenly kill him. Let's also kill guy. Let's now kill a civilian for no reason. Here let's set this house on fire so heroine throws the child out of the window and then rather stays behind then breaking a leg by jumping out herself now appears to burn in it but then she doesn't. She wakes up and is now safe as meanwhile the fire department arrived. Child waited outside I guess. Here a guy assuming that he's being ambushed as he hands over the kidnapper. But then he isn't. He was wrong. He gets a new car instead. Was this to show he has bad instincts? In the last scene we see him in? Was it to show that black people are paranoid when seeing white people? Should I just not connect the dots???Gilbey closes with the child saying thank you well you're fcking welcome and then adds a line of the medical assistant calling heroine 'sweetheart' lesbian? important fact? before meaningfully rolling up the credits. He's also showing footage along with it  apparently Super9 video recorded with the digital camera shown breaking in the beginning for no reason  of the people we never cared about having a good time. Now that it's over.Great job dude. 110".

So here a minute of screen time for the lead mixing different alcoholic beverages against the warning of her colleague. Will she be incapacitated for the rest of the movie due to a severe hangover that she'll have to overcome to save people's lives? No. A minute later she explains that she took aspirin so she's fine. So what was the point then? Product placement? Mere stupidity? Here a scene of two hunters inserted in a way so you think they are the kidnappers but then they aren't. A red herring? Not really as a minute later they get killed by the actual kidnappers I guess cause they're potential witnesses. But then why introducing them in the first place? Just so the kidnappers can steal their guns? Appearantly they are pretty cunning guys don't they have money for their own guns? Here guy breaks his leg. But he can still walk. Then he offers to stay behind anyway. Then heroine convinces him not to so he doesn't and can walk again. What difference did it make that he broke his leg? Why was it necessary? Here a whole plot device on the assumption that the police officer is corrupt because guy mentioned above accuses him of being corrupt. But then again he really isn't. Guy was wrong. But now that you assumed he's corrupt and don't like him anymore lets suddenly kill him. Let's also kill guy. Let's now kill a civilian for no reason. Here let's set this house on fire so heroine throws the child out of the window and then rather stays behind then breaking a leg by jumping out herself now appears to burn in it but then she doesn't. She wakes up and is now safe as meanwhile the fire department arrived. Child waited outside I guess. Here a guy assuming that he's being ambushed as he hands over the kidnapper. But then he isn't. He was wrong. He gets a new car instead. Was this to show he has bad instincts? In the last scene we see him in? Was it to show that black people are paranoid when seeing white people? Should I just not connect the dots???Gilbey closes with the child saying thank you well you're fcking welcome and then adds a line of the medical assistant calling heroine 'sweetheart' lesbian? important fact? before meaningfully rolling up the credits. He's also showing footage along with it  apparently Super9 video recorded with the digital camera shown breaking in the beginning for no reason  of the people we never cared about having a good time. Now that it's over.Great job dude. 110";

	schema:reviewBody "A Lonely Place to Die has been getting some great reviews so it was about time I sat down and gave it a look. Also Melissa George Triangle is in this flick and I absolutely adore her as an actress. First off let's talk about the plot. A bunch of rock climbers real ones not dopey xtreme ones but people that just enjoy the outdoors go off hiking go figure. These rock climbers are a close knit group and are genuinely fond of each other. They joke and laugh at each other's expense and the writing is superb so it never feels stale or acted. These rock climbers find a little girl buried in the mountains and they realize that she has been kidnapped. When something has been taken there is usually someone who wants it back and this is where the thrill ride begins. Two killers start hunting them the chase never slows down. From the mountains to the village the chase for the little girl only ends when the final credits role. I really liked this movie I kept thinking that they don't make films like this anymore. It plays out like a no holds barred thrillkill ride. Also I loved the cinematography in this film. The scenery and landscape are just beautiful it really sets the atmosphere for the film. A Lonely Place to Die is like a gunshot in the wilderness loud and disturbing a really great piece of film making. The only problem I had with the film the order of the killing was too clich. Filmmakers can't be afraid to kill someone unexpectedly shock us that's why we watch film to be in awe. But seriously that little problem I had it is a speckle of dust on a pristine thrill ride. And Melissa George is really good in it. Joshua Ryan  Horribletimes.com".

Fans of Melissa George should enjoy it though as she puts in another divine performance someone write that woman an ultra violent action film already she'd totally kill it. 5 stars for the movie and an extra star for Melissa.

	schema:reviewBody "The start of this movie and in fact most part of the first hour was one big advertisement for heading to the Scottish highlands to do some hiking. Definitely got me thinking about booking a flight.But that's about it as far as positive things go for this movie. It wasn't too difficult to figure out which characters are going to see the ending credits and which ones are the proverbial red shirts. The film is riddled with why would you do that? moments. Granted it is a piece of fiction so you have to allow some insanity for the sake of suspense. Sadly none of the events that clearly were supposed to be shockers managed to actually be shockers. There are so many inconsistencies here it just ridiculous. How about a marksman who first has no problem hitting a guy running away from him at full speed but then wastes bullet after bullet trying to hit someone slowly climbing a steep slope a mere 50m away.This movie also suffered from the multiple endings syndrome. During the last 15 minutes there were three scenes where I thought OK now we fade to black and roll credits. And it did fade to black but only to fade up to another scene again. They made sure to tie up all loose ends in this one. If the first end scene would have been the real ending scene then this movie would have gained a couple of points in my book. Not because it would have saved 10 minutes of my time but because then the ending would actually have been a bit of a surprise considering how easy the rest of the plot had been to predict.The score is for the scenery the rest was just not up to par unfortunately.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this was a Great Film! they sure don't make them like this anymore. This film was exciting and thrilling from beginning to end and i was hooked all the way through. What makes this film work so well is the beautiful location the Scottish highlands.I thought the scenery was breathtaking which is one of the films many good points. The mountains and the trees look great and definitely has you captivated. The film is about a group of mountain climbers that climb for a thrill and one day they want to be skilled enough to climb the Eiger. I Liked all of the Main characters which is rare because in most Thrillers the characters are cannon Fodder or have no development but in this film i cared about the characters and thought there was some good character development also the characters were not stereotypes they were just ordinary everyday people that wanted to have some fun and i can relate to people like that which is what made me like themthey also seemed like a nice group of people and i had No problem with them. The cast was great you have the beautiful Melissa George who i like as an actress she gave a great performance in this film and she was very convincing. Ed Speleers was good and the rest of the cast were fine and the actors that played the two bad guys were very good. The bad guys were ruthless psychopaths and very cold and chilling they were both good bad guys in my opinion.they both had scenes where they were intimidating and it makes the viewer think wow you don't mess with these guys. The story to the film is simple yet effective which is what i like about the film it did not have some over complicated story it was a simple cat and mouse type thriller that was executed very well. The group of climbers find a young girl buried in a Chamber with nothing but an air pipe keeping her alive so naturally they get her out of there and help her and give her food and water.they then try to get her off the mountains to safety as quick as they can before her Captors Return.the Actress that played the little girl did a good job she was convincing and you really do feel sorry for her.When the girls captors find out she's gone they hunt down the people that took her and try to get her back. The bad guys hunt with Sniper rifles and they usually shoot from above which gives them an advantage. As i said before the bad guys are ruthless and brutal and all of their scenes are interesting. The Film has a very Brutal Atmosphere and Even Feels like a Horror Film at times because of the Intense chase scenes. Overall the film is more of a thriller and not a horror film but i can say the film definitely has a couple of horror elements one in particular is when the main bad guy wears a creepy looking pig Mask and goes on a killing rampage in the last part of the movie and that definitely gave the film a horror vibe. Some people complain about the last part of the movie because the location changes but i never had a problem with thati thought the change of location in the last half hour was a good idea.the last half hour was just as exciting as the rest of the movie. I was not bored a single time during this whole film i was on the edge of my seat the whole time cheering for our main characters. The chase scenes in the Scottish highlands were very exciting and the film has a very dark gritty atmosphere throughout which i think adds to the suspense. The Music also adds to the suspense and works very well in the chase scenes in the woods. The chase scenes were very thrilling and the great music makes it even more thrilling.Michael Richard Plowmans musical Score is Fantastic and matches the film perfectly. His music does not play all the time but its played a lot during the chase scenes and climbing scenes and it was very effective and griping music. The finale part of the movie was one of the most exciting i've ever seen. Melissa George fights one on one with the Main Bad guy and they have a violent and brutal fight in a house. Melissa George fights to protect the little girl and she puts up a good fight too which i was happy to see.she was No damsel in distress that's for surei thought she kicked Ass in this film and was a very likable character. She was a very cool character and she took no crap from the bad guys. The Ending was very exciting and intense! and overall i highly recommend This Film I Thought it was Great! and is a Favourite Of Mine.".

Her role as Alison a climber and a hiker is probably her most wild yet as she dangles off cliff edges and dodges bullets in this one of a kind thriller. The cast are brilliant who each deliver smashing performances I really liked the characters so it was a shame when most of them got shot and fell victim to the ruthless kidnappers. The great thing about British thrillers or horrors is that the characters have a good bit of banter as for A Lonely Place To Die there is plenty of it making this film quite humorous at times. There is no such thing as a perfect thriller but if there was A Lonely Place To Die would definitely be a contender. The tension is relentless you will be on the edge watching the characters hang in the balance. Guaranteed to leave you breathless this film is a masterpiece for thrills and chills.".

What makes the film worth watching is that the film has bits of unexpected originality sparking what would have been in lesser hands a routine film. Tarantini also uses very dynamic framing in the cinematography with lots of low angle shots as well as using extreme close ups for contrast. The action includes several shoot outs car chases and a fistful of dynamite. While some of the humor is culture specific with the rivalry between northern and southern Italy other bits are handled lightly eliciting some earned chuckles courtesy of costar Enzo Cannavele. The DVD probably looks better than when the film first hit theaters with 5.1 Dolby I am sure it sounds better.".

His mission  find the drugs and stop the killing.Even though I knew this was a first time viewing throughout A Man Called Magnum I had an odd feeling that I had seen the movie before. Then it dawned on me  change the locations take out the nudity and blood and put in a few American actors and voil what you've got is essentially the same as any number of American cop television shows from the 1970s. It's not that A Man Called Magnum is bad there's just nothing spectacular about it. We've all seen it before. The gun battles car chases and fistfights are strictly by the numbers and lack originality. I also had problems relating to the main character Inspector Dario Mauri. The movie gives less detail about him than even the most minor of characters. Not to mention that what we do know makes Dario seem pretty dull. And it's difficult for me to invest any real emotion in such a lifeless character.There are a few highlights such as the camera work the score the locations and the idea of the little girl drawing pictures to send to the police as clues. The movie presents a lot of images from unique angles. The camera work rises above the rest of this ordinary film. The score is full of those funky 70s sounds that I always enjoy. The locations are fascinating. You can't find places like that in America. It's distinctly Italian. Finally the girl and her crayon are an interesting twist. It's too bad that A Man Called Magnum never takes full advantage of this plot point the way it could have.".

I don't even think the dubbers actually watched the movie as the plot points don't even make sense and the comic relief provided by the lieutenant just confusing.That said this has a very good cast Lastretti Merenda Murolo Billa and the genre regulars and moves along fairly quickly with its fair share of violence.

This movie was mad cute it is based an a story of Greek mythology and takes place in the hood of Miami. Trina place Alicia a girl who wants to end the street violence and make their home safe. This is actually quite a positive movie and Trina shows great skills in acting. The only thing keeping this movie from more stars is a couple minor actors really are bad at acting...but Trina and the rest of the majors are really good. These movie is very sexual and funny A must have for any Trina fan.".

Gooding decides to publish the novel as his own and then the fun begins.Gooding has an engaging personality but his acting leaves something to be desired his name is on the credits as producer which in Hollywood can either mean a lot or nothing at all so we would assume that he had read the script but it doesn't always seem that way. He sometimes seems to be acting from off stage cues with his mannerisms at variance with the mood of the scene. In one scene for no reason at all he looks down at floor then shuffles his feet to another position as though he has just been told he is standing in the wrong spot.The plot takes some not always credible twists and turns and we get that hackneyed scene where for no plausible reason the protagonist makes a run for it. In this case Gooding makes a surprisingly easy escape from a house swarming with cops then of course we get the chance to visit some nicely photographed locations and to meet some quirky characters.Tom Berenger does best in the acting department as a surly cop. He also has some of the best lines. He refuses a drink at one point with a terse I never drink. It makes me feel happy.Mainly for Berenger's performance and some nifty locations I give it 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Narration in movies can be tricky. Sometimes they're practically a requirement especially if the plot is convoluted or the prose style ornate as in Raymond Chandler's work. How could we survive without Philip Marlowe's voiceover telling us that her hair was the color of gold in old paintings? Just as often narrations are a crutch as they are here telling us things that an Old Master like Hitchcock would have used imagination and skill to tell us visually. Not only is this narrative sometimes pointless but it varies in tone as if coming from different characters instead of just Cuba Gooding Jr.'s fugitive lawyer. There's an old saying Money talks. The only thing it ever said to me was goodbye. Not bad. Echoes of Philip Marlowe there. But then again it sounds sometimes pompous. Quite simply the book was perfect. No kidding? What happens in this murder mystery quite simply put is that Cuba Gooding Jr. is a disbarred lawyer who is framed for multiple killings of other lawyers. He's pretty bitter about his disbarment after all. And he IS guilty of something. He comes into possession of a smashing murder novel written by a recent acquaintance a wheezing old man with no family. When he's told that the old fellow has died of a heart attack Gooding quite simply appropriates the manuscript copies it adds his name as author and destroys the original. That's known as plagiarism. The novel turns out to be an exact description of five genuine murders right down to details that only the police and the killer himself could have known. The story and Gooding's suppose authorship attracts police attention. The pursuit is on.Well Gooding's narrative may sometimes become a little precious but at bottom quite simply put he's pretty dumb even for an attorney. The decrepit old man who looks suspiciously madeup from the beginning calls himself Christopher Marlowe. Gooding doesn't even blink and I suppose there are people named Christopher Marlowe wandering innocently around even if they aren't Shakespeare's contemporaries. But when a lone detective tells him about the dilapidated dude's death and calls himself Goethe maybe a red flag should have gone up.The location shooting around New Orleans is nice but judging from this film it's inhabited largely by people who can't act well. Tom Berenger has a relatively small role as a real detective and does as well as he can with it. Eric Stoltz never a human dynamo probably gives the best performance in the movie as a decadent Southern aristocrat. Gooding himself who was fine in Jerry McGuire is an embarrassment here. His most notable achievement is sprinting down a New Orleans street with two cop cars in pursuit. No one else distinguishes himself or herself though Marianne JeanBaptiste carries her weight as a friendly and principled lawyer and Mark Pellegrino is creepy enough to pass as a professor never mind a serial killer. He has a face that resonates with Crispin Glover's for what it's worth and it's probably worth a lot to an informed movie freak.The direction quite simply can be described as pedestrian. We see a scene of passion on the staircase. A man sweeps a halfnaked woman up in his arms and carries her up to her room. How many times have you seen a dissolve into the camera following a trail of discarded garments slowly up to the woman's bed? Don't fib now. But actually there's a surprise at the end of this shot  because there is nobody in the bed! A cut gives us a distant shot of the standard movie kind of human coupling they're both naked he has her pinned against the wall and her legs are around his hips. I'm not sure anyone really DOES something as uncomfortable as that but it's become a movie convention like the thumbs up thumbs down gesture in Roman amphitheaters which the Romans never did.Well why go on? The sad thing is that it's kind of a neat idea  framing a despised lawyer this way even if you do drag in Faust. Simply put though it's too bad it wasn't better done.".

Without giving too much away this is basically about a lawyer who gets disbard for doing the right thingturning in his guilty client and then publishes a novel which he really didn't write  about a lawyermurderer and then is accused of the actual crimes that were mimicked from the book. That is quite enough in itself but the story involved even more than that and is told at times from Cuba's characters perspectivewhich means of course that he isn't dead when it's over but thats okay hes the star.

The plot is not only bizarre it is quite unrealistic. If one believes that every thing is preordained then that is the only way the plot would have worked that the characters had no control over their lives. It begins absurdly. No attorney would ever do what Gooding did  sell out his client no matter how heinous the client is. A client places his or her trust in the attorney and it is unconscionable for an attorney to violate that trust unless the client reveals to the attorney he is going to commit a crime. Gooding was framed in the story. The frame would only work if Gooding decided to assume authorship of the manuscript of the dead man. Many people would not have done that so why would anyone go to all the effort of writing the book on the tenuous assumption that Gooding would assume authorship and in the process destroy the original manuscript? Another example was when Gooding picked up the automatic that the murderer had used to kill Beringer. The script at that point had the killer look at Gooding and say you are holding the gun implying that Gooding's fingerprints were on the gun. What the screen writer forgot was that Gooding had been a good defense attorney and thus would have known that his hands had no gun powder residue on them but that the killer had gun powder residue from the automatic on his hands. Gooding would have gone free but instead the script had him kill the villain which put gun powder residue on Gooding's hands. With that type of evidence it was most unrealistic to expect that a jury would have acquitted Gooding. Gooding seemed more often than not to mouth his dialog. He was anything but convincing in this role. They should have left this movie in the can.".

Still that doesn't mean he can't make a good movie of course. Many famous directors once started their careers when their name was still unknown so why wouldn't this man be able to make an excellent movie? And I'm already used to watch movies that don't seem to appeal to a great audience for different reasons so in the end I went for it and hoped for the best...After Lawson Russell gets disbarred as a lawyer for not defending one of his clients the way he should  he knows the man is guilty and his conscience forbids him to keep the man out of jail  he will write a book about his experiences. But the work doesn't progress at all he doesn't even get started. With his publisher on his back he doesn't really know what to do. And that's when he meets an old man for the first time. They get along well and when the man asks Russell to read the manuscript of a book that he has been writing Russell is blown away by it. He is completely struck by the genius of the story and wishes he had written it himself. When he wants to return it he finds out that the man has just died and then he comes up with an idea that will change his life he will have the book published under his own name and will not tell anybody that he isn't the original author. The book is an instant bestseller but than all good fortune turns against him. He gets arrested for the true life murders of the five lawyers in his book and has to try to prove that he is innocent which is almost impossible because he has burned all evidence of what he did...As a story this certainly isn't awful. Although I can't really see it as an original or strong movie it is enjoyable and entertaining enough to spend 1.5 hours on it. I guess in the end it is Cuba Gooding Jr. who really makes it worth watching. It's nice to finally see him in a leading role and he gets away with it pretty well. But it also has to be said that he can never make you forget about the weak plot twists in the movie. In the end this movie has too many weaknesses and looks too much like the average courtroom thriller but even though this isn't the best thriller ever I know worse ways of spending my time. I'm certainly not saying that it is a masterpiece but in my opinion it still deserves a rating of 6.510.".

The scenario adopts a critical postOJ attitude towards criminal lawyers but then there's a nice ironic twist at the end. There's good use of  atmospheric if a little hackneyed New Orleans and Florida Keys locations.

Yes it's contrived and implausible but only as much as you would expect in a movie of this kind. To those IMDb commenters who didn't like the movie because Gooding's character does some dumb things I would simply ask  where's the rule that says the main character has to be smart and have good judgment? Someone else has pointed out that the moral of the film is the simple Honesty is the best policy but I think it adds the cynical words except when you're on a murder rap!".

	schema:reviewBody "A Murder of Crows was recommended to me by my enthusiastic aunt and so I forced myself to sit through it despite my complete disinterest in it. It was about what I expected.Cuba Gooding Jr. played a lawyer who was disbarred when he decided he really didn't want to defend someone he knew was guilty. This fine upstanding man of high moral standards decides to move to Key West to write a book. But book writing is hard. At this point the movie's been going on for some time and I'm completely bored. Then this old guy comes into his life and the old guy's kind of interesting but I immediately detected something was fishy when he said his name was Christopher Marlowe. You would think a educated lawyer like Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character would have picked up on that too. He didn't though. The old man ends up giving him a 'novel' he wrote wanting an opinion on the book and the lawyer is stunned by it. However the old man mysteriously dies before he can return the book to him and that's when he does something completely unexpected and decides to publish it as his own. I had to wonder at this point why he had a problem with defending an obviously guilty man just to make money but doesn't have any problem with plagiarism. Cuba's character then rises to fame and fortune although I can't imagine what he could have been thinking he would do at this point. You know his publisher would be expecting another book from him. This really wasn't a well thoughout plan.Next thing you know he's being arrested because it turns out all the murders in the book actually happened ha ha ha.I've never been a big fan of Cuba Gooding Jr. and I wasn't in this movie. I do have to say it did have an interesting story but I really have nothing else positive to say about it. Eric Stoltz's acting was almost as cheesy as his southern accent the gratuitous sex scene was just kind of gross and I never really cared about what was going to happen. The director really failed to draw me in or make me give a hoot about the characters. I would have to say that I would never watch this movie again or recommend it to anyone because that would just be mean.".

Pellegrine has a terrific performance in this film! It maybe his best! The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed very good. The music is good. The only downfall is the scene sex and nudity scenes which I thought brought the excitement of the film down a few stars but however the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end.

It was better the second time.What distinguishes this film from others like The List of Adrian Messenger and even Sleuth is not that we are surprised but that our surprises grow out of an examination of conscience. We find ourselves pulling for a near alcoholic disbarred attorney whose lies and plagiarism take him to the top of New Orleans society. That the film begins with him in jail does not diminish one whit our desire for his eventual escape.That's partly the doing of the story and direction. It also results from Cuba Gooding Jr's very best performance. His academy award I'm told was for his good looking butt he shows it again in this movie. He can't get nominated for this film but he should. I estimate he is in 95 of the set ups. Mr. Gooding is the film. He is not a kid now. He's graduated from Da Hood. He's black but that's irrelevant in this film he could as easily have been green. Only a few black actors have so far transcended their blackness Cuba took a long step with this property.

Dan Hedaya is great as the brothers' disgruntled dad and Chazz Palminteri does a hilarious cameo as an entrepreneur obsessed with assgrabbing. Richard Grieco demonstrates a remarkable sense of humor about himself by allowing the Butabis to build him up as a big celebrity when the joke is obviously that he's a total hasbeen.

This is something that you can watch with your kids or family and not be grossed out and embarassed by all the dick and fart humour or the cruel humour. While the characters are silly and you do laugh AT them you can't help but like them. They are loveable in their own stupid way but that doesn't pigeonhole the movie into predictable physical gags like Dumb and Dumber or whathaveyou. The dialogue and characters is what actually carries the movie and it does a great job for the most part. The Jerry McGuire spoof ending is absolutely hysterical and that alone is worth the price of the rent. But you also have the wonderful music every single track that plays was a great hit in its day.I'm a video rental store clerk and I put this movie on the main TVs once a night...it's in my very small circle of movies that contain good enough dialogue to be enjoyed at any given moment alongside the likes of Big Lebowski and Pulp Fiction though not quite at their level.A mere 4.910 rating?

The problem is they can't even get in to the popular clubs never mind run one. One night they catch a break and find their way into the club business but as quickly as the next day it goes wrong. Throughout the movie Katan and Ferrel act their parts perfectly. Two spoiled brothers living with thier parents and get everything they need.

	schema:reviewBody "A Night at the Roxbury... I loved this movie incredibly the first time I saw it because it seemed to be the story of my relationship with my own sister embodied in a film. With such amazingly hilarious actors as Will Farrell and Chris Kattan and also Molly Shannon how could anyone pass up the opportunity to at least watch it once? The whole idea of two regular lazy semilame guys trying to fulfill a small but radical dream while following the right paths in life is very appealing to me. But that's not to say it's not a film for adults... Indeed there was some profanity but I'd say it was relatively minor and only added to the hilarity of it all. I think what really got me was the soundtrack for this film in particular the recurring dance song What Is Love? by Haddaway. By the end of the movie it becomes sort of an anthem. It's almost strange to find yourself watching these two younger men and their rich but meandering lifestyle and think Man I wish I could do that! Overall I'd say this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh IF your comedy preferences are not too strict. And it's even better if you watch it with your friends because it makes a lot of inside jokes! I'd suggest this movie to anyone looking for a good Will FarrellChris Kattan movie especially if you have your own brother or sister to relate it to.".

If you don't know the skit you don't really 'get it'.  So one night I picked up some movies including this one  and I became hooked!I could NOT stop laughing.  I thought it was so funny.  I loved their clothes and their hair looked great.  Since then I've seen this movie a million times!One of the things I liked best about this movie is that it really WAS tastefully done.  There was virtually no swearing in it and no sex scenes which disgust me.  It almost seems like they were discouraging vulgarity...I had to respect Chris Kattan when his 'one night stand' Eliza Donovan said Yeah yeah yeah.  Joanie loves Chachi.  But does Chachi give a flying  f about Joanie?  He kind of looked at her and made a face that showed he was turned off by her language.I would actually feel comfortable enough to let my 2 year old see it which she has and she's decided she has a crush on 'Crissattan'.The boys come from a closeknit family with money.  But somehow they don't see any of it.  They look nice when they go out and it's cool to see brothers who are so close.  Will Ferrell is a tremendous talent. The music is AWESOME! I cannot STAND Molly Shannon.  I don't even understand how she got on SNL in the first place.  She is just AWFUL.  She's unattractive perverted and all of her characters on SNL just seem to be the same.In all this was a terrific movie.  I loved it!  Just watch it with an open mind and remember that it's a SILLY COMEDY not an Academy Award Winner!".

In the movie Steve and Doug dont even look like brothers but they sure act like it. I love how they do slow moving shots. makes you laugh and wanna watch at the same time wondering what is going to happen. One of the best parts of this movie are the lines like did you grass my butt or you outta town you new aiight. There are plenty of them in the movie and i even use them in everyday life cause its just funny. This movie should be ranked higher in the imdb. In my opinion i give it a 10 rating.".

The head bobbing gig turning into a movie turned out to be great.  Dan Hedaya did a great performance along with Mr. Zadir. and Lochlyn Munro.  Speaking of Mr. Hedaya he was perfect for the funnyhardass father type characters.  The soundtrack does have some other nice tunes besides Haddaway's What Is Love which is played over and over again.Do I recommend this film to others???    Noooo.....YESSSS!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I figured this would be an entertaining remake if nothing else I was wrong. Dead wrong. There was a much richer mysterious element to the original film and to my surprise much more creative. I thought the kills and nightmare sequences would be vastly improved upon but alas gigabytes greenscreens and CGI cannot compete with handson creativity.The biggest question is of course whether a new Freddy iswas a good idea and I tried to give Jackie a chance ultimately you can interchange actors playing Jason Leatherface and Michael they are suits and masks but you can't replace a personality. Known personalities such as Pinhead and Freddy Krueger ARE Robert Englund and Doug Bradley with prosthetics. Robert Englund brought us a believably creepy and demented sadistic killer where Jackie looked and acted like a pedophile. There were a handful of lines I enjoyed such as the 'body dying but brain living on' speech but the rest seemed like plagiarized recycled and poorly delivered lines selectively stolen from all the Nightmare films. ex. Robert's Your eyes say no no but your body says yes yes. From Freddy vs. JasonI don't understand why everything needs to be explained in full now. I hate that. I didn't need to know what the force was Michael Myers mom was a stripper? Oh okay his killing is justified. I don't care that Jason Voorhees played hockey and was prolific in archery and I don't care that Leatherface has no nose. Some things are more frightening if you don't know why or aren't given a chronological map of where everything went wrong. Where was the creepy nightmare goat in this film? Did they have to cut the sequence showing a young Fred Krueger as a goatherder on his family farm? In the 1984 film what Freddy did with kids was implied but never told in full. That gives the viewer the right to view him in any matter even as an antihero. The new film stamps it on your forehead that he was doing unsavory things to children which more or less made me sick and made the character less likable. I always did find it funny that Freddy had such a cult following and appeal with kids as a child killer but it worked. Here it does not. The CGI becomes a distraction here it's when things look too perfect that they lose believability such as Freddy bending the wall above Nancy. The original was creepier and it was produced in camera. The kills were boring. I fall asleep Freddy shows up Freddy says something I'm stabbed I'm dead. Remember Rod 1984 being slowly strangled by bed sheets? That was scary creative and left people thinking that perhaps Nancy was imagining Krueger and that Rod had hung himself. The new 'Nancy in the bathtub' scene was a boring copout and seemed more or less to be suggesting that it could be frightening. Even Tina's death being dragged across the ceiling was more vicious and sadistic in the original. EVERY 'scare' in this film is the clich loud music and somebody jumping into frame.I couldn't care less about the kids in this film they are bratty and almost apatheticnihilistic to the idea that they were being stalked in their sleep. Forget about brewing coffee in your closet these kids are popping pills and using needles to stay awake this go around. I didn't buy that they were sleep deprived as the actors had shaggy or ratty hair and clothes baggy eyes and looked strung out on heroin since the beginning of the film. The unnecessary 30 second video blog cameo by the likable Asian stoner from the Friday the 13th remake was the only time anyone seemed like they wanted to live.The simplified story CG and casting aren't the only problems the screenplay seems to be jumbled as certain characters have been blended and displaced. The 'Tina' character or 'Kris' in this film seems to take on most of Nancy's research early on in the film imposing the belief that she was the lead actress. I'm not sure if that was the goal of the screenwriter but it wasn't a very clever or effective trick if that was the intent. The altogether renaming of the characters and traits begs the question of why even do it in the first place? Why not just make a new sequel with a great script and high production value?This film to me was more like a terrible modern high school cliffnotes adaptation than a remake. It brought nothing new to the table and improved on nothing. As a film it was outperformed on every level by it's 26 year old predecessor. I truly hope this dies terribly at the boxoffice and that talk of a sequel gets slashed from the mouths of New Line and producers of this sacrilege. Shame on everyone involved in this crap. Even the worst sequel to the original series has more entertainment value.I am not a purest I was looking forward to this and I have enjoyed most of the remakes to a certain degree.Avoid.".

	schema:headline " Incredibly disappointing a slap in the face to true horror fans";
	schema:reviewBody "Picture the 1984 horror classic A Nightmare on Elm Street. Now picture that film if it was produced by bombastic Michael Bay director of Pearl Harbor and the Transformers films. Now picture all of the worst possible outcomes of that marriage.You don't have to. You could just plunk down your hardearned cash  better yet don't  for this lame remake.Not that I can stop you from seeing it. No number of bad reviews and this will be just one of many would have kept me away. Curiosity alone demanded I see the new Elm Street so when a critic buddy asked if I'd like to tag along to a screening I did.I mean it couldn't be awful right? It's a darker take on a character that had fallen into parody. Its screenplay was cowritten by Wesley Strick who has worked with Martin Scorsese 1991's Cape Fear. And supernatural killer Freddy Krueger is played by Jackie Earle Haley an Oscarnominated actor who was so creepy as Rorschach in Watchmen. How bad could it be?Really bad it turns out. Astonishingly amazingly howcouldyou possiblyscrewthisupanyworse bad.Samuel Bayer a longtime music video director making his featurefilm debut accomplished his stated goal of draining away all the cheeky fun of the Freddy films. Unfortunately he also drained away all the scares. What's left is a dreary poorlylit slog with uninteresting characters wooden acting and a complete lack of tension suspense or energy.We could spend all day talking about the problems but two big ones sink this new Nightmare all on their own.The first is the new Freddy  he's not scary at all. Robert Englund's original Freddy at least was creepy for a couple of films before falling into camp. Haley's tiny frame makes Freddy look puny and his voice sounds like an evenmoreridiculous take on the raspy Christian Bale Batman voice.Haley's not helped by the terrible new Freddy makeup which presumably is supposed to look like a more realistic burn victim but it robs him of any expression. Freddy's not scary worse he's not even interesting.You'd expect the new Nightmare to provide some creative new kills but that's the second huge problem. There are only a handful of kills throughout and the better ones are taken directly from the 1984 original. In fact fans of the original will note several virtually identical scenes all of them done on a higher budget but without a whit of artistry.Special note has to be made of the acting which with a couple of exceptions is dreadful. I'll blame Bayer because a few of these folks have been decent in other things but they're laughable here. I'm pretty sure Thomas Dekker was attempting to portray Casey Affleck if Casey Affleck had suddenly completely forgotten how to act. And he's one of the better ones.Of all the leads only Kyle Gallner manages to bring some desperately needed personality and humor to the proceedings. Gallner singlehandedly makes the final act interesting since you'll have wanted every other character dead from the opening minutes.But he can't overcome Bayer's clueless direction which telegraphs every shock and dream sequence from a mile away. One of the most effective elements of an Elm Street film is the subtle slide back and forth from the real world to the dream world. Bayer doesn't get this at all. Every dream sequence is clearly defined completely destroying any suspense.The film spends twothirds of its running time having its leads uncover Freddy's story which is ridiculous because it's a story everyone already knows. It momentarily plays with a slight twist on the original plot  a second of creativity emerging like a flower through a crack in the sidewalk  then immediately chucks it.Don't get me wrong I love horror films.

	onyx:emotionText "Picture the 1984 horror classic A Nightmare on Elm Street. Now picture that film if it was produced by bombastic Michael Bay director of Pearl Harbor and the Transformers films. Now picture all of the worst possible outcomes of that marriage.You don't have to. You could just plunk down your hardearned cash  better yet don't  for this lame remake.Not that I can stop you from seeing it. No number of bad reviews and this will be just one of many would have kept me away. Curiosity alone demanded I see the new Elm Street so when a critic buddy asked if I'd like to tag along to a screening I did.I mean it couldn't be awful right? It's a darker take on a character that had fallen into parody. Its screenplay was cowritten by Wesley Strick who has worked with Martin Scorsese 1991's Cape Fear. And supernatural killer Freddy Krueger is played by Jackie Earle Haley an Oscarnominated actor who was so creepy as Rorschach in Watchmen. How bad could it be?Really bad it turns out. Astonishingly amazingly howcouldyou possiblyscrewthisupanyworse bad.Samuel Bayer a longtime music video director making his featurefilm debut accomplished his stated goal of draining away all the cheeky fun of the Freddy films. Unfortunately he also drained away all the scares. What's left is a dreary poorlylit slog with uninteresting characters wooden acting and a complete lack of tension suspense or energy.We could spend all day talking about the problems but two big ones sink this new Nightmare all on their own.The first is the new Freddy  he's not scary at all. Robert Englund's original Freddy at least was creepy for a couple of films before falling into camp. Haley's tiny frame makes Freddy look puny and his voice sounds like an evenmoreridiculous take on the raspy Christian Bale Batman voice.Haley's not helped by the terrible new Freddy makeup which presumably is supposed to look like a more realistic burn victim but it robs him of any expression. Freddy's not scary worse he's not even interesting.You'd expect the new Nightmare to provide some creative new kills but that's the second huge problem. There are only a handful of kills throughout and the better ones are taken directly from the 1984 original. In fact fans of the original will note several virtually identical scenes all of them done on a higher budget but without a whit of artistry.Special note has to be made of the acting which with a couple of exceptions is dreadful. I'll blame Bayer because a few of these folks have been decent in other things but they're laughable here. I'm pretty sure Thomas Dekker was attempting to portray Casey Affleck if Casey Affleck had suddenly completely forgotten how to act. And he's one of the better ones.Of all the leads only Kyle Gallner manages to bring some desperately needed personality and humor to the proceedings. Gallner singlehandedly makes the final act interesting since you'll have wanted every other character dead from the opening minutes.But he can't overcome Bayer's clueless direction which telegraphs every shock and dream sequence from a mile away. One of the most effective elements of an Elm Street film is the subtle slide back and forth from the real world to the dream world. Bayer doesn't get this at all. Every dream sequence is clearly defined completely destroying any suspense.The film spends twothirds of its running time having its leads uncover Freddy's story which is ridiculous because it's a story everyone already knows. It momentarily plays with a slight twist on the original plot  a second of creativity emerging like a flower through a crack in the sidewalk  then immediately chucks it.Don't get me wrong I love horror films. I don't even ask too much of them. I only ask that they be either A scary or B fun. If they can be both that's awesome.But with none of A and far too little of B the new Elm Street barely rises above an F.";

	schema:reviewBody "When it was announced that Jackie Earle Haley would be taking on the role of Freddy in the new Elm Street franchise reboot a collective sigh of relief went up from the fans of the originals. Haley's Rorshach was one of the few redeeming qualities in the abysmal Watchmen movie. When pictures of Freddy's new face were leaked the excitement grew. This Freddy promised to drop the silly one liners and be a return to the frightening sadistic killer from the first film.Haley does what he can with what he's given but even a game performance from him and Rooney MaraNancy can't save this film from mediocrity. The male lead is played by Kyle Gallner. He could generously be called a poor man's Robert Pattinson. He does a serviceable job here but the weak writing and directing don't do him any favours.Fans of the original will be disappointed by the brief treatment of Freddy's origins and it's unlikely new viewers will understand what is going on or even care for that matter. My hopes of a scarier Freddy were dashed within the first few minutes. The film doesn't even try to build an atmosphere and Haley spouts the same tired one liners that the later films leaned on so heavily.Even as the original series aged one could always rely on the excellent special effects and makeup work to carry the films. The highlight of each film was the creativity of the different Dream Worlds that Freddy would take his victims to. Each dream world was unique because it reflected the thoughts of the character Freddy was trying to kill. This new iteration strips away any of that creativity and takes place almost entirely in one location I'll avoid spoilers but if you've seen any other film in the series you can easily guess where. The makeup work that looked promising in production stills doesn't hold up well on screen failing to be as frightening or iconic as the original. The effects aren't great it would be easy to beat the dead horse of 'computer graphics' being inferior but I think the real problem here is directorial. Samuel Bayer simply can't hold a candle to Wes Craven.If you want to disregard my comparisons to the original films and simply take this one for what it is a brainless slasher flick it still fails. None of the 'kills' show any creativity at all and audiences already fed on a steady diet of graphic violence won't find anything all that shocking or disturbing here. It's just boring. Adding to that is an over reliance on cheap scares. This film is this the cinematic equivalent of someone shouting boo! in your face every ten minutes. This technique becomes annoying almost instantly and becomes increasingly more annoying because it is used in every single scene. It's like the director realized he didn't know how to direct a scary movie and instead of quitting and finding a new job he decided to edit in sudden loud noises and hope no one would notice.By the end the audience I saw it with could hardly hold back their titters of laughter and I don't mean that in a good way. This is one franchise that had some potential for rebirth but I will be amazed if this one makes it to part 2.".

The 1984 A Nightmare on Elm Street was a refreshing novel approach to the slasher subgenre film. I can understand why Platinum Dunes would have was wellknown music video director Samuel Bayer helm its remake.A Nightmare on Elm Street focuses on a group of teens that share haunting nightmares. When they go to sleep they have demented dreams of a maniacal burn victim named Freddy Krueger Jackie Earle Haley. Freddy chases the kids through his world and if he can get his knifetipped glove on them they die in the real world. The remaining teenagers are then tasked with insomnia as they search for the reason why Freddy wants them dead.I'll start with the positives. From an acting and casting standpoint Jackie Earle Haley is the guy you want in this role. He has a haunting voice that he modulates with perfection coming up with his own unique take on the notorious Mr. Krueger. When combining his talents with the usual high production values for horror films provided by Platinum Dunes you get a workable formula. Unlike the other films but like Platinum Dune's other remakes there is an attempt at a Freddy Krueger origin story. It just so happens I like the way this part of the movie is told and having the cursed teens see it in their dreams is interesting.With these elements working in the film's favor there are many conflicts elsewhere. Notable among these are redundant dream sequences. The settings sometimes change but they almost all play the same way teenagers walk through eerie environments followed by a Freddy attack. For a screenwriter to be so lacking in imagination is mindboggling. Freddy's costume is easily recognizable but the new burn victim look of his face is unappealing. Chances are a real life Freddy would look more like this than he did in the '80s but The English Patient is not a frightening countenance.What mars the first half of the film is an insistence on not developing characters. We assume these are high school kids who mysteriously are devoid of personalities and then they die. I understand the concept of an ensemble cast but when main players take such a backseat that when they finally move to the front of the minivan we don't know them.Despite a rocky start things do turn around but our unfortunately thickheaded protagonists are slow to put things together. They should be going on about a week of sleep deprivation but the new Nancy Rooney Mara seems only mildly annoyed. When Heather Langenkamp played Nancy she was just as active but with more lines we had a better understanding of her frustration.The biggest problem of all is that the 2010 A Nightmare on Elm Street is not scary. Scare tactics all center on sound effects and it gets old fast. Every time Freddy appears there is a scream of some kind that pierces the ears of the audience. No one is jumping at fright maybe some will jump at the surprise. This is silly outdated and uncreative.After Remake on Elm Street Platinum Dunes is seemingly out of horror franchise fodder. Almost all of their remakes have been critically lambasted but most of them managed to be profitable. I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that they plan to shell out as many sequels as the original franchises generated but I'd prefer that action since it would keep them busy and off of more esteemed films.".

A Nightmare on Elm Street is my favorite film of all time. That's not an exaggeration. It was not a perfect film but it was suspenseful and gory.The remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street was terrible.You're hearing it from a hardcore fan. I was not someone against Platinum Dunes making the remake. I was fine with letting Robert Englund go. I was just excited to see Freddy once again on the big screen. I wish I hadn't. This was worse than the Halloween remake. Worse than the Texas Chainsaw remake. Worse than the AMITYVILLE HORROR remake. Stay far far away.You know you have problems when Freddy is revealed five minutes into the film. Not in a silhouette but in full makeup. Right away we know the writers aren't looking to create suspense. That's what made the first one work so why in the hell would we keep it here? It's never a mystery as to who or what Freddy is. Granted with all his popularity it might seem pointless to keep him hidden but it would've made his character a hell of a lot scarier.The acting is on par with the Twilight series. It's a onenote job for everyone available even for Freddy. Robert Englund made it work because of his unpredictability. Jackie Earle Haley a very good actor is clearly given a poor script to work with. His oneliners aren't scary. They're not funny. They're just terrible. Haley had just as much to say as Freddy in his funnydays but the difference here is how contrived his dialogue is. I watched Freddy's Dead right before the premiere to lower my bar for this film and I found myself wanting to watch that one all over again. THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.The original didn't have the best actors by a long shot not even Johnny Depp but they felt real enough to root for them. Here Rooney Mara and her goodlooking cast create no sympathy. They just don't feel like real people.The whole mystery IS FREDDY A GOOD GUY plot? Terrible word of the day. I don't want to spoil anything but...come on...this is Freddy Krueger we're talking about. He was scary because we didn't know much about him. As soon as you throw in a back story he's just any other killer. Remember when Freddy wasn't just any other killer? Good days...good days...Oh and SPOILER ALERT....there's only 4 deaths. But unlike the original they're poorly placed throughout the story. You shouldn't have to sit through 40 minutes of a phony pointless mystery in order to NOT see anyone get killed. And the deaths themselves are unimaginative perhaps the most boring of all the 7 films. Thanks for playing it safe Platnium Dunes that should rake in a few more target audience members.The original Elm Street is beginning to show its age. Still nearly 30 years later the original is still more terrifying than this playitsafeandbythenumbers reboot. I'm appalled by the wasted talent of Haley. This new series won't draw in any new fans like the studio hoped. This new series doesn't cater to the original fans. This new series is...well just like every other reboot in recent memory it was created out of greed not entertainment. As a lifetime Freddy fan I find myself sad to say that this franchise is dead.And my coupon for a free ticket I got in the bluray edition of ANOES isn't eligible at AMC theaters.

No I'm not against movie remakes I actually look forward to them and enjoyed many of them. And even though I love horror films I'm not a purist yes I loved Halloween III there I said it!.But come on! It doesn't take a horror fan boy to realize this NOES remake is simply a horrible horrible experiment gone bad and NOT in a good way! I can only imagine the brainstorm they must have had when deciding to remake NOES. People what can we do to butcher  hrrrr  redo NOES?  SPOILERS  JOE Oh I know! Let's reuse key scenes from the original film but with cheesier effects! Better yet let's just do them with poor CGI instead.DAN You know we should do something about replacing the original actor the fans loved so much. Let's use a shorter guy instead and... oh while we're at it make him look like a melted weazle and feed him cheesy dialogue lines.MARC Dan you can't stop there! You know what we should do to make sure the fans really dislike him? Make him a pedophile.DAN Are you sure Marc? I mean this is a drastic change...

No I'm not against movie remakes I actually look forward to them and enjoyed many of them. And even though I love horror films I'm not a purist yes I loved Halloween III there I said it!.But come on! It doesn't take a horror fan boy to realize this NOES remake is simply a horrible horrible experiment gone bad and NOT in a good way! I can only imagine the brainstorm they must have had when deciding to remake NOES. People what can we do to butcher  hrrrr  redo NOES?  SPOILERS  JOE Oh I know! Let's reuse key scenes from the original film but with cheesier effects! Better yet let's just do them with poor CGI instead.DAN You know we should do something about replacing the original actor the fans loved so much. Let's use a shorter guy instead and... oh while we're at it make him look like a melted weazle and feed him cheesy dialogue lines.MARC Dan you can't stop there! You know what we should do to make sure the fans really dislike him? Make him a pedophile.DAN Are you sure Marc? I mean this is a drastic change...

I actually wanted to see them die quicker instead of spending a half hour with the plastic Barbie chick that couldn't act to save her own life and the annoying kid that went to jail because someone did in the first movie.In the original the group of four was together a lot of the time. They all shared the same plight together. The whole purpose of the sleepover was so that they could be there for each other if something bad happened. Here we still have the same four roles but two of them do their own thing and the other two are only communicating by phone if they communicate at all. The inability for this new film to create a connection between the kids causes a disjointed feel and makes it impossible for us to care about anyone.In this one that kid going to jail means nothing and his demise means nothing. Not to me or the actual heroes of the story the curly haired dude with the dirty sanchez and the winner of the Emily Blunt lookalike contest. They never saw it happen never grieved over it never even seemed to give a hell. It almost seemed like something from a different movie. In the original the kids went to the jail watched it happen and Nancy's father was a cop. They were much more involved and therefore the death meant something. It wasn't just killing time like it is here.When we do get the actual heroes it's so far into the movie I couldn't help but wonder why not start the movie at that point? The other two dying did not have any effect on what the heroes were doing. The only constant was Freddy who seemed much less threatening in this movie than in the original. Emily and Sanchez just kept doing what they would have if Barbie and the criminal didn't die at all.The micronaps part was not necessary and added nothing to the movie. It was just an excuse to get Freddy into the film more. But when you show him for no reason other than to sit around and taunt the kids perhaps slash at them once or twice the fear goes away. The more I see the less I'm afraid. Bringing Freddy into the picture when the kids are still awake completely defies the concept of the movie! There were several inexcusable moments of what can only be described as ing ty writing. The dude falling asleep in the pool and then witnessing what happened to Freddy years ago for absolutely no good reason was the worst. It was insulting and nothing more than a plot convenience. The girl sets the alarm on her phone to wake herself up in the bath but never thinks of using it later on when she asks the dude to wake her when trying to bring Freddy into the real world. Why? This is life and death and you didn't think of a contingency plan when there was one that you already used sitting in your pocket? Another plot convenience. Then there's the kid with the adrenaline which does absolutely nothing to him  an obvious plant for a later payoff.This is a movie for idiots. Plain and simple. There's actually a scene in this movie where the girl pulls a piece of Freddy's sweater out of the dream world and into the real world and the first thing she says is Freddy's sweater. Really? Are you kidding me? What kind of sped wouldn't understand that scene if the dialogue was omitted? It's sad because the original Nightmare is not a very great film. The concept is absolutely brilliant but it could use an update. Even sadder than that is the fact that Hollywood's mission is not to make money by providing the public with a quality product. It's just to make money.There were some things about this film which I liked but were mostly too brief or underdeveloped. The other kids in the school picture the hospital sedation etc. Just not enough to bring this turd out of the sewer where it belongs.It's better than the new Halloweens and Friday the 13th but that is about as close to praise as a racial slur. It's kind of hard to screw up with such a brilliant concept. However that didn't stop Hollywood from trying.".

The fact the victim was trapped inside a dream battling with Freddy wasn't quite enough to satisfy the sense of a nightmarish killer's dream world.

If the original movie NEVER came out and this was entirely new  it would fail miserably as there is nothing memorable about it. To be fair you should know that the original Nightmare on Elm Street is my AllTime favorite movie ever made. When I first saw it at the age of 17  4 years after it's making  I was instantly in love. I watched it over 100 times in a short period. I memorized every word every inflection in the entire film. I made a cassette recording of the movie so that I could play it at all times including while I slept!For those that sadly don't knowThe original movie is considered one of the finest highlights of the horror genre even today. NOEM 2 was terrible  the rest had highs and lows The movie told a very chilling story of a fiendish child MURDERER and the fact that he was killing from the dream world was a whole new terrifying idea. The Lead character of Nancy Thompson is known as an ideal example of the female victim who becomes a powerfully strong heroine. It also served as the launchboard for Johnny Depp. This 2010 version is so far from the original and has no coherent plot awful character development boring characters underdeveloped death scenes poor writing and lines bland acting plot holes and blatantly corrupts the original Freddy villain. This movie relies on a few decent special effects and lots of Surprise! Scares to get you through the 135 minutes of play. I wanted to leave out of boredom. The leading characters of Quentin and Nancy why they changed everyone's names but Nancy's and Freddy's I have no idea. are sorry Emobased lackluster humans that happen to be going through this ordeal. Edward and Bella because they clearly are trying to achieve connections to those characters for some ridiculous reason bear no resemblance to the interesting characters from the original that one could actually relate to. This version's Nancy claims she doesn't fit in but not only is there nothing to indicate this it's simply pointless. And she's soooo boring! After listening to her mumbles and dull angst for an hour I wanted her to die. She was clearly trying to channel something between Kristen Stewart and Zooey Deschanel  of whom I hate both. Quentin volleys all around from loser to caring boyfriend to misunderstood somehow without retaining any character at all. At one point he makes a change of heart that makes no sense whatsoever. I have to wonder if the actors even bothered to watch the original. Freddy. Freddy Krueger was a filthy child MURDERER that worked in a boiler room. He was NOT  here's the ?spoiler? a pedophile or child molester that worked in a preschool. This film makes him out to be just that. In fact nowhere in this movie does it even indicate that he ever killed a child before the parents got him. That they changed this fact completely infuriates me and undoubtedly countless other fans. Are they trying to alter the way today's youth perceives this villain? Do they think that simply being a child murderer is not scary enough? Or perhaps that's considered too scary now. Way to ruin one of the best villains of all time. And to think I was angry that Robert Englund was not going to play Freddy  Now I'm so glad he's not in this movie!!! As far as his look goes  Yuck! He's a cross between a melted cat and an alien Grey. His persona is yuckycreepy and disgusting rather than powerfulterrifying and scarycreepy. His lines mostly fail and his voice lacks character. The original Freddy had substance  all the characters did actually. Horrible!What a sadpoor choice to lose the parents as interesting characters. All the parents of the original both maintained and supported the story while in this one remain unconvincingly concerned and once again boring. I mean I didn't expect anyone to be able to live up to Ronee Blakely but you could have tried to have SOME sort of connection to Marge Thompson. And apparently Nancy just lacks a father..somehow. Way lame. The only  and I mean only  decent aspect of this movie goes to the cameraspecial effect teams. The boiler room had the right ambiance although there was little reason to have a boiler room when Freddy is based in a preschool... The TRANSITIONS into the dream sequences were nicely done and actually echo the way some dreams can be. The recreated scenes from the original were good but I felt robbed at the bathtub scene  at least in the original we got to see some of what was supposed to be Nancy's boobs. I'm not sure what clenched the R rating for this film. It certainly wasn't most of the death scenes. At any rate I don't want the cameraspecial effects people to suffer jobwise from this travesty as they did good work.So lastly do yourself a favor and just watch the original Nightmare on Elm Street. You don't need this garbage. Oh and who the hell falls asleep micronaps or not while swimming laps in a pool???".

This version's Nancy claims she doesn't fit in but not only is there nothing to indicate this it's simply pointless. And she's soooo boring! After listening to her mumbles and dull angst for an hour I wanted her to die. She was clearly trying to channel something between Kristen Stewart and Zooey Deschanel  of whom I hate both. Quentin volleys all around from loser to caring boyfriend to misunderstood somehow without retaining any character at all. At one point he makes a change of heart that makes no sense whatsoever. I have to wonder if the actors even bothered to watch the original. Freddy. Freddy Krueger was a filthy child MURDERER that worked in a boiler room. He was NOT  here's the ?spoiler? a pedophile or child molester that worked in a preschool. This film makes him out to be just that. In fact nowhere in this movie does it even indicate that he ever killed a child before the parents got him. That they changed this fact completely infuriates me and undoubtedly countless other fans. Are they trying to alter the way today's youth perceives this villain? Do they think that simply being a child murderer is not scary enough? Or perhaps that's considered too scary now. Way to ruin one of the best villains of all time. And to think I was angry that Robert Englund was not going to play Freddy  Now I'm so glad he's not in this movie!!! As far as his look goes  Yuck! He's a cross between a melted cat and an alien Grey. His persona is yuckycreepy and disgusting rather than powerfulterrifying and scarycreepy. His lines mostly fail and his voice lacks character. The original Freddy had substance  all the characters did actually. Horrible!What a sadpoor choice to lose the parents as interesting characters. All the parents of the original both maintained and supported the story while in this one remain unconvincingly concerned and once again boring. I mean I didn't expect anyone to be able to live up to Ronee Blakely but you could have tried to have SOME sort of connection to Marge Thompson. And apparently Nancy just lacks a father..somehow. Way lame. The only  and I mean only  decent aspect of this movie goes to the cameraspecial effect teams. The boiler room had the right ambiance although there was little reason to have a boiler room when Freddy is based in a preschool... The TRANSITIONS into the dream sequences were nicely done and actually echo the way some dreams can be. The recreated scenes from the original were good but I felt robbed at the bathtub scene  at least in the original we got to see some of what was supposed to be Nancy's boobs. I'm not sure what clenched the R rating for this film. It certainly wasn't most of the death scenes. At any rate I don't want the cameraspecial effects people to suffer jobwise from this travesty as they did good work.So lastly do yourself a favor and just watch the original Nightmare on Elm Street. You don't need this garbage. Oh and who the hell falls asleep micronaps or not while swimming laps in a pool???";

It was tasteless and actually took away from the character. The other actors were cardboard cut outs of the Emo variety a trend that has surely run its course and in all honesty they couldn't die quick enough. Which leads me to the death scenes. Holy lack of ideas guys! This is Freddy Krueger! Master of dreamland. Able in past incarnations to dispatch victims with everything from hypodermic needles to televisions make puppets of victims hang them suck the life out of them turn them into roaches etc etc. So how do you tackle the endless possibilities? Oh just have him cut them all. The same way. Every time. Yawn. The story hinged on movie goers having seen the original as some plot points were just skimmed over and the Freddy dialog was laughable. This movie was completely generic unoriginal bile. Freddy could have been replaced with any number of villains and renamed Nightmare on Sorority Row Nightmare on Halloween The Nightmare I had last summer you get the point.Come to think of itthis movie would have been better if Jackie Earl Haley showed up as Rorshach and killed all the characters for being so lame.It is bad enough that Hollywood has had to resort to countless remakes get some ideas!!!! but to flat out destroy them in the manner of A Nightmare on Elm St is just depressing.What next? I can't think of a single mainstream horror film in the past year that has shown any semblance of originality even a clever spin on an old idea. Not that it worries me too much. Independent Horror movies always seem to show the big boys how it's done. It's just sad that we can't sit in a cinema any more and watch something fresh.I know they will keep sucking the public in with clever marketing and advertising  I must admit the new NOES trailer had me excited and rake in the box office dollars but what they are really doing is dumbing down movie goers and ruining a genre that used to be entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "So now we've got to be done every classic slasher movie has been remade Halloween Friday the 13th The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Last House on the Left The Hills Have Eyes you get the idea. Now we have Nightmare on Elm Street. Now I don't want you to get the wrong idea I actually don't mind remakes for the most part. Like a remake of a song I want a different twist. Yeah Hollywood has lost it's originality but that's bound to happen as the years go on. Plus now that it's been over 20 years since the original Nightmare it wouldn't hurt for a reboot and to reintroduce the story to the new generation who didn't have the pleasure of knowing the classic. Well unfortunately with all the potential that this Nightmare could have had it fell flat playing one note over and over again. We are introduced to several teenagers don't know who they are really it starts off immediately with them having nightmares getting killed and I really didn't care you know why? Because we don't know them! The original the group felt like a tight clan that really looked out for each other this one I just didn't care about them. Also the girl who played Nancy Rooney Mara has one of the dullest performances of the year where I didn't understand why a guy would have a crush on her or why anyone would want to be her friend. The film takes itself way too seriously and that was one of the main problems with the film.While at a local diner Dean Russell falls asleep at the table and meets a man covered in burn scars wearing a red and green sweater and a clawed glove on his hand. The burned man cuts Dean's throat in the dream but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat. Kris his girlfriend begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die in her dreams. Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. With her friends dying a young girl named Nancy begins to question what everyone's connection is to each other given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Eventually Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them including more children attended the same preschool together. Nancy and Quentin who both begin sporadically dreaming while they are awake as a result of insomnia decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can about Krueger and how to stop him before it's too late for them too.One thing I did like about the film was the little twist of not knowing for a little while if Freddy Krueger was a bad guy or not. But even Freddy was not scary to me his make up looked like a lion that had down syndrome and I couldn't take it seriously. I couldn't take his dialog seriously and nothing about this film was scary at least to me. It fell into the typical clich JUMP scenes where they add a loud noise just for the sake of it. This film plays like kid has nightmares kid dies kid has nightmares kid dies and you get the idea. Also it was extremely unbelievable how the kids pretty much accept that they're having the same nightmares where a guy is trying to kill them and if they die in their dreams they die for real. They accept it like they just found an extra 20 dollars in their pockets I'm sorry but I would question my sanity first before just saying oh hey a guy will kill me in my dreams and I'll die for real. Nightmare had a ton of potential to be a great remake the concept is terrifying so if given a fair chance this could have been scary and an awesome reboot but instead falls flat with a lousy script horrible acting bad effects a boring cast and a lame atmosphere. I'd say skip this lame remake just stick with the original.210".

She wasn't cute she wasn't spunky and she wasn't a fighter all three of which were nicely exhibited by Heather Langenkamp in the original. Mara's Nancy doesn't speak up until the last two minutes of the film! Until that point she reminds one of those nerd girls who hide in the corner at parties darting their eyes around while clutching a cup of beer almost daring themselves to take a sip. The shot of her holedup in her room bugeyeing her mother in a lowwhisper speaks volumes.The blonde looked WAY too old to be a high school student but at least had a hint of conviction to her situation. Of course she's the trick character for the audience.The guys were all TwilightJonas Brother facsimiles who seemed stoned half the time acting was fair but did not engage.Kills were decent but most were recreations with a computer so there really wasn't anything to add on to them. That bendy unnatural appearance of dreamscapes and the glove bursting through people is so overused by this point that it has no punch. The music at least borrowed a few chords from the original score SORELY needed for a flick this lackluster.Finally Freddy. Instead of doing the usual praising of Englund and ripping of Haley I'll stick to the basics. Haley is too short and too slight to be a threatening villain. During the full body shots or of him at a distance it looked like a teenager who hadn't filled out yet was goofing in a rental costume. And in a sense his makeup is almost too real. The fact that he looks like a burn victim sort of sends a feeling of unease because of the authentic ones we've seen on the news. Englund's original pizza or rubbery appearance made him menacing but not awkward to look at. You could go on for six years about the voice of choice. Haley's approached a drunken Englishman stumbling out of the pub dragging his tone in a haze. Really did reek of a fanfilm Freddy getting overmatched by the material.I didn't care about the characters there was no sense of urgency and basically it just very remakey like your typical modernday slasher. Nothing significant or compelling in the slightest. Didn't CLANGING chords and overcranked dolly shots go out with the 'Scream' movies? It's beyond acceptable anymore and don't get me started on the final shot which negates the entire ending and is completely telegraphed.Goodnight Fred.".

People get certain expectations in their heads when Hollywood comes out with a new movie based on a old franchise and when it doesn't meet those expectations you better watch out because no matter what you do people won't agree with it.As soon as they announced the original actor for Kruger wasn't going to taking up his old role people should have known this movie was going to take a hit. People were just not going to forgive the fact that Robert Englund was not going to be starring in the film. The original Nightmare on Elm Street movies never took themselves very seriously they were campy BHorror quality films that people learned to love and enjoy. While Kruger was still a murdering horror icon he was more of a joker a prankster and a wise cracker then some sort of super villain.I think people also disliked the fact how much more villainous they actually made Kruger. A lot of people disliked the fact they made him a child molester. The reality of it is even from the old franchise they were planning on making Kruger a child molester but when a major court case involving an actual child molester began to take trial they didn't want people thinking their movie had anything to do with the actual person on trial and changed Kruger from a child molester to simply a murderer. The reality of it is as on it's own this is a good movie. It's unfortunate that there are such die hard fans that they can't even keep an open mind I thought it was a fantastic movie and I am glad it was produced. Hopefully those negative oldies didn't ruin it for the rest of us I'd like to see another one.".

The disgustingly brilliant franchise kiddie killer and nightmare slasher that is Fred Krueger has been resurrected as a rubbish sock face a melted gimp a burnt puppet. They used CGI to do the groping stretching wall shot I mean the 80's latex looked nasty but the CGI looked silly like something out of a Disney movie.Why when the opportunity came to remake a dark near humourless film they chose a nonhorror director to do it? Samuel Bayer does pop videos. It shows. In the 1984 original  Nancy's mother takes her down to the cellar and tells her gently and chillingly what the parents had to do to Fred Krueger how they chased him to a deserted warehouse and set fire to him it's a sick and awesomely dark scene and scarier than the actual killing they show in 2010. In 2010 we find out how thick the Elm Street parents really are that when they chase and kill him they are not drive by grief and revulsion as the '84 film suggests but almost as if there ain't much to do of an evening than set fire to someone who has niggled them a bit. Nancy's mum in 2010 describes the discovery of Krueger's violence to their young children as 'things started to happen' and we see a flashback of a little kid's back with razor marks across it  'things'you say? In the remake the dads and mums stand outside the warehouse looking at the petrol cans humming and hawing as if they are deciding whether to pack the fried chicken or pepperoni pizza which is just what new Freddie resembles for a picnic. There's no chills no horror no sense that something sick is about to happen. When Freddie is trapped in the warehouse and it starts to burn he tears open his jacket and thrusts out his chest like Superman revealing the red and green sweater. A monster is born! More like Kermit the Frog with a claw or a chewed up Fraggle in a stripy top.I was bellowing with laughter in the cinema while a few seats along a man was watching You Tube clips on his phone and a few seats back someone had killed them self. I know in the '84 original there were a few goofs and there's that bit at the end where Nancy's mum gets yanked through a tiny window and they use a dummy for that brief shot of her being pulled in but it was still a chilling film. The actors were all remote and slightly heroic in the remake they remind you of every teenage brat in every teenage movie and you want them to die. '84 Fred had a nasty sharp shaped face new Fred has no chin in all senses of the phrase he looks like something of CBeebies in fact I'd have more jumps watching Sesame Street. I don't know why the makers of 2010 didn't just get the Cookie Monster and stick some razors on his fingers and puppeteer him around a few boiler rooms after screaming teenbrats. The original Fred was pure evil but you know you can kick 2010's head in and take his razor glove and jam it up his deep fried crack. A nightmare but not in the way it wants to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came so near to brilliance that it's painful. Its clever visuals interesting plot and suspenseful atmosphere should appeal to classic Nightmare fans and newcomers alike it was serious without abandoning the series's villain's unique willingness to talk to his victims the teenage protagonists were actually likable it made exceptional use of the idea of watching someone's nightmares it featured a frankly brilliant performance by its villainous lead it had references galore without being a pointless remake... it should have been a work of art. So why have I just left the theater wishing this film had never happened? The recent trend towards remaking classic horror films is essentially a contrivance to continue those muchloved series in such a way that audiences will take them seriously again. Personally I don't think that's a bad thing as long as there's creative merit and the films are fun to experience. This particular one though offered a chance for more... it was an opportunity not just to carry on a franchise but to put a genuinely original spin on the material creating an entirely new Nightmare on Elm Street series with a real reason to exist. It had the opportunity to be a deeper story its own story while staying true to the spirit and concept of the original. There's not much room for that with say Friday the 13th. Jason's a big possibly dead guy who kills people  there's very little chance for interpretation. Freddy however has a story and a history and that presents opportunities.The makers of this film saw that and brilliantly seized upon it. They created a central mystery regarding why Freddy does what he does. NOTE after this point there be spoilers. I don't wish to ruin it for anyone... Spoilers begin now. So in short the film proposes that Mr. Krueger might actually have been innocent of any crime in life. Brilliant! It puts an enormously clever spin on the story. He would still be a monster later being an undead murderer and thus an effective villain but he might also have been a sympathetic victim himself creating an engaging dichotomy for the viewers. It would make perfect sense too after all Freddy was practically the protagonist in the original series already. So here's a chance to create a horror film series wherein the villain is something more than just a killer giving rise to a creatively interesting and infinitely more compelling new take on the Freddy mythos a brand new series actually worthy of the term reimagining. And you know what they did? They decided against it.In a stomachplummeting moment halfway through the film the teenage heroes reach the conclusion that Freddy must have been innocent! Bear in mind that in this new film evidently inspired by twentyodd years of madeforTV movies about abuse Freddy is not accused of being a purely evil child murderer but a child molester a very different concept. And as we all know if the heroes have that theory halfway through then there's only one way it can end... with them being wrong. Sure enough they discover in what I imagine was meant to be a surprising moment that he really was guilty as accused. Rather than leave anything to doubt the film goes so far as to present the audience with a look at Freddy's box of souvenir polaroids. And with that any possibility of an interesting film much less futher interesting films goes out the window. Is he a tortured soul hurt by those he loved and in search of vengeance? No he is not... he's a slightly mincing pedophile an oddly Southern pedophile when he was alive no less because let us not forget that in Hollywood everyone from the South must be messed up in one way or another.I kept waiting at the end of the film for some hint some genuinely surprising moment wherein we discover that the school's principal was really responsible not Freddy at all. But it was not to be... Honestly I find it difficult to believe that any writer or director could conceive of such a clever idea and then deliberately discard it. It hurts to imagine much less to watch. It's just... sad. It's as though Casablanca ended with her getting back OFF the plane and running back into Rick's arms a chance at brilliance utterly discarded.More making him guilty renders the rest of the movie a lot less effective almost nonsensical. The darker tone of Freddy's world leaving out more fantastic dream imagery in favor of harsher more straightforward nightmares makes perfect sense if Freddy is innocent of the crimes for which he was murdered. It works as a representation of his anger just like his demeanor. Haley played it with a savage genuine anger as someone falsely accused. That performance only works if his anger was actually justified. The same is true of Freddy before his death  Haley played him as an genuinely caring man. I sincerely wonder if the decision to make him guilty was conceived at the last minute. That would explain a great deal as the whole tone of the film and the character's demeanor change radically right at the end. All the dialogue that comes after the revelation particularly that which explains his guilt and his motivation seems hasty and forced when compared to rest of the film. In the end if Freddy was guilty all along when one looks back over the film everything that had come before just doesn't work anymore. Not only does that destroy any rewatchability but it renders the whole film not just disappointing but actually bad.And with that the template is set for the new series of Nightmare films  sex pedophilia and predictability with any chance of creativity cast dismally aside. Well... here's hoping they reboot the series again in fifteen years' time. Until then remember creativity and Hollywood just don't mix.".

	schema:headline " Solid take on Freddy Krueger.";
	schema:reviewBody "I grew up as a kid watching all the Freddy movies. I thought Freddy was a whole lot cooler than Santa Claus and I thought he was a lot more interesting. They all have a special place in my heart. As the series went along Freddy became less scary. He wasn't scary like he was in the first two movies. He went from being a very scary very mean guy to just being a scary clown with more emphasis on the clown aspect. Then he was scary again in New Nightmare. And then he was somewhere in between in Freddy vs. Jason. Either way Englund was in top form in every single incarnation. So of course the first thing on everyone's mind is how in the hell will Jackie Earle Haley top what Englund has created. I asked myself that. I had hoped in the back of my mind that Jackie would do for Freddy what Heath Ledger did for The Joker. After watching this and liking Jackie I came to the conclusion that nobody no matter how good of an actor will ever top Robert Englund. Ever. Heath Ledger didn't top Jack Nicholson as the Joker because Heath Ledger simply was THE Joker. In a sense the role of Freddy is like the Joker it goes from simply trying to top an actor to just giving up and realizing that the original actor can't be topped in which case you simply have to make it different and make it your own. Which is probably what Haley did. It's like if someone were to try and top Ledger's Joker It wouldn't be possible so they just do the next best thing Make the character their own and give their own awesome take on it it might not live up to the original but it can still be a good performance. Simply put Robert Englund IS Freddy and the only thing another actor can do is simply give a different interpretation and make it a good alternative.I really liked Haley's take on Freddy Krueger and in all I really liked this take on Elm Street in general. In comparison to the other movies this one seems to have more weight it seems much meatier. It makes you think about things a lot more than the old movies did. They do this by giving Freddy a human side a back story. I'm sure people are all angry reading this thinking Humanizing Freddy what the hell what a disgrace blah blah blah LOL! He's not humanized in a cheap crappy way. Nothing about the character is really changed he's just explored more than he was in other movies. It's not like Rob Zombie's crappy Halloween movies where they show Michael as a child and therefore kill off whatever mystique Myers had and shed light on what he was like. The difference is that knowing Michael was human didn't change anything it was unnecessary. He was a different villain. Freddy on the other hand is a person he's human. His motivations his thought process everything about him that is pure evil is taken up another notch and is made a little more disturbing because you know that he is a man a very very evil man.This remake was really interesting to me because they made Freddy a really ambiguous character. Throughout the movie you're left wondering whether or not he's actually guilty of harming the children. During the first half it seems very likely that he was wrongly accused and during that same half you're left thinking that all of his killing might just be because he's legitimately angry and getting revenge on the kids that got him killed. Even though he's an awful person already you're still left thinking that maybe he was a good guy. He certainly seemed like a really good guy in the flashbacks. This ambiguity added an extra dynamic to the movie that the original didn't have.Now when you finally realize that Freddy WAS a really bad man that he really is sick enough to hurt children and then wanna kill them because they simply told the truth about him it makes the movie and Freddy himself much more interesting and a little creepier. When you're watching the flashbacks you're left thinking that he might've been a good guy but when you realize that he never was you're forced to realize that this seemingly good hearted guy was a very mean very awful and evil psychopath underneath it all. When you realize that he's relishing and enjoying killing all these kids now grownup just because they told on him it makes him a lot creepier and just completely different in comparison to the old movies. All the actors weren't really that terrible. Kyle Gallner is pretty cool and he's pretty awesome in most of the movies he's in. Thomas Dekker was pretty good I liked Rooney Mara as Nancy and Clancy Brown is always awesome in anything he's in. I liked all the actors. Of course people will complain that they're too pretty and modern looking but really all the people in the original were considered pretty and modern looking back then too. And also people seem to forget that the original movie didn't have the best acting either Englund was awesome though. Overall I really liked the movie. It could have EASILY turned out terrible. It's much better than the crappy sequels and it's a new take on Freddy and I really liked it. It doesn't tarnish the original it doesn't try to imply that the original was crap it's just a new take. I love how people condemn the idea of this but wouldn't object to a bad sequel. But that's just me. Go to the theater and judge for yourself. This is just my take my opinion. Score 8  out of 10.".

After watching this and liking Jackie I came to the conclusion that nobody no matter how good of an actor will ever top Robert Englund. Ever. Heath Ledger didn't top Jack Nicholson as the Joker because Heath Ledger simply was THE Joker. In a sense the role of Freddy is like the Joker it goes from simply trying to top an actor to just giving up and realizing that the original actor can't be topped in which case you simply have to make it different and make it your own. Which is probably what Haley did. It's like if someone were to try and top Ledger's Joker It wouldn't be possible so they just do the next best thing Make the character their own and give their own awesome take on it it might not live up to the original but it can still be a good performance. Simply put Robert Englund IS Freddy and the only thing another actor can do is simply give a different interpretation and make it a good alternative.I really liked Haley's take on Freddy Krueger and in all I really liked this take on Elm Street in general. In comparison to the other movies this one seems to have more weight it seems much meatier. It makes you think about things a lot more than the old movies did. They do this by giving Freddy a human side a back story. I'm sure people are all angry reading this thinking Humanizing Freddy what the hell what a disgrace blah blah blah LOL! He's not humanized in a cheap crappy way. Nothing about the character is really changed he's just explored more than he was in other movies. It's not like Rob Zombie's crappy Halloween movies where they show Michael as a child and therefore kill off whatever mystique Myers had and shed light on what he was like. The difference is that knowing Michael was human didn't change anything it was unnecessary. He was a different villain. Freddy on the other hand is a person he's human. His motivations his thought process everything about him that is pure evil is taken up another notch and is made a little more disturbing because you know that he is a man a very very evil man.This remake was really interesting to me because they made Freddy a really ambiguous character. Throughout the movie you're left wondering whether or not he's actually guilty of harming the children. During the first half it seems very likely that he was wrongly accused and during that same half you're left thinking that all of his killing might just be because he's legitimately angry and getting revenge on the kids that got him killed. Even though he's an awful person already you're still left thinking that maybe he was a good guy. He certainly seemed like a really good guy in the flashbacks. This ambiguity added an extra dynamic to the movie that the original didn't have.Now when you finally realize that Freddy WAS a really bad man that he really is sick enough to hurt children and then wanna kill them because they simply told the truth about him it makes the movie and Freddy himself much more interesting and a little creepier. When you're watching the flashbacks you're left thinking that he might've been a good guy but when you realize that he never was you're forced to realize that this seemingly good hearted guy was a very mean very awful and evil psychopath underneath it all. When you realize that he's relishing and enjoying killing all these kids now grownup just because they told on him it makes him a lot creepier and just completely different in comparison to the old movies. All the actors weren't really that terrible. Kyle Gallner is pretty cool and he's pretty awesome in most of the movies he's in. Thomas Dekker was pretty good I liked Rooney Mara as Nancy and Clancy Brown is always awesome in anything he's in. I liked all the actors. Of course people will complain that they're too pretty and modern looking but really all the people in the original were considered pretty and modern looking back then too. And also people seem to forget that the original movie didn't have the best acting either Englund was awesome though. Overall I really liked the movie. It could have EASILY turned out terrible. It's much better than the crappy sequels and it's a new take on Freddy and I really liked it. It doesn't tarnish the original it doesn't try to imply that the original was crap it's just a new take. I love how people condemn the idea of this but wouldn't object to a bad sequel. But that's just me. Go to the theater and judge for yourself. This is just my take my opinion. Score 8  out of 10.";

However this remake is not without its flaws...The Good The movie manages to be generally creepy I got the same feeling from this version of Freddy that I did from the original one a sort of uneasiness from his very presence. Some of the death scenes were really well done also. Kris's death like Tina's was executed very well. I found only one thing about the movie that was superior to the original and that was the suspense throughout the entire film unlike the original the remake had an element in it i.e. Micro naps that made Freddy capable of popping out at any given moment which was actually quite effective overall. The acting overall was not bad at all it wasn't amazing but it suits the movie.The Bad The movie doesn't start off slow instead of building up suspense it just takes a flying leap into the very basis of the movie. Over half of the times Freddy comes on screen it happens by way of the old sharp music and jump tactic which I found alright at first but it soon got kind of old and annoying to be honest. Two iconic elements from the first film were executed very poorly. The wall scene from the original was now a very poor CGI version I hated it and it was completely unnecessary to add it just for the sake of paying homage or whatever they intended on doing it just looked bad... then again I despise CGI with every fiber of my being. The tub scene was also poorly done it was simply his hand coming out of the water with again some sharp music to get the squeamish. I still don't care for Freddy's look in this movie even after having a very open mind about it however his voice far makes up for it.Overall this film is worth seeing I was a complete skeptic with low expectations going in and the movie managed to be very well done. Robert Englund will always be the true Freddy but I will accept this as a replacement. The Nightmare formula works to this day and is the scariest concept I have ever witnessed in a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street is a remakereimagining of Wes Craven's supernatural slasher classic about a group of teenagers being tormented by badly burned killer Fred Krueger in their dreams with wounds inflicted in said nightmares manifesting themselves in the real world.There's a good reason that as of the writing of this review this movie's average IMDb rating is smackbang in the middle a perfect 510. This is as much of a reimagining and re thinking of the series as Rob Zombie's Halloween was. Unlike the recent Friday the 13th A Nightmare on Elm Street has been taken back to the drawing board to it's very basic premise and rethought for 2010.To put it simply we're not looking at the same movie with modern day effects here. We're looking at Wes Craven's idea coupled with today's growing concern about paedophiles as well as what we now know about dreams insomnia and repressed memories. In fact until the end of the movie one might be lead to think that the characters are in fact being killed by their own repressed memories and not some kind of supernatural dreamkiller.Fans of the original will remember the intentional ambiguity of Freddy's past starting off as a child killer who got away with it killed by angry town folk taking the law into their own hands and becoming more and more bizarre as the series went on involving the strange circumstances of his conception and a lot of religious undertones. This time around Krueger's past is made a little more clear and this is what will make or break the movie for a lot of people. Many were upset by Rob Zombie's choice to explore Michael Myers' past in Halloween as they felt that a mysterious faceless enigma is scarier than somebody you know everything about.I beg to differ... The slasher genre has slowly become a parody of itself especially after the ingenious Scream quite literally stating all of the rules and clichs and even if we can block out their knowledge of the 'rules' the killer still often becomes the protagonist in our minds as we become more interested in how they will pick off the next dumb drunk teenager than who will survive.This is where Freddy's backstory comes in. Once you know what he is though still ambiguous through most of the movie it does start to become pretty clear eventually you will hate him fear him and most definitely root for the heroes of the picture. Freddy's backstory is more disturbing than the original version and things which Craven may have intended but never outright said come to light here.I will also tell you this  a newcomer to Freddy would probably do better watching this film than a hardcore fan of the original series. Firstly some of the strongest moments in this version are lifted straight out of the original but more importantly the story is told in a completely different way. Surprisingly this is not a teenage slasher flick. None of the stereotypes appear here  there's no token black guy no cheerleader no geeky dogooder girl  and there are no houseparties or scenes of characters getting drunk and sleeping with one another. In fact I don't recall any 'happy' scenes in at all since we begin the movie with all of the characters already affected by these nightmares.This in the long run leads the movie into much more of a mysteryhorror like The Ring where the primary concern of our remaining characters is staying alive and awake long enough to find out the truth and possibly shed some light on how to save themselves rather than who is going to die next. On the down side this does mean we have to spend the first twenty minutes trying to relate to the characters as they get stalked by night and attend funerals by day and it can be difficult to pick which to try and follow as they are slowly picked off. It pays off once the cast has been nicely 'pruned' though as the few remaining characters really hold your attention and there are none of the he just went in there on his own I can tell he's going to die moments.So how is Freddy? Robert Englund kept in the role for such a long time that it does become hard to imagine anybody else with the striped sweater and fingerblades but equally hard to imagine him becoming scary again after the 'wisecracker' character he became. If you ask me the only way to have truly brought back Freddy's terrifying nature from the original movie was to re cast and redesign him and that's exactly what has been done. Englund has been replaced by Jackie Earle Haley  that would be Rorschach from the brilliant Watchmen  and his makeup rather than being based on Englund's look is what in anybody's imagination a horribly burned murderer would look like. It will upset some fans but will scare newcomers in the same way that Englund did in the 70s. Makeup aside Jackie's acting is as usual brilliant both as burn victim Freddy and as the past Fred Krueger.I could go on all day about how anybody with an open mind should ignore all of the fanboy hatred but there is a 1000 word limit here. 'Elm Street recreates a brilliant idea from the 70s in a way that is relevant to 2010 and once again scary and believable. Like I will say about Rob Zombie's take on Halloween this is by far the scariest the series has been since the original movie and the perfect way to keep such a brilliant idea alive. As such it's probably better for newcomers but fans will smile at the number of references to the classics with character names and lines from movies all across the series even Freddy vs. Jason.".

She's great in action flicks I am a massive fan of the Resident Evil series! but I've always found that she goes a bit overboard when taking on dramatic or real life roles. I was more than pleasantly surprised when it dawned on me just how good a job she did on this film! Granted no one needed Oscar worthy acting to pull off their roles every actor in this film held their own. From beginning to end I was totally drawn in  both character and storywise. Sure you come across some clichs here and there but that's totally to be expected. The entire movie is cleverly put together and is sure to keep you guessing every step of the way. The characters are well developed the acting is great the scenery and cinematography are outstanding  some very inventive shots towards the climax of the film  and the story will definitely leave you with the feeling that it actually hasn't all been done before. Every person that has rated this movie low falls under one of two categories Either they missed an integral part of the story I watched the film twice just to make sure I was right about this or they have ludicrously high standards. Movies are by no means my life. I'm sure my rating of 8 is probably a bit biased for some reason this movie really did it for me on pretty much all fronts but any rating below a 7 in my humble opinion says more about a lack on the reviewer's end... not the film's.

	schema:reviewBody "A Perfect Getaway was nowhere near a perfect film but it was certainly a good film. The trailers made it out to be a much more nonstop action thriller than it really was showing the last 20 minutes. The majority of the film centers around paranoia. It is true though that the plot twist can be seen coming from a mile away but how it is delivered is where it succeeds. While I personally wasn't surprised how the twist was presented was quite original and chillinducing. I'll leave it at that. Where this film really succeeds is in the cinematography and acting both of which are superb. The locale is beautiful all the colors are vibrantly displayed and everything looks crisp. There are some scenes with intriguing camera work that works well to add intensity and be intuitive. All the actors really give it their best and create believable characters. Milla was good as usual but Zahn really surprised me. I never really gave him credit for how good of an actor he is until about now. Overall it's worth the watch and is ultimately very entertaining with wonderful characters.".

The reason is the way the story is structured in which apparently nothing happens in the first 45 minutes. For today's average 1834 audience this is almost intolerable as they are now conditioned to expect cheap CGI thrills and impossibly huge explosions in the first two minutes of the film not necessarily a bad thing BTW. What underrated DirectorWriter David Towhy is doing is actually putting your brain to work during the first two acts of the movie all the while enjoying some incredible visuals of the Hawaiian tropical rain forest. Towhy concentrates on subtle character development. The acting is good. Mila Jovovich and Timothy Oliphant are the two that carry the film throughout. All in all I have to say that Towhy put out a fairly plausible story here with none of the CGI generated hyperbole that we see so much of nowadays.".

If you spent the time to read a murder mystery and the murderer turned out to be some guy that wasn't introduced until the last page would you be feel satisfied or rippedoff? Unfortunately you can see the twist coming a mile away but frankly I didn't want to believe the talented David Twohey would stoop so low. Basically the first half shows numerous scenes with the ZahnJovovich couple wondering to themselves who the murderers are. Unless you are outright lying to the audience denying them the chance to figure it out these scenes clearly establish that ZahnJovovich are not the killers. Then comes the twist  they are in fact the killers and the filmmakers have been lying to you. Absolutely idiotic and a slap in the face to anyone who appreciates a wellcrafted movie. I'd rate this lower but for the good performances of the principal actors especially Oliphant. Rewatch The Usual Suspects instead.".

Halfway into their hike the two learn about the slaying of another newlywed couple on one of the neighboring islands. The killers? A man and woman. Soon after they encounter another couple on the trail Nick Timothy Olyphant and his girlfriend Gina Kiele Sanchez. The four continue on the trail as a group but it isn't long before Cliff and Cydney begin to suspect their new acquaintances of being the killers. There's also the shady hitchhikers Kale Chris Hemsworth and Cleo Marley Shelton looking particularly nice with braided hair who seem to be following them.While I was able to correctly guess the identity of the killer's just from watching the trailer I still had a great time with this. The performances are really strong. I've heard others say that Zahn and Jovovich aren't a believable pairing. I've seen several instances of stunning women with less attractive guys so that's nonsense. Aside from that they're terrific together. This is a dialogueheavy film with several amusing character moments thrown in all of which the actors nail. Olyphant is the standout as Nick a former marine with a bit of a screw loose. The humor actually works the quirkiness adding to the picture. I also thought that the BW exposition scene was welldone better than most of it's ilk. These types of scenes are generally frowned upon but here it winds up being a highlight.The Puerto Rican locations subbing for Hawaii are quite lovely though the dangers of the trail aren't played up as much as I'd expected. It isn't an element that's necessarily needed however as I found the film to be plenty suspenseful as is. The killers were obvious to me yes but the I was more caught up in the situations than the reveal. For instance the situation of the reveal made for a terrific moment. It's all in how it's done. While I could have done without the annoying screenwriter injokes they don't ruin the suspense either.I'd say that director David Twohy has more hits than misses and this clever slice of pulpy entertainment continues that trend.".

While driving to the spot they refuse to give a lift to the strange couple Kale Chris Hemsworth and Cleo Marley Shelton. Cliff and Cydney befriend the former marine Nick Timothy Olyphant in the trail and then they meet three girls that tell them that the police are chasing a man and a woman that had slaughtered a couple in honeymoon in Oahu removing their teeth and finger tips. Cliff and Cydney decide to go along with Nick and they meet his girlfriend Gina Kiele Sanchez that is camped in Secret Falls. The two couples decide to tag along to the beach together and along their journey they feel tense with possible stalkers until the police helicopter captures Kale and Cleo. But danger is still in the Kalalau Trail.A Perfect Getaway is a surprisingly great thriller with Steve Zahn performing an unusual role. The screenplay is excellent and the plot is very wellconstructed. When I finished watching the DVD I decided to watch the beginning again to find any possible plot hole but the dialogs are ambiguous and it is impossible to discover the identities of the killers. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Trilha The Trail".

But danger is still in the Kalalau Trail.A Perfect Getaway is a surprisingly great thriller with Steve Zahn performing an unusual role. The screenplay is excellent and the plot is very wellconstructed. When I finished watching the DVD I decided to watch the beginning again to find any possible plot hole but the dialogs are ambiguous and it is impossible to discover the identities of the killers. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Trilha The Trail";

	schema:headline " Trouble in Paradise";
	schema:reviewBody "In thinking about this movie it's worth remembering two great thrillers from the past. One is Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. In that film the first two scenes in the movie following the rooftop chase are major scenes that arm you with everything you need to figure out what's REALLY going on later in the story. They're loaded with information. Trouble is those scenes are likely to glide right by the viewer as they did with me because much of what happens seems inconsequential. It's not. The clues are all there. In Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation the peeping tomforhire Gene Hackman spying on a couple is certain he's figured out what's going on but he's undone by not realizing that something said can have different meanings depending on HOW it's said.A Perfect Getaway merrily leads you down the garden path so to speak by fulfilling all your expectations then turning the table on them. You're practically tripping over the clues but because you're looking at the wrong things or looking at things the wrong way you might miss them. This movie is so smart so wellmade and such a tease that it's absolutely exhilarating. No I didn't see what was coming but I was having fun and I felt safe in writerdirector David Twohy's hands  I sensed that he wouldn't let me down. I'm a big fan of Twohy's delightful 1996 sciencefiction thriller The Arrival. This movie is as much a psychological thriller as the two movies I mentioned off the top and is as seemingly slowmoving and deliberatelypaced but it requires the audience's full attention. The climax is a wild ride with inspired editing and camerawork and the flashback sequence is a remarkable piece of exposition. The movie thankfully is NOT a slasher flick. The story is mostly characterdriven. It's about a murderous couple on the loose in Hawaii slicing up innocent honeymooners but what really drives the story is the competition between the leading males two bulls locking horns  Steve Zahn's pitifully inadequate doofus versus Timothy Olyphant's macho and endowed American jedi whose insouciant swagger and flip insults Here kitty kitty kitty. are a constant thorn in Zahn's side. The women's parts are just as well written as the men's and each woman has her own reason for latching onto her man. I love the idea of loving you is Zahn's pathetic reply to his partner's Milla Jovovich request for an expression of affection. Their relationship is a lot more dysfunctional than we at first realize. I really enjoyed watching Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez together there is such openness in their faces and chemistry between them. The screenplay is loaded with wit and I suspect that all the references to screen writing are a jab at what usually passes for scripts in Hollywood in general and this type of movie in particular. It has genuine suspense great performances and breathtaking cinematography. A welcome breath of fresh air.I watched this movie a second time to see how the details of the whodunnit aspect of the story were managed and I ended up enjoying the movie and admiring the screenplay and the direction even more. The script is very imaginative and economical in the way it handles small details and uses them to enrich the story. Small things such as the bug in the bottle the rings and the operation of the camera Just point and shoot? ripple through the story. Olyphant's line to Zahn Maybe you should change your story is a double entendre that made me laugh this time around. Twohy makes absolutely certain that we are always aware of the geography of each scene. The crucial props  knife axe gun camera  are in place and we always know where each character is and if one of them suddenly looms out of nowhere we know why it is logical. The Big Twist whether you guessed it or not is thrilling in the way it gathers all the threads of the story together. The craftsmanship and artistry that went into this movie elevates it way above its schlock Bmovie origins.".

	schema:headline " Good Thriller with Questionable Twists";
	schema:reviewBody "Perfect Getaway A 2009  out of 4The old dark house genre was made famous back in the silent days as we'd get a group of people in one house with the idea that one of them is a killer. That basic idea continues with this film although instead of a house we're treated the beautiful locations of Hawaii. A newlywed couple Steve Zahn Milla Jovovich are on their honeymoon in Hawaii and decide to go on an eleven mile hike. Half way through the hike they learn that another newlywed couple were butchered. The film then has our couple meeting two other couples Timothy OlyphantKiele Sanchez Marley Shelton Chris Hemsworth with the possibility that one of them are the murderers. This 97minute movie is pure buildup for the final ten minutes when the twist is revealed. I certainly won't reveal the twist but I must say I was somewhat letdown by it but not enough to really enjoy the film. This is the type of movie that gives you a rather simple idea and then works every little inch out of it and in the end we're left with a pretty tense little thriller that is sadly being marketed as a horror movie which might keep some people away. The film benefits from the great locations terrific acting and some nice direction. All six leads do a terrific job and it was great seeing someone like Zahn get the leading role. He's basically played supporting roles most of his career but he has no problem carrying the film here. He and Jovovich have great chemistry together and work well with the other cast members. Olyphant clearly steals the film as the exsoldier who is hiding a few secrets of his own. Another very positive thing about this film is that the majority of it takes place during the daylight so there's nothing jumping out of the shadows at night. I think it's brave to try and build suspense during the day but the director pulls it off perfectly. The 2.351 aspect ratio picks up the entire beauty of the island which really becomes a character all by itself. The film is up for a lot of debate over the twists and turns it takes which is good. Discussion never hurts a movie and I'm sure people will be discussing what happens here. I personally found it to be a cheat but a lot of thrillers do this. No matter how one feels about the twists there's really no denying that there's still a lot of fun and tension building up to the final moments.".

Those bonds that the actors created gave more tension because you could feel the love they had for each other being threatened which added a higher stake to fight for. The movie really grabs you and sucks you in to this world that is so screwed up and full of deceit that the fear you feel is just unparalleled to anything that you could've expected when picking a action movie to watch. The final thing that I really enjoyed was the story. The story of the movie is half of what makes a good film a good film. This movie has a story that was fresh and new and exciting. I was really excited to watch this and was even more glad when it lived up to my expectations.CONSThis movie is so close to being 55. The only thing that is holding it back is the ending.

Reading other reviews I noticed that many people think that the first half of the movie and the second half are inconsistent. However if you watch the movie again you can see that it is not. Watching it a first time the film makes the audience believe that Zahn and Jovovich are worried that the other people are the killers. Watching it again you can actually tell that Zahn and Jovovich are actually just worried that they are going to get caught. And they also might just be worried because they are intimidated by Olyphant. That is what makes this movie very well planned in my opinion. It is never completely set in stone that Zahn and Jovovich are the killers it only makes the audience think that by the way they word their conversations. Watching it again with the knowledge of the ending you can put things together and realize that there is a completely different conversation going on you just do not know it yet. I think this film was such a good mystery movie and really made you think. The acting was great and so was the cinematography. It is definitely at the top of my list for awesome movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah thrillers the genre that can either hit or miss because of it's wonderful twist endings. Now when I saw the trailer for A Perfect Getaway I have to admit that I was intrigued the advertisement said that it had a great twist ending and for fun my boyfriend and I always like to go to these movies and try to see who can guess what the ending is whoever guesses first and correctly will buy dinner lol. So I happened to be right on this one well we both did we pretty much figured out from the beginning even though the director was trying to be sly about the whole thing but never since The Perfect Stranger with Halle Berry and Bruce Willis have I seen such a pathetic twist ending. This is one of those movies that is the let's have a twist ending because we can while I would have been perfectly happy if this was just an average thrillerhorror movie. Instead we don't get the best from the actors and a very silly movie.A young couple Cliff and Cydney are celebrating their honeymoon by hiking to a remote beach in Hawaii. The couple comes across two hitchhikers Cleo and Kale and a group of frightened hikers discussing a double murder in Honolulu of another newlywed couple on the island with the victims having their teeth pulled out and they begin to question whether they should turn back. Unsure whether to stay or flee Cliff and Cydney join up with another couple Nick who claims to have a titanium plate in his head and be a former special forces operative and his longtime girlfriend Gina a former butcher. Far from civilization or rescue everyone begins to look like a threat and nobody knows whom to trust. They later see Cleo and Kale getting arrested under the suspicion of murder. Gina and Cydney reveal that each thought that the others were the killers and the group continues to the beach. Even though everything seems to be in the clear things are not always as they seem.A Perfect Getaway is seriously a ridicules movie that made no sense whatsoever even with the ending being that Cliff and Cydney are the killers why the heck in the beginning when we the audience are trying to figure out who the killers are we get friggin' obvious Bonnie and Clyde type of girl and guy who are not too subtle on the we are the killers look. So it's like pointing out the typical creepy janitor in horror movies you know that they're not the killers and then you have Cliff and Cydney who are talking about the other couple being the killers and it makes no sense. In fact neither does this paragraph this movie has me so confused lol. But point being A Perfect Getaway was a waste of time and money. I strongly recommend you stay away form it it was pretty lame.210".

When I 1st viewed it on Sunday with my gf although I throughly enjoyed the movie..I was like but this twist does not make any sense. Then on viewing it a 2nd time I got it!..not that it was that hard to get in the 1st place BUT in can be easy for someone in the heat of the moment to miss the logic! It is a given that Cliff  Cydney were planning on killing Nicko  Gina  stealing their identities.. if you focus on the flashbacks properly you can clearly see that all the conversations they had that sounded as if they were trying to figure out if Nicko  Gina were the killers was really about...1Them assessing the amount of difficulty they would have to go through in killing this unexpectedly resourceful  streetsurvival smart couple...2Them contemplating not going through with it because of the fear of failing  possibly getting killed themselves cause they barked up the wrong tree...remember the 2 parts in the movie when Nicko gives them stories of him surviving some impossible situations  his loving gf Gina playfully says that he's hard to kill? Look at the way Cliff  Cyndey look at each other...upon seeing those 2 scenes at 1st the viewer tends to think that look they give each other means OH NO they might be the killers!...when it really in fact means DAMN IT!..is this guy for real?? I think we may have bitten off a little more than we can chew this time! 3Them not getting figured out by Nicko  Gina..like when Cliff shows Cydney the picture on his phone that the authorities have of them departing their latest crime scene  she says to him that could be anybody while nervously glancing in Nicko  Gina's direction. The twist is pretty brilliant actually  it's not that the filmmakers were trying to lie to the audience like some not too bright people that left all these negative comments suggested. At the end of the day this film is great...the filming locations were beautifulthe acting was quite good especially Timothy Olyphant's character! the twist was excellent. All the people that have these silly negative comments about the twist should just give up on watching good movies! My opinion on this extremely entertaining thriller is that it was a top notch effort! 10 out of 10 stars!".

In the first half we have this newly weds on honeymoon and they are in Hawaii sightseeing tracking and exploring the natural beauty. Soon they find out that there have been murders going on targeting couples on the island. Meanwhile they meet with another couple an ex war vet and a girl who can skin a goat without blinking an eye and our weds start to suspect that this odd couple might actually be the wanted killers.Note This Part Reveals Important Information About The Movie I am wondering if the writer is also on that crystal he kept showing in his movie. Now how the hell Jovovic and Zach could be the killers all along when they secretly discuss one on one conversation if the other couple may be the killers? Wth???1 Why would they panic about the recent murders and get scared if they were the ones who have done it??2 Why the hell Zach told Milla that they have to play this along without letting the other couple realize that they are scared off of them so that everybody could complete the tracking alive??3 Why did Zach work his butt off to get a signal to get information about the recent news on the internet?4 Why the hell would he get so worked up thinking the hitch hikers were close and attack the permit guy with an Axe thinking he was hitch hiker guy???5 Why would he be scared about the security camera footage and show it to Milla being very scared and arguing with her that the other couple look like them?? Wth????6 If Zach and Milla are really the killers then why were they also scared off the hitch hikers to not give them a ride? I mean if you are a bad ass psychopath then why would some tattooed six pack guy would intimidate you???None of these make sense at all. These are all act I and act II. Act III is completely the opposite as if it was just written by somebody else. People who think these are not inconsistencies are as high as the writer himself. I had to watch this crap so that the writer can insult my intelligence?? Huh what a horse crap. Absolutely ridiculous.If you want to feel like insulted then go ahead and watch this pile of mess. If not a re run of Se7en or Identity is recommended.Completely garbage. Awful!210".

The movie begins slowly and carefully while at the same time building necessary suspense. There are several twists and turns throughout that keep you guessing until the opportune moment when it quickens pace and really grabs the viewer. When everything comes together it does so in a smooth and interesting fashion. The only criticism would be an acceptable yet somewhat uncreative final ten minutes. However that weakness does not take very much away from the quality of the film. In summary A Perfect Getaway is a fresh 97 minutes that is highly recommended. Enjoy!".

Instead of being given before he kills someone in his custody a desk job Simms is put on the case of the vigilante child sex abusers killings which he's very much the vigilante's actions in favor of. It's very obvious from the start that both the citizens of Austin as well members of the Austin Police Department are the least interested in capturing the vigilante in that he's cleaning up the streets of the city of dangerous sex offenders. This becomes very clear when a very reluctant Simms is given Daphne Jocelyn Joey Lauren Adams as his partner in finding and arresting the vigilante. Having been working in traffic court giving out parking tickets a major criminal case like this is usually given to a much more experienced cop who handlers homicides and kidnappings then a green rookie as well as ticket writer like Daphne is! Which shows how unconcerned the higher ups in the police department are in catching the vigilante.Later Cutter in his trying to kidnap little Brianna Joanne McCray in a local park is confronted by the masked vigilante who quickly with his expertise of the martial arts puts him away with a cracked skull and a few broken bones. It's at Cutter's arraignment that two unexpected things happen. Simms trying to take the law into is own handsJack Rubystyle and gun Cutter down on the steps of Hall of Justice is beaten to the punch by the vigilante! The vigilante hiding on a garage roof overlooking the Hall of Justice puts a high powered bullet through Cutterbulletproof vest and allbefore Simms could even get off a single shot!The rest of the movie has you guessing just who this vigilante is who after icing Cutter escaped from being captured by Simms' partner Officer RolandBrian MaNamara with what seems like something a flying teaser straight out of Batmans's famed utility belt! Soon the vigilante angle of the movie starts to get a bit tiring in that he's able to pick up police radio calls from what looks like his stateoftheart control center that puts him a step ahead of the police who like Officer Simms are not at all interested in capturing him.SPOILER It's only when Simm's daughter Cassie is later kidnapped that the film after almost putting you to sleep again becomes interesting! You know that Cassie's kidnapper can't be the late John Cutter who earlier murder her mom as he unsuccessfully tried to kidnap her so who in blazes can he be! It takes Officer Joceyn and the vigilante who's listening in on her radio calls to figure out who Cassie's kidnapper is. He turns out to be someone who has very close connections to not only Simms  Joceyn but to the late John Cutter himself! And that sets up the movies unbelievable final sequence where the mysterious vigilante's identity is reviled but also which is far more surprising how totally impossible in the condition he's in he could have pulled off what he did all throughout the entire movie!".

A little bloody for me at times but a well done indie movie. It was good to see Mimi Rogers in such a powerful role. And glad to see Joey Lauren Adams on film again. She makes it believable that her character has to overcome past problems and current antifemale cop male officers in order to prove herself capable of doing her job.".

A little bloody for me at times but a well done indie movie. It was good to see Mimi Rogers in such a powerful role. And glad to see Joey Lauren Adams on film again. She makes it believable that her character has to overcome past problems and current antifemale cop male officers in order to prove herself capable of doing her job.";

It may leave permanent scars in your mind that will ruin some of the best experiences of your life such as witnessing the birth of your child or lying in bed caressing a son's hair.

Unfortunately I can only go down to 1 so...First off let me start by saying that I'm not a faint of heart kind of guy...and I can actually enjoy disgusting films. Take for example Martyrs it's a disturbing film but has some weird mysticism to it that makes it good and enjoyable. Or The Human Centipede awful movie but it has such a twisted sense of humor that by the end you're thinking gross! and at the same time hilarious!.But this...this...whatever they want to call it... this is some youshouldbeinArkhamAsylum type of film.Yeah I know that there's a lot of pseudophilosophical criticism out there trying to explain that the underlying theme of society's moral decay and human corruption is somewhere around this thing...but I'm NOT one of those critics.I think this is garbage. Pure and utter TRASH. I think this does NOT have any social commentary and it's only an insult to any sane person. This is one of the worst things I have ever seen. And I've seen some really twisted things in my life. This isn't art. It's disgusting revolting nauseating stomachturning appalling abominable vile nasty foul loathsome offensive distasteful putrid ghastly and horrid...and I'm being nice.I'm not gonna mention any particular scene but just let me tell you that as a man husband father and human being...there's just NO EXCUSE to do some of the seriously objectionable things they did in this atrocity. And I'm not blaming the actors. I'm just saying that the writerdirector Aleksandar Radivojevic should be in a mental institution. This guy only made 2 movies well 3...but the other one was produced by Luc Besson so he couldn't move freely in that one. Thank God this sickening piece of crap...and another one about a guy that gets hired to film A SNUFF FILM. See the resemblance? It's obvious that Radivojevic has a snuff fetish. He makes movies trying to sell them as artistic work...but deep down he's only a very sick puppy just trying to satisfy his hunger for extreme violence and unacceptable behavior.If you have any amount of good taste you should stay away from A Serbian Film like I hope you would stay away from child pornography or an execution video. And yes this film has comparable features with those two aberrant things. It's not that graphic...but it doesn't need to be. If I show you a dog and then I go to the next room and you hear banging sounds and 10 minutes of the most awful howling and animal cries and see blood splattering all over it...I'm almost as guilty as a psychopath showing you the actual torture and killing of a dog. That's not the same as showing you the dog and then going next door...hearing BAM! and then seeing me coming out of it all bloody. Get the picture yet?Do yourself a favor...and don't watch this. There's no redeemable factor in it. Nothing memorable. No well at least x was good.If you're trying to waste your time go watch some of the Porky's movies instead. They are AcademyAward pieces compared to this one.There's just no way you can enjoy something as hideous as this film...and some of its content will haunt you for a long time.".

It doesn't necessarily make it a good film although it is  admittedly well shot and well acted.  It almost reminded me of seeing footage of beheadings on the internet.  It's supposed to be profound in some way but ultimately it is just  irredeemable pain and destruction and contains no social commentary at  all.  Realistic torture and extremely graphic rape scenes usually make a  negative impact on the viewer because they are horrific and unpleasant  subjects. Using babies and children does not make it artistic  independent of your cultural origins  although some people claim that  it is art.

It doesn't make any  difference whatsoever. Subgenres come and go and the recent tide of  shocking torture films are more akin to a test of the viewer's resolve  than the slices of entertainment they used to be.

One of my top films of all time Cannibal Holocaust is a film that is considered a shock film but it's more than just a film with shock scenes as the ending challenges the viewer to question our corrupt morals nowadays. A Serbian Film does not do that at all it exists only to subject its viewer to ugly vile and repugnant stuff that would make the Saw movies look like a teddy bear's picnic.A Serbian Film follows Milos an ageing porn star who has taken a bit of a break from the biz live a nice life at home with his lovely wife a translator and his son who is enrolled in singing classes. One day he is called to lunch where he is offered a chance at redemption a new porn film. His agent has not much info since the company prefers to keep its details secret which leads him to question if he should do it or not. After his wife pushes a few buttons he reluctantly agrees to star in the film and gets good and ready for the shoot.But things don't sound right for starters the man in charge seems to be a little sinister and the moment the shoot starts things don't seem right. The shoot is taking place in an abandoned children's hospital and the whole atmosphere is creepy and disturbing. The situations involved are some of the weirdest he's ever seen. After an oral sex shooting day he slowly begins to figure something is wrong with the shoot. It isn't until a nightmare he has and an unpleasant shooting day where he finally decides to to leave the shoot for good. His decision is final after he is shown a video of a newborn infant being penetrated which the director calls newborn porn. Then from there things get worse as he finds out he has done sick things unconsciously after waking up with no memory.If you felt uncomfortable reading the second paragraph of the synopsis I don't blame you I felt uncomfortable typing it. I decided not to type the rest of what happens since there is absolutely no need to mention such disgusting demoralizing and repugnant content. I'm sure most of the other reviews on here have done the deed and without a doubt this film disturb even the toughest and most macho.I can't come down on the film too hard though because I'd be lying if I said it wasn't well done. The cinematography is well done and there are some nice dark and creepy moments here. The acting is pretty good especially from Milos and that's where it stops. It's too bad a good concept got wasted on sacrifice of good storyline for sick disgusting and shocking moments. This takes up half of the film and is just unnecessary and absolutely demoralizing. Likelihood I'll ever watch this movie again? Definitely never.To quote Ain'titCoolNews' review of Chaos Why do we need this st anyways?".

Some have described it as fascinating and mildblowing and others have called it torture trash. I was warned about it beforehand but I like to challenge myself once in a while. Now I can watch movies like 'Feed' and 'Irreverible' and be shaken and admired by them.However I have mixed opinions about 'Srpski Film' a.k.a. 'A Serbian Film'. Initially the film does succeed in portraying that people are fascinated about taboo subjects and how they are easily hypnotized by it even if it's bad to dolook at. However at some point nothing is left to suggestion. It incorporates as much taboo elements as it can such as various forms of rape newborn porn bestiality intrafamily rape pederasty paedophilia fellating someone to death necrophilia snuff films aiming to push boundaries and mashes them into gratuitous hardcore scenes.The director was aiming for shock value which is expected in this kind of film and most likely he was vouching for a place in the Guinness book for 'most disturbing legitimate film' of all time. The writer has been quoted to say This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government... It's about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotize you to do things you don't want to do. You have to feel the violence to know what it's about. What a clever way to use politics to defend an extreme fake pornpolished snufftortureflick.On the technical side 'Srpski Film' is very well made. The cinematography light effect and music are very effective in creating the atmosphere. The acting is also very good. Sran Todorovi does a fine job as retired pornstar Milo. Sergej Trifunovi does tend to be over the top to the point of being a caricature but that was perhaps the intention.This is not the kind of movie that I would revisit.

Now I have to say NONE are as nasty as this beast!Im not going to say what happens in the film but even for me some was hard to watch. BUT the actual film is GOOD!...If you can get through it.The basic story is about a guy called Milos who is a retired porn star who in his day was the best actor in the business. Now he is a bit skint so when he gets offered one last job offering him enough money to set him and his family up for life he just can't turn it down. He asks what the film is about but the employer is reluctant to tell.....what happens is indescribable!!! Like I said it is very hard to watch in some scenes but the film is actually really good and the acting is solid throughout.You got to think the poorer European countries are rife with crime and money goes a long way. So if you are having hard times and a massive money offer comes your way...How far would you go!For me 810 but I can't recommend it simply for the content in the film. But if you think you can take it and can appreciate it for the film it is go for it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I first watched A Serbian Film uncut once online and then after that it was removed from the site it was on which was a good job considering the site is very popular and has an under 1821 audience. Was I shocked by it? No. Did I find it interesting or thoughtprovoking? Not at all. Am I a lover of a horror films? You bet. So now you must be wondering well why did I watch A Serbian Film knowing what it was about then come on here and give it a bum rap. Well. I heard of it through friends and websites and being a lover of horror movies and a fan that likes to have seen it all I obviously was going to watch A Serbian Film sooner or later. First of don't get me wrong it's not the violence in this movie that makes me dislike it it's how they tried to be so over the top about it and in doing so it makes it look like a futile piece of crap. Not including the film's so called political statement that is really only a guise for it to show its cheap scenes.Apparently the movie is meant to show or well be an allegory as to how Serbian people are forced into doing things am I getting this right or what? How their Government is meant to be controlling  how violent Serbia is? But all I seen was rape after rape in this so called movie that is trying to make this important political statement but we know underneath that's just a guise for its cheap exploitative purpose. For those who don't know A Serbian Film is about this guy called Milos a retired porn star who is lured out into a black market porn industry with an offer for money. He has no idea what he will be doing until he agrees to it and thus the film begins there. Milos is dragged into various acts of sexual torture and violence. But as with most of the violence in the movie it's over the top and obviously makes it look cheap and flawed.Sure I ain't gonna lie it's reasonably realistic except the fake penis but it's just one of those films were it has been so overly done it's poor and the real purpose behind it is made clear in that. Of course the film seems to have gained a backing now of everyone that thinks it's the most violent movie in history. Well it sure has a good attempt at this but no it's not.August Underground's Mordum does a far better job and at least it's not trying to hide its exploitative purpose like this movie tries its hardest at. A Serbian Film in my opinion is not a statement about anything. It's just another over the top exploitation film which might have gotten a higher rating from me if the people who made it didn't make a guise for the over the top scenes in it which is exploitative.There's one DVD release of it to date and it's a UK release. It's not uncut and I don't suspect it will be uncut for a long long time. If you like violence sure give it a go but please don't be fooled into this whole allegory about Serbia  it's just another exploitation film.".

	schema:headline " A milestone for pulp cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "First I want to say that I disagree with everyone who argues that this movie is simply made for explicit shock value with no other purpose. I can quarrel this with two simple points 1. I am a male porn performer myself and immediately found there to be a handful of real concepts thoughts and fears to relate with Milos on within the first fifteen minutes of the film desensitization your position in a family setting as a pornographer to take the job or not to take the job etc. Now I'm sorry if you have no way of grasping that he is a realistic and admirable character in believable shoes but he is. The level of relation I found with Milos shocked and impressed me and made me wonder if either that screenwriter had had some personal experience as a porn performer in the past or instead was just a really intelligent person who was able to grasp it without actually experiencing it.2. People like this actually do exist! Snuff is not a fictional concept. There are people that are this sick out there  and involving massive sums of money and pornographers does not seem far off at all. If it weren't for people who took the time to make films like this for us how would we be aware of the twisted possibilities of what could happen to us if we're not too careful? On top of these opening defense statements there are a bundle of things that make this a fantastic film.First of all the cinematography  the look they got in post  the editing  it all looks stellar tasteful and comes off as being done by true inspired professionals. This is probably the best looking and feeling film that exists that could be considered anything even nearing the torture porn subgenre. While I would never call this a straightup torture porn film it certainly does feel similar when it delves into it's scenes of sex and violence with SM tones  that's putting it lightly... I would never call this a horror film either. It's FAR too human and psychological to me to be categorized in a genre that has become so stale and brainless. If anything what separates it from most torture porn is that it's torturing your brain not just your eyes by seeing prolonged sadistic violence on it's own. There's a lot more to this. It's more like psychtorture.I also found the performances to be perfect for this film. Milos of course steals the show seesawing between the calm likable man he is and the primal beast he becomes when working. Marko was also another standout with his performance  very discomforting with his bitterness towards Milos and his uncontrollable lust for Milos's beautiful wife. While Vukmir and his henchmen were the cheesiest they still filled their shoes very effectively. Majority of the female characters didn't have much personality but I believe that was on purpose to go along with the mentality of pornography  and I found it very effective and dreamlike or nightmarish. I couldn't believe how many stunning women they found to cast for such an intense film  it only adds to it's surrealism.The score was impressive as well. Hard hitting abrasive electronic beats almost comparable to a score like that of The Social Network  and just as good. It made me feel even more engaged in the film and the character than I already was beforehand.Now I know a lot of people can't handle explicit gore  but the artificial violence itself is a masterful art on it's own! To create an artificial scene of violence and make it believable and effective is a mighty task! And this movie is chock FULL of gutwrenching ultraviolence! This is something that deserves recognition praise... even awards. It's not an easy game kids! I would love to go into detailed descriptions of the groundbreaking scenes but I'll leave that to everyone else. I've looked through this message board and it's just chock full of spoilers. I'll just say that all the violence is extremely disturbing and realistic and thus it's very impressive.Now I admit that I laughed plenty of times as an instinctual defense mechanism in reaction to some of the most overthetop sequences. What else can I do as a human being? You feel disgusted or you laugh. It's one or the other. If it were real  I would certainly not be laughing but it's not  it's a effective emulation of what in reality would be ultimate horror. Because it's SO shocking and effective I laugh because I can't believe they pulled it off  or took my brain to this new place it hadn't been before. THAT is something to admire.I would never tell anyone to watch this movie. But I will tell you that it is absolutely a masterpiece of it's own kind. Pulp cinema if I had to call it anything so broad. A lot of people say they will never watch it again. Now although it scarred me  I don't think I'm going to lock it up and swallow the key. It's too good to never watch again. But it will be a long long long time before I do again... Unless I have a sick friend who just wants to watch it WITH me THAT bad.I'd give it a 10 which it very well probably does deserve in the long run but I just can't bring myself to do it.".

It made me feel even more engaged in the film and the character than I already was beforehand.Now I know a lot of people can't handle explicit gore  but the artificial violence itself is a masterful art on it's own! To create an artificial scene of violence and make it believable and effective is a mighty task! And this movie is chock FULL of gutwrenching ultraviolence! This is something that deserves recognition praise... even awards. It's not an easy game kids! I would love to go into detailed descriptions of the groundbreaking scenes but I'll leave that to everyone else. I've looked through this message board and it's just chock full of spoilers. I'll just say that all the violence is extremely disturbing and realistic and thus it's very impressive.Now I admit that I laughed plenty of times as an instinctual defense mechanism in reaction to some of the most overthetop sequences. What else can I do as a human being? You feel disgusted or you laugh. It's one or the other. If it were real  I would certainly not be laughing but it's not  it's a effective emulation of what in reality would be ultimate horror. Because it's SO shocking and effective I laugh because I can't believe they pulled it off  or took my brain to this new place it hadn't been before. THAT is something to admire.I would never tell anyone to watch this movie. But I will tell you that it is absolutely a masterpiece of it's own kind. Pulp cinema if I had to call it anything so broad. A lot of people say they will never watch it again. Now although it scarred me  I don't think I'm going to lock it up and swallow the key. It's too good to never watch again. But it will be a long long long time before I do again... Unless I have a sick friend who just wants to watch it WITH me THAT bad.I'd give it a 10 which it very well probably does deserve in the long run but I just can't bring myself to do it.";

	schema:headline " Transgressive shock cinema at it's best";
	schema:reviewBody "A Serbian Film tells the terrible story of a retired adult film actor named Milos who gets far more than he bargained for when he accepts what he is led to believe is the role of a lifetime. His intentions are valiant. He needs the money so that he can leave the troubled country of Serbia and start a new life with his wife and his young son. He accepts the job based on the intriguing premise of what film director Vukmir tells him. It's a reality based pornographic art film in which Milos is supposed to instead act off of the reality of the situations he's brought into. However things begin to get too weird when the reality begins to incorporate some sort of strange revenge fantasy. He tells Vukmir that he's backing out of the project and has no interest in continuing. Immediately following his declining however his life becomes a living nightmare of extremely depraved proportions.A Serbian Film is easily the most disturbing film I have ever seen alongside Schindler's Listthe Academy Award winning Holocaust picture and Threadsthe BBC mockumentary about Nuclear war. This is a deeply troubling film and it left me feeling a great sadness and frustration. Part of what makes this film so emotional and devastating is the heavy and I do mean HEAVY exposition that makes up the entire first half of the film. We see the family that Milos has and we as the audience cannot help but admire how far he has come. He and his family may be poverty stricken but they have as normal a life as a family like that can have. The wife is a nonjudgmental unassuming mostly pleasant person who is faithful to Milos and doesn't fret at the fact that his profession of choice is what he is most known for in other circles. The son is as gentlenatured as a boy like that can be and aside from viewing one of his father's films in the opening of the film is completely normal and healthy. Then there's the brother of Milos whom we only meet a few times and each time he seems like a sleazy jealous and unpleasant man. He is also a police officer but he seems most distracted by Milos and his wife in particular. He has an unhealthy fascination with his family. Vukmir seems most suspicious out of everyone but doesn't seem too crazy. He seems more eccentric but that's true of a lot of filmmakers. The film takes it's time showing all these characters as fully rounded people who all have their little personality traits and their own agendas. As a horror film it works wonderfully due to the suspense of the picture. It has a more classical way of plot development and depicting how it all comes together. A good chunk of the film is told in hyper real flashback and so the audience spends a good amount of time wondering what the heck is going on and fearing the worst. I like how this film shows events. I like how the film also shows perspective when it comes to what happens. I think one of the more effective parts of this film comes toward the end when it suddenly dawns on us that this story is not going to have the usual horror film ending. This film's way of depicting tragedy is really interesting because it relies more on personal torment and frustration in order to bring the audience into the situation that Milos has undergone and is still going through. It's a tricky technique but somehow is works. It especially works when the film finally makes it's biggest revelation which is just terrible and deeply heartbreaking and then the horror doesn't stop there. What works the most about all this however is how unabashed and how bizarre and offthewall the nature of reality becomes as the film progresses. Director Srdjan Spasojevic creates such a chaotic world that we get involved in and we the audience are led to believe that anything horrible and depraved could happen at any moment and there will be no limits.This film in terms of transgressive cinema that includes films such as Ex Drummer Irreversible Inside Martyrs and Possession A Serbian Film is one of the best of it's kind. It's also one of the most effective films I've seen in years as well as one of the scariest. It's also disheartening frustrating and cruel. One thing I can definitely say though is that it's not gratuitous. It's beautifully made it's heartbreakingly tragic it's terribly realistic and it's one of the most effective and well made films as well as one of the most disturbing. The big question is does it work? Yes it works. It works a little too well but it works. So do I fault it for working? No. I praise it. I'm glad that films like this can still be made and I'm glad that filmmakers have the balls to go all the way with their vision. Inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock Brian De Palma David Cronenberg and William Friedkin this is Srdjan Spasojevic's first film and I think a lot of Hollywood horror filmmakers could learn a thing or two from him. It's the most disturbing film I've ever seen and I don't regret watching it for even a second.".

I'm not nationalist but I do love my country and merging any word that defines Serbia Serbians or else with this sick despicable garbage is smack in a face to all Serbian citizens.I don't believe in violence hate or censorship for that mater but this is such a piece of scum lowlife garbage that director and main actors in this movie deserve jail time.This is legalized pedophilia and rape commercial free of charge for all sick bastards of the world. Enjoy you sick bastards. Hope you all rote in hell if such place exist if not it should be invented for people who like this kind of art. But enough about content.Something about political agenda of this movie. The director and screenwriter are the worst in Serbian cultural establishment yes they are establishment and once more this kind of people are prepared to do anything with extreme sleaziness to crawl they way into what they think is main opinion about Serbia today in western public and cultural critics so they can elevate oneself to European cultural level so they can start thinking about self as relevant. They are familiar with tactics how to blend into conventional opinion about anything... Fetch any bone that western critics give them out of pity for gore they presented to public. Little more dirt on Serbia good thats good..now little more. Good doggy. Bunch of slime bags. But this is not Serbia it has nothing to do with Serbia. If you want to know more about Serbia and our problems go and watch movie called ianje Eng.Skinning or Sisanje 2010. Now there is good movie about cultural post war Serbia deprivation of youth and human metamorphoses. It's not easy to emotionally process but it is the truth about our society.".

I've seen very very horridweird stuff like Aftermath Nekromantik or other vaguely offensive movies but this one takes the cake. I wont say it's good good being an adjective not once approximately insinuated in the film but I can't say its bad hence the 5. I'll take it for granted that people reading this review are well aware of the plot so I won't go through writing about it. Worst thing about this film is that it's very well produced. Sure looks like this endeavor got a very comfortable budget and all the people involved are professionals. The latter parts of the movie that aren't sunk in darkness are somewhat beautiful. If you don't listen to the dialog or anything that happens on screen there is about a total of 15mns worth of normal exchanges and heartfelt relationships throughout the whole film. The main actors are very not to say prosconvincing. Yet beneath the pretty varnish of inspired lighting and settings still talking about the first 20mns this film traumatizes. And while repugnant and depressive it's pacing and editing drags you to the very end. Quality production overall but that's hard to confirm since you'll probably only see it once.This movie should be is in some countries illegal and should not be watched by people under or at least 2530. One has to have a mature approach to the content in order not to be scarred by this flick.Here's a noneoffensive way to think about it  the Serbian Croatian and Bosnian people were ravaged by war 1992 and this is their catharsis. Civil war is not about tanks and bullets  its about the desecration and destruction of people. That's about how brutal and merciless this film really is.It asks all kinds of questions. Mostly to the audience and it's voyeurism. Its a movie about the making of an extreme film so it involves the viewers and confronts them with their responsibilities...by pretty much the first frames. Smart move for a hard subject the only redeeming quality of the film.Isn't that why we're watching horror films in the first place?The first and foremost question this film asks is  what can one hope for when witnessing the deepest abysses of human depravity? Can't think of a better answer than  nothingness.It's one of the only film I've watched that was completely devoid of any human value or respect but one of the only ones that dealt directly with evil and depravity to such an extent that it becomes almost a parody at some points and that certainly helps the afterwardcoping.I watched it once used up a full week to think about it and get it out of my system tried it a second time and stopped half an hour in. Now I enjoy Wes Andersons' movies even more.Be warned.".

But it's still stuck in my mind. Some of the scenes will sure stay in your subconsciousness forever and will come back as a flash on some of the gruesome details you come across in life and movies you watch after this.The only star I give here is for the camera and good Serbian actors in this movie everything else is done purely for shock with no artistic value or any purpose at all. I understand people getting here saying this is great and they have never seen such a thing before... But I have a question for those people first off are you sure you're sane if your getting turned on by this? 'Cause I'm pretty sure the director of this movie was. Was it really necessary to call pedophilia and necrophilia  art? 'Cause you know such people do exist IRL and this movie seems to support all that since most of the pedophiles and necrophiliacs surely did watch it and got another sick idea of what they could do next.Six months ago when I was in absolute shock after watching it I thought for a while I wasn't open minded enough that I lack objectivity about this sort of scenes. Six months later I'm no longer shocked as much nor am I now easily shocked by anything anymore but my answer is still NO. NO I didn't want to know someone could think of raping a newborn NO I didn't want to think someone would rape a dead child NO I don't want to think about horny father raping his own son until the little one bleeds and NO I don't find a fellatio easy to watch after the woman has been left with her teeth pulled out of her mouth. Hell NO this is so wrong on so many levels. But the scene where the main actor uses his tool to murder a man by raping his eye socket... That is maybe creative comparing to other scenes. Here's a star you don't get another one from anyone sane enough to call this movie a shocking piece of trash.Remember The Human Centipede I mentioned before? Well most of the plot you get from Two Girls One Cup and seeing the trailer but let me hear how you looked your or any child in the eyes after watching this. Did it make you a better parent or a future one? Two words unnecessary consequences watch but be prepared for what it brings.".

Some people have argued this film needs to be looked upon for having a deeper message a social commentary on family life politics class systems etc but in my opinion that's wide of the mark. There are ways to show those kind of factors without resulting to what ultimately this film does  shock value. In that respect this film succeeds because if this does not in some way shock you or leave you feeling uneasy then you need help! lol. This film chucks it's moral compass out the window and delves as low as the human spirit can go. I will admit that the cinematography is good and the actors give very good performances but ultimately I can't get past the fact I feel this film was made to shock people and I did not get a sense of a deeper message.There is no way Id want to watch this film again or recommend anyone watching it even the hardest of exploitation cinema fans will find this hard to stomach.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Serbia the retired porn star Milos Srdjan Todorovic is married with his beloved wife Marija Jelena Gavrilovic and they have a little son Peter that is their pride and joy. The family is facing financial difficulties but out of the blue Milos is contacted by the porn actress Lejla Katarina Zutic that offers him a job opportunity in an art film. Milos is introduced to the director Vukmir Sergej Trifunovic that offers a millionaire contract to Milos to act in a film. However Vukmir neither show the screenplay nor tell the story to Milos. Milos discuss the proposal with Marija and he signs the contract. But sooner he finds that Vukmir and his crew are involved in sick snuff films of pedophilia necrophilia and torture and there is no way back to him and maybe it is too late to protect his family. Yesterday the exhibition of A Serbian Film was forbidden in the RioFan Festival by the promoters that claimed in a note that We deeply regret the decision. A Serbian Film is without any doubt one of the most polemic films of all times etc. These were the magic words that made me see this film.First of all I am against any censorship a film shall be accordingly rated with warning advising the theme since only very specific audiences might like it. My wife for example is a very sensitive person and would never support watching A Serbian Film.This film is indeed sick violent polemic with many transgressions but Irrversible Sal o le 120 Giornate di Sodoma Hostel Ichi the Killer Cannibal Holocaust I Spit on Your Grave the original and many others also are and they have their public and fans.A Serbian Film is one of the most violent sick and graphic films that I have ever seen but I liked it. The sequence with the baby is unbearable and hard to see the scene with Milo's family is too violent and disturbing but absolutely predictable. The acting and makeup are impressively realistic. Certainly a sensitive person will be sick and will not like or even see this movie. The poster in the movietheaters and the boxes of the DVD or BluRay should warn that this story is recommended to a very specific audience but censorship never since it is the best marketing that a polemic film can have. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Serbian Film  Terror Sem Limites A Serbian Film  Terror without Limits".

	onyx:emotionText "In Serbia the retired porn star Milos Srdjan Todorovic is married with his beloved wife Marija Jelena Gavrilovic and they have a little son Peter that is their pride and joy. The family is facing financial difficulties but out of the blue Milos is contacted by the porn actress Lejla Katarina Zutic that offers him a job opportunity in an art film. Milos is introduced to the director Vukmir Sergej Trifunovic that offers a millionaire contract to Milos to act in a film. However Vukmir neither show the screenplay nor tell the story to Milos. Milos discuss the proposal with Marija and he signs the contract. But sooner he finds that Vukmir and his crew are involved in sick snuff films of pedophilia necrophilia and torture and there is no way back to him and maybe it is too late to protect his family. Yesterday the exhibition of A Serbian Film was forbidden in the RioFan Festival by the promoters that claimed in a note that We deeply regret the decision. A Serbian Film is without any doubt one of the most polemic films of all times etc. These were the magic words that made me see this film.First of all I am against any censorship a film shall be accordingly rated with warning advising the theme since only very specific audiences might like it. My wife for example is a very sensitive person and would never support watching A Serbian Film.This film is indeed sick violent polemic with many transgressions but Irrversible Sal o le 120 Giornate di Sodoma Hostel Ichi the Killer Cannibal Holocaust I Spit on Your Grave the original and many others also are and they have their public and fans.A Serbian Film is one of the most violent sick and graphic films that I have ever seen but I liked it. The sequence with the baby is unbearable and hard to see the scene with Milo's family is too violent and disturbing but absolutely predictable. The acting and makeup are impressively realistic. Certainly a sensitive person will be sick and will not like or even see this movie. The poster in the movietheaters and the boxes of the DVD or BluRay should warn that this story is recommended to a very specific audience but censorship never since it is the best marketing that a polemic film can have. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Serbian Film  Terror Sem Limites A Serbian Film  Terror without Limits";

Though originally banned from what I heard off a colleague I was surprised to see it on the DVD shelf. I had to see it for myself and it does rate quite high on the shockometer. The film acted and directed by it's lead star is basically about a has been porn actor Milos now reduced to doing crap and that's no bull as we're warranted some footage. He is approached by an old girlfriendporn actress who tells him of this new filmmaker Vukmur who's making something really dark where Milos virtually just has to play himself with the camera of course him where he's witnessed to some shocking and truly unsettling moments the dark director's young daughter partaking in them along with other actors. Milos starts to question the director's authenticity really having reservations threatening to quit. He even has his older brother a cop to do a background check where this director is a mystery. Milos starts being drugged kidnapped and forced to perform things against his nature where he himself is slowly losing it. The story I must admit I liked though I found hard to accept how Milos could let himself change like he does where I couldn't really buy that drugs alone could do this especially considered when judging the shocking ending. Or may'be Milos really lost it somewhere and went nutso. And that's what A Serbian Film is a psychological drama that goes to the real dark recesses of one's self but again as in other controversial pics like this it's a cheap and weak facade that belies a number of nasty things like snuff child murder and abuse and some brutal pornographic images purely to shock just like this dark director Vukmur wants to do for his small private and sick clientele. The director of this Indie shock pic gives a fine performance having me thinking he was a legit porn actor when not doing this as it was such a naturalistic performance one scene involving a threesome almost blindly convinced me of that The others weren't bad either esp. Vukmur. Yes the lead actordirector does have a talent creating something successfully and mind blowingly shocking. I love the film for it's darkness but the film is so dirty and brilliantly corrupt with some of the most disturbing themes in film which doesn't constitute for a good film and one that is certainly not for the faint hearted. Electric music score ultimately fitting.".

The opening presents the paradox and is crucial to the rest of the film.Unlike the local review for the film which described this as a typical Coen Brothers film and weird and no closure at the end I found this film to be quite literal and true to the principles of uncertainty and duality. The two major characters both find closure and in retrospect there is clearly a beginning middle and end to the story the brothers wanted to tell.But the movie continues after the closure just as life continues on a daily basis setting up another expectation of continual uncertainty.Not being Jewish I no doubt missed some of the double entendre and humor in the tradition. I would have liked to understand the Hebrew passage of the bar mitzvah ceremony for example and how it relates to the core theme of the film.

	schema:headline " Natural and excellent next step for the Coens' cerebral probing of life's toughest questions";
	schema:reviewBody "The Coen brothers have developed critical acclaim for making black comediesawkward tragedies that depict smalltime people getting in way over their heads who for one reason or another are motivated to do things out of the ordinary because the natural order of the world and society has wronged them in some way. A Serious Man however is about a man who doesn't do anything to whom badannoying things happen. This story of a confused suburban Jewish man in the '60s wrestling with life's meaning is therefore an important step in the evolution of the Coens' themedriven filmmaking. Borrowing on an autobiographical context Minnesota Judaism etc. for the brothers it moves on to greater cosmic questions but with the same quirky and ironic spirit that have garnered the Coens all their deserved attention over the last 20 years.Larry Gopnik Michael Stuhlbarg is that one Coen brothers character in every movie  you know the innocent one who manages to suffer a seemingly unfair fate think Steve Buscemi in The Big Lebowski or most recently Richard Jenkins' character in Burn After Reading  only he gets to pilot this film. In that spirit an unknown Stuhlbarg is cast in the lead although he was clearly up for the challenge. Larry is a mildmannered math professor with a family in an ideal suburban home only his wife wants a divorce and his kids are nightmarish. Little by little the annoyances of his life pile up from the foreign student trying to bribe him for a passing grade while simultaneously suing him for defamation to his socially immature brother Richard Kind who won't leave his house.Larry seeks answers from the rabbis in his community to understand the mess his life has suddenly become. One rabbi tells him he needs a change of perspective another tells him the story of The Goy's Teeth a hilarious bit about a dentist who tries desperately to make meaning of a Hebrew message engraved in a patient's teeth only to find he was better off not worrying about it. None of their advice seems to help at the time  but it's dead on.

It is a challenging film and those who have struggled with the Coen brothers before will struggle again but for the cerebral and intellectual moviegoer it's outstanding.

	onyx:emotionText "The Coen brothers have developed critical acclaim for making black comediesawkward tragedies that depict smalltime people getting in way over their heads who for one reason or another are motivated to do things out of the ordinary because the natural order of the world and society has wronged them in some way. A Serious Man however is about a man who doesn't do anything to whom badannoying things happen. This story of a confused suburban Jewish man in the '60s wrestling with life's meaning is therefore an important step in the evolution of the Coens' themedriven filmmaking. Borrowing on an autobiographical context Minnesota Judaism etc. for the brothers it moves on to greater cosmic questions but with the same quirky and ironic spirit that have garnered the Coens all their deserved attention over the last 20 years.Larry Gopnik Michael Stuhlbarg is that one Coen brothers character in every movie  you know the innocent one who manages to suffer a seemingly unfair fate think Steve Buscemi in The Big Lebowski or most recently Richard Jenkins' character in Burn After Reading  only he gets to pilot this film. In that spirit an unknown Stuhlbarg is cast in the lead although he was clearly up for the challenge. Larry is a mildmannered math professor with a family in an ideal suburban home only his wife wants a divorce and his kids are nightmarish. Little by little the annoyances of his life pile up from the foreign student trying to bribe him for a passing grade while simultaneously suing him for defamation to his socially immature brother Richard Kind who won't leave his house.Larry seeks answers from the rabbis in his community to understand the mess his life has suddenly become. One rabbi tells him he needs a change of perspective another tells him the story of The Goy's Teeth a hilarious bit about a dentist who tries desperately to make meaning of a Hebrew message engraved in a patient's teeth only to find he was better off not worrying about it. None of their advice seems to help at the time  but it's dead on. The Goy's Teeth scene in particular is one of the brilliant moments where the Coen brothers let you know pretty clearly what their intentions are with the film while giving you something to laugh about. That's their strength and it's all over Serious Man.Much like Burn After Reading this film is one that makes a thematic point out of the audience's attempt to squeeze meaning out of everything.

The ominous turn of events and the wife's sensible solution to the situation is comical and you would think the film would build on such an interesting prologue.Alas like reading the Book of Job without the good parts namely the philosophical arguments and the poetry let alone a resolution A Serious Man feels like an exercise in viewing torture. What is it about 2009? The Road and A Serious Man both belong in the category of 'agonizing to watch....Maybe the brilliance of this film lies in that you think at any minute this honest good hardworking Jewish man will crack and finally take on the world that is besetting him as opposed to questioning Gd. But for much of the film our lead character Larry Gopnik a professor husband father of two brother of sociallyinept Adam there is little here that happens let alone satisfies a viewing audience.It has been awhile before I watched a film wherein I continually battled with myself over whether I should continue or simply walk away. I wanted to walk away...What made this film the most unbearable is how each periphery character rarely ever showed their humanity  Larry's Son and Daughter are simply cretins the former a typical high school student with bully problems and marijuana indulgence also he orders records of the month and leaves the bill for his father while his daughter's only needs in life seem to be her hair and going out. There is no dimension to either of them while their mother Larry's wife is a loveless shrew that remarkably makes Larry pay for his rival's funeral an arrogant friend of the family named Sy. Throughout the first half of the film Sy and Larry's wife are in love working on Larry to get a kosher divorce.After awhile I lost sympathy for the lead not because of his wife and family but because he had wandered into a cinematic world lacking humanity let alone real people. The Coens have not crafted a movie let alone a film but an alternate universe a torture chamber of bland direction and characterization. It has been awhile since I watched a film where I felt I despised so many characters. Ideally supporting characters are there to create relationships to reveal the complexity of human life. It seems everyone here is just another means to stab the lead and bludgeon him with their inane presence. Even the rabbi who refuses to talk to him feels less like a person as opposed to a forced story development.If you were the kid in school who didn't torture earth worms or pull butterfly wings off Monarchs then you might not like this debacle another pseudofilm from the Coen Brothers.".

It is a modern version of the book of Job whichof course you remembercontains a prologue in which God and Satan bet on whether Job will remain faithful and Satan then strikes down Job's flocks children and health a series of speeches by three comforters with Job's responses a speech by Elihu who is unhappy with the advice of the three comforters the Lord himself answering Job directly out of the whirlwind 'who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?' a final submissive speech by Job 'I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye see thee wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes' and an epilogue in which Job receives more flocks and children ... than he had before.The book and the film address what Christian at least theologians call theodicy or how bad things can happen in the world when God who supposedly controls everything is supposedly good. For nonbelievers if you have any interest in the subject the best way to think of this is perhaps to ask yourself whether the universe the Creation is on balance a good thing 'and God saw that it was good'. If so then perhaps we somehow have an obligation to live moral lives and as Jews and Christians think of it to follow God's law. If not then perhaps it's every man for himself and the Devil take the hindmost.The Coens' answer if I understand it correctly comes out of the whirlwind at the end in the voice of Grace Slick. I personally prefer God's original response with its paean to astrophysics and evolutionary biology'Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? ... When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ... Gave you wings and feathers unto the ostrich? Who leaves her eggs in the earth and warms them in the dust and forgets that the foot may crust them or that the wild best may break them... because God has deprived her of wisdom neither has he imparted to her understanding'which essentially asserts that Creation is wonderful and a package deal. But the Coens' very different answer while oddly Christian in emphasis is fully consistent with both the 1960s zeitgeist and with the midwestern Jewish community that they have so meticulously recreated.If you like this film you really need to see it twice. But without giving anything away if you see it once be careful to pay attention to i the bribe that like Schroedinger's cat is alive and dead at the same time and ii the whirlwind at the end. This is a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me say up front that most fans of the Coen brothers' early films might be disappointed if they're expecting Fargo The Big Lebowski or even O Brother. Unlike those movies here we don't have a lot of plot comedy or action. The message of the film is very challenging and it requires a lot of thought to figure out what they're saying.I'd say this movie is for fans of the recent American films Synecdoche NY Doubt and the recent Japanese films Departures Yureru and of course the classics by Kurosawa like Rashomon. What I'm saying is that this is a film that tackles philosophical questions of perception faith and in particular uncertainty.If you've had some physics you're in for a real treat because much of the theme centers around Schrdinger's Uncertainty Principle briefly touched upon in the Coens' excellent 2001 film The Man Who Wasn't There. Here they give us a more powerful dose. If you've never heard of this principle don't worry you can look it up on Wikipedia or you can accept my synopsis of it which I'll warn you might be flawed because I ain't no physicistThe Uncertainty Principle or Schrdinger's Cat proves mathematically that certain events are unknowable. It proposes the idea of a cat that might be alive or dead but we cannot know without looking inside the cage. At the same time the minute we look inside the cage the cat will be killed by a toxic gas. The bottom line we can't know the answer. Ever.From there the movie explores how different people react when confronted with the unknown. Some form prejudices. Some fall back on faith. Some become faithLESS. And some just don't care.This is a beautifully crafted film that shows us the nature of human beings in that respect. No there's not really a story. But it does even better than that it challenges our minds to see elements of our own lives within the life of this ordinary schmuck. I am truly amazed at the Coens' accomplishment and I hope they continue in this direction in the future though I'm sure it may hurt their mainstream appeal.If you see this film  like it I think you'll really enjoy the other films I've listed as well as the Hungarian masterpiece Werckmeister Harmonies anything by Wim Wenders The End of Violence touches on the same Uncertainty Principle and Orson Welles' The Trial.".

It very well could be  as only Coen Brothers could adapt the Biblical story to the screen. They placed Job the Schlimazel of the Old Testament in Minnesota suburbia of their own adolescent. They named him Larry Gopnik made him a physics professor in a local college a nice loving and pious man and let him watch hopelessly how his life was collapsing around him while he tried to make sense of what and why was happening to him and desperately sought after a spiritual help from his religious advisers three rabbis  in vain. A Serious Man is not an autobiographical movie but it is set in the very atmosphere and spirit where two Coen boys grew up in the year 1967 the exact year Joel Coen turned 13 and was preparing for his own bar mitzvah  just like Danny Gopnik 13 years old pot smoking Jefferson Airplane fan Larry's son whose Bar Mitzvah in the movie is a truly unforgettable event for many reasons. Now as the experienced celebrated filmmakers who have proved at least for this viewer to be among THE best modern filmmakers Coens look back at the place and time that shaped them as individuals men and creative personalities and they ask eternal and often impossible to answer questions. Does life have meaning? What is the point of it? Or is there point at all? Why do bad things happen to a decent person who did not do anything? Is there any certainty in life or all we can do just accept the fact there is no explanation no certainty and no fairness and the best is  to receive with simplicity everything that happens to you. I can understand how this film may be puzzling and even disappointing for many viewers even among the fans. A Serious Man is different and original even for Coens always innovative and creative artists but it is undeniably and unmistakably their film with their finger prints all over. Take for example the opening scene the blackwhite prologue spoken in Yiddish and set somewhere in Eastern Europe back in the 19th or 18th century in a small Shtetl. It involves a married couple and their mysterious visitor who could be a dybbuck an evil spirit believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. The scene certainly would stay with a viewer and make them try to understand its meaning. As one explanation the husband and wife could be the ancestors of Larry Gopnik before his family immigrated to the USA and ended up in Minnesota. The encounter with the dybbuk could bring the curse to the future generations and that may explain all assortment of tsuris that poor Larry tries to deal with. Coen's explained that they wanted to include a folk tale to set the tone in the film that explores among many things Jewish traditions religion faith and character. They could not find a tale they'd like so they wrote one and made a very stylish ominously dark yet funny and mysterious opening to their film. As a perfect balance to the fairytaleghost story opening the final scene comes that literally can blow you away. As it has happened before in a Coens 'movie  the open ending has as many admirers as haters but I believe it was no other way to finish the film and I found the ending perfect in the universe that Coens create. The brothers' decision to cast mostly unknown stage actors in the main roles proved to be successful one and everyone was up to their job. Michael Stuhlbarg positively shines as Larry and he makes one of the most sympathetic characters in Coens' movie. Sari Lennick Richard Kind Fred Melamed as a seriously creepy man whom Larry's wife Judith wanted to leave Larry for as well as the rest of the cast are all memorable. The camera work by Roger Deakins' the longtime collaborator of Coens in recreating the long gone era of the late 60s in the Middle of America is above any praise. A Serious Man is beautiful profound and perfectly well made. It is funny too. Seriously.".

He has a divorce pending and his wife leaving with Sy Ableman seriously Sy Ableman! he has a South Korean student who may be simultaneously bribing him and suing him for defamation he has a brother who has a cystno jobgambling troubles two kids who more or less are just typically dysfunctional teens the boy on his way to be Bar Mitzvah and smoking enough dope to acknowledge more than once that it's 1967 and his sexual repression is practically taunted by the foxy Jewish woman next door who sunbathes nude. And what does God have to say about this? Oh don't get him started on trips to the Rabbi  frankly he'd have better luck with Anton Chigurh.A Serious Man is a movie to take seriously as art but at the same time the Coens aren't above pulling out their usual allstops to make this a hilariously weird and awkward movie. Perhaps a better way to compare is that it's like if Curb Your Enthusiasm starred an average shmo who doesn't have quite the sense of humor of Larry David and perhaps is even cursed by his bloodline via the opening scene in the movie... or maybe not I'll get to that in a moment and who keeps getting s on from all directions not coincidentally perhaps Richard Kind appears in both show and movie. It's such a funny movie that I have to think back to Big Lebowski and O'Brother Where Art Thou to remember when I laughed so hard. Maybe its the predilection for Jewish jokes that sting so or maybe its the originality with the storytelling. As far as a blackasJewishdeath comedy it works completely.As for being a masterpiece of a film... I'm still not completely sure. Sometimes the Coens' movies are instant classics No Country for Old Men Blood Simple and others take a little while to grow on a viewer i.e. Miller's Crossing even Big Lebowski was a grower and not a shower for me. A Serious Man may fall in the latter category it's such a personal film maybe more than anyone done before if only for the time and place and particulars of the characters in a Jewishsuburb of Minnesota and its such an oddity in their catalog of work. Watching Larry on this existential odyssey of WTF nears Bergman proportions  there's even a scene where a character's death affects a woman in much the same way as the father Ekdahl's death in Fanny  Alexander  where religion is tested to the fullest and most harrowing of emotional schemes. Where is God when Larry needs him? Everywhere? Nowhere? Screw Larry he didn't pay his son's Columbia Records account! But for all that succeeds in A Serious Man such as a completely masterful sequence a contender for my single favorite sequence of any movie this year where a Rabbi describes a harrowing and pointless and uproarious story of a dentist and a Goy's teeth or when Larry's son is stoned out of his mind when reading the Torah at his Bar Mitzvah a first in cinema history combining marijuana Roger Deakins' use of a lensbaby and Hebrew and its creative characterizations and shocking nightmare scenes it's an unsettling film and not always in the best ways. It's a film that as one could argue in their past films is at war with if not the audience directly then with audience expectations. We might expect A Serious Man to just be about this man's downward spiral in his life but what then to make of that cool opening scene all in Yiddish and admitted by Joel Coen to not really have a whole lot to do directly with the rest of the movie or for that matter the end of the movie which just... ends.As far as 'fyou's' to audiences go it certainly is funny and startling in comparison with No Country for Old Men almost like the Coens are saying 'yeah knock this one this time we dare you! and if I get an fyou from filmmakers I'm glad it comes from them. But... you will either need more than a viewing for it to sink in or you'll curse the day you decided to walk in the theater or rent it. Not much of a middle ground. Then again I wouldn't want it any other way in this case. And hey it's got Jefferson Airplane quoted by a YodaRabbi that scores points right there! 9.510".

Visually it is beautiful. There are so many perfectly framed scenes that even when the story seems to drag it keeps you captivated.Having said that for me it did drag. The central figure was a neurotic cerebral awkward middle aged Jewish man. Not entirely a cinematic first. Add to this the fact that he was possibly the most passive character in cinematic history  he literally made no decisions in the entire movie until the final scene. Instead he was drawn from one catastrophe to another on the basis that he was a good upstanding man surrounded by stronger people.Normally in this situation we would see the character challenged and grow but this is the Coen brothers so it's not going to be that simple. Insteadwe are left to squirm at the relentless nature of the man's incessant failings  a frustrating experience particularly if you're not privy to the Jewish humour that pervades this intimate film.It seemed to me almost as if the Coen Brothers were seeing how far they can stretch their high profile. With No Country For Old Men they robbed us of the pivotal climactic scene and I for one left feeling cheated. Here they simply don't introduce it at all. They break every story paradigm there is as if to suggest that they are now so great they can present a piece that has no development no conclusion a prologue that seems to have no relevance to the main body of the work and no redemptive quality to extract from any of the characters. A bit like real life I suppose. But who wants to see that on a forty foot screen?I need to lay down.".

Admitedly i was intrigued enough to watch it to the end. I was furiously annoyed with the ending and wished I hadn't wasted nearly 2 hours watching this film hence posting my review.The acting isn't bad but seems one dimensional and there doesn't appear to be any depth of characters. You keep expecting the main character to go postal but does nothing of the sort.As for being a Black Comedy I have watched many films of this genre and it barely made me give a wry smile at times. The true comedy is the Coen Brothers making a film that I watched to the end only to wish I hadn't bothered.Knowing about the Jewish faith would probably improve your understanding of this film however the only message an Atheist like my self can obtain is that if you are done wrong repeatedly that is doesn't make it OK to do something that is unethical.To sum up Only worth watching if you are either religious or have nothing better to do for 2 hours of your life!".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film earlier today and I have to say that it was simply thrilling. Now how can I possible say that it was thrilling when there were zero action scenes zero suspense and zero plot? To me it's exactly because it lacks those things that makes this film thrilling! If you are reading through these IMDb reviews you already know the general premise of the movie and have likely seen the preview and so knowing that it is a Coen brothers movie you probably know what kind of film to expect. One of the things I really love about this film which others may hate is because it basically has no plot and is simply 90 minutes of one middleaged man's struggles in life with no type of resolution whatsoever. The tone and slow pacing of the film reminded me a great deal of the film Sideways2004 in that we just see an average guy's struggles with the people in his life with some comedic moments thrown in occasionally to break the overall depressing mood of the film. Like that film you are so able to relate to the main character and his problems because his issues and the people he has issues with are so genuine.And that's exactly why I call this review a serious look at human nature. All of the great satire is in fact based closely on reality or realistic events that we can relate to. In this film the main character's issues are so average and normal divorce teenage son experimenting with pot possible job advancementwork stability etc. that they are parts of almost everyone's everyday life. Even the interactions and subplots with the Asian student and the hunting neighbors are so very realistic which aids in making them hilarious. Even if you are not Jewish you will still be able to relate to and understand the satire in this film. Some moviegoers with short attention spans will probably hate this film and wonder when the big explosive fight scene will be or when the Adam SandlerWill Ferrell stupid fartgay jokes will start appearing...but of course this film is the exact opposite of typical Hollywood.Another reason why I am giving this film such a high score is because while watching this film it is clear just how much the Coen brothers simply LOVE making films and they are only concerned with making the film their way. They don't care about box office profits or a target demographic...they just make films that are personal to them. It's just so refreshing to see. Just look at the attention to detail they will put into one scene of dialogue between characters. Look at the way the glasses' on someone's face are angled the way the characters' hair is just a tiny bit messy the way a character holds his yamaka in place while running the way the lines are setup and timed perfectly to have the perfect effect on the audience. When you watch this you can just see how dedicated they are to their craft. These guys care so much about creating little details and endearing characters and so little about any kind of recycled plot. Hats off to the Coen boys once again! Shalom!".

Larry represents at once his own midlife self and his future son. the son while appearing flat and devoid of substantive character is Larry also. the first two rabbis represent Larry and son middle age rationality and youthful wonder and Marshak represents the wisdom of old age. even the confiscation of the radio by the teacher is a metaphor for middle age stealing the freedom of youth. the bar mitzbah scene sorry for any misspellings as i am not Jewish is quite telling. the rabbi literally forces the boy to pull the cup from his hands symbolizing how we must take from society the generation before us what we deserve. the boy learned the Torah and had difficulty speaking his verses and some of the older men around him provided assistance. previously when the boy offered assistance to the old teacher in using his radio earphones it was dismissed but later in the movie Marshak recites verses of Jefferson Airplane for the boy and accepts his assistance. this signifies something about how the wise realize that youth have more to offer the world than just their stupid and repetitive nonsense. the boy went to the trouble of learning Torah so Marshak reciprocates because he is wise enough to see the beautiful contributions of youth to society ie. the song which in essence tells more about what is happening in the movie than the rabbis do. the middle aged rabbi is nearly worthless as he speaks only in rational things. the youngest rabbi speaks truth but his truth cannot appeal to the middle aged Larry except when he is high and sees things with a new perspective.as for the beginning sequence we must accept that evil is real and irrational. the middle aged man who is rational cannot accept the idea that the man who helped him is in fact evil. its irrational to think this could be possible. the scene was left open ended because we must decide for ourselves which is reality. did the wife kill a dybbuk or not? she believes that she did because she is irrational and religious. to believe in God is essentially a leap of faith. you must forgo the rational and do what you are told is correct. Dora acts regardless of the outcome because she believes in the irrational. i believe she killed a dybbuk. later in the movie Sy Ableman is the dybbuk in Larry's life and he doesn't act because he is rational. he is rational because he is middle aged and beset by tribulations unable to deal with them as his son does avoiding them. he must be irrational and yet he cannot.the final sequence with the tornado ties all the levels of the movie together. the son is both himself and a future Larry at once. i don't believe the tornado represents an actual impending death for him but rather the storm of middle age that he will inherit from his father. we are left to decide if Larry will live or die be terminally ill or just suffer further tribulations but either way his son will no longer be able to run away from his own tribulations. he will become his father thus he better find somebody to love. that was what Larry needed to help him through his own perils.all in all this movie is pure brilliance. i would suggest watching it at least 3 times and trying to see it from a different angle with each viewing. pay attention to the small story details and see the puzzle in its pieces. you can assemble A Serious Man in many different ways and find a unique commentary in each viewing. all of the meanings and symbols exist together simultaneously. its an abstract cinematic masterpiece that should not be viewed as a realist painting but taken in for the beauty of each of its various and seemingly unrelated parts.".

	schema:headline " The Coens get down and Jewish on man's predicament";
	schema:reviewBody "Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love hovers over the scenes of the Coen brothers' A Serous Man the story of a Sixties Minnesota Jewish college professor with a small family whose life starts to fall apart. One of the Coens' strangest and most thoughtprovoking films this one is a black comedy a meditation on Jewishness and a modern rethinking of the Book of Job in a world where Hashem God isn't just incomprehensible but largely imperceptible. The movie has been seen as a meanspirited product of selfhating Jews but that's not right at all. Returning to their roots and their tribe the Coens have never been more serious or in their sardonic way more kind. To see life as a cosmic joke is really quite orthodox. It just doesn't lend itself to easy answers. And the rabbis the professor consults haven't got any. They've got basically nothing.The time and place echo the Coens' own youth. One of them might have been preparing for his Bar Mitzvah like Danny Gopnik Aaron Wolff the son of the film's nerdy but utterly decent physics teacher hero Larry Gopnik the excellent Michael Stuhlbarg.'A Serious Man' begins with a little Yiddish prologue set in longago shtetl Poland when a wife stabs an old man who's done a good deed for her husband because she thinks he's a dybbuk a dead person possessed by an evil spirit. The sequence is serious and gentle in the manner of the Yiddish theater and not a joke. When the old man starts to bleed and wanders out into the snow the couple realizes they've brought on terrible luck.Terrible luck that's what is visited upon Larry Gopnik. But first we see Danny listening to Sixties rock with an earpiece hooked to his transistor in Hebrew class. The old teacher confiscates the little radio and tucked into its case 20 the boy owes somebody.All the scenes are marked by the Coens' usual precision and elegance but the movie is tricky to watch because it changes focus so rapidly. It alternates between offhand polyphonic passages in which four things are going on at once to superfocused ones where only one very intense thing is happening it asks us to laugh and be cynical but demands metaphysical speculation.The point is Larry has all this stuff going on at once his wife the implacable Sari Lennick is leaving him inexplicably for the titular serious man the unctuous selfsatisfied Sy Ableman Fred Melamed a widower who's wife died only three years ago. His hugs and reassurances of the value of communication show the feelgood clichs of the period used as a cynical ruse. At work there's a Korean student Clive Park David Kang who tries to bribe Larry to change his F to a passing grade and when Larry refuses Clive's father threatens a lawsuit. The goy neighbors are vaguely menacing they're infringing on Larry's property line. He's up for tenure and somebody's sent the tenure committee letters impugning his morals. His useless brother Arthur jobless and with a gambling problem has come for refuge and is sleeping in the living room. Larry's wife exiles them both to the Jolly Roger Motel. A sophisticated woman neighbor Jewish Amy Landecker who sunbathes in the nude tempts Larry to take advantage of the new freedoms. Meanwhile there's a daily pinprick that may morph into a serious threat calls keep coming to the department office to say Larry owes money to a record club he never joined.The children are simply not there. Danny is only interested in marijuana  he goes through his Bar Mitzvah almost as memorable a one as in Schlesinger's 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' entirely stoned  along with getting better reception to watch a certain TV show and rock music. He learns his Torah passage nonetheless. Danny's older sister goes to a club every day and is only interested in washing her hair.But all this is incidental because as the formal intertitles indicate the central moments are Larry's attempts to consult with rabbis who will help him. But they're no help. I too have forgotten how to see him in the world says one Simon Helberg with a nonJewish name who cites the parking lot as a vision of the wonders of creation. A higherlevel rabbiGeorge Wyner sipping tea says Something like this it's never a good time. The oldest putatively wisest rabbi Rabbi Marshak Alan Mandell won't see him at all. He sees Danny after his Bar Mitzvah returns his transistor radio to him and quotes Jefferson Airplane.Central to 'A Serious Man' is Jewishness  true to the Coens' own origins they grew up in a heavily Jewish neighborhood where you went to the synagogue and got Bar Mitzvahed. You became a doctor a dentist a lawyer and each of these professions comes in for an appearance and Larry's various troubles leads him to more than one lawyer with threatening bills  it's a nightmare!  but it's also steeped in mundane quotidian Jewish experience. The Coens' irony has applied to being Minnesotan in 'Fargo' to being laid back in 'Big Lebowski.' But being Jewish is a good sight more central to their comic worldview. What are the Jews? The Chosen People. Chosen for what? The Holocaust? Every memory of Jewish pride is matched by a twin memory of humiliation and rejection. None of the people around Larry closest to him are any real help. But he remains a good man. He remains nerdy but he's still admirable.In making Larry Gopnik the humble schlep a smart mathematician but a dumkopf when it comes to people into a Job they redeem him and they take the torments of man in a world where God can't be located accessible to us and to their humor. Does Jewish experience make the torments of the modern secular world any more comprehensible? Maybe not but it's what they've got to work with.".

At work there's a Korean student Clive Park David Kang who tries to bribe Larry to change his F to a passing grade and when Larry refuses Clive's father threatens a lawsuit. The goy neighbors are vaguely menacing they're infringing on Larry's property line. He's up for tenure and somebody's sent the tenure committee letters impugning his morals. His useless brother Arthur jobless and with a gambling problem has come for refuge and is sleeping in the living room. Larry's wife exiles them both to the Jolly Roger Motel. A sophisticated woman neighbor Jewish Amy Landecker who sunbathes in the nude tempts Larry to take advantage of the new freedoms. Meanwhile there's a daily pinprick that may morph into a serious threat calls keep coming to the department office to say Larry owes money to a record club he never joined.The children are simply not there. Danny is only interested in marijuana  he goes through his Bar Mitzvah almost as memorable a one as in Schlesinger's 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' entirely stoned  along with getting better reception to watch a certain TV show and rock music. He learns his Torah passage nonetheless. Danny's older sister goes to a club every day and is only interested in washing her hair.But all this is incidental because as the formal intertitles indicate the central moments are Larry's attempts to consult with rabbis who will help him. But they're no help. I too have forgotten how to see him in the world says one Simon Helberg with a nonJewish name who cites the parking lot as a vision of the wonders of creation. A higherlevel rabbiGeorge Wyner sipping tea says Something like this it's never a good time. The oldest putatively wisest rabbi Rabbi Marshak Alan Mandell won't see him at all. He sees Danny after his Bar Mitzvah returns his transistor radio to him and quotes Jefferson Airplane.Central to 'A Serious Man' is Jewishness  true to the Coens' own origins they grew up in a heavily Jewish neighborhood where you went to the synagogue and got Bar Mitzvahed. You became a doctor a dentist a lawyer and each of these professions comes in for an appearance and Larry's various troubles leads him to more than one lawyer with threatening bills  it's a nightmare!  but it's also steeped in mundane quotidian Jewish experience. The Coens' irony has applied to being Minnesotan in 'Fargo' to being laid back in 'Big Lebowski.' But being Jewish is a good sight more central to their comic worldview. What are the Jews? The Chosen People. Chosen for what? The Holocaust? Every memory of Jewish pride is matched by a twin memory of humiliation and rejection. None of the people around Larry closest to him are any real help. But he remains a good man. He remains nerdy but he's still admirable.In making Larry Gopnik the humble schlep a smart mathematician but a dumkopf when it comes to people into a Job they redeem him and they take the torments of man in a world where God can't be located accessible to us and to their humor. Does Jewish experience make the torments of the modern secular world any more comprehensible? Maybe not but it's what they've got to work with.";

Few filmmakers today can combine genres produce stunningly original stories and master every aspect of cinematic technique like they can. A Serious Man is among their most recent efforts and it is also among their greatest.It's a black comedy that relies more on character and situation than actual plot somewhat like another darkly humorous Coens masterpiece Inside Llewyn Davis that focuses around a middle aged Jewish father and husband whose life transforms into a storm of chaos and really REALLY bad luck. Here the Coens wonderfully weave elements of hilarious humor and gut wrenching tragedy all at once. Some scenes are both sad and funny and the Coens are such masters that these two genres to not clash together in a chaotic way but instead a very natural effective way. The Coens realize that even when life is at its absolute worse it can still be hilariouswhich is really the essence of dark humor within itself. It makes the worst most miserable aspects of being funny.There is no real happy ending here much is left unresolved. It is a mysterious ending the type that audiences like to groan at. However for a film as unique and dark as this it works quite well. There is no need for a resolution the ending itself is powerful enough to conclude the fascinating fable. The final shot of this film is so beautiful haunting and indescribably sad it packs a punch for the ages.".

It is much more reassuring that having to think. In this case at least isn't this the point though? Life IS like that. The core of the movie seems to be about the inscrutability of the universe and of God's purpose. Or is there a God? It does not ask this question outright  but it is hanging there. Together with the question we all have  we are convinced there must be an answer to  what is OUR purpose? Poor old Larry Gubnik always being a serious man. Always doing what's right and in return being served up a big steaming pile of drek. Seeking answers from God or the Rabbi and getting nonsense  or getting no answer at all. Very dark. But I have been there myself at times in my life when all of my plans have been crapped upon by the universe  trying the same things Larry tried asking the same questions Larry asked but  Silence. So I get it. I get what Larry is going through. And of course some reviewers have pointed out the similarities to the biblical story of Job. But did anyone else pick up the symbolism in the movie of Larry up on the roof twisting the TV antenna to get a better reception  a message from the ether? When this is also exactly the theme of the movie. Poor old Larry cannot even get F Troop clearly. How can he expect to get a clear message from God. This was not a coincidence folks. Those sneeky Coen brothers!The movie also raises issues many Jews specifically have had to ask themselves in the face of say writ large the holocaust. Jews confronted by outright malice and evil or by just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time ask themselves that eternal question. If there is a God why does he let bad things happen. For some this was the trigger to turn off religion. For others it strengthened their faith somehow. So at another level the movie is about what is it about to be a Jew and to ask yourself the same questions that Jews have asked themselves down the ages. In this case What's going on? as the Coen's express it.Also I have a sneeky feeling this movie is also biographical in a way. The Coens grew up in the twin cities area of USA in the 1960s I have read. They would have been Bar Mitvah'd in a synagogue much like the one depicted and the Jewish characters would have been much like those depicted too. The life questions they may have asked themselves as they became adults would have been much like those asked in the movie and even if all the bad stuff did not happen to them personally they may well have feared it would  will I get an urgent call from my doctor about a routine xray? Will my kid's Bar Mitzvah go OK. Will my wife run off with another man taking everything I have including my family self respect and my understanding of who I am? In other words perhaps all the normal stuff of life. But written in bold type both because us Jews are a neurotic bunch and because it is damn good material for black comedy. As Woody Allen found out before them.But of course the Coens would not have gotten any answers to these questions just as Larry did not. Silence. Zip. Bupkis. But there is one thing I learned that life taught me and maybe this is part of the message too. Nice guys too often DO finish last. If you are too nice too compliant too good people will take advantage and crap on you. And maybe the universe does too although in its case not because it is malicious but rather just uncaring. And that is a lesson poor old Larry never learned.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen A Single Man twice already at different screenings and I believe I will see it again and again. Yes for me is one of those films. Thank you Tom Ford and thank you Colin Firth. I love Colin and my favorite performance of his dates back to 1989 Apartment Zero. George Falconer Colin's character in A Single Man seems to me the flip side of Adrian Leduc Colin's character in Apartment Zero. George has had a real life and grieves the death of his companion. Adrian Leduc never had a companion and his grief is based on his total inability to connect with people. George believes that human connection is at the center of everything and puts that thought into practice. Adrian worships James Dean George doesn't think that much of James Dean he actually says it. Adrian wears white shirts made of cheap material and he launders them himself. George wears impeccably cut white shirts that he has professionally laundered. They seem tiny details but they become overwhelming when you know both characters. George even hurts himself and wears a band aid just like Adrian during the last 15 minutes of Apartment Zero I love Colin Firth because he's an actor that can give you so much doing seemingly so little. It compel us to participate and include our own thoughts and feelings. The love of George for his lover is as pungent and real as anything I've ever seen on the screen. It is a cinematic triumph and as I'm writing about it I feel a sort of urge to see it again just as it happened to me when I saw Apartment Zero for the first time. I felt then that Colin deserved an Oscar nomination for Adrian he will get it for George. This is the first comment I ever wrote and it comes out of a profound need to share this emotion. When movies can do that film lovers all over the world have real reason to celebrate and I'm celebrating.".

	schema:reviewBody "I attended the North American Premiere of A Single Man at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. This is the first foray into film for esteemed fashion designer Tom Ford directing from his own script based on the Christopher Isherwood novel. In a word A Single Man is a triumph.It is easily one of the most Oscardeserving films of the year. Colin Firth's performance screams Best Actor which he did win at the Venice Film Festival Julianne Moore is exquisite and Nicholas Hoult About a Boy Skins is on his way to stardom. I was simply awestruck.The curtain rises on a despondent George Firth having lost his longtime partner. Sapped of energy and will he struggles to wake each day and function as the brilliant college professor he's expected to be. Few notice the change in him but one student sees George as a magnet pulling him forward to a place even he doesn't understand. Kenny Hoult seems to glow like an angel in George's dark world and yet is a puzzle and presents a challenge which he doesn't necessarily want to confront at this stage in his life. As is his custom he turns to Charlotte Moore for a warm shoulder but the temperature drops amidst the chill surrounding George's bleak existence.Everything about this film  the look colors pacing shots composition cinematography costumes soundtrack  says that an extraordinary amount of love and care went into it. Special mention to director of photography Eduard Grau and editor Joan Sobel for their keen abilities to work lockstep with Ford in projecting his vision onto the screen. Abel Korzeniowski's score is haunting and moving. Despite his design genius Ford was generous enough to entrust costume designer Arianne Phillips with the freedom to work unencumbered. Production designer Dan Bishop with art direction by Ian Phillips and set decorator Amy Wells created two worlds  a cold stark one in which George sees only hopelessness and another warm colorful one in which he has hope.What stays with the viewer though is the enigmatic friendship between George and Kenny. Nicholas Hoult is absolutely mesmerizing in this. The way Ford shot him made people gasp. He's lit framed and shot like an Adonis. Of course that's the idea here. This will definitely be a break out role for the 19yearold. The camera loves him and it's a pretty daring performance.Most of all this is a tour de force for Firth and a stunning achievement which is destined to be a highlight of his distinguished career. The range of emotions and the extent to which his character must convey them through his eyes and facial expressions with the copious use of long takes without dialogue left me wideeyed with wonder.This is the stuff of great movies. They don't get much better than this.".

	schema:headline " An Unbearable Portrait of Grief";
	schema:reviewBody "Colin Firth plays George Falconer an English Literature teacher who wakes up ready to commit suicide. For the past eight months George has been grieving the death of his lover Jim for the past 16 years. Unable to live without him anymore George prepares his last day on Earth which includes giving one last lesson to his class on the subject of fear buying bullets for his revolver and at night having a final party with his best friend Charley. George just wants to get through the day and kill himself with dignity after the party. The movie basically follows him through the day as he makes his preparations and the big question is Is he really going to do it? The movie is not easy to watch. For one thing it paints an unbearable portrait of grief. Colin Firth displays pain in his voice and face throughout most of the movie even when he's smiling or seemingly content there's in his eyes a vestige of sadness and weariness. Secondly George is such an instantly likable character it's painful to watch him going about his life knowing he wants to put an end to it. It's so easy to fall in love with him that his pain becomes ours very quickly.The simplicity of the movie's premise is made up by Firth's outstanding performance and also by Julianne Moore's. She plays Charley a woman he once dated and the only person who knows he's homosexual. I don't know how long she is in the movie perhaps 10 or 15 minutes but in that short time she gives an amazing performance as a woman who doesn't have much to look for like George who doesn't have anyone else in her life no dreams no future just memories of her good days with George.Tom Ford also complements the movie by giving it a very distinctive visual style pretty much every scene is unique in the way it looks and the way it is shot. One of my favorite examples is the way he portrays the cluster of emotions in George visualizing his pain by showing imaginary scenes of him drowning. Not only is it a lovely metaphor but also connects with a scene in the movie that is the closest thing to happiness George feels in it.Although this was Tom Ford's debut movie and he showed what a good filmmaker he can be for me the revelation of this movie was Abel Korzeniowski a Polish film composer who brings a unique sound of melancholy to the movie. How he was ignored by the Oscars is beyond me.A lot of things in this movie were ignored by the Oscars this year and yet I think this movie being the intimate character study that it is has better chances of outliving all other movies in competition in years to come. I hope so because movies like this is the direction cinema needs to go in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Ford you surprised me. I don't really follow the fashion world too closely at all so although I naturally knew his name I wasn't familiar with his creations. I haven't read the Christopher Isherwood novel yet so Colin Firth and Julianne Moore were the ones who actually got me excited for this project. And I wasn't disappointed  it actually exceeded all my expectations and alongside Jane Campion's Bright Star which unfortunately is being almost completely overlooked this awards season it's the most poetic 2009 film I have seen so far.Firth always elegant and fascinating plays George Falconer a British professor in 1960's Los Angeles trying to cope with the death of his longterm partner Jim Matthew Goode. It's been eight months since Jim's death and George decided to end his life by the end of the day  and it's this day we see in this admirable film. George spends time with his best friend Charley the always wonderful Julianne Moore with whom he had something in the past and still has hopes of winning him over again and now is an unhappy divorce. A young pupil Kenny Nicholas Hoult who has grown up a lot since About a Boy and The Weather Man who clearly is infatuated with George harasses him until he finally gives him the attention he craves. These two different encounters will be decisive for George. As sad as the overall tone and the theme of mourning can be A Single Man is by no means depressing. Ford uses and abuses of artsy but very efficient and intriguing camera angles and a classy score by Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski. Eyes lips are shown in evidence throughout the film and naturally the costumes are all superb. George's long day's journey reminds me a lot of Virginia Woolf's classic Mrs. Dalloway. Marleen Gorris was able to do a correct but somewhat cold adaptation of Woolf's novel in 1997 scripted by Woolf scholar and talented actress Eileen Atkins featuring the magnificent Vanessa Redgrave in the title role but I thought she wasn't much to blame for the film's coldness since that's one of the most complex novels to be translated to the screen. After seeing A Single Man I even dare to say Tom Ford could do an interesting and very personal adaptation of Mrs. Dalloway. Also this is one of the sexiest films since Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Tambien 2001 and Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers 2003 and Nicholas Hoult's incandescent presence has a lot to do with that. He gives an efficient brave performance for an actor his age and although I'm sure Jamie Bell Billy Elliot who was the first choice for the role would've been terrific Hoult doesn't disappoint. It's not every day we're given a film with such emotional intensity and exuberant sensuality and A Single Man proves that Tom Ford is certainly a promising director having given us not just a great first film but one also one of the year's finest and most unusual creations. A film to be felt and celebrated and I can't wait for the DVD  it's a keeper. 1010.".

	schema:headline " A role tailormade for Colin Firth";
	schema:reviewBody "With Tom Ford at the helm the very least you'd expect from his adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's novel is a parade of gorgeous men in wellcut suits. Certainly there's enough Kennedyera period detail here to satisfy the most ardent fan of Mad Men and an uncredited voice cameo from Jon Ham. But the meticulously edited trailer gives no hint of the warmth and humour that underscore this potentially bleak meditation on love and loss.The action takes place over the course of just one day and night  30 November 1962  in the life of handsome middleaged college professor George Colin Firth. Like his friend neighbour and onetime lover Charley Julianne Moore George is an expat in LA. He has a good job and a wellappointed home in a pictureperfect suburban street but since the death of his longterm lover Joe Matthew Goode a few months earlier George has been going through the motions. Now today it appears that he is putting his affairs in order with a view to ending it all.I must confess that I never swooned over Colin Firth's Mr Darcy back in the 90s and I've found it increasingly hard to relate to the repressed lovelorn and frankly lumpen Englishmen he often plays. But here he's a revelation. As George's day unfolds a series of reveries  erotic nostalgic humorous and sad  reveal the man behind the immaculately suited exterior. Whether perched on the loo wryly observing his neighbours lavishing praise on a bemused secretary or enduring a discourse on bomb shelters from a colleague Lee Pace Firth shows a welcome lightness of touch.

	onyx:emotionText "With Tom Ford at the helm the very least you'd expect from his adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's novel is a parade of gorgeous men in wellcut suits. Certainly there's enough Kennedyera period detail here to satisfy the most ardent fan of Mad Men and an uncredited voice cameo from Jon Ham. But the meticulously edited trailer gives no hint of the warmth and humour that underscore this potentially bleak meditation on love and loss.The action takes place over the course of just one day and night  30 November 1962  in the life of handsome middleaged college professor George Colin Firth. Like his friend neighbour and onetime lover Charley Julianne Moore George is an expat in LA. He has a good job and a wellappointed home in a pictureperfect suburban street but since the death of his longterm lover Joe Matthew Goode a few months earlier George has been going through the motions. Now today it appears that he is putting his affairs in order with a view to ending it all.I must confess that I never swooned over Colin Firth's Mr Darcy back in the 90s and I've found it increasingly hard to relate to the repressed lovelorn and frankly lumpen Englishmen he often plays. But here he's a revelation. As George's day unfolds a series of reveries  erotic nostalgic humorous and sad  reveal the man behind the immaculately suited exterior. Whether perched on the loo wryly observing his neighbours lavishing praise on a bemused secretary or enduring a discourse on bomb shelters from a colleague Lee Pace Firth shows a welcome lightness of touch. He's tender and tolerant as Moore's ginsodden hostess berates him for his inability to be the heterosexual man she needs. And his obsessivecompulsive fumbling with a gun and a sleeping bag are hilarious.Moore expertly conveys the fragility and hopelessness of a woman once married and once feted for her looks who is now staring into the abyss through the bottom of a bottle of Tanqueray's.

The credits roll at this point so we need also wonder about Kenny's state of mind when he finds George's body. Life and its suffering do go on.The film's advertising is slightly misleading in that George is shown lying next to Charley his woman friend with whom he had a past relationship. Sure this is designed to attract straight viewers but anyone hungry for psychologically rather than sexually mature scenes between a man and woman will find it here.We are born single and usually die alone. A Single Man dramatizes our loneliness in a powerful and literally haunting way. I seriously recommend watching this film alone to let it capture you in its rumination.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film was announced I knew it would look fantastic but I wasn't ready for the intensity of this production the incredible performance by Colin Firth and certainly one of the best films of the year. A Single Man takes place during a single day in what might be the last day in the life o a devastated human being.Framed with superb art direction a keen eye for accurate recreation of a period long gone and one of the most haunting scores in recent history we see how George is going through the motions on his way to what he perceives as the solution to his sad situation. From the moment he wakes up to another miserable day he has finally found a purpose and this time he has something to look forward to. Still as unpredictable as life is a series of events occur to have him pause and reflect on whether he's making the right decision.It is as if divine intervention might offer him an opportunity to reconsider or is it just a couple of disguised attempts from other people who look for something less profound. These are interesting moments in the film when a hustler and a young man try to connect with George and he certainly seems to appreciate their attempts but he also seems to question the sincerity of their respective motives or is it that he has already given up on trying to find happiness? There are other possible lifelines and here comes Charly a long time friend who was at one time romantically involved with George. It is also obvious that Charly never really got to know who George was and at a critical moment she seems to unaware of how desperate the situation might be. The scenes between George and Charly are incredibly sad mostly because of her inability to read what is happening to her best friend. Yet the scenes pale in comparison to the everyday scenes where George's reveal that he wants to somehow overcome the pain and desperation he is going through. He looks at the eyes of strangers yearning to see if he can capture some of the energy he now lacks. Ironically some of them find him attractive and want to connect but it just might be too late for George.The film is lovingly photographed with Ford's masterful hand taking us through the potentially last moments of George's existence. Some people might argue that it is just too beautiful a picture to deliver its devastating message. Yet why is it that metaphorically speaking isn't it worse when people are unaware of the beauty surrounding them that makes the situation more pathetic? Firth can see the beauty but he can longer enjoy it. His world might not be perfect but he lives in an amazing place has a great job good friends and yet his broken heart can't take it anymore.The film will rank as one of the greatest romantic tragedies of all time peppered with flashbacks of George's happier times and showing the contrast of wasted possibilities nothing will prepare the audience for the shocking ending and it might lead to a never ending debate of whether the ending fits the rest of the film. I believe A Single Man is an amazing accomplishment led by the best male performance of the year one full of complexity and going beyond gimmicks much like Vivien Leigh gave us a full character with its contradictions and an incredible range here comes Firth showing how an another can give us a lifetime of experience in 90 minutes with a smirk or a sorrowful look that speaks more than a thousand words. He recalls Heath's great performance in Brokeback Mountain another character whose tortured plight touched us.".

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't fit my whole review here so please go to Lost In Reviews.com to find it and read more. Thank you.Would you ever suspect that you would love a film by a fashion designer turned first time director? I didn't quite know what to expect from Tom Ford as he told his version of the book A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood. I knew from the trailer that everyone was going to look their very best but not much more until I sat down to watch it.A Single Man is the story of George an English professor in 1962 that has recently lost his partner of 16 years to a car accident. With the disapproving family not allowing him to attend the funeral George is left to fester in his own pain for 8 months. When he wakes up from yet another painful night of memories he decides to end his life and we spend the rest of the film watching George live his last day with moments of clarity.We see George in almost every scene in the film and get little bits from other great actors here and there like Julianne Moore who plays Charley his neighbor and best friend who he has been very close to for years. We spend the most time with her and she does not disappoint. Charley has come over to California from London as well as George and so they have a past. She spends her days passing the time with a bottle of gin or applying makeup but when she has George over she is also very attentive and a true friend while still getting drunk. Matthew Goode plays Jim the deceased partner and lover and we get to know him from George's flashbacks. He seems to be just perfect with George. They seem to literally complete each other. Every flashback of Jim will put a smile on your face.Ginnifer Goodwin plays a nice neighbor and Lee Pace stops in as a co worker at school. Both parts are very brief and I would have loved more of each. They are both great actors and even in the few scenes we see them in we could see a history with George. I love Ginnifer in Big Love and she seemed just as warm to George in this film. Just with a kind hello or a smile in her eyes you could see that they knew each other more than we get to see. I imagined that when her husband went to work she would have him over for tea or something completely innocent like that. Lee Pace was in one of my favorite movies The Fall and I was actually taken back by the utter lack of use of his character. He completely fit the look of the other characters as well and already has a sixties look. Kenny comes along played by Nicholas Hoult who you may remember from About a Boy with Hugh Grant. He is almost all grown up now and not afraid to approach his professor and ask him some very personal questions.As George tries to get through the day so that he can get home and get things in order many things get in the way life. He begins to talk with his student Kenny in a way that might be more romantic rather than a professional relationship and he spends a few hours with Charley over dinner and drinks reminiscing their lives apart. Much of this film is spent making the viewer feel like a fly on the wall in George's life. At points in the story there is dead silence only the sounds of a real life and we are immersed in his world. Other times in flashbacks the pain is so much that the noise is deafening. Ford shows us this by muting the most upsetting parts of his life and leaving us just the images to be burned into our minds.This is not your every day mainstream kind of film. This is a film directed to a certain audience and open minded story lovers. Ford chose to shoot this very artistically and seems to blend black and white scenes seamlessly with color scenes and then completely drain the color in front of your eyes. This is a film that will immerse your soul and use all of your senses to encompass the nature of the story. The symbolism is very faint at times yet so prominent. A gay man in the sixties is an invisible man yet he chooses to live in a glass house. The world outside of the memories he holds with Jim are very sterile and bland. Every scene is very gray and dull and seems lifeless. Until these moments of clarity come in and almost instantly there will be a burst of color that everyone will appreciate.At times the cinematography was so great I thought I might be witnessing a perfume commercial in Italy in the way that Chanel No. 5 would entice you to purchase their product to become beautiful and stunning Ford entices you to become visually intrigued with the characters. The colors and close ups of the opening scenes are where this is felt the most. There is a dream sequence that I am speaking of specifically that seems like it puts you in a daze. Sometimes the shots were so tight on a conversation I felt uncomfortable. I wished for a break from the reality and wanted to pull back but in the end I'm glad Ford kept my eyes glued to the scenes. In this way it truly feels like seeing through the eyes of another. The way he looks at someone else may not be how you would see them but it's refreshing to have a risky director give it all to show that to us.".

	schema:headline " A glossy muted 'Brokeback'";
	schema:reviewBody "As his directorial debut designer Tom Ford has made a highly accomplished lushly  a little too lushly  beautiful film about a gay man struggling with tragedy  the recent death of his lover. The story from Christopher Isherwood's elegantly simple novel of the same name set in 1962 concerns an Englishman living in Los Angeles a professor of literature who in Ford's version lives in unreal splendor. He is like a Fifties fantasy of tasteful bachelorhood. His house resembles a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece. He has an immaculately ordered wardrobe housed in a beautiful wooden dressing room. He drives a lean classic Mercedes hardtop twoseater. Most elegant of all he is a suave Colin Firth whose understated suffering is tempered with good manners and restraint. Sweeping string music takes us back and forth between the present as George Falconer Firth goes bravely through the day and a halcyon past when he savored perfect moments with his lost companion of sixteen years Jim Matthew Goode the movie 'Brideshead's' Charles Rider a handsome young American met romantically outside a seaside bar wearing Navy whites now dead in a car accident on a trip to visit family. It's all too exquisite in its sweet sadness and George's friend Charley Julianne Moore a boozy divorce also English also lonely lives in another kind of equally glamorous dream house the glitzy overdecorated kind a fitting showcase for a woman whose expensive clothes beehive hair and elaborate makeup accompany a grand manner. And though George is inconsolable and his life now  the story recounts only one day of it  has been reduced to just going through the motions he seems to be offered some choice opportunities to forget his troubles. He's being relentlessly stalked by a freshfaced and pretty young male student called Kenny Nicholas Holt the BBC Skins star like Goode actually English but playing American who might be any gay teacher's fantasy. Coming out of a liquor store George encounters a todiefor young Spaniard Carlos Jon Kortajarena a former Ford model a dreamy Mediterranean James Dean with a Castilian accent who's ready to jump into the Mercedes and into bed. These scenes are all in the novel though one imagines George in casual tweeds and all the accouterments so splendidly on view are less significant in the book than what simply happens. Sometimes in this film the visuals completely take over.Even George's suicide preparations are nice to look at as well as genteel  the way he's received politely by name at the bank when withdrawing valuables and arranges important papers and keys on the floor for people to find leaving a handsome wad of cash for his irreplaceable Latina housekeeper. Charley is a great friend her invitation to dinner ttette at her place causes George to put off selfimmolation for a few hours and they share a discreet drunk together and have a wonderful laugh dancing the twist. This sequence is superbly done and Julianne Moore an American playing a Brit does some of her best acting ever. If it feels overdone on the other hand Ford's film is unquestionably cinematic in the way it drenches experience and memory in intercut images and what could be more 1960 gay than remembering a beach scene with one's lover as if it had been photographed in black and white by the German Thirties sensualist Herbert List?Even though it's a mite too gorgeous and glossy this is an admirable and in some ways quite wonderful film and that's because its emotions however muted seem real. Designer Tom Ford would not be expected to do things inelegantly. Gay man Tom Ford would not be expected to cast any but the most delicious young men. Colin Firth isn't young but his performance provides us with the richest depiction of an older gay man in film since John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday.

	onyx:emotionText "As his directorial debut designer Tom Ford has made a highly accomplished lushly  a little too lushly  beautiful film about a gay man struggling with tragedy  the recent death of his lover. The story from Christopher Isherwood's elegantly simple novel of the same name set in 1962 concerns an Englishman living in Los Angeles a professor of literature who in Ford's version lives in unreal splendor. He is like a Fifties fantasy of tasteful bachelorhood. His house resembles a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece. He has an immaculately ordered wardrobe housed in a beautiful wooden dressing room. He drives a lean classic Mercedes hardtop twoseater. Most elegant of all he is a suave Colin Firth whose understated suffering is tempered with good manners and restraint. Sweeping string music takes us back and forth between the present as George Falconer Firth goes bravely through the day and a halcyon past when he savored perfect moments with his lost companion of sixteen years Jim Matthew Goode the movie 'Brideshead's' Charles Rider a handsome young American met romantically outside a seaside bar wearing Navy whites now dead in a car accident on a trip to visit family. It's all too exquisite in its sweet sadness and George's friend Charley Julianne Moore a boozy divorce also English also lonely lives in another kind of equally glamorous dream house the glitzy overdecorated kind a fitting showcase for a woman whose expensive clothes beehive hair and elaborate makeup accompany a grand manner. And though George is inconsolable and his life now  the story recounts only one day of it  has been reduced to just going through the motions he seems to be offered some choice opportunities to forget his troubles. He's being relentlessly stalked by a freshfaced and pretty young male student called Kenny Nicholas Holt the BBC Skins star like Goode actually English but playing American who might be any gay teacher's fantasy. Coming out of a liquor store George encounters a todiefor young Spaniard Carlos Jon Kortajarena a former Ford model a dreamy Mediterranean James Dean with a Castilian accent who's ready to jump into the Mercedes and into bed. These scenes are all in the novel though one imagines George in casual tweeds and all the accouterments so splendidly on view are less significant in the book than what simply happens. Sometimes in this film the visuals completely take over.Even George's suicide preparations are nice to look at as well as genteel  the way he's received politely by name at the bank when withdrawing valuables and arranges important papers and keys on the floor for people to find leaving a handsome wad of cash for his irreplaceable Latina housekeeper. Charley is a great friend her invitation to dinner ttette at her place causes George to put off selfimmolation for a few hours and they share a discreet drunk together and have a wonderful laugh dancing the twist. This sequence is superbly done and Julianne Moore an American playing a Brit does some of her best acting ever. If it feels overdone on the other hand Ford's film is unquestionably cinematic in the way it drenches experience and memory in intercut images and what could be more 1960 gay than remembering a beach scene with one's lover as if it had been photographed in black and white by the German Thirties sensualist Herbert List?Even though it's a mite too gorgeous and glossy this is an admirable and in some ways quite wonderful film and that's because its emotions however muted seem real. Designer Tom Ford would not be expected to do things inelegantly. Gay man Tom Ford would not be expected to cast any but the most delicious young men. Colin Firth isn't young but his performance provides us with the richest depiction of an older gay man in film since John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday. If Ford overdoes the poshness he doesn't distort or satirize the period. Though this is an immaculate world  even a pesky little boy with a toy pistol is perfectly turned out  there is real believable suffering. George has his 'Brokeback' moment a flashback scene of the time eight months earlier when he got the phone call informing him belatedly and with the unspeakable buttoneddown cruelty of the straight world of that era of his longtime lover's death.

This is what happens when there is too much of a stress on form and beauty  it moves into the realm of make believe.

	schema:reviewBody "1962 wasn't a good time to be gay. When George Falconers's lover of sixteen years Jim is killed in an auto wreck poor George isn't even invited to the funeral  even though they had been together longer than most married heterosexual couples can manage. He is definitely persona not grata around the parents and other family members and he's told of the tragedy as an after thought. The Love that Dare Not Speak Its Name. Can't recall who wrote that but it was certainly true of homosexuality in 1962 even in liberal LA. This movie is set at about the same time as Brokeback Mountain by the way. As polite society put it George was a confirmed bachelor. As a neighbour less politely put it George was light in his loafers.Even George's neighbour long time friend and one time lover Charlotte can't quite believe that what George and Jim shared was real love Wasn't it she inquires really just a substitute for the real thing? No replies George angrily probably the only time we really see his teflon demeanour crack.A Single Man is a superb movie. Moving beautifully crafted well written and fabulously well acted. The only reason I haven't given it ten is because the ending is perhaps just a little too 'pat'. Fashion designer Tom Ford can feel justifiably proud of his debut as a film director. The movie is based on a Christopher Isherwood story and written for the screen by Ford himself and David Scearce. Every scene is beautifully constructed perfectly lit and the design is as one might imagine of someone with Ford's artistic eye unimpeachable. Every detail of early 1960s life is here from the interiors to the attitudes.When the movie opens Jim has been dead eight months and George cannot come to terms with the loss. Every day it's agony to wake up every day just has to be gotten through. George a college lecturer and an expat Brit has lost his soul mate his life his love but cannot even express that loss openly at a time when homosexuals were still persecuted. He is invisible and his grief doesn't exist to the world except for Charlotte Charley neighbour and fellow Brit who sympathises and yet still yearns for George in a naive way a feeling still lodged in the recesses of her underused brain that all would be right with the world if they could only get together. Julianne Moore is perfect as Charley a heavy drinking and smoking rich divorced fashionista with no proper job and way too much time on her hands as clever women so often had in those prefeminist days.The story follows George through the day he has chosen to end it all. Suicide will end his pain. He methodically puts his affairs in order leaving everything neat and tidy right down to the clothes for his funeral the insurance policies neatly laid out on his table last compliments paid to his staff and coworkers. He buys bullets for his old gun and in a scene infused with black humour tries to decide how best to shoot himself so as to leave the least mess for his house cleaner. But he can't quite get it right so goes off to the liquor store to buy a bottle of whiskey and while he is there meets one of his students Kenny himself struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. A series of people reach out to George in small acts of kindness throughout his day and the movie turns on whether or not these small acts will be enough to convince George to go on with life or whether he will still pull the trigger.It may sound like a rather gloomy subject but A Single Man is life affirming and moving and an excellent study in bereavement. Colin Firth gives the performance of a lifetime beautifully contained and you have to feel he may have finally have shaken off the ghost of Mr Darcy and his Thinking Girl's Crumpet tag forever. He is a much better actor than he is usually given credit for and should be a bigger star than he currently is. I would not be surprised to see both Firth and Moore nominated on the strength of these performances. This is obviously subject matter close to the heart of Tom Ford. It will be interesting to see what he comes up with next time.".

George is an English professor so that makes since but there all plenty of dumb people walking around who aren't going to shake the foundations of your beliefs with one conversation.Also A Single Man continues the annoying Hollywood trend of making homosexual main characters that have no other characteristics aside from their sexuality. All the conflict events and many of the characters are simply byproducts of the fact that Colin Firth is gay. I understand that gay people have to deal with persecution and I could never fully understand what they go through but it's not like every minute of their lives is devoted to the fact that they're gay.I also believe that directorswriters do this just to draw attention to their movies.

Trapped in the silent stillness of grief we watch as Colin Firth's character Prof. George Falconer tries to remember how to breathe after the sudden loss of his longterm love. The hopeless desperation of his character is beyond miserable. A handsome cardboard cutout in a suit he tries to assemble his sanity as the jaws of grief bite down.Every single scene features George and therefore the film never moves away from the heavy grip on the emotions  turning mine into a kind of filmic flatline. I felt dead and empty for the duration.Tiresome in its stylishness the grainy scenes and ubiquitous monochrome of the decor and costumes become as dull as the subject. Grief is dull if prolonged and in life as well as in film it needs to be punctuated by something anything else. This film does not give you that muchneeded reprieve from the horrid gloom it never lets your feelings off the hook. At times I felt as though I needed some breathing apparatus at others I was bored.Julianne Moore is brilliant. A strange mix of vulgar vulnerability a true paper rose fading into the night clutching her beloved bedfellow a nearempty gin bottle. You can almost smell her desperation. Colin Firth's performance is average he's reserved and English. Save for a subtle mincing run along the beach he is just being... well... Colin Firth. But with a stylish haircut and strange glasses.To sum up a poor man's 'American Beauty' for this decade. 'A Single Man' doesn't have half the character of Sam Mendes' masterpiece however. In that film the desperation kind of unfolds so it's much easier to stomach. This film is concentrated on one man and one problem. In a nutshell too miserable to be memorable.".

Sorry it took me a while but NOW I know why I hated this film so much.

Now Lord knows 'Milk' had its problems but Penn and Franco burned up the screen and made you believe that those two people were crazy about each other. Furthermore I was really pulling for that relationship to work and when it fell apart I felt badly. Firth and Goode on the other hand are couple of waxworks going through the motions and were incapable of making me feel anything.".

The script could've been written a little better. The thing that really p me off with this movie was the two year skip. It goes from the candlelight dinner to the stroller that fits three. You never see the coaching she claims to do the pregnancy or the birth. Who cares whose smile it has? And the most miscast of the whole movie was most definetly Jennifer played by Lauren Holly. Could she be any more of a wimpy loser? She acted as if she was helpless and she cried at almost everything. If they would've had a more girlpowerlike Jen it would've been much more pleasant to watch the scenes with her.But enough about the bad things. This movie had many strong points. The idea was very cute and likeable for anyone who loves Greg Kinnear and sweetmarriageromances. Ladies if you thought he was sizzling in 'As Good As It Gets' he was so hot in this movie my TV was hot. Or maybe it was electricity. Who knows? He played a great husband and an even funnier patient at the clinic with the hilarious nurse. Lindsey Hamilton was a husband stealer you could like and did it quite well. Joan Cusack cracked me up with her mortician stories. Danny's buddy was funny especially with the story about his kids' dates. Of course the funniest part of the whole movie was the B.J. attempt. 'WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!' 'I heard this was supposed to turn you on.' Man I was nearly falling off of my couch laughing. And watching Greg playing with those babies at the end almost made me believe that those were his real kids. He was a natural at that.All in all it's a movie that builds you up for the big finish and when the credits roll with the cute babies on the side...awww you're left thinking 'THAT was the ending?' I was hoping to watch some pregnancy humour i.e. Look Who's Talking but I was disappointed when it abruptly ended. It's not a terrible movie. If you've got a cool 95 minutes and are looking for a cute movie to rent AFTER you get engaged try this on your bf or gf and prepared for 'I have to get up early tomorrow.' this is it. If not just rent 'My Best Friend's Wedding'.710".

Finally Danny agrees to see an infertility specialist which hurts his pride and on top of that the new female boss at work is after him! Will the couple be able stay together and have the family they long for? This slight but very sweet picture is fueled by the power of the two leads. They are good looking charming and funny. Joan Cusack does her usual wonderful work as Jennifer's dear friend and Shirley MacLaine makes the most of her small role as Jennifer's mother. The scenes at the infertility clinic are priceless as Danny tangles with one very determined nurse. Those who gravitate naturally to the romantic comedy aisle will find this one very fulfilling. All others by contrast may find it superfluous.".

Will the couple be able stay together and have the family they long for? This slight but very sweet picture is fueled by the power of the two leads. They are good looking charming and funny. Joan Cusack does her usual wonderful work as Jennifer's dear friend and Shirley MacLaine makes the most of her small role as Jennifer's mother. The scenes at the infertility clinic are priceless as Danny tangles with one very determined nurse. Those who gravitate naturally to the romantic comedy aisle will find this one very fulfilling. All others by contrast may find it superfluous.";

Well for starters it was two hours long.  The storyline was barely strong enough to sustain an hour and a half but no they had to torture us with an extra half hour most of which was owned by an endless musical montage right in the middle of the movie.  Secondly the casting.  Greg Kinnear was strong and appealing despite the thin plot. Jay Mohr was alright as Jay Mohr goes.  Joan Cusak was delightful as she always is.  Jill Hennessy was stunningly beautiful and just about the only actor to put any depth into her character at all.  The glaring problem was Lauren Holly.    She was just awful and contrasted with the performance of Jill Hennessy who despite her shameless pursuit of a married man you actually begin to root for Holly pales in comparison  I found myself wondering why they hadn't cast Hennessy in Holly's role and vice versa. The movie would have been so much more easy to bear.".

	schema:reviewBody "'A Smile LIke Yours' is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense. I don't mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couple's desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children. People who tried that hard must've forgotten of the option of the adoption to which this movie is not kind to.Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the women's liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence. She is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids. Like a dumb 50's romance comedy Greg Kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interest.They are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant. Except they really don't do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number. The plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple don't do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. So what?The subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together. Jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by Joan Cusak and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays the intrested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friend's product. The subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although Joan Cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene.Danny Kinear is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in Seattle where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence Danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons I don't care to give away. Jill Hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for Danny. It is stupid and once again hardly interesting. The overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight. The plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing. Even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers could've figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that. Second the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silouhettes of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband. So even without mishaps present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funny.Joan Cusak should've been in the lead and someone else should've taken Kinnear's part. Cusak would've made even a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her costarring role here. This is definitely one to pass up.".

The male lead who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is.

There are various ridiculous and totally unassuming gratuitous scenes in the film for example with a budget airline which is devoid of any humor.
