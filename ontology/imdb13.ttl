	schema:reviewBody "A Short Film About Killing is Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski's feature length adaptation of the hour long piece belonging to the Dekalog series a collection of modern representations of the ten commandments set in a sociorealist Warsaw in Poland. This film 'thou shalt not kill' is a film essentially about two separate 'murders'. Jacek a young adolescent kills an innocent taxi driver in a seemingly motiveless crime for which he is tried and executed at the hands of the state.Inherently simple in terms of its plot A Short Film About Killing is a complex indictment on all forms of killing whether in the form of an act of brutal murder or an organised and legal murder wrapped in the arms of the law. Kieslowski clearly inspired by the humanissues documentary movement in the 70's has presented the film as a bleak and depressing reality. Filmed on location the run down postcold war communist Warsaw in Poland provides a cold and melancholic back drop to the film. The documentary feel of the film is intensified by the way it is filmed with no tracking or dolly shots just an observing camera placing us the undiscerning viewer right in the thick of it. This can make the affect of the scenes in the film somewhat sickening at times however it was clearly intended by Kieslowski who wanted to show how disgusting murder is. The subtle green filter used on the camera gives the celluloid a dreary appearance pertaining to the bleak mood of the film. This minimalistic photography allows us to focus on the detailed reactions and actions of the characters in the film which come to a horrifying climax during both murder sequences probably two of the most superbly executed murder sequences ever committed to film.Kieslowski doesn't try to explain Jacek's murder because he clearly wants to avoid condoning it with motives that might make the audience feel sorry for him. Instead Kieslowski simply presents Jacek's execution as a counterpoint to the murder of the taxi driver thus forcing us to compare the the horrific nature of both acts revealing the crux of the film. The first murder in the back of the taxi is with out a doubt horrific but the execution is just as unforgivable illustrating that although legal capital punishment is devoid of humanity and veracity in all the same ways as cold blooded murder itself. It is a brilliant illustration of the failings and contradictory nature of capital punishment which replicate the actions of a murderer instead of upholding justice.It was clearly the intention of Kieslowski to underline this in his film. He believed like many others that capital punishment has no place in the 20th century. I wouldn't be surprised if many who start this film as pro capital punishment end up strongly against it by the time the credits roll. If this sounds too presumptuous then consider the fact that A Short Film About Killing led to the suspension of capital Punishment in Poland. This surely proves the power of the film.".

The only impulse that drives him is destructiveness but his actions are aimless and accidental He finds a stone on a bridge pushes it forward so that it falls down and smashes the windscreen of one of the passing cars. He shoves a poshlooking young man into a urinal without any word of explanation. And he pulls out of his pocket that long cord and keeps fiddling around with it until he finally commits the murder he planned the senseless killing of a cab driver completely unknown to him a man who just had the bad luck of taking him and not one of the other passengers who were waiting at the taxi rank.Explanations will only follow very much later after Jacek is sentenced to be hanged. But even in the first part of the movie the audience may find some hints which make them stop short in their condemnation of Jacek's actions. There is for instance the scene in the photographic shop when he takes out an old and slightly damaged first Communion photo of a little girl and asks for an enlargement. Can you tell from a picture if a person that is on it is still alive? Such a question seems abnormal to the shop assistant. But only a little while later Jacek proves that he is perfectly capable of normal human reactions when he merrily starts visual contact with two little girls he can see from a cafeteria.However we also notice the spatial distance produced by the thick window pane of the cafeteria in which lonely Jacek consumes his piece of cake. A direct communication does no longer seem possible. He became estranged from the human beings that surround him when an awful thing happened in his life five years ago a fatal incident that he finally reveals to his defence counsel just a few moments before his execution After a boozeup he went inside a tractor driven by a pal there was that little girl right at the side of the road Jacek's twelveyearold sister the pal failed to see her and knocked her down.Jacek never got over this senselessly caused death of a beloved sister and therefore this accident may be seen as the origin of Jacek's embitterment. Like a train that is derailed by an unexpected obstacle Jacek's life got thrown off the track. The equally senseless death of the cab driver is just a logical consequence resulting from the preceding accident. And the causal chain reaction does even go further. For Jacek's death by hanging in the end is nothing more than a consistent continuation of a disastrous move of fate committed at some point of the past.".

I'm sure people have endeavoured to make a film that makes a city in this case Warsaw look bleaker and darker. And I'm sure that this isn't the most painful spiral downhill voyage any character has ever made on celluloid. I'm also sure that this movie is the darkest movie on every level I have ever seen.The director uses dark filters at time to make this movie almost black but all that is does is replicate the feel of the material. Which was essentially an anti capital punishment movie. We follow a young man's trip to the dark side troubled by an unnamed past this movie is a lot like The Machinist or Requiem for A Dream we can see this man faltering and we feel helpless. The movie is compelling the same way a car wreck is.You shouldn't be able to watch a movie this black from the start with a cat in a terrible position to the end with a human in a terrible position this is only a film that could have been made in Europe. Humans are painted in a despicable way but it's the city of Warsaw that looks like it's about to grab you at any moment.This is a very visual way of telling a story words are almost not necessary throughout the whole film except a brilliant conversation between lawyer and client. And another brilliant thing about this movie is there is not a the capital punishment law is wrong speech by a lawyer to be seen the movie tells you what it wants you to know without a lawyer ramming in down your throat.Subtle is best. And in this case a picture does tell a thousand words.This is a slow burning painfully beautiful look at killing and if you can sit through its 80 minutes of bleakness you may never forget its imagery.".

While he was celebrating his success the killer whose counsel he would later become was on the way. There were many chances for him and his victim to change the fate but they denied singly. From the beginning when the taxidriver open the glass door on which mapped the city's brown imperturbable face all the things happened afterwards seemed lead to the inevasible end confirmedly. Just like all the things we entitle accident in our lives.The sky above the city reveals a disconcerting light the camera perfectly captured the distance that blocked off the young man and the crowd. Sometimes when he was wondering where to go the screen was eerie half bright and half dark. Of course he could only choose the destined one. The killing itself took a long long time and was really horrible although narrated in Kieslowski's selfpossessed voice. During the long time when Yazec tried even struggled to achieve the driver's death he was horrified by any words the dying driver moaned and struggled to be crueler to end it and I was horrified by the dark side of humanity and tried to escape from the glum face of fate. The fifth commandment is You shall not kill. In the real world it becomes You shall not kill without proper reason. But who has the right to judge it? The lawyer lost his faith in his job finally he found out the problem was not how to be justice but to whom justice could be possible. And the last one is about ethic the reverse of laws. Yazec's killing was unreasonable even Kieslowski himself said that he didn't know why Yazec wanted to kill the driver. But is the killing of Yazec reasonable? Kieslowski recorded every detail in the last killing including the long preparing. The calmer the law officer was the more doubtful I am. It became more and more obvious that this rite itself is a bigger crime. During this long course every audience was put into the puzzledom of ethic. Kieslowski gave us a compassionate last shoot that the lawyer stopped at a rural lawn perhaps where the seed of Yazec's crime was sowed where his sister died in an accident and cried. But the question is still unanswered. When the audiences walk out of the cinema they are more sensitivity to the predicament of ethic of our time. I think that was what this great ideologist and filmmaker aiming for.".

	schema:headline " A powerful work of cinema.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is easily one of the finest films ever made  a searing social indictment against murder in all it's forms and the justification of a crime on the basis of human emotion without cloying sentimentality or the reliance of stereotypes which clearly demonstrates Kieslowski's firm understanding of cinematic storytelling concerns juxtaposed with certain elements germane to the humanissues documentary movement that was popular in Europe in the mid1970's. This film would be an important step within Kieslowski's cinematic works in so much as it would represent the beginning of phasetwo of the filmmaker's fascinating career as well as giving him a much needed degree of international success that would allow him to progress on to those other life changing works The Double Life of Veronique and The Three Colours Trilogy. This film can be seen as a steppingstone to those projects as the director effortlessly moves away from the more rigid sociopolitical aspects of his early documentaries and feature films like Camera Buff and more towards a cinema free of those realist limitations or clichs with ideas of chance and emotion really taking precedence over the narrative to offer us more than the usual dogmatic European concerns.Though the title is simplified to the point of irony the film has a lot things going on with Kieslowski on the one hand presenting a moral and humane message and a visual essay on the ironies of murder and statefunded execution as well as the depiction of the central character who as a product of modern alienation is never allowed to stray into the realms of caricature making the performance of lead actor Miroslaw Baka one that resonates alongside other cinematic depictions of similarly tortured outsiders from films like Taxi Driver and Naked. Added to this we have the world created by Kieslowski and his technicians that is neither reality nor fantasy but rather some inbetween living hell with a continually desolate atmosphere of damp melancholy that few films can equate. Right from the opening scene the filmmaker paints a portrait of bleaker than bleak squalor creating a place where children hang cats from drainpipes for kicks whilst wandering misfits drop rocks from a motorway overpass all the while watched by soulless faceless vessels that peer from the windows of suffocating claustrophobiainducing towerblocks.The central image of the peripatetic loner drifting from town to town with the weight of the world on his shoulders is a universal one prevalent in both literature and cinema history though it is important to note that Kieslowski never allows his character to plumb the depths of melodrama in the way similar antiheroes might by denying us of a firstact backstory. This makes the character all the more enigmatic... a brokendown loser burning with inner torment that we cannot understand until it is too late. The real crux of the story and the moral centre to both the film and the character doesn't become clear until midway into the second act in which the director allows for moments of empathy and compassion whilst simultaneously drawing parallels between the ideas of murder in the name of hate and murder in the name of the law. The two murder scenes that close act one and two respectively are without question the most devastating moments of cinema that I can ever recall seeing. The atmosphere that is created by the director and that matteroffact frankness in how the action is captured with honesty and conviction permeates through the nuances of the actors every expression and allows for the transformation from mere performer through to the fragmented reflection of a real human being. This makes the prolonging of the violence and the character's painful desperation all the more heartbreaking because Kieslowski understands his characters and more importantly understands his actors. The mood and feeling of an expressionistic viewpoint is further heightened throughout by cinematographer Slavomir Idziak's use of colour composition and strange approach to focus as he employs an optical smudge over one half of the screen in order to draw the audience's attention to what the filmmaker considers integral to the story at that particular point in time.The world of A Short Film About Killing is as murky and as troubled as the mind of our protagonist with a great reliance on the colours yellow brown and green. This depressing pallet almost chokes us in the final scenes when only a few sources of urinetinged light are allowed to break through the darkness onto the teardrenched face of the young killer during that amazing dialogue between the murderer and his solicitor towards the film's unflinching climax. However beneath the drab locations and austere realisation of the text A Short Film About Killing has a strong emotional undercurrent throughout though for much of the film it is kept secondary to the central message so as to avoid the kind of clichs rampant in this kind of film. As with the work of other directors from the same socialrealist background Kieslowski doesn't offer the viewer any easy answers  we don't get the last minute pardon or the spoken word narration heaping forgiveness on the world or a crescendo of violins to further the melodrama  this filmmaker presents us with a simple story and allows us to come to our own conclusions.Kieslowski alongside Bergman Tarkovsky and a further select few is one of the all time genius filmmakers and this is his masterpiece. A shocking work that forces the audience to ask some deep questions without the promise of easy answers. As a result of this it isn't enough to simply declare it one of the greatest films of the 1980's as this is a rare film that demonstrates the true potential of cinema as an artistic medium... a film that everyone should experience at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young unemployed man Lazar Jacek with a sad childhood drifts aimlessly about Warsaw.   He hires a taxi and murders the cabdriver.   He pays for the crime with his life.   The atmosphere and mood of this sombre film is established early.   Is the strange colouring of the film intentional?   The uneven lighting of the screen is unusual the photographic images almost overexposed in the centre of the screen while the edges of the screen are dark shadowy and without much colour.   At times the images with a preponderance of yellow suggest pastel drawings.   The action is slow and ominous giving a feeling that something is about to happen.   This tends to rivet the viewer tense in his seat.   What follows is abhorrent to the eye  the cruel bashing of a man to a slow and painful death.   Kieslowski likes to give us the detail.   He spares nothing.   The attempts of the battered victim to attract passersby is horribly exciting.   Jacek's acquisition of the taxi is shortlived.   He is soon in jail.   The defence lawyer recently graduated and uncertain about his own future makes an unsuccessful attempt to save the young man from the gallows.   A lot of this story we have seen before but not with such detailed violence.   The final scene when the lawyer visits the condemned man is probably the most moving.   The preparation of the noose the oiling of the device the placing of the tray below the trapdoor hold one rapt in disgust.   The message is clear  Thou shalt not kill!!   But thinking about it we wonder how this young life might have been saved if help had been given in his early years.   It seems it all started with his little sister  killed in a tractor accident on the farm when she was only twelve.".

	schema:reviewBody "If it wasn't for the fact that I saw Bergman's The Seventh Seal today I could wholeheartedly state that director Krzysztof Kieslowski's A Short film about Killing is without a doubt the best film I have seen in a long time. Originally made as part of Kieslowski's series of TV dramas Dekalog dramatising and updating the Ten Commandments A Short film about Killing details the bleak story of a young man who in the heat of the moment murders a detestable taxi driver.  When I say bleak that's really an understatement this is one of the most downbeat films ever made with it's specially printed photography and dreary Polish locations Kieslowski makes it clear that this is not going to be an easy film to sit through and although there is not an upbeat moment in the entire running time we still find ourselves compelled to watch compelled to listen to what Kieslowski is trying to say.The first image of A Short film about Killing is appropriately enough a dead cat.  Hanging from a railing as the title is superimposed on the screen.  We are then introduced to the three characters that will play the important roles in the story the killer Miroslaw Baka the victim Jan Tesarz and the young barrister set the task of following the case when the murder reaches the court Krzysztof Globisz.  Each of these people's lives are set up simultaneously with the use of crosscutting sometimes their separate paths cross briefly but never fully meeting until the end of the films first act which climaxes with one of the most brutal murder scenes ever committed to film.  With this scene I believe that Kieslowski is showing the audience that the act of killing is not as easy as shown in Hollywood movies and daytime TV the fact the scene goes on for as long as it does gives the viewer an idea of just how loathsome an act of murder is.The final act of the film may not be as strong as act one but the point of Kieslowski's argument begins to become clear.  An almost unplanned act of random violence is enough for the state to put all of their time and effort into the trial and subsequent execution of the murderer.  By the final act with the killer hanging from the neck Kieslowski's draws parallels between the dead cat from the opening credits.  The point being does this murder actually stand for anything?  This is a powerful film that will linger long in your mind and with stand out performances from all concerned especially Miroslaw Baka whose display of emotion at the climax of the story is nothing short of brilliant.  Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made. 1010".

I know all the arguments about capital punishment not affecting crime rates but to be honest I don't really care about that. It's all about an eye for an eye and allowing relatives a degree of closure knowing that the perpetrator who killed their love one had suffered a similar fate.However and this is where this film is clever the film doesn't allow you to see any real background to the character before committing his crime. It allows you to see only the act and judge the character on the act alone. If the film ended at the murder you would also believe capital punishment is not such a bad idea after all. Once we go past the very short trial A long drawn out trial was rightly skipped as we already know the fate of our young man and we get the one on one interview with the aspiring anti death penalty barrister we start to see just how screwed up this kid is and how the rage in him is not entirely of his own making. Just as you start to question if you knew your mind doubts start to creep in and just as quickly before you can really gather any coherent thoughts he is whisked away to his death and the act is entirely as abhorrent as you imagine it would be.The nasty high risers and grainy colourless backgrounds set the scene well and the shaded lenses focusing on the main character highlighting his loneliness and possibly his narrow mindedness made it a rather sad film to watch but it certainly is worth sticking with.An 910 is definitely warranted".

	schema:headline " Morality of Murder Krzysztof Kieslowski";
	schema:reviewBody "Although this movie concerns itself with one of the paramount taboos its evocative intensity is kept quite impassive. Perhaps the intention is to allow the viewer the freedom of choice to either accept consciously the facts of life with all its red in tooth and claw aspects a form of realism or to resist the blind impulsive irrationality of sado masochistic gratification with all its pathological undertones.Kieslowski divides his tale into three main parts  the first part introduces the three main characters  the candidate advocate who is being examined by the Board for his Bar entrance  we are introduced to a man of a sensitive nature thoughtful and unconvinced after four years of practice that punishment is a deterrent although he concedes that it might be a deterrent or at least intimidatory to those for whom crime is not a natural calling. He offers a reference from Genesis stating that the threat of punishment did not deter Cain from murdering Abel. The next character is a youth who walks aimlessly looking at cinema posters amusing himself in rebellious and antisocial ways. The third character is a taxi driver who is seen cleaning and shining his car. Kieslowski has given him a rather disagreeable personality.The second part of the movie has the three main characters slowly and inexorably moving towards each other so that the precise details of their intertwined destinies can be unfolded. The advocate is seen with his wife in the same coffee house as the punkish youth. The youth then randomly selects a taxi to drive him to a desolate country road where in a slowly enacted drawn out scene he garottes and bludgeons the taxi driver who begs for mercy on behalf of his wife and children. The viewer is left in no doubt as to the horror of the act as the youth raises a large stone and smashes the victims head with it.The movie then experiences a jump cut in editing as the capture and trial of the murderer are omitted and the thread of the story continues with the youth being found guilty. This causes the advocate to go through a soul searching period of whether his defence of the youth was competent. Kieslowski finally allows the viewer biographical access to the life of the youthmurderer  this is the only part of the movie driven by emotional values as we learn of the tragedies in his life and his need to be reassured that at least in death he would be buried close to his father and sister whom he both obviously loved. This is a brilliant preparatory moment as the viewer is made conscious of this up tonow abstract figure who up to this point had elicited no sympathy at all. Now the viewer is jolted into consciousness as the humanity of the murderer transforms him back into a human being.The third part of the movie  the final curtain is the carrying out of the death penalty.Unlike Hollywood where as in Dead Man Walking Sean Penn is shown walking to his doom still embracing his pride  Kieslowski depicts the taking of life first with the murder of the taxi driver in a long protracted scene and then with the Judicial murder a heart wrenching display of fear and struggle leaving the viewer feeling personally assaulted and gutwrenched at least that's how I felt.Only a master of the practice of art could have pulled this off. When one thinks of what to reference this movie to other movies don't come to mind. Rather one has to look at literature as I'm sure Kieslowski did. Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Musil's The Man Without Qualities spring to mind. I take the fact that this movie is to be compared with major works of literary art to be high praise indeedIf you want more than pulp movies then this philosophical discourse on the nature of life and death will leave you somehow enhanced and certainly more aware. Highly recommended.".

The next character is a youth who walks aimlessly looking at cinema posters amusing himself in rebellious and antisocial ways. The third character is a taxi driver who is seen cleaning and shining his car. Kieslowski has given him a rather disagreeable personality.The second part of the movie has the three main characters slowly and inexorably moving towards each other so that the precise details of their intertwined destinies can be unfolded. The advocate is seen with his wife in the same coffee house as the punkish youth. The youth then randomly selects a taxi to drive him to a desolate country road where in a slowly enacted drawn out scene he garottes and bludgeons the taxi driver who begs for mercy on behalf of his wife and children. The viewer is left in no doubt as to the horror of the act as the youth raises a large stone and smashes the victims head with it.The movie then experiences a jump cut in editing as the capture and trial of the murderer are omitted and the thread of the story continues with the youth being found guilty. This causes the advocate to go through a soul searching period of whether his defence of the youth was competent. Kieslowski finally allows the viewer biographical access to the life of the youthmurderer  this is the only part of the movie driven by emotional values as we learn of the tragedies in his life and his need to be reassured that at least in death he would be buried close to his father and sister whom he both obviously loved. This is a brilliant preparatory moment as the viewer is made conscious of this up tonow abstract figure who up to this point had elicited no sympathy at all. Now the viewer is jolted into consciousness as the humanity of the murderer transforms him back into a human being.The third part of the movie  the final curtain is the carrying out of the death penalty.Unlike Hollywood where as in Dead Man Walking Sean Penn is shown walking to his doom still embracing his pride  Kieslowski depicts the taking of life first with the murder of the taxi driver in a long protracted scene and then with the Judicial murder a heart wrenching display of fear and struggle leaving the viewer feeling personally assaulted and gutwrenched at least that's how I felt.Only a master of the practice of art could have pulled this off. When one thinks of what to reference this movie to other movies don't come to mind. Rather one has to look at literature as I'm sure Kieslowski did. Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Musil's The Man Without Qualities spring to mind. I take the fact that this movie is to be compared with major works of literary art to be high praise indeedIf you want more than pulp movies then this philosophical discourse on the nature of life and death will leave you somehow enhanced and certainly more aware. Highly recommended.";

However Kieslowski marvellously uses filters in order to portray a sinister world in this film. In an interview Kieslowski says that this film is not about capital punishment it's about killing. Any form of killing according to Kieslowski is immoral. He condemns Jacek's action as cruel and senseless. Meanwhile Jacek's personality cannot and should not be defined by the murder he committed. Jacek's goodness flows out when Piotr visited him.The taxi driver does not deserve to die. But he is not a very good person either. In this film an average person is not always good. A criminal is not absolutely evil. Neither an individual nor an authority institution has the right to take away someone's life. The only good person in this film is Piotr the lawyer. He has the character of grace that he brought Jacek's dignity back to Jacek.Overall A Short Film about Killing is one of Kieslowski best in the Dekalog series. It is the best film against murder and capital punishment sorry Dead Man Walking fans.".

He scares away some pigeons that an old woman is feeding he shoves a stone of a bridge smashing a car's window below he pushes a man over for no reason. This is a troubled man one who has a dangerous chip on his shoulder.Meanwhile a taxi driver is shown cleaning his car. He seems to have a nasty streak in him too. He drives off leaving two passengers behind. He sounds his horn to scare a man with two dogs. Fatefully he will soon pick up the aimless young man. The killing of the taxi driver is slow and brutal. The old man struggles for his life. The young man then steals the taxi and inexplicably shows it to a young girl who lives near the taxi driver. The next scene shows him in court and sentenced to death. The other figure featured in the first third of the film is a recently graduated lawyer who defends the young killer in court. Now the man is in the gallows awaiting his execution. The lawyer has one last conversation with the doomed man and we are told of a sad story that perhaps may have prevented him from being in the situation. The execution is shown in detail. Kieslowski doesn't hold back in this film. A film that will stay with you for a while after the credits.".

It is simply 7 horrific but important minutes. You will remember this killing throughout the rest of the film and long after the movie has ended. And this is deliberately intentional. As was Kieslowski attempting to make us feel sympathy for the devil the killer at the end by a tragic childhood memory. However it is too little too late. I felt no sympathy for the killer because I remembered the brutal slaying he committed earlier. You'll still emphathise with him at the end despite his crimes.I think if you agree with capital punishment then you may change your mind and if you don't it will merely confirm your stance against it. Even though this film is dark and at times horrific it needed to be made and the 3 main cast the victim his killer and his lawyer all deserve credit for their moving performances. Kieslowski his cowriter his D.O.P and indeed all the rest of the bit cast and crew should be commended.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1985 Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski became acquainted with two men Zbigniew Preisner and Krzysztof Piesiewicz both of whom weren't that familiar with film industry. Eventually Kieslowski decided to make his next film No End 1985 with these two men Piesiewicz as the screenwriter with Kieslowski and Preisner as the score composer. Shortly after the film was released Piesiewicz got an idea to make a film about The Ten Commandments. The idea fascinated Kieslowski but he didn't like the idea to make just a film but to make ten films each dealing with one commandment. They got their idea working the Polish television agreed to produce it and Zbigniew Preisner composed a score for each of the episodes. Krzysztof Kieslowski decided to make two theatrical versions of two episodes of The Decalogue The Ten Commandments Decalogue five Thou shalt not kill A Short Film About Killing and Decalogue six Thou shalt not commit adultery A Short Film About Love. In each of the episodes of The Decalogue Kieslowski used a different cinematographer and let him to give the film his own visual touch. Decalogue five  A Short Film About Killing was filmed by Slawomir Idziak who also filmed The Double Life of Veronique 1991 and Three Colours Blue 1993.Three persons whose lives have no connections with each other are presented to us. A taxi driver a new lawyer and a young 21yearold boy Jacek. One day Jacek decides to kill the taxi driver for an unknown reason. After the difficult murder he gets arrested and the new lawyer takes his case. Jacek gets sentenced to death and the lawyer is forced to witness the first death of his client. This same pattern is shown to us in the first pictures we see a dead rat in the gutter a hung cat and a group of boys the society running away. Kieslowski was always interested in the coincidental events that can change the course of our lives. What kind of a turn happens in life when something unexpected happens? There are some turning points in life when important things happen and important choices are made which can guide our life. I believe that there are invisible threads that bond people together. The question is to find those threads.  K. Kieslowski. In his earlier film Blind Chance 1981 he dealt with fate and destiny by showing different variations of the protagonist's life.The theatrical version is 25 minutes longer than the television version but the length isn't the only difference between them. In Decalogue five the perspective is the lawyer's and in the film it is the boy's. The episode studies the commandment thou shalt not kill and the film just killing in general. Many have seen it as a film against capital punishment but Kieslowski didn't intend that. Sure he as a humanist is against capital punishment but the film is a charge against violence in general. It just happened to be that after the film was released capital punishment was a current topic in the Polish media.To create the repulsive Polish reality the cinematographer Slawomir Idziak got the idea of using colored lens especially green ones. Green is often supposed to be the color of fresh new beginning and spring. But when you put them in a camera the world turns into something obnoxious. Kieslowski wanted to show the world which was even uglier than reality. By this technical element Kieslowski was also able to delimit the picture more and delete all the useless things away from it. Films of today are far too prolix. What isn't necessarily important should be cut out. In addition to the severe aesthetics Kieslowski also took a lot of useless stuff away from the storyline. He didn't film the trial of the boy because it isn't relevant or interesting. We the people should be interested in people. In his interview book Kieslowski on Kieslowski published by Danusia Stok Kieslowski says that there were three reasons why he made A Short Film About Killing. The first death penalty the fact that someone gets killed by the society of Poland happens in Kieslowski's name because he's a citizen of Poland and he didn't want it to happen. The second reason was that to Kieslowski's mind killing is always wrong no matter what the reasons were who got killed and who was the killer. The third reason was that Kieslowski wanted to film the Polish world which is pretty grim and dull. The audience never gets to know why the boy kills the taxi driver and that is very relevant. What we do get to know are the reasons of the society which rest on the law but we don't know the true humane reasons  and won't ever know. The film is about killing but also about loneliness that profound loneliness in us all. All the characters of the film live alone and can't decide about anyone's fate but their own. It's a tale about loneliness which lives in our society where people desperately try to get connection with each other. In our western world people quite paradoxically want to get out of the fuss and live in peace miles away from other people. But at the same most of the people say that the thing they fear the most is loneliness to be left alone.A Short Film About Killing is a charge against violence. Capital punishment is the most radical form of violence one can imagine. The film achieves to bond violence and capital punishment and to resist capital punishment as a form of violence. It is a profound film about loneliness in us all and how small things can change the course of our lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Short Film About Killing 1988 Since Cain no punishment has proved an adequate remedy. A soon to be lawyer responds to the debate on capital punishment with this quote at his exam. The older lawyers seem pleased and do not need to be told who the source of those words are. And so we are not told. Kieslowski one of the greatest of all filmmakers made a habit of this in his films he never tells us anything we don't need to know even when we think we need to know. In the Double Life of Veronique he never tells us why there are two women who look exactly alike both have heart problems why one feels the loss of the other without ever having met her or knowing of her or why all this happens despite no relation perhaps other than spiritual whatsoever. We want to know the answer but what good would that do? If we got it we'd likely be left disappointed. Whats left unsaid sometimes speaks the loudest. In A Short Film About Killing Kieslowski never really goes into details about why a young man brutally murders a Taxi Driver one afternoon. We find out details from his past but the closest we get to finding out why he did this is why he lives in the city now. In Kieslowski's world chance dictates the day  although it is not necessarily random. The characters in the film seem to be on a path of fate  the young lawyer the young man and the middle aged taxi driver. They are floating down a path presented with various different paths which unfortunately for all involved are never treaded on. The taxi driver is the best example of this. He has a mean streak if not for anything but his own enjoyment. Early on a young couple wait for him to finish washing his taxi. He finishes and simply drives off leaving them behind seemingly pleased with himself. Later he sees a drunk man coming out of a pub with the help of his friend instead of taking the fare he immediately drives away before the men can get in the cab. This mean spirited actions lead him on a path to his death. If only he had took the couple the young man wouldn't have ended up in his car if only he decided to be a good Samaritan and take the drunken fare he would have never ended up with his killer in the car. But alas he chooses to ignore the escapes and alas he is killed. The film is clear about what its trying to say in its main message Capital punishment is wrong and unjust. Fate lead to the death of the taxi driver but it is the state's vengeance for a man it could care less about that leads to the murder of the young man yes capital punishment is murder no matter how you spin it Sorry Weber. What is incredible about this film is that whereas other anticapital punishment films show that the offender has his very clear reasons for committing his crime tugging at our heart strings with murder in some form of defense Kieslowski doesn't allow us that luxury. No instead the taxi driver a jerk he may be is killed in cold blood without any legitimate justification. That is a bold step to make in a film against capital punishment. David Gale should have taken lessons. That the film makes this work is perhaps its greatest strength. We see that the young man regrets what he did he's scared he's human  not a monster. Kieslowski makes the final scenes genuinely heart breaking without having to tell us why. Yes it is the lack of reason which makes A Short Film About Killing work just as the lack of answers is what makes The Double Life of Veronique work. Fate has its way with us yet grants us opportunities to deny it without ever acknowledging them. What a cruel game life is.Oh and if you must know the film's unsourced quote with which I opened this review is derived from Marx in 1853 ...there is such a thing as statistics  which prove with the most complete evidence that since Cain the world has neither been intimidated nor ameliorated by punishment".

David Gale should have taken lessons. That the film makes this work is perhaps its greatest strength. We see that the young man regrets what he did he's scared he's human  not a monster. Kieslowski makes the final scenes genuinely heart breaking without having to tell us why. Yes it is the lack of reason which makes A Short Film About Killing work just as the lack of answers is what makes The Double Life of Veronique work. Fate has its way with us yet grants us opportunities to deny it without ever acknowledging them. What a cruel game life is.Oh and if you must know the film's unsourced quote with which I opened this review is derived from Marx in 1853 ...there is such a thing as statistics  which prove with the most complete evidence that since Cain the world has neither been intimidated nor ameliorated by punishment";

Meanwhile the idealistic Piotr Balicki Krzysztof Globisz has just graduated as a lawyer and is assigned to defend Jacek but loses the case and the youngster is sentence to death.Capital punishment is a polemic theme where many people approve or disapprove this sentence. The director Krzysztof Kieslowski uses one of the Ten Commandments You Shall not Murder to defend his position against Death Penalty no matter whether legally executed by the State in accordance with the laws. The provoking Krtki Film o Zabijaniu is a simple and melancholic feature with depressing colors and no redemption the performances are topnotch and the murders are extremely violent and dreadful however Kieslowski manipulates the audiences with the brutal sequence of the execution of Jacek and he is effective in his intent. The story isolates the victim and is focused in the killer avoiding any sympathy with the wife relatives and friends of Waldemar. The film never shows the widow of Waldemar and the consequences of his loss to his family. When Piotr is submitted to his final oral test he says that justice is flawed since Cain but serves as example to avoid similar crimes. In my country there is no Death Penalty but the present days where increasing violence is everywhere with criminals terrorists and deranged people committing hideous crimes would the families and friends of the victims agree with this beautiful and poetic position or would prefer the ancient an eye for an eye?.

	schema:reviewBody "Kieslowski did something essential important he invented something delicate in vision. It is a way of placing self so that the world appears to us as abstract but real. But rich not simple. Textured in such a way that the textures are in the environment rather than objects in the environment.This is so obvious a place to be that we forget that it was invented not discovered. Though almost no one else achieves this balance in art ever it has become already something we find naturally in ourselves.The way he achieved this was to divide his creative self I believe. One part he kept to himself and used in the ordinary way we do stumbling into insightful pleasure. The other part he gave to his creative partner and lover and completely bonded the two. In practical terms his partner created the situations and ordinary narrative shape. Dialogue.Kieslowski was then free to shape the cinematic environment. In an ambitious project he worked with what we call short form in ten related small films made for TeeVee. These are amazingly rich experimental successful. They are where he found and gave us that balance between outside and inside observation and intimacy narrative fold that vanishes.But at the same time he knew they were only sketches of what could be. He needed to take that careful balance into the long form. Now this is a major challenge because all of a sudden the narrative becomes a spine not a melody. It becomes the path in the environment. The environment in his carefully conceived balance now has to be dynamic. He did later achieve this in Three Colors one of the most important adventures in cinema.The way he got there was by taking two of the ten decalogue films and making them long form projects. He did not do this  as is generally believed  by simply adding footage to make a short film longer. He completely reimagined the thing from scratch. It is in fact wholly different though all the bits of the small project are in it they are now part of a flow. Though the thing is longer there are many more mysteries more story not exposed but placed in the space alone. There is a hint of multiple observation.There is meaning now in the car door that mysteriously closes as we see the killer dragging the body to the water.We owe this man this project this killer a lot.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

The series was to be loosely based on Kieslowski's and his cowriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz's interpretations of the ten commandments as set in modernday Warsaw.A Short Film About Killing their representation of the commandment Thou shall not kill is considered the only one of the ten films to have an explicit political stance reflecting Kieslowski's own opposition to capital punishment.It is certainly one of the strongest most emotionally jarring of the series as the slow melancholic buildup of the first act finally culminates in a harrowingly explicit fifteen minute scene of the protagonist Jacek's unmotivated killing of a local taxi driver.The second act juxtaposes this ruthless murder by portraying Jacek's own subsequent and surprisingly similar in its coldblooded and calculated method killing at the hands of the Polish legal system.There is a claustrophobic compositioning of shots throughout the film and it comes as no surprise that Kieslowski himself when interviewed put particularly stress on wanting to encapsulate the audience in the world of his characters. This technique emphasises the alienation the physical detachment Jacek feels with the world around him allowing an audience to if not sympathise directly with him at least empathise with his internal psychology somewhat.Given this creation of a character who does not directly relate to an audience they are not rooting for him in any real sense Kieslowski brings a realism and a certain courage in his argument against capital judgement by neither condemning or condoning his character's actions and therefore not choosing to go the easy route of say supplying all the answers and manipulating an audience into exactly how they should feel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must give the late director Krystof Kieslowski his due when A Short Film About Killing ended I had to think about it for at least a couple of hours before sitting down to put something to print and I know I'll think about it some more tomorrow. For those who may not know this is actually a longer 'director's cut' of a segment from the director's towering work The Decalogue a tenpart film which has an episode about each of the ten commandments this made up the segment Thou Shalt Not Kill. I had originally seen that filmseries years ago and a flood of images and thoughts came back to me at the time the 60minute version of this story about a young man who wanders aimlessly through a town has a coffee chases pigeons then gets into a taxi cab and leads him to a rural area and kills him then later being executed after being caught was great and full of passion in its argument for showing not that killing is right in anyway but that the death penalty is fundamentally corrupted when it uses the same sort of barbaric tactics that Jacek used in his fight.But now seeing this full film and thinking about it for a while I know what my issue is this is in essence a short story and if you distill the essence of the story down to what happens and its characters it would read much more like a short piece hence the title I suppose but that is why it worked so well in the midst of all the other 'Thou Shalt Not' setups in the Dekalog. Here we just have the narrative before us and there's a piece of the story that feels missing and it almost feels like it was changed from the reedited film.What is so strong and powerful about the movie is just how unflinching Kieslowski is about how Jacek and the cab driver and also the lawyer going for his exam to join the legal system go about what they're doing one is aimless one is simply enjoying washing his car and the other has to explain himself to a committee. They're all men going about what they do and the color palette makes this very much a dirty horrifying kind of world in my original review of the 'Kill' episode I wrote 'Its like the world is all gray like Children of Men... The music like a horror film.' And more than that there are moments at least from the DVD I watched where a character will be sort of highlighted as they're riding a bike or walking through town with everything else around them sullied and lacking value. So that when the violence does happen  both killings as one should say  they're particularly brutal as it comes as real shocks to the system.I think my problem watching this story again is that there seemed to be a lack of that yes conventional but possibly necessary storytelling piece  seeing the character caught how that happened even if it's just one small moment or shot or even seeing how the lawyer becomes involved  but it cuts directly from Jacek in the stolen car with his girlfriend at night to him being taken away in handcuffs being found guilty of the murder. It's hard to say on one hand that I don't want a typical Hollywood examination of violence this is basically in a way like a Law  Order episode but with all of the 'investigation' and 'trial' processes thrown out the window and on the other bemoan that there's nothing of that in the film. To be sure Kieslowski knows we've all seen movies and that we know Jacek will be caught but just a hint in this case would add something even just some context one supposes Piotr will be Jacek's lawyer seeing as he's now been marked to practice law in the first part but why does he take the case does he have to is there some kind of impending moral imperative for him  we only get the slightest hint early on of him being opposed to death penalty.And yet I still have to see what's in front of me and if it's affecting and it still is in all its stripped down unvarnished 1980's Polish presentation it's a horrifying drama and mostly about what goes into killing someone whether it's Jacek and how long it actually takes to kill the driver it's almost as if Kieslowski takes things further than Hitchcock did in his later years with Torn Curtain and then with the executioners readying the noose. But the heart of the movie is a scene between Jacek and Piotr  their last as it turns out  where the condemned says some things about his family and where he wants to be buried and it's hard not to be moved. Some of this may be slightly manipulative by the director  the music can't help but come in with the singer on the aria a common use in his films  but the acting is so natural and heartbreaking that it helps to drive the message home.While I would recommend the slightly shorter cut of this story in The Decalogue if you're seeing this version for the first time it's still an affecting piece of filmmaking by a master of his craft caring always about the emotional context and challenging viewers on what they think about a subject even if at the expense of traditional storytelling.".

It's certainly not a cheery film and most Kieslowski films are very dreary Perhaps the most realistic crime film ever made . Not much is said verbally with the main Character it's all told through his actions and body language. We have all walked the streets alone  felt isolated and alone. Much of this story is about loneliness. Even the victim is a loner finding comfort in his small confined taxi. I won't give too much away about the story. a must see and if your not a fan of foreign cinema this is one of the easier to follow told simplistic. It's a difficult and challenging film and apparently changed Polands judicial system it had so much power. A masterpiece but a little bleak to be perfect .".

	schema:reviewBody "A Short Film About Killing is a movie criticized for some really weird things which I can't see as a flaw even if I really try! For example according to some it isn't a masterpiece because it is too dark and too depressed! According to some it is not even a successful or good film because of the crime scene. I see this film as one of the greatest films of all time because of several reasons. The film itself is sociologically very important. It is a fact that Kieslowski is a great observer thus the film is also a great character study. Simply it is a very deep film. In my opinion the film is about idleness and loneliness first. The main character of the movie has not any ideal or a goal or a dream or hope or even a future. Kieslowski's distant approach to the characters makes this almost an objective film. There is criminal he did some evil things he is evil may be but the judgment and punishment for him should be the same or not? Yes the movie is visually extremely pessimistic depressing the movie itself the content is dark some scenes are shockingly and literally terrible but in the end it is a perfect crime film rather it is a film about crime itself and a quintessential masterpiece another masterpiece from the director. What I appreciated about the crime scene was the scene was not emotionally and visually exploitative in contrast with the negative hype. I couldn't see any art entertainment side sadism exploitative material or anything which is to disturb the audiences. Yes that scene was extremely extremely disturbing but also just a work of observation nothing less nothing more I mean the naked reality the reality itself without any intervention or cinematic embellishment. In the second half we face with another moral question another story another disturbance another horror. In terms of story editing the movie is very useful by the way. As expected from Kieslowski About Killing is a real humanist film like Lars Von Trier's masterpiece Dancer in the Dark. The final climax of the film is an example of being effective and or impressive without being artistic by an effective and real cinematic story telling. May be the only minor thing I didn't particularly like was the last seconds of the film the short car scene it feels like it is a little bit unnecessary but it doesn't mean anything may be I am wrong because that short scene also shows the humanism that the film carries throughout.".

But Chabrol is usually more interested in focusing on pointofview of the killer the victims the suspects the community than in any who'sthekiller games.  So 'Au coeur du mensonge' belongs to a relatively marginalised and recent position in Chabrol's filmography its most famous predecessors are 'Cop au vin' and 'Inspecteur Lavardin' although there are important echoes of earlier Chabrol classics like 'Que le bete meure' and 'Le Boucher'.However just because we don't know who committed the two murders until the end this doesn't mean Chabrol is only interested in artifical games.  The limits of the whodunit paradoxically give Chabrol the freedom from delineating the psychology of the criminal to something much more interesting to him in other words the unknowability of other people especially those we love live with and think we know best.Chabrol's films are so selfcontained and remote that it's rare to find him concentrating on 'topical' issues.  Here the subject is the alltoofamiliar paedophile rape and murder of a young girl in the woods.  She was last seen at a lesson with her art teacher Rene and suspicion immediately falls on him in one of those oppressive small towns where the Internet will never outpace malicious gossip.  If we didn't know whodunits we might think so too  he is lame shifty looking whiny and a failed artist experiencing mental breakdown who thinks his masseuse wife Vivianne is having an affair with a slick media personality G.R.There are other suspects G.R. himself his criminal gobetween and Rene's friend Regis even as the coroner cheerfully suggests a woman with strong hands and gloves  an exact description of Vivianne earlier.  But it is Rene everyone suspects especially the new Chief Inspector Lesage whose personal stake in the case she has a daughter of the same age as the dead girl makes her determined to bring him to justice.'Mensonge' is a psychological study in the guise of a mystery thriller. We are asked to follow Rene's reactions to the murder social ostracism artistic failure etc. and yet we're not told whether he's the murderer or not or any of the other characters which would surely be a crucial element in anyone's psychology!  so these two impulses  towards psychological truth and towards a mystery story which necessarily precludes the audience having any access to the character's psychology puts it with the same level of knowledge of characters as the other characters making for an effectively tense film which beyond its mystery trappings asks whether we can ever know anyone when trust or selfconfidence or faith in 'reality' is gone.The film links the idea of lies characters concealing truths making realities out of lies with art painting  Jacques revels in panoramas and trompes d'oeil the second murder is 'composed' like a painting. Throughout various media for the diffusion of  truth  painting TV books recitals  as well as the police investigation with its need for artistic resolution are highlighted interrogated and undermined even a last minute confession is suspect and the denouement appropriately takes place in a deep mist.  Chabrol's blithely elliptical narrative style further compounds our uncertainty.  As with every Chabrol the surface every character sees or creates is as treacherous as a trompe d'oeil.

	schema:reviewBody "Rene Sterne a painter living in a Brittany coastal town has resorted to taking private students that he guides in the art of drawing. A small girl is seen with Rene as the film begins. As she finishes for the day the girl is sent home but she never makes it. Her body will be found in a forest area not far from the Sterne's home where she was left by a criminal who raped her. All eyes focus on Rene as the police comes to investigate.The painter is married to Vivianne a physical therapist. They seem to be happy in their environment until Rene is questioned about his possible involvement with the crime. Vivianne wants him to cooperate because she believes in her husband a man with a bad leg whose work is not selling. The new police inspector is Frederique Lesage a Parisian woman. Being new to the area she relies on her colleague Inspector Loudun a practical man who knows the area better.Into this milieu walks a wealthy author Germain Desmot who lives in the vicinity. He has sent Vivianne a copy of his latest novel. It is clear Desmot likes Vivianne. He realizes she is somewhat dowdy with the things she wears. He goes as far to suggest she will look stunning in blue. Rene is the background seems to resent the familiarity between his wife and the sophisticated man. He has reasons to be because Vivianne has agreed to meet Desmot in a hotel. She lies to Rene although the tryst turns out to be a failure.One night while Germain Desmot has been at the Sternes he drinks too much being unable to drive Rene offered a boat ride to his house. When Desmot's body is found by a maid in a sort of courtyard brings Inspectors Lesage and Loudun to the scene. Death was caused by a heart attack.Claude Chabrol directed this psychological study about a tormented man. The director cowrote the screenplay with Odile Barski his usual collaborator. The last part of Mr. Chabrol film legacy is not as interesting as his earlier period. In spite of that this film shows Cabrol in a sobering mood. The girl's murder is only a distraction that resonates with Rene because he is made a suspect for doing it. Rene realizes Vivianne's infidelity but he never says anything about what he knows happened between her and Desmot. At the end it is Vivianne who comes out stronger as her husband falls into depression for a crime he might or might not have committed.Jacques Gamblin gives a good performance as Rene. Sandrine Bonaire had a bigger role in Chabrol's more satisfying film La Ceremonie she has a limited opportunity in this film to shine but her Vivianne is a complex character. Antoine De Caunes is perfectly suave as Desmot. Valeria BruniTedeschi's inspector is not one of the best things she has done in the cinema.Eduardo Serra the man who was closely associated with Claude Chabrol was the cinematographer. Mr. Serra gets the right atmosphere of the small Brittany town in the off season. The musical score is credited to Mathieu Chabrol the director's son. This film should be seen by all Chabrol's fans. While not one of his best it shows the director at a different period of his long career.".

He goes as far to suggest she will look stunning in blue. Rene is the background seems to resent the familiarity between his wife and the sophisticated man. He has reasons to be because Vivianne has agreed to meet Desmot in a hotel. She lies to Rene although the tryst turns out to be a failure.One night while Germain Desmot has been at the Sternes he drinks too much being unable to drive Rene offered a boat ride to his house. When Desmot's body is found by a maid in a sort of courtyard brings Inspectors Lesage and Loudun to the scene. Death was caused by a heart attack.Claude Chabrol directed this psychological study about a tormented man. The director cowrote the screenplay with Odile Barski his usual collaborator. The last part of Mr. Chabrol film legacy is not as interesting as his earlier period. In spite of that this film shows Cabrol in a sobering mood. The girl's murder is only a distraction that resonates with Rene because he is made a suspect for doing it. Rene realizes Vivianne's infidelity but he never says anything about what he knows happened between her and Desmot. At the end it is Vivianne who comes out stronger as her husband falls into depression for a crime he might or might not have committed.Jacques Gamblin gives a good performance as Rene. Sandrine Bonaire had a bigger role in Chabrol's more satisfying film La Ceremonie she has a limited opportunity in this film to shine but her Vivianne is a complex character. Antoine De Caunes is perfectly suave as Desmot. Valeria BruniTedeschi's inspector is not one of the best things she has done in the cinema.Eduardo Serra the man who was closely associated with Claude Chabrol was the cinematographer. Mr. Serra gets the right atmosphere of the small Brittany town in the off season. The musical score is credited to Mathieu Chabrol the director's son. This film should be seen by all Chabrol's fans. While not one of his best it shows the director at a different period of his long career.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a typical Claude Chabrol study of the intricacies of human deception betrayal failures of self and of others. It weaves a wide web of intrigue and who is the murderer is a question which almost drowns in the mire of human weaknesses which Chabrol's relentless scalpel peels away layer by layer in his surgical manner. The film set on the coast of Britanny is brilliantly directed as usual. And the actors in this ensemble film are all superb also as usual. Probably the outstanding performance is by Jacques Gamblin as the limping artist suffering from a prolonged case of painter's block. His wife is sturdy Sandrine Bonnaire a district nurse. Her performance is excellent as usual but the makeup person overdid her eyebrows far too much! Ever since his serious accident some years before he has experienced a collapse of morale and she keeps him going and also brings home the bacon. Meanwhile she is flirty with an odious arrogant man who is a visitor to their town with whom she then commences an affair. Where would a Chabrol film be without an affair? Who killed the young girl? Who is sleeping with whom? Who has the hard heart of a killer and who merely seems to? Will the Gamblin and Bonnaire marriage crack up or will it survive? Chabrol has his usual fun mystifying us perplexing us teasing us depressing us and putting us in our place. His main purpose often seems to be to prove to us with almost mathematical precision that we are all in the grip of an incomprehensible Fate that there is murder around every corner or behind every bush that no alliance or marriage is safe that betrayal lurks in every heart that we all have terrible secrets and if we don't what's wrong with us? which will devour us from within and that every situation is so complex we need to be able to solve partial differential equations for nonlinearities even to begin to figure out anything at all. And even then we will still be lost and wandering in a maze of extra dimensions! The amazing Jacques Gamblin of this film appears in Chabrol's last film before his death in 2010 INSPECTOR BELLAMY 2009 see my review where he plays three characters at once. But Gamblin's performance here is even better than those.".

First of all I love to watch good dancing and Shall We Dance? has plenty of it.

It would take more than any movie to answer the question but perhaps it would help one day just take a different road and open a new door?".

Having not seen the Japanese original and having known only that the movie did not perform extremely well in the US I did not know what to expect when I went in. I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie is very entertaining sweet and kind in commenting on people's little quirks. Emotionally there is not a single false moment. And there a couple of genuinely funny moments none better than the GereTucci moment in the men's room. It does help I guess if you are over forty like myself to understand the yearning of the main character Gere who has no reason NOT to be happy in his life yet he cannot help but missing something. I loved all the little stories of the supporting characters and I loved the fact that the movie took the time to wrap up all the stories in the end. I guess the movie underperformed because it was seen as a star vehicle whereas it is more an ensemble piece. That is not to say that Gere Sarandon or Lopez are miscast. Not at all in fact now that I have seen the movie twice it is difficult to imagine a different cast they all seem to be perfectly chosen for their parts. But it is really the supporting cast which really makes the movie work. It is difficult to chose just one but Stanley Tucci is quite exquisite in his role. Though the movie is rather light in its tone Sarandon character's observations on the reason why people get married is rather interesting and stays with you after leaving the theater. I hope Peter Chelsom will continue making movies like Serendipity and this one there are definitely not enough movies of this kind around anymore. This is a movie I will return to each time I will be feeling down. And a special mention goes to the soundtrack. Chelsom seems to really have a hand for picking the right tunes Serendipity soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks ever and here the choice of the music really helps to define the emotional core of the movie.".

	schema:headline " Great Fun";
	schema:reviewBody "I went to this today at a Sneak Preview with my daughter. I was hoping to not be bored. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find this a greatly entertaining film kudos to the screenwriter Audrey Wells who crafted an excellent presentation from a work originally by Masayuki Suo who wrote the Japanese film from which this is a remake. There was so much I liked it's hard to decide where to begin. At times infectious with fun and genuinely funny this is a great look at several aspects of enhancing one's life. The story was much better than most dance movies as it was less about dance and more about what it means to be human. For that we should thank Director Peter Chelsom whose only other notable work seems to be the film 'Serendipity'. In this outing the experienced Richard Gere who BTW is only a year older than me plays a highly successful attorney bored with his life in spite of being married to a stunning and still very sexy Susan Sarandon. He seems to have everything on the surface how could you not with Ms. Sarandon as a wife? everything that is except fun in his life. He longingly spies a brooding Jennifer Lopez staring out the window of an old dance studio in decline as he passes by on the L train each day as he goes home from work. She raises his curiosity enough that he thinks he wants to meet her. It's a dance studio with a sign that says that watching is welcome. Lopez immediately scoops him up for a dance class for beginners in ballroom dancing and there it takes off. His initial interest in the famously callipygous Ms. J is finally supplanted with a genuine love of dancing. He is hooked and it changes his life for the better and we have a great time sharing his new found joy. I was pleased beyond words that this did not fall headlong into what could have been a film of nothing but infidelities. That it didn't follow that path is a laudable tribute to scores of real people who do the same every day turn away from temptation. I think this is just about my favorite role I've ever seen Gere in. He played the part with great skill and brought out just the right emotions from the audience who applauded at the end. Even the great Ms. Sarandon adds an unexpected turn as philosopher with a comment on the realities of marriage that ring fully true. She made the perfect counterpoint as the amazing superwife who made us all wonder if Gere was nuts for being so unhappy at the start.As for the rest of the cast Anita Gillette was wonderfully cast as the studio owner Miss Mitzi. Her portrayal of the older woman who has her best days behind her is both touching and sweet without making us feel sorry for her. She seems in her element here. She did a wonderful job. Bobby Cannavale as 'Chick' whom I last saw playing a ruggedly handsome paramedic in the TV series Third Watch did a terrific job as one of Gere's fellow beginners. He also gave one of the biggest laughs of the film just at the end. We should be treated to more of him on the big screen he graces it well. The previously unseen Omar Benson Miller as 'Vern' and Mya who plays his girlfriend both added some warm moments of their own his in a more literal sense. The very good Lisa Ann Walter plays Bobbie a very funny character role she wore so well she nearly owned every scene she was in. Just about the best in the film was Stanley Tucci who did an absolutely brilliant turn as  and I paraphrase  'Just about the only hetero guy on earth who like parading around dancing in sequins.' He was great so great in fact that if he doesn't get a nomination for a Best Supporting Actor award he'd be robbed. He did steal a lot of scenes with no apologies needed. He deserved every one.The rest of the elements in the film worked very well to paint just the right mood. The sets were realistic and not overly noticeable leaving the attention to the actors where it belonged. The costuming was great and added some great moments of their own from Sarandon in a T Shirt to Lopez in an amazing gown near the end to even Gere's tuxedos and natty business suits. But it's the costumes of Tucci and Walter that are the most entertaining. The musical score was great too just right for the dancing and mood of the film. The sound editing was outstanding very enjoyable.We all left the theater with smiles on our faces talking about bringing friends back to see it when it comes out. It is a film well worth the price of admission.".

I didn't see the British movies that brought him the most acclaim but only Town and Country Serendipity and now this one. The first was clearly a disaster. The latter two should not have worked but they do. Chelsom depends very much on the charisma of his actors to pull off his movies combined with the whimsy he adds with his direction. With that being said Gere is very effective in his role. It is his character's likability that sells this movie combined with the colorful supporting actors that show up in Chelsom's movies that provide the final sell for the movie. I predict this movie will spawn an increase in dancing lessons. Like the movie Serendipity people will leave this movie feeling there is magic in the air and seek out ways to find the magic in their own lives...".

While the Japanese version was light and captivating this adaptation is a bit heavy handed. The editing of the film has a lot to do with out enjoyment and when the dance sequences in the competition are clumsily handled as it's the case here one wonders what could the creators have been looking at?The idea of seeing Richard Gere as the man who is intrigued by the dancing he sees as he passes the dance academy is not as credible as one would have expected to be. Mr. Gere is versatile enough as he already showed with his role in Chicago. The idea of his character pulling the wool over his wife Beverly's eyes doesn't come across as too credible. It seems to be a cultural difference that a Japanese wife might be less vocal and accepting a straying husband than in this country by an American wife. That's basically the fatal flaw with the movie in our humble opinion.Jennifer Lopez comes across better. As Paulina she shows a professional attitude toward her students but her chemistry with Richard Gere doesn't create any sparks. Susan Sarandon as Beverly the wife who suspects her husband's betrayal underplays her role with better results than some of her late screen appearances. Stanley Tucci's character is irritating at best and Lisa Ann Walters does what she can with Bobbie.Since you probably have seen this version take a chance and rent the original Japanese film and compare.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shall We Dance doesn't break any new ground but those who just want a good time will find it with this film. Richard Gere plays John Clark a lawyer who feels the need to spice up his stagnating marriage to Susan Sarandon no less by taking ballroom dance lessons from a beautiful and mysterious younger woman Jennifer Lopez. The plot is okay it just sounds kind of boring. The movie for the most part isn't boring. Its actually quite entertaining. I have never seen the original so I can't compare the two but the original is probably better. I was expecting this film to be horrible as the trailer and early buzz weren't that good but they must have fixed the problems. The cast is pretty good with the best being Susan Sarandon. She does a very good job and she has a fair amount of screen time. Richard Gere does a good job playing John nothing great but nothing terrible either. Jennifer Lopez's performance isn't very strong and the role didn't really seem to fit her. She gets by with an average performance though. The rest of the supporting cast are very funny and they keep this film moving. Out of all of them Stanley Tucci was probably the best as Link. His performance of trying to be a young dancer was very funny. There are other interesting characters as well that are in the dance school and are fun to watch them. Peter Chelsom directs and he sure knows how to make this type of film work as he directed the very entertaining Serendipity. The only problem with this film is that its too predictable. Its very by the numbers and doesn't even try to stray away from the familiar path that most romantic comedies take. There was also a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Gere so there scenes together weren't very good or interesting. The running time of 106 minutes goes by fast. The dancing itself was actually pretty good. It wasn't the best but it wasn't terrible either. In the end this is better then most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year and this film can be enjoyed if your just looking for a good time. Rating 710 entertaining but forgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I hear this title I first assume that it means the Fred AstaireGinger Rogers musical but this one is actually based on the same title as a song featured in The King and I from director Peter Chelsom Funny Bones Serendipity. Basically John Clark Richard Gere has a good job as a lawyer Beverly Susan Sarandon as a loving wife and a happy family life but he seems bored by all of this and fancies something new. He passes it every evening and sees the same beautiful woman through the window so he decides one night to enter the place a dance lessons class and he signs up hoping to be taught by the woman Paulina Jennifer Lopez. He may instead be being taught by the older Miss Mitzi Anita Gillette and he is just as clumsy as other dance students such as Chic Bobby Cannavale and Vern American Pie Presents Band Camp's Omar Benson Miller and for a while the woman he glanced at doesn't seem interested. After a while John does eventually get to meet Paulina she only wants to teach dancing not have a date but they do become good friends to the point when he has fallen for her. He has been keeping the dance lessons a secret from everyone all his friends and family and eventually he has become really enraptured in the dancing as well he is training for a championship Chicago dance competition. For this John is partnered with dancer Bobbie Lisa Ann Walter and he is against fellow dance student Link Stanley Tucci he obviously has Paulina watching from the audience but he is unaware that Beverly and his daughter Jenna Clark Tamara Hope are there as well. This distracts him at the crucial point during the performance and in the end he decides to quit but his life returns to a happy normality Linkn and Bobbie get together Paulina gets a new dance partner for a Blackpool competition and John and Beverly enjoy a dance together themselves. Also starring Stark Sands as Evan Clark Richard Jenkins as Devine Nick Cannon as Scott Sarah Lafleur as Carolyn Onalee Ames as Diane and Diana Salvatore as Tina. Gere is alright being reasonably charming as trying to escape his drab lifestyle Sarandon doesn't get much to do at all as his wife and of course Lopez looks gorgeous thrusting her moves and poking her bum out even though her mood is low most of the time. If you are a fan of dancing films and specifically ballroom then I guess this has a fair amount in it to satisfy the eyes as for the story in between it is lacking in originality only the dancing is worth watching otherwise it's probably only worth seeing the once a slightly lame romantic comedy drama. Okay!".

	schema:headline " Comparison to Shall We Dansu  JLo Acting and Few Comments on Dancing";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen the 1997 Japanese movie Shall We Dansu? only partially. The movie was successful in presenting the audience an insight about the Japanese culture and the contrast created by the traditional Japanese family and societal values and the spirit of the Latin and Ballroom dancing.This movie does not make sense as a remake. The cultural contrast so delicately pointed out in Shall We Dansu? 1997 ceases to exist in the 2004 movie. The most important message of the 1997 movie is related to the Japanese culture. This message disappears when the setting is changed to USA.To illustrate let's take the example of Gere being ashamed for dancing There is no cultural reason why Gere John Clark would be ashamed of his wife played by Sarandon because of his dancing What aspect of American culture shuns ballroom dancing? Why does he not just ask Sarandon to join him? The reason stated by Gere that he is ashamed to want more happiness in his life is absurd. There is no concept such as shunning pursuit of happiness in American culture and as audience we are presented no reason why Gere should be ashamed of this.Another theme in the movie that does not fit to the American culture is the reaction of Lopez to Gere when she thinks that he is hitting on her Kusukari's Mai Kishikawa counterpart of JLo in 1997 version reaction to Yakusho Shohei Sugiyama counterpart of Gere This may sound rude but I hope you don't join the class with me as your goal is one of the peaks in the movie where the audience is presented with the dilemma Kusukari faces as she is torn between her position as dance instructor and her cultural disposition towards Yakusho. Her reaction is soft and measured and takes care not to offend Sugiyama. Paulina's played by Lopez in the 2004 version reaction is extravagant She risks injuring a stranger's feelings to the extend that he may give up dancing and also risks losing a potential student to an already troubled dance studio. Although her cultural disposition to the issue is much liberal than her Japanese counterpart her reaction is much more extreme and thus unrealistic.Comments on the dancing technique The actors could not dance. Period. This is understandable for Gere and the other students. It is unacceptable that supposedly professional dancers played by Walter Bobbie Gillette Miss Mitzi perform such unaesthetic wriggling on the dance floor.Final note on Lopez It is unfair to present her acting as bad. She gave the character everything that the character needs. None of the characters in the movie required too much depth. Her acting is not comparable to a professional actress such as Sarandon however it is more than sufficient for such a shallow and unrealistic character. The fact that the character is shallow and unrealistic is the fault of the director and 2004 screenplay writer not the actress.In addition Lopez's dancing technique was significantly better than the rest of the supposedly professional dancers contributing much to realism or better stated contributing to decrease the unrealism of the movie. Her dancer's training and background including the fact that she actually took night dance classes when working in a law firm makes her a natural fit to this role. Her short performance of Paso Doble set in the darkened dance studio was very well performed.".

This movie was considered to be a romantic comedy where a bored overworked Estate Lawyer upon first sight of a beautiful instructor signs up for ballroom dancing lessons.The main character John Clark seems to be having a great relationship with his wife. But he feels like he can not tell his wife about him taking lessons. The reasoning behind this is unclear but it seems like he will cheat on his wife with the dance instructor. Of course after watching the movie you see he doesn't commit such an act. In the scene where he travels home everyday on the train and passes the dance studio is very affective. We are uncertain if he will follow through and end up taking the lessons.When John finally starts dance lessons he really isn't that great. He hides it from everyone at home and work. His family starts to see strange behaviors in him such as peeking in on him in his room and he is dancing around by himself. They are curious to know what he has been up to his wife goes on and hires a private investigator to see if he is cheating on her. He then follows John and sees he goes to dance classes.The best scene in the movie is when John has to perform in the dance competition. He realizes he is really good at something and debates sharing it with his family. When his wife and daughter found out they went to his dance competition. He messed up when he saw them and his daughter yelled yeah dad. His family then walked out on him and his performance. From that moment he decided he didn't want to dance anymore. His wife wouldn't let him do that because she saw how good he was!".

I enjoyed the fact that the movie showed that even though you may have a so called perfect life there could still be something missing which I think most of us feel at one time or another. I found this movie to be extremely funny and touching at the same time.This movie is more of a telling of peoples lives and emotions than a story of dance. The dance helps them to bring out their inner selves. I liked the fact that John Clark Richard Gere reflected back on the people that had wills done in his office and that the happier ones were the ones who took that extra step to get as much out of life as they could possibly do before it was too late.This is a story about a man who does take that extra step and follows his emotions. He sees a beautiful girl in a window three times from the train each night coming home from work and one night he gets off that train in hopes of meeting this girl who works in a dance studio. He ends up signing for dance lessons hoping to be able to dance with her and instead finds happiness in dance.The movie does an excellent job showing how John Clark Richard Gere and the others who are inept and shy and a little ashamed at the beginning become confident in themselves. The scenes in the dance studio are extremely funny. The movie goes on to tell how his wife Beverely Susan Sarandon thinks he is having an affair and hires a private detective.This movie shows how each of their lives have been affected by dance. The acting in this movie is superb. Richard Gere does an unbelievable job of dancing he is terrific. His acting is second to none and this is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen him in. This is by far the best movie I've ever seen Jennifer Lopez in she actually does a good job. Susan Sarandon was great and would love to see her and Richard Gere do more movies together. The rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job in their roles.I went to the pre showing of this movie and the theatre was packed and some people had to turn away because there were no more seats available but they did say they would be back to see the movie when it opened up. There was a lot of clapping and laughter during this movie and everyone I spoke to said they loved it some even said they would be coming back to see it again as will I.This was perfectly casted movie and you won't be sorry if you go and see it.This is a feel good inside movie A MUST SEE.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was that time again for me to sit down and watch another chick film with my wife. She got the popcorn and I got the bamboo shoots for my fingernails. The movie was better than I expected however. It was about this bored guy who was happily married with two teenage children. Everyday he went to the same job where he was a lawyer at a small firm and every evening he rode the same commuter train home. He loved his wife and children but was asking himself that eternal question that haunts all of us from time to time is this all there is? Is there anything more? Until one night on his way home he looked through the train window and noticed a strikingly beautiful women looking out the window of a dance studio. Intrigued he began to look for her every night on his way home and low and behold she was there every night. Until one night he decided to get off the train in attempt to meet this woman. He signed up for dance lessons figuring that she would be his instructor unfortunately his instructor turned out to be the owner of the studio and old bag who needed a little nip from her flask now and then to make it through another session. Until one night his opportunity came when the old lady was gone and Paulina Jennifer Lopez taught his lesson for that night. He seized the opportunity when upon walking her out of the studio he asker her out for dinner for which she harshly rejected him.After the rejection he soon discovered that it was the dancing that was filling the void in his life and not so much the fascination he had for Paulina. Richard Gere was good in his role as John Clark. From the movies The Cotton Club and Chicago we all know Gere's talent as a musician and a dancer. Both The Cotton Club and Chicago were far superior films Shall We Dance is not in the same league. Gere's performances in those pictures were standouts compared the movie I am reviewing here. If you have not seen either one of those films get out and rent them. If you liked Richard Gere in Shall We Dance you will love him in The Cotton Club and Chicago. The surprise for me in this movie was the performance of Jennifer Lopez. After being lamb basted by the late night talk shows for her performance in Gigli and Maid In Manhattan she did redeem herself a little here. Her talents as a dancer is undeniable and it was show cased beautifully here. She is without a doubt a very beautiful woman. I think her creditability suffers from her selfinflicted off screen troubles the on and off again marriages and romances the see through dresses etc. We get a lot of JLo over kill from the media as well if she changes brands of toilet paper Diane Sawyer has a 10 minute piece on Good Morning America the next day.Susan Sarandon is always solid and has that ability to make even a bad film mediocre. Stanley Tucci is good in everything I have seen him in and he has been in a lot of movies and did a good job here as well except that his role was a week one. His Character was responsible for the comedy relief unfortunately it was not funny. Embarrassing may be a better word. The wig and fake wash off suntan just did not work. All in all I have to give Shall We Dance two bamboo shoots.".

Richard is having such a great time learning his ballroom dancing that we can't help but take the ride with him. Problem with this film is the age barrier. I don't think anyone under 40 who is insensitive and filled with the arrogance of youth can really understand how wonderful this film is with its depth of understanding about the human condition and the joy of being filled with music that moves you to movement yourself and more importantly revives your joy of life and living.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING The author of this review loves challenging films.They Live is based on a pulp scifi story about aliens who live among us and manipulate us through subliminal advertising other mind control techniques and sometimes guns and bulldozers. Like most Carpenter films its artistic fun intelligent and does not take itself too seriously.As usual Carpenter's casting is brilliant. Roddy Piper plays the goodhearted but not very bright construction worker who is both the hero and protagonist of the film. Keith David whose character is just a little bit brighter is his unwilling sidekick. Piper's character sees some strange goingson in a local church hears some weird paranoid ramblings from a street preacher and becomes especially curious when the church is raided by 3040 police officers and the vagrant camp where he lives is bulldozed one night. Soon after he finds a pair of sunglasses in the now abandoned church that literally changes his view of the world around him. The fight scene between David and Piper while straight out of TV wrestling is one of the most jarring and bizarre scenes in the movie  it goes on for a very long time  which nicely and subtly points out its significance in moving the plot forward. When Piper finally gets the sunglasses on David's face he is vindicated and the last shred of doubt about his sanity disappears. From that point forward they are both committed to saving the world from the alien menace. Further description of the plot would approach a spoiler so I won't go any further. Both of the main characters succeed in dominating the screen to the point that it is hard to even notice the contributions of the rest of the cast. Both actors are surprisingly good though understandably typecast these are after all two very big guys but  who the hell is Keith David? look him up here on IMDb.com and I'm sure you'll be as surprised at I was. He's quite an accomplished character actor. Raymond St Jacques for all of his five or so minutes of screen time makes a lasting impression and Meg Foster is perfect for her ambiguity. Overall the character development in this film is quite excellent despite the difficulty of pulling it off in a decidedly B scifi genre.From an artistic and technical point of view the film must be judged against Carpenter's other works. Carpenter has practically created his own film genre and each of his films bears his mark very clearly. Carpenter's camera work is remarkable for its unremarkableness. He chooses not to use gimmicks and allows his cameras to tell the story without embellishing it. Like his version of The Thing this technique fits very well in this film as it helps the viewer suspend disbelief in what would otherwise seem as ludicrous as an episode of the XFiles. Carpenter often makes his own soundtracks. Of these the soundtrack for this film is very good but terribly repetitive and after a while a bit grating. Nevertheless its goofy redundancy helps to lend a comic edge to the film. Is there a point?I would argue that there is. Carpenter is always more interested in fun than poignancy but he doesn't shy away from recognizing the value of the material he brings to the screen. Of all of his films They Live is one of the most overtly political  as it carries some very clever messages about capitalism conformity poverty and the horror that everyday life can be for some people. This is all done however with a good sense of humor and an almost teenage sense of rebelliousness all very typically Carpenter. A great film for Bmovie fans intelligent scifi fans and those who enjoy film as an art form.".

America might be said to be operated more in such a fashion i.e. parasitized by the elite than are the countries of western Europe. Obvious examples of this parasitic behavior are the golden handshakes and backscratching exchanged between corporate CEO's and the Boards of Directors of their companies. But it is far more pervasive than just that.TheyLive uses the invisible alien elite as a proxy for our suspicions about how we are all being exploited by the elite of our reallife society and how these elite are subtly programming us to accept this exploitation.So the major theme of the movie is not as another poster correctly pointed out about being manipulated to be good little consumers in a crassly commercial world. No it is far more profound than that. Instead it is more about how the working class Americans in They Live are being exploited by the elite upper crust who in the movie happen to be aliens but who in the real world are a subsociety that use their collective power to exploit the rest of us.Unfortunately this movie sometimes has an unintentionally comic air to it. Still the exploration of that theme is so rare in pop culture and that theme is so profound and reaches so far into what American society is was and is becoming that this movie is a MustSee for anyone with an interest in politics and sociology.".

Where Frank stays with poor people and a place to rest. Once he gets there John watches television and sees some subliminal reporting by a scientist. The scientist is trying to get an important message on television by using frequency. John knows there is something unusual going on at a house nearby.

That box was hidden in the wall and when John open that box. He finds nothing but sunglasses. When he takes one of them John sees a whole different world. A Bizarre look of L.A. in black  white with images full of subliminal advertising messages are visible though special glasses. Then he notice the only purpose of these glasses are the civilians are mixed with aliens population amongst them! Directed by John Carpenter Assault on Precient 13 Ghosts of Mars The Thing1982 made a extremely well made film mixed with actionscifi elements and a refreshing scene of humor. Piper is good here he has some memorable scenes with some funny dialogue. The film's best line from Piper is I come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass but i'm all out of bubble gum. There is also an unforgettable scene with Piper and David when Piper asks David to put the glasses on. When David refuses to put them on. Piper and David get into a very funny fistfight scene that turned into a classic scene. The film might have a few flaws only depending a matter of personal taste. The Alien MakeUp effects are extremely awful but intentionally funny. The film ends with a great payoff. The film is hilarious at times and always fun to watch. Since this film like most Carpenter's works become a Cult Classic.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen 2.351 transfer and an goodDolby Surround 2.0 Sound. Too Bad Universal didn't release a Special Edition of this landmark independent film. The DVD from Europe Carpenter and Piper recorded an running commentary track for this film in a two disc special edition. When in the U.S. get out Special Edition ? DVD doesn't have no features. This is a amusing satiric scifi adventure. Underrated to be sure the film ages well despite awful alien makeup. Based on a Short Story by Ray Faraday Nelson titled Three O'Clock in the Morning. Screenwriter Frank Armitage is actually director Carpenter. Panavision. .".

The only real complaint that I have about the film is that the aliens when finally revealed are far too human. They basically look like a skeleton with bug eyes. Not a whole lot of energy seemed to go into their design. While They Live will never be remembered as a film that redefined the way films were made it still to this day holds a place in my heart as one of the films that just defines your youth.

I thought the fact that the turncoat working with the aliens that were brainwashing the public was employed in the media was a brilliant way of showing how the media moguls consider us to be sheeple and use their power to persuade any way they see fit. This movie was actually quite well down considering it did not have a blockbuster budget.I would rather watch this than waste my time on the Matrix which I think is a complete waste of time. The main plot of the movie was Nada discovering a worldwide conspiracy that used subliminal messages to herd the sheep. Is this not a metaphor of what we see ever day? The media commercials billboards etc use subliminal messaging to encourage the actions of the public at large.John Carpenter did a wonderful job. Roddy Piper's acting abilities were definitely above average which is a lot more that I will ever to be able to say about anything Keanu Reeves has ever done. As usual Keith David turned in a great performance. The reason this a cult classic is because it is a very good movie that requires the watcher to think.".

	schema:reviewBody "... And of course very well made because it's from Carpenter from his good ole days actually I haven't seen his recent films from the nineties or so so I cannot say how good his days are now They might be good also. The plot is bravely stupid if you look the surface but also secretly intelligent and deep just the same thing as in very many scifi horror and even action movies You have to look at them with open eyes to get the messages. I think this movie is much more interesting and much more realistic and intellectual than let's say some french art movie Farthenheit 951 or something. This is real art. It's from this world not from some artificial art movie marshmallow fantasyworld. Of course it's very funny film also. You may see the main actor he's some prowrestler? as some kind of a walking joke. But actually he is perfect for this role. He is like some mythological hero just like Schwarzenegger or so. He is a symbol. The movie is filled with really good jokes and oneliners that you'll never forget. For example when the main character comes to a bank in his intent to kill some aliens he shouts I'm here to chew bubblegum and kick ass! And I'm all outta bubblegum... And another comment from him after he has had a tenminute long fight with somebody Ain't love great! This is a great cult movie. I'm sure there are many people who watch this regularly with or without friends and remember all at least the good lines. Perfect entertainment. Recommended.".

I haven't seen that much of his 90's work but anyway I decided to see this and it actually is a lot of fun to watch.So the plot is that a drifter gets a job at a construction site in another town but in that town he sees multiple... assuredly crazy people who believe that some kind of mind control is going on between the entire human race. One thing leads to another and he finds a pair of sunglasses that manage to let him see that all billboard signs are replaced with words like obey and some people are not people but aliens that manage to assimilate our society. The end result is the aliens have all the wealth and power and basically use this planet to take all it's resources.So this movie is pretty much in the genre of others such as Invasion Of The Body Snatchers but one of my biggest problems with it is that through unclear intention I don't really know if it's meant to be a movie mocking it or playing it as a straight up action movie. I mean I like this movie but my expectations are rather confused when the guy can see Aliens through sunglasses and there are people who know how ridiculous that sounds like it's playing it self aware along with some of the effects used for the alien spaceships seem like it's out of a 50's scifi.Aside from that as I said I really enjoyed it. Stuff like the acting seems good in places but a little hokey in others from people like Roddy Piper although I don't know if that was the intention. I also think some of the effects are good and the idea of John Carpenter directing something like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers seemed like a good idea. I honestly think that if I saw the intention more clearly this could be up there with the best of his work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in November of 1988 director John Carpenter's They Live may be the film of its generation. Well if it's not then it's pretty close. John Carpenter is mostly known for the box office smash hit Halloween 1978 and as great as that film is it's my favorite film They Live is proof that the horror master had more to offer along with a lot of other gems like Escape From New York 1981 The Thing 1982 Big Trouble In Little China 1986 In The Mouth Of Madness 1995 Escape From L.A. 1996 and Vampires 1998 They Live ranks on the list of his best films. Carpenter's films usually suffer from low production values and above average performances from his actors but when you look past that his films really are very deep and well made and this film is no exception. What makes Carpenter so unique is that he really understood where Hollywood was heading during the late 70s and most of the 80s and for a short period of time he got his taste of Hollywood. He then realized that it simply only cares about making money and he spent the rest of his career as a true independent not following any rules and making movies the way that he wanted to.Carpenter was riding on the success of Halloween which was in its day the highest grossing independent film ever made. Escape From New York was another hit movie and by this time he was getting major studio offerings. He then directed his first big studio picture The Thing. This film was expected to be a commercial hit but unfortunately the film was a disaster and was even considered one of the most hated films by critics and audiences alike. Although The Thing has found a cult audience over the years it was the film that launched a series of commercial failures from the director.Carpenter was feeling angry and frustrated with the way the studio system was heading so he decided to make a film that expressed this anger which is where They Live comes in. This film may be one of the bravest movies in its day. During the 1980s we were being told to do nothing but consume. This film is a study of the world being corrupt by the media and how it tells us to simply not care and just make tons of money. The middle class are portrayed as villains in the film and that being rich and successful is the only way to be happy while poor working class people are being treated as useless. We all believe that fame and fortune is what makes us somebody but Carpenter wasn't about to become a sell out and instead he dealt with his anger by making this film and when you look at it now you can't help but think what an honest direction that was to go in.But this movie isn't just for deep thinkers it is also a kick ass scifi action movie and it's a lot of fun too. Sure the movie is goofy at times and very B movie material but to me that's a positive aspect I think that was the perfect way to portray the story. I would put this movie up there with A Clockwork Orange 1971 even as pretentious as that sounds.".

	schema:reviewBody "THEY LIVE 1988 is one of those 80s movies that eluded me as I was growing up. The two adjectives that you hear most about 80s movies are 'dated' and 'trivial'. But a funny thing has happened to movies in the 00s. Most movies now are really indistinguishable from each other no matter what the genre. Summer movies are big on special effects with no story or good characters. Nonsummer movies are either boring Indie flicks or dull mainstream bids to win Oscars. And every other movie is now a remake or a reboot! But in the 80s it seemed like a movie could be about almost ANYTHING and still be entertaining! Even a lot of bad ones are getting rediscovered as cult classics! Go figure.They Live is another 80s movie that has managed to reach the level of cult status but that's not surprising given the source...John Carpenter! Who is fast moving up my list of favorite directors! I already had been a big fan since the 80s of his noholdsbarred cult action comedy Big Trouble in Little China and have recently gotten around to watching and loving! his atmospheric and spooky horror flick The Fog. There's a nonchalance and unassuming quality with which Carpenter directs his flicks that is really inviting. He doesn't overdo it with camera action or music. Rather he focuses on the characters and dialog allow them to drive the action rather than the other way around and sets a tone and mood that permeates throughout his movies. They Live starts off very methodical and slow establishing the main character and a couple of minor ones very well while setting an ominous foreboding tone and once it gets going it REALLY gets going! It had been years since I'd seen it until recently but I remember totally liking this effort and now have come to appreciate for how psychic and clever it really is!They Live stars 80s wrestling icon Roddy Piper in a surprisingly persuasive performance as a John Doe style drifter who finds work at an LA construction site. There he meets fellow worker Frank a solid Keith David and the 2 live at a local shelter that is run by Gilbert reliably played by Peter Jason who later played a role in Carpenter's anthology flick Body Bags. Piper's character finds out that the shelter is a front for a secret organization that gets raided by the police but not before Piper finds a box of sunglasses in the group's hideout. After donning a pair of the glasses he sees the light! The world has been infiltrated by aliens who have worked their way up through societal ranks and hold key positions of power and authority businessmen police newscasters politicians and all the signs and media carry subliminal messages that force the general populace to conform submit and obey! Then there is this long sequence where Piper discovers the magnitude and scope of the alien threat via the sunglasses that is truly spooky and scary and he proceeds to go on an alienkilling spree! During his escape he kidnaps a local yuppie named Holly played by the beautiful Meg Foster in an alltoosmall role and tries to convince her of the alien threat.While They Live has several moments of hilarity most notably in some of Piper's dialog and has a comic air about it at times it is mostly a serious film with an important message. Piper's blas dialog actually complements the horror and action scenes as it's coming from a character that is at a crossroads in his life he's homeless with little to no hope of a good future and is in last straw mode BUT he also has a heart as illustrated in his connections with both Holly and Frank and morals and defeating the aliens is his way of saying that he does count and can make a difference.Yeah I know it all sounds cheesy and clich but the movie never feels like that to me. While the effects are cheap which is intended since this is a very low budget B movie and the dialog is purposefully tongueincheek the message and the way Carpenter tells the story is most certainly NOT cheesy or cornball! They Live is actually one of the more provocative lowbudget flicks I've ever seen! The drab blackandwhite world that is relayed through the sunglasses is actually pretty scarylooking relaying a cold and empty feeling. The movie is actually pretty disturbing and violent with the big alleyway fight scene as well as the attacks on the shelter and the underground basement and of course in the climax. The main stars Piper David and Foster really do a great job with the serious moments and making the viewer believe in the imminent threat.The film's ending is simply smashing simultaneously ambiguous and yet somehow uplifting. They Live is a pleasing blend of horror satire comedy action and is grounded in a lot of truth! My fave from John Carpenter!".

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to one of the most iconic modern scifi action movies made. A film that has gone on to inspire the work of artist Sheppard Fairey amongst an endless list of eternally grateful filmmakers. Its director the legendary and criminally understated John Carpenter absolutely hated it seeing as it was the movie that burned him out labelled him a commercial failure and saw him retreat prematurely into semiretirement! One of the few original movies of the 20th Century that is highly coveted as a bible of hidden truths in a world of elitism conspiracy and the fate of man's freedom where capitalism and corporate rule are destroying the world I don't think it was ever meant to be so clever so deep or foreboding but what would otherwise be an average '80s action movie is instead a shout against the alienation and segregation of the middle and lower classes thanks to the ignorance of the super wealthy.Starring WWE superstar Rowdy Roddy Piper in a fascinating and often intense lead role as drifter John Nada our relenting and reluctant hero stumbles upon a Los Angeles where the unemployed and homeless are being driven out as alien beings in disguise sit at the top of the economic hierarchy acclimatising the globe to their own preference.Upon witnessing the carnage first hand and then discovering a way he can separate the aliens from humans Nada goes on the rampage catching the attention of the underground resistance who've been planning a way to expose the alien threat for some time. Nada and his new friends have one chance to make it right or die as the armies of the enemy close in to exterminate them all.As usual with any '80s Carpenter movie you might not know his family of goto character actors Peter Jason Keith David George Buck Flower etc. but they are all naturals and they really add to the atmosphere. Keith David had always been a great costar and put even more into his work alongside Rowdy than even with Kurt Russell in 'The Thing.' The fight they have in the alleyway is painful to watch. You'll never see a street fight like it ever again.In terms of cinematography it's the staple Carpenter look widescreen film format always perfectly shot and a pleasure to watch. In terms of soundtrack it's Carpenter's least effective but with that slowbeating western style every time Nada's on screen and counting his woes it serves the character and the story so it's not distracting.As for action Arnie and Stallone must have blushed for sure and Carpenter always having been ahead of his time gave a kind of arcade game first person shooter feel to some of the shootouts which is really interesting considering he's retired from the business to sit and play XBox all day every day.Other cons it has some boring quiet moments that don't work as well as they could have and the strain on Carpenter's creative muscle does show at times through some clunky scenes and empty dialogue. There lacks a little chemistry between Rowdy and leading lady Meg Foster though I think we're supposed to notice that for a reason.On a whole it's like the scifi action movie Walter Hill never made. Imagine that Hill and Schwarzenegger made this instead of 'Red Heat' because you could watch them back to back on a Saturday night and have the time of your life without a doubt.Not perfect but so horribly underrated. I hope Carpenter now realises how 'They Live' had to wait a couple decades to be really appreciated. Because for those of us who understand the message it's really true They Live We Sleep!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah... the 1980s where flamboyance was accompanied in films whereas today's films highest aspiration is to make sure that you are numb and applaud for it with its own exceptions. This film displays the surface world and later reveals what lays behind it. Nada appears to be the average Joe Blow just going about his day radiating in such a way that something curious resides within himself. He is living a time in the USA where employment was not adequate. After the changing of circumstances he realises what is happening in the world and initially stuns him.The camerawork tends to draw attention and generates interest while being aesthetic. The framing in this film is done in a way that highlights several aspects and details that the story contains. Also it helps to create a sense of wonder which complements the setting.The music for this movie is simple and yet captures the feeling of the scenes with ease. They did not use many instruments for each track so it does impress with how it impacts with what is occurring when watching.The storyline and the plot is what makes this film outstanding and it is better to spare unraveling it. If you are the sort of person who likes depth its likely that you are going to like and enjoy the film. If you are someone who just wants to get his or her kicks thinking that it would be a generic film or a numb film then it is not for you. As it is possible that it would stir emotions. Supposing that you would like to watch it anyway then why not.Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably one of the most overlooked and underrated films by Carpenter yet possibly his most clever. All his own work and a quite beautiful look at how paranoia and fear within an ever decreasing economy can be exploited for a good story.Now I'm not saying all Americans are suspicious conspiracy theory doom mongers but this film exposes that ever present trait whilst also scratching at the notion of constant gross consumer consumption greed and subversive subliminal messages touching on hypnosis and domination.To be honest the whole idea just shows how some Americans including Carpenter think most of the time always looking over their shoulder and suspicious.As for the film its a romp that just keeps going and you wanna know how it ends. The start is slow and dull it takes time to get going but once Nada finds the sunglasses of truth things get really interesting in a good way. I love how Carpenter made this film its dated but still looks great as it has that nice Bmovie look which is mainly down to the budget. Think of it as an unintentional result that happens to fit the whole films concept perfectly. Classic 50's alien Bmovie fluff enhanced with time.The whole idea is really very clever and imagined so well. We see the alien corrupted world controlling the now unaware obedient humans in their daily lives through the black and white shades Nada finds. Without the shades the world appears normal an illusion created to blinker or fog human eyes.The aliens only appear when the shades are on and boy do they look creepy. Even though its obviously a simple mask the makeup and design is superbly created and really gives an eerie effect. That skeletal skull look with those quite scary eyes!I have always been surprised with the great performance by Piper also. The guy was a WWF wrestler at the time for Gods sake yet his acting here is great just perfect. He really carries off the suspicion and awakening of the story to a tee. As for his character of Nada...all I can say is the guy certainly has an element of Jack Burton if you ask me. 'I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass...and I'm all out of bubblegum'I also like how this film isn't predictable. It keeps you guessing and you're never sure how it will end or who will survive.The subtle political jabs crazy ass humour and out n out action is a curious blend but like Carpenter's 86 film 'Big Trouble in Little China' he manages to pull it off with ease and create another cult on his filmography. A great comicbook tale of mindless mediaadvertising supremacy on an Orwellian alien monitored Earth. 'Brother life's a bitch... and she's back in heat'810".

Filled with suspense action and quirky humor this film has put me on a Carpenter binge.ReviewIf you're a conspiracy theorist this film will blow you away. One reason this is true is because how the 'uncovering' is played out. It seems that the enlightenment that our nameless character experiences is much like the creepy terms sooner than you think and before you know it in which the events you just discovered have already tread an almost irreversible path. In addition there are always a million people who just aren't going to believe a word you're saying. And this aspect is evident during a pretty gnarly fight sequence.The humor of this film is awesome. Our nameless character is a buffall American tough guy who makes parody of the Stallone and Schwarzenegger personas giving a clear idea of the tone Carpenter possesses in regards to those types of action figures. With cheap clich idioms and catchphrases Carpenter owns this aspect of the film creating a character whose comic appeal turns out being more badass than Stallone or Schwarzenegger.Many have complained about the special effects of this film giving it a poor review. I might contend that the special effects although cheap in fact ADD to the strange and bizarre nature of the world that our nameless character uncovers.Obey my command and see this film.

Well piper is very scared and confused when he finds this out so he turns to his friend kieth Davidhis AfricanAmerican coworkerfor some assistance but he refuses to try the glasses on even just for style. So this is where the best part of the movie happens Piper doesn't like that he won't try them on so a 62 minute fight scene ensueskeep in mind the movie is only 90 minutes long. You would think this would get boring but the fight is so good you will be in awe the whole time and if you are a woman you will have to change undies.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie today opened yesterday here and was simply delighted.I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are a the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man b the extensive malefemale humor arising out of that basic conceit and c some of the names including Viola  Duke.Aside from those names the thematic commonalties a  b are really great themes for any script and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that though this really is a simply delightful and very contemporarytraditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.The movie is bright fastpaced emotive stylized funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and malefemale humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing overthetop fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard it's not that kind of a movie things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next splitsecond happening.Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola  Sebastian Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this movie today opened yesterday here and was simply delighted.I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are a the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man b the extensive malefemale humor arising out of that basic conceit and c some of the names including Viola  Duke.Aside from those names the thematic commonalties a  b are really great themes for any script and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that though this really is a simply delightful and very contemporarytraditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.The movie is bright fastpaced emotive stylized funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and malefemale humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing overthetop fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard it's not that kind of a movie things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next splitsecond happening.Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola  Sebastian Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!";

The actors were perfectly cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives. She is so refreshing.

Of course love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother. She also has a girl who is chasing after her.

	schema:reviewBody "She's The Man was everything I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teen type chick flick films and I knew this one would be great!! In the same vein as 10 Things I Hate About You one of my all time faves She's The Man is a unique well written very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy I have seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther. But She's The Man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script Three's Company style story of mistaken identities and mixed messages and the cast.Amanda Bynes is a star!! Even since the days of the horribly campy yet strangely entertaining The Amanda Show she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. Her style of physical comedy impersonations and witty dialect makes her hilarious. Previously her big screen debut where she was the star was the rather hilarious and well made What A Girl Wants. If that wasn't her break out vehicle than She's The Man takes care of that hands down. Bynes is really the ultimate girl next door. It's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next It girl. She is the All American cute down to earth bubbly teen although she's twenty now and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen. But for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! She actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable. Not entirely...but believable enough. Most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious non stop laughs. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's Havoc by plays Duke. He's the jock the captain of the soccer team and eventually Bynes' object of affection unfortunately he's also Sebastian's room mate who is Bynes. He's a good leading man and the chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia who happens to be attracted to Sebastian who again is Bynes. She does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as the real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is astonishing...they are absolutely believable as twins and further more from a distance you could understand someone believing Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between Bynes and Tatum but everyone is more or less supporting Bynes terrific performance. She easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth while.This is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film. Relative newcomer director Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this film. He weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together. The story which is loosely based off of Shakespeares Twelfth Night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film. It's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think. There isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film. Nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down!!! 910".

The film also had enough pretty people to make the setting nothing like any normal person's high school.

Actually the whole cast is great  I just happen to be a huge David Cross fanatic. The cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few I hadn't heard before but I know they have a CD coming out so I will definitely buy it.

	schema:headline " Bynes and Company Score a Hat Trick";
	schema:reviewBody "Though I hate to admit it Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have scored again. She's the Man is a ridiculous but ultimately entertaining teen movie which takes the genderbending action of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and drops it in the middle of a modernday American boarding school. The premise should sound familiar because screenwriters Lutz and Smith also penned 10 Things I Hate About You another twist on Shakespeare starring the likes of Julia Styles and Academy Award nominee Heath Ledger before he was an Academy Award nominee.It's more of the same of course but seeing Shakespeare's work go Hollywood and thus be ripped to shreds continues to amuse. She's the Man also focuses on a decidedly less bitter heroine than the shrew Katarina played in 1999 by a very stilted Styles. If that makes the film less witty who cares? Not half of this film's target audience who came mostly to see Channing Tatum with his shirt off.Like Kat in 10 Things Viola Amanda Bynes is a tomboy and a soccer star on the women's team at Cornwall Prep. Her life is soccer which becomes a problem when her school cuts the women from the sports program. Better than most of the boys Viola wants to suit up with them but is snubbed by both the coach and the team's captain  her boyfriend. So it's end of discussion  end of relationship. Viola hatches a plan to pursue her sporting dreams at rival school Illyria where her twin brother has just enrolled. Twin brother Sebastian is skipping off to England for two weeks and nobody at Illyria has ever met him.If you missed the set up read Twelfth Night. It's pretty obvious what happens from here. Viola disguises herself as her brother and moves into the dorms where she meets her roommate and fellow soccer player Duke Channing Tatum. She begins to gear up for Illyria's season opener against Cornwall and has to navigate a complicated lovetriangle in addition to other challenges like taking a shower alongside her male teammates without them finding out about her girl parts.In reality nobody who looks like Bynes could get away with impersonating a 17 yearold male. Viola is too pretty to be a boy in other words dressed as her brother she makes Orlando Bloom look like a frostbitten lumberjack. This fantasy aspect doesn't detract from the film though. Viola puts on her wig and fake sideburns and suddenly she's the most socially awkward nerdboy you've ever seen. Suspension of disbelief works.The Sebastian disguise doesn't have to be convincing. What matters is that all the other characters are oblivious to facts that are obvious to the audience. The laughs come from seeing Viola get away with a ridiculous scam. In one scene Duke and fake Sebastian hug each other but Viola slips out of character and gets a little too friendly. It's not that homoeroticism or homophobia are inherently funny it's the knowledge that Duke is disturbed by being frisked by someone who is actually a girl that makes us laugh.Other than that She's the Man offers audiences the simple pleasure of Amanda Bynes who seems to be a natural in comedic roles. Her SebastianViola is definitely a caricature but it's a perfectly illustrated one. From her mixedup half southern half Canadian drawl her misguided version of the typical teen boy cadence to her crotch grabbing and Eminemlike posturing Bynes has a lot of fun and as a result the jokes land.It's a teen movie so the ending is typical and cheesy. While sister film 10 Things I Hate About You had a wild feminist streak in it and touched on somewhat weighty issues such as the pressure to have sex She's the Man lacks a serious undercurrent. But this is probably a good thing. 10 Things was at times too earnest and moralizing. She's the Man doesn't pretend to be more important than it is. It'll earn a spot on the shelf in between Bend It Like Beckham and Legally Blonde. And like Reese maybe Bynes will win an Oscar in 10 years. Anything is possible  just look at how Crash won Best Film.Copyright c 2006 by Lauren Simpson".

The strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. And so the classic tales of crossdressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Eve and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. And the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham another charming coming of age movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viola Johnson Amanda Bynes enters a prestigious boarding school disguised as her brother so that he can run off to London to become a musician. Unfortunately she immediately falls for her male roommate who already has a crush on a girl who now has a crush on the male version of Viola.Combining the story of Just One of the Guys and Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night may sound like a recipe for disaster but She's the Man is a funny charming and cheesy movie. The original trailer looked really lame yet the film turned out to be quite enjoyable. The story is clearly nothing new but it still works fine. The fact that the screenplay is written by Karen McCullah Lutz explains everything. She's good for harmless fun films like She's the Man Legally Blonde and Ella Enchanted. Andy Fickman does a decent job as the director. He never lets the film become too serious or else it would ruin the movie's appeal. He does overload on a few lame jokes though. That was the major problem I had with this film. Some of the jokes just fell flat while others were just incredibly cheesy even for this film.The acting was good for this type of movie and most of the actors were enjoyable to watch on screen. Amanda Bynes is full of charm as Viola. It was very hard to actually hate her and she's a much better actress than Hilary Duff. Channing Tatum was not as strong as Amanda. His performance was okay sometimes his reactions were a little fake. Laura Ramsey plays Olivia and she gives a decent performance. Alex Breckenridge gives a pretty good performance as Monique. Her character was pretty interesting and she had decent chemistry with Amanda. The rest of the supporting actors are good except for David Cross. He plays the school principal and his performance was not funny at all.If you do give She's the Man a shot then keep in mind that the entire film is highly unrealistic. I was reading some of the posts here and a few people are bashing the film for that. While the movie is pretty entertaining it's also easily forgettable. It was a fun way to spend 100 minutes but it won't stay in your memory for long. It's also not just a chick flick and a guy could also like the movie. In the end She's the Man is worth checking out whether that be in the theaters or on video. Rating 710".

	schema:headline " This is why I love Amanda Bynes";
	schema:reviewBody "Ignoring the fact that the movie is unrealistic and a little cheesy you will love it! I was already a big Amanda Bynes fan but this movie definitely made me like her even more. If you enjoy subtle or dry humor she may not be the comedian for you but she pulls off over the top humor like that of Jim Carey Lucille Balle and Mary Tyler Moore. You may know some predictable jokes are forth coming but you will be surprised at how they are pulled off and what original jokes are presented. If you are quick to judge a movie i have to warn you that the first 20 minutes have all the qualities of a straight to television tween movie but as the plot thickens so does the movie and humor. As you watch the movie you can actually feel the awkwardness that develops as Amanda Bynes character Sebastian begins to fall for her male roommate. The humor within the background characters such as Eunice Malcolm and Principal Gold is down right silly but in a hilarious way that makes them stand out. She's the Man won't be winning any Oscars but that didn't stop me from buying it on DVD the day it was released. It has become my favorite comedy without using the obscenity that Will Ferrel Ben Stiller and others like them often need to make their movies funny. With the exception of sexual innuendos it is a fun movie that i think your entire family can enjoy!".

Admittedly there were some entertaining lines and I may have laughed out loud once or twice but the painful moments and pathetic repeated attempts at humor during Amanda's attempts at faking masculinity just made me wince and shake my head.

	schema:reviewBody "Just returned from a screening of She's the man. It's not a cinematic masterpiece. There is no nudity whatsoever. No swearing whatsoever. But still a solid production with strong comic performances from the leads especially Bynes. The writers are Karen Lutz and Kristen Smith who also wrote Legally Blonde and 10 things I hate about you Expect the same theatrical set uppunchlinesoundtrack dominated flick with more Series of Shots plot development montages than most people care to see. The dozens of 16 year old girls at the screening I told you at lunch that I was gonna sit with Amanda. Cause remember during study hall when that cute Senior was walking by and Amanda asked me first if I would sit with her? Remember? all loved this movie. I have watched Legally Blonde numerous times on cross country flights and it never fails to disappoint me. Mainly because Reese Witherspoon is despicable and one dimensional. She is easy to hate. Amanda Bynes is a piece of work. Impossible to dislike. She reminds me of Lucile Ball and Ellen Degeneres with a natural sense of timing and uninhibited range of expression. Bynes is adorable. These types of comedies live or die on how memorable the cast is. If the performances are wooden such as in 10 Things I Hate About You the film fades into dust. She's the Man is a fine effort. I found myself laughing at regular intervals. That wasn't true with Mean Girls because the performances in Mean Girls were not convincing. They seemed too rehearsed. The cast of She's the Man is theatrical to a fault but the situation demands it. Their performances come across as improvised and authentic. They are going for laughs and mostly get them. I can't see how anyone under 20 would not like this movie. Anyone over 20 should see it if they like teen comedies with clever situations.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie sucked. It made me long for Garfield the Movie. I sat through Gigli mildly entertained yet I wouldn't wish this on Sadam. Its almost as if Amanda Bynes has a King Midaslike ability to turn everything she touches into refuse. So if you're looking for a good movie or even just a movie that is not too funny but at least somewhat entertaining then go see Ice Age II. Otherwise just save yourself the nine dollars I paid to Muvico Cinemas and stare at your watch for two hours because that's what you're going to end up doing if you go to see She's the Man. For further reasoning on why this modern day adaptation of Twelfth Night sucked here is the review i'm turning in to my English teacher who forced me to sit through this wretched abortion. For some reason the writers of this movie decided to not only put the story of Twelfth Night not only into modern times but into the lives of high school kids who look like they are twenty five and act like they are twelve. The character of viola is bastardized and betrayed almost entirely. Her motivation from the beginning is changed from fighting from her life from a shipwreck and looking for a way to survive and keep herself alive to having her high school soccer team dismantled. She joins another schools team pretending to be her brother simply to get back at her ex boyfriend even though she believes ahead of time that she will not be recognized by scouts or prospectors for anything she does nor receive any benefit from her efforts at all in anyway because she is pretending to be her brother. Thus she has no motivation whatsoever and is not a realistic character. The characters Toby and Andrew are also abandoned. they are simply friends of Duke and therefore become friends of Sebastian. They have nothing to with the story. They are simply fall back characters to toss lines to whenever writers couldn't think of anymore substantial dialogue for Duke or Viola and needed yet another lame sexual innuendo to fill the dead air timelest the audience actually listen to the story. The name Malvolio was used but in such a poor and shamelessly vain way that you cant really give the movie any credit for having such a character. In She's the Man the Feste character loses his pet tarantula and passes out fliers. On one of these fliers is a picture of the spider and the name Malvolio. This is thrown in for no other reason than to remind you that you are watching a movie based on Twelfth Night and trust me if they didn't continue to shamelessly point that out you would forget it very quickly.So do yourself a favor and do something else with your time maybe read or something maybe even Twelfth Night. Just don't make the same mistake i did because i will never get back to two hours of my life that movie stole from me good luck".

	schema:headline " Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed disturbingly violent and incredibly powerful films.";
	schema:reviewBody "Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that less is more. This doesn't apply to the violence the film is extremely violent from beginning to end but the details of the botched diamond heist which the entire film is based on are conveyed only in the dialogue except for one scene where Mr. Pink Steve Buscemi recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors there's no makeup to make them look pretty there's little to no comic relief and most important of all there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in a detrimental trademark of so many action films as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery. Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.Make no mistake Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made and some scenes are really painful to watch but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent they usually get branded as such but despite the extreme violence Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films and it will not be soon forgotten.".

	onyx:emotionText "Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that less is more. This doesn't apply to the violence the film is extremely violent from beginning to end but the details of the botched diamond heist which the entire film is based on are conveyed only in the dialogue except for one scene where Mr. Pink Steve Buscemi recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors there's no makeup to make them look pretty there's little to no comic relief and most important of all there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in a detrimental trademark of so many action films as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films.

Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy and when I finally did see it I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying Wheres all the violence Anyway I watched it till the end and then I watched it again and since then it has just grew on me.This is one of the movies I don't get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic Are you gonna bark all day... I'll make you my dog's bitch. Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous but you don't know this because these guys and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it and the next time you watch it there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the Kill Bill movies but who cares I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs just rent it buy it or steal it right now.".

The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession.  Having said thatthis movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary to the grim to the horrific aspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is in meeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 711 stickup.  The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate.".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of weeks ago I was blessed with a rare opportunity. one of the movie theaters in town did a midnight showing of this. Naturally being a Dogs freak I went down and saw it.To say I was blown away would be an understatement. I have only seen two of Mr. Tarantino's films in the theater. This being one and Kill Bill being the other. I only became a fan of his a year ago and have subsequently seen all of his films and own them all.It really was a treat to be able to sit in the movie theater and watch this while eating grossly overpriced popcorn and drinking a grossly overpriced soda.For those who don't know the film involves a jewelry heist. Six strangers including Harvey Keitel Michael Madsen Steve Buscemi Eddie Bunker Tarantino himself and Tim Roth are recruited by a crime boss named Joe Cabot Lawrence Tierney and his son Eddie whom everybody calls Nice Guy Chris Penn. The six are almost all friends or associates of Cabot particularly Keitel and Madsen. Cabot gives them colors for names Mr. White Mr. Blonde Mr. Pink Mr. Blue etc. And expressly forbids them to reveal anything about themselves to each other so if anyone is caught no one can inform on anybody. But the heist goes wrong the cops seem to show up way to fast some members of the group are killed and the rest start returning to the rendesvous point to try to sort out what went wrong. After the arrival of Mr. Pink They realize that one of the number is a police informer. The arrival of Mr. Blonde and the present he has in his trunk complicates things even more. Things are also complicated by the fact that since no one knows each other discovering who the informer is is given added difficulty since no one trusts each other.This film Tarantino's first is one of the best if not the best one he has ever done. but part of this credit has to go to his outstanding cast. Keitel is an old pro at this type of thing he has the distinction of being the first older actor who's career seemed to be going into a slump and who has recovered thanks to Tarantino's casting. But Tarantino can't claim sole credit for that because Keitel really got the ball rolling on the project and help him score his budget and the prominence to gain his cast. Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. Tarantino wrote the role for himself and he would have been good but Buscemi brings a type of weasly professionalism to the role that no one else could. Penn and Tierney are ideally cast as the father and son who are left to sort out the mess of the robbery Bunker is only in a few scenes but livens up the proceedings. Tarantino gives himself the perfect monologue for his character Like a Virgin is a metaphor for big dcks and Tim Roth gives a spectacular performance as Mr. Orange who is relegated to bleeding on the floor for a large chunk of the movie. His scene in the car when he has just been shot is particulary outstanding. But then of course I have to throw out a special nod to my favorite character in the piece Mr. Blonde as portrayed by Michael Madsen. Blonde is the definition of Badss and Madsen fits him like a glove. His first scene back at the warehouse is particularly memorable as is the Ear torture sequence. Without Madsen's portraying of Mr. Blonde I don't think the Ear scene would have worked Madsen just does something with it that nobody else can. Not only does Blonde have most of the coolest lines he's fun to watch on screen especially his reaction to a gun pointed in his face by Mr. White. Madsen rocks!Dogs Is one of the few movies where I don't think thae casting could have been any better. Part of the reason it works as well as it does has to go the the way the cast works with each other. No one seems to think that they are better than anyone else and no one seemed to approach the project with the stuck up feeling of how bad it was that they were doing an indie film on a low budget and with an unknown director. Every single member of the cast gives everything he or to a much lesser extent she has. It's this mindset that I think has made Dogs the classic it is today. Little could be improved upon.As a side note This came out a year after Thelma and Louise which also stars Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen. However in Dogs They play ruthless characters. In TL they play the only sympathetic Male characters in the entire movie. An ideal would be to watch TL then RD and really see the difference. They are two great actors and they deliver. And for those who enjoyed Madsen in this I also recommend Kill Me Again made a few years earlier and which also features a scene where he tortures someone.Dogs is a great film to watch. Not a date flick but for a cops and robbers movie it's perfect. Seeing it for the first time in a theater it hasn't lost it's touch and the Stuck in the Middle with YouEar sequence has never been more intense or memorable. !010".

	schema:reviewBody "Crime boss Joe Cabot brings together a group of criminals to perform a big oneoff job.  To protect each other they all use colour coded names. However on the day of the job the police ambush the gang and each makes their own getaway.  As the gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within the gang must have tipped the police or be an undercover.  The accusations and suspicions escalate into violence in the confines of the warehouse.When this film came out in the UK it caused an absolute firestorm of controversy over it's violence even to the point that it was banned in the UK for a while.  I still find this absurd and am very glad we have moved to a more tolerant society where generally the BBFC protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide for themselves.  Looking at the media's adoring welcome for the ultra violent Kill Bill one can't help but marvel at how things have changed.  Looking at Reservoir Dogs now or even then! it simply isn't THAT violent.  However what it is is very sudden and all the more powerful for it.Tarantino directs the film and writes the film in such a way that it was impossible to ignore him even if the film was only a cult hit.  The dialogue is both witty at points but more importantly very tough and loaded with testosterone.  It is the writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at the start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into a backseat bloodbath.  The entire job happens off camera and only occasionally do we actually see the immediate effect of violence  usually we get the aftermath.  It is incredibly tight and very tense throughout I was about 16 when my father took me to see this film  it has stayed with me since and I still considered it to be one of the best job gone wrong' films of my generation.  It may not be original there's a thin line between a homage and a rip off but it is certainly effectively done.The cast are excellent and turn the hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes.  Keitel is wonderful.  His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others.  Likewise Buscemi is wideeyed and freaking out for much of the film but he does it well.  Roth is more balanced but is still good for it it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well despite a wandering American accent at times.  Madsen is great maybe not the best character but wildly out of control.  Tierney was a great piece of casting as was Bunker.  Penn is good but not the best of the cast.Tarantino mercifully has little acting to do but it is his film as writer and director.  The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well  mixing stories with flashbacks and so on.  No matter what the time of the scene it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what  it is tight and tense macho violent funny and very enjoyable.".

Keitel is wonderful.  His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others.  Likewise Buscemi is wideeyed and freaking out for much of the film but he does it well.  Roth is more balanced but is still good for it it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well despite a wandering American accent at times.  Madsen is great maybe not the best character but wildly out of control.  Tierney was a great piece of casting as was Bunker.  Penn is good but not the best of the cast.Tarantino mercifully has little acting to do but it is his film as writer and director.  The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well  mixing stories with flashbacks and so on.  No matter what the time of the scene it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what  it is tight and tense macho violent funny and very enjoyable.";

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this half a dozen times with a biased antiTarantino what the heck is so great about this guy anyway viewwhich as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of selfknowledge will tell you is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it there's very little reason to think that you will no matter how good it is you need an open mind I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog cinematography editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent and incredibly wellintegrated. Pans dolly trips and lest we forget the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is topnotch allround. With most of the cast being name actors this is no surprise but they really do shine. Madsen Buscemi Keitel Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well let's be honest it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking of course of Tarantino's character. Now don't get me wrong in From Dusk Till Dawn this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a filmmaker myselfalbeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes you just need to face up to the facts and admit it if you can't act. Still that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters however are wellwritten and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog which although somewhat drawnout at times is exceptional. Welldelivered too. When it comes to direction he shows how talented he is as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great with the nonlinear timeline telling the story far better than a regular film ever could. One of the many Tarantinofans in fact the very person who originally talked me into watching this film once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such timelines  this Pulp Fiction Memento etc.  so that their timelines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so welltold lies in the timeline. Also I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit don't censor don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version and not the original. Sorry rant over. Finally I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all just a really really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 810".

A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast great script and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add good over the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie is what grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandoned warehouse.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact good and bad on movies but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that like another dog movie from the same era that I saw 'Man Bites Dog' that it was supposed to be violent funny and disturbing and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife  Her Lover'. Okay I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature but what did we know. Then the movie itself electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wisecracks of Mr. Pink Steve Buscemi  'In The Soup' Mr. Blonde Michael Madsen  'Thelma  Louise' and Nice Guy Eddie Chris Penn  'At Close Range' there is a lot of  depth that being the very human relationship between Mr. White Keitel and Mr.Orange Roth. To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal Tarantinoesque movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bloodily violent irreverently shocking politically incorrect inventively funny and so on and so forth I'm trying to find the right expression to describe Reservoir Dogs and I finally got it it stands in three letters NEW. There was something waiting in the abyssal wombs of cinema so repressed it was waiting for deliverance with a fierce impatience a deliverance with a quite original and coolsounding name Quentin Tarantino the new incarnation of modern violence with STYLE. Reservoir Dogs is more than a debut it's a sensational entrance that consecrated Tarantino among the most influential directors of his generation and THE reference in independent filmmaking.Tarantino invented a new style that would never desert his films and would make each of his creation the epitome of coolness. It's so fresh to watch Reservoir Dogs now and to realize how new it was at that time. I remember the first time I watched the film I was 17 and the movie literally blew me away in every single aspect and I guess the fact that I wasn't familiar with the Internet or IMDb was a good thing since it didn't intercede with my approach of the film. I didn't want to know what's so cool about Tarantino I just discovered him with his film shortly after watching Pulp Fiction and for some reason I loved Reservoir Dogs a little more. Tarantino quickly became my favorite director as a teenager and in my early 20's because of this level of creativity in the writing the directing and the editing.The writing is Tarantino's trademark and his greatest quality the movie starts with a whole discussion about the meaning of Like a Virgin told by a fastspeaking Tarantino himself as Mr. Brown then a whole debate starts about tipping and non tipping. That's the question raised by the first minutes of Reservoir Dogs and the least we could say is that the talk is so trivial it sounds real and authentic in its rawness and makes the characters more human if not sympathetic. More generally the whole characterization is driven by dialogs so delicately vulgar you never miss the action or wait for something 'to happen'. Script 'happens' in Tarantino's films like meals you've already eaten but with a new special taste something juicy creamy and spicy. It's almost an indigestion of creativity  I don't need to tell you the lines if I start them you know the rest  You shoot me in a dream  Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? etc. etc. And these dogs not only bark but they do bite a lot.Indeed if the movie was all dialogs it wouldn't have had the same impact. It's like Tarantino already knew his lesson and wanted to make something big from the beginning. From the iconic slomo walking scene down the alley with the opening credits you get the idea that this Little Green Bag song will be the 'hallelujah' glorifying the birth of a new style of filmmaking and instinctively you know something special will happen after these credits and you're not disappointed by what follows. Blood blood all over the car seat and probably one of the most convincing painful screams ever. You really can feel for Tim Roth in that scene it's like the real actor got one real bullet and the rest is the touching expression of a growing friendship between Roth as Mr. Orange and Mr. White his mentor played by Harvey Keitel. He combs his hear whispers something that provoke Orange's cute but heartbreaking smile the chemistry is so believable you understand that the movie is not just about cool dialogs. Then comes Mr Pink as Steve Buscemi asking who the rat is! Because this is the first serious element we have. It's the story of a botched jewel robbery with a traitor among these gangsters. This question will be the starting point of the narrative with three specific back stories told in flashback.The three characters depicted in flashback are Mr. White Mr. Orange and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde. And in the memorableaction department the winner is undoubtedly Mr. Blonde the one who provided the most iconic and recognizable moment of the film. The iconic earcutting scene with the Stuck In the Middle With You music like a reminiscence of A Clockwork Orange rape scene with 'Singin' in the Rain' as a musical background the scene is disturbing violent bloody but also  iconic. The violence is not meant to be cool but just to show how psychotic Mr. Blonde one of the most twisted gangster villains is. And his torture is also crucial because it will unmask Mr. Orange as the snitch and will make his relationship with White even more complex. In one minute the movie raises a new dimension deeper and more tragic.Forget the cool and raunchy dialogs the creative editing where flashbacks interfere with parallel stories as when we witness a great scene where Orange tells a story within another story. Too many insertions as to create a confusing feeling until the last iconic scene  after the slomo opening the earcutting the Mexican standoff as the last memorable scene that would lurch this movie into Pop Culture. Forget the wonderful ensemble cast with so many colorful characters literally and such believable actions and reactions like childishly arguing about nicknames instead of preparing a serious job. All these elements are great but it would have been nothing without the tragedy  The beauty of the film relies on this profound relationship between Mr. Orange and Mr White made of respect and honor and the last minute of the film was something that reminded of Peckinpah's films a moment of honesty and loyalty incarnated by Orange's last confession and White's heartbreaking gesture as to redeem the act of a man he still loved as friend  Keitel's last look before the movie ends will haunt me forever.".

Quentin Tarantino came on the scene not with a whimper but a bang with this story of a diamond heist which is foiled by an undercover copone of the criminals.   The story unfolds backwards beginning with Quentin Tarantino waxing poetic on Madonna's Like a Virgin and manages to cover Tim Roth writhing around in Harvey Keitel's backseat with a bullet in his stomach Michael Madsen with a straight razor and a bound  gagged cop Chris Penn crying rape in his father Laurence Tierney's office and other insane violent andor hilarious plot lines leading to a dazzling end.  The soundtrack adds just the right amount of style and superiority which you'll understand immediately when the Dogs walk in slomo to the tune of Little Green Bag. This movie can only compare to Pulp Fiction with its brilliance otherwise it is completely and utterly a unique experience.".

Well yeah Reservoir Dogs does push the envelope  but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?My exgirlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy.  If that were true the violence would be entirely justified because it would help elevate Reservior Dogs to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas none of the characters is particularly noble they start off as lowlifes and have nowhere to fall.  So that defense doesn't seem to work either.In short people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece.  But even the best parts  such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant  seem artificial and engineered.  Tarantino is ripping off older better films and directors wholesale.  There are shades of The Taking of Pelham 123 here and there's also a dash of The Omen at the end.  Hitchcock Frankenheimer and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before and they did it better.  No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies but he was not much of an innovator and I don't think that his supercool style has stood even the shortest test of time he has after all practically dropped off the face of the earth.".

	schema:headline " Cruel intentions...";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS I can think of nothing kind or good or positive to say about this truly repulsive motion picture. It is quite simply cruel. Quentin Tarantino's badly written script focuses on the events leading up to and the aftermath of a botched jewelry store heist. The heist itself is largely inconsequential to the story as Tarantino's intent was apparently to create a character study of the participants. Yet he has failed to give any of his characters anything resembling human personalities beyond phony macho posturing. The cast does little to add depth to the characters beyond the routine tough guy gambit of shouting their obscenityladen dialogue at the top of their lungs. As such they never raise their onenote performances above the level of brain dead savagery. But good bad or indifferent the actors have little to work with in the first place. Tarantino's much deified dialogue is insultingly dullwitted  banal pop references peppered generously with tiresome profanity. The kindest thing to be said for Tarantino's ability to direct action is that it at least distracts from the emptiness of his written words. But it is the violence that pushes the film into the realm of the utterly contemptible. There have been films with more violence and with more explicit violence but few revel in its violence to the extent of RESERVOIR DOGS. The film doesn't use violence to show cause and effect or to make a social statement or to reflect reality or even for cheap shock effect. It is violence for the sake of violence. The violence in DOGS is purely sadistic a sleazy pornographic celebration of inhuman cruelty.Here and in his other violenceobsessed films Tarantino embraces the infliction of pain as not just an act of power but of an almost orgasmic display of gratification. Add to this the fact that the victims of the violence are usually bound helpless terrified tortured randomly selected and undeserving of such cruelty and the violence clearly becomes symbolic of rape. Worse such savagery encourages the audience to identify with the perpetrator not the victim and Tarantino all too effectively I'm afraid tries to make the viewer complicit in his sadism.  Okay if Tarantino wants to indulge in his little SM fantasies that is his business. What is disheartening is the way people  filmgoers and professional critics alike  have been seduced into not just tolerating Tarantino's sadism but to applaud it as well? DOGS centerpiece is the totally unnecessary and illogical kidnapping of a young policeman who is subsequently beaten tortured and mutilated for no apparent reason other than because it amuses one of the psychotic characters  and one can presume Tarantino himself. The director stages the torture sequence like a comic musical number complete with rock background music and choreography casually topping it all off with the young officer's murder being the punchline of a joke. That's entertainment! seems to be Tarantino's pathetically cruel message. This killing should inspire anger or at the very least pity for the innocent man. Instead it elicited raves by film viewers who see the scene as stylish or worse cool. What does it say about our society that not only do we condone the glorification of senseless violence as entertainment but applaud it as art? Why have we become so obsessed with the matter of style that we can't see that beneath Tarantino's superficial technique there is sadism? RESERVOIR DOGS represents some sort of low point in the history of cinema. That it helped propel Tarantino to be considered one of the most influential directors of our time represents some sort of low point for society.".

Moreover some parts were very boring. Other parts were so talky and somewhat over the top that they strained credibility. However there were some funny lines as well. After having watched this again some ten years later I can say with all honesty this film has not aged well. On second look you see what looks like a first year film student project. It still has funny lines but the story is paper thin. The actors tend to over act and the dialog is so full of Clint Eastwood wannabe oneliners that you just roll your eyes. Michael Madsen cannot act sorry. He is cool but he cannot act. Tim Roth's attempt at an American accent makes him sound like Ralph Cramden from the HoneyMooners. I was just amazed at how bad this film really looked to a more mature person. The funny lines just don't cover that constant posturing of characters that have no real depth. The movie is cotton candy it looks filling but is far from it. Perhaps there will always be 14 year old boys around to give this cool film high marks but I fear it will grow more ridiculous the older I get. However Tarantino has this cult of personality going and I am sure the 10s will continue coming in for this film and a 10 might mean perfect in here but that don't make it so.".

	schema:reviewBody "To quote the great Terry RossioThere are many films with the goal 'to find your way home.' But there's only one film where a girl clicks together a pair of ruby slippers.What that basically means is that the goal of many stories is essentially the same. The 'find your way home' example is used in films such as E.T. The Wizard of Oz and Back To The Future just to name a few. Only one of those has ruby slippers. Only one has a bicycle fly past the moon. Only one has a timetraveling Delorean.The goal of 'criminals getting together to pull off the perfect heist' has been used is such films as The Killing The Taking of Pelham One Two Three and City on Fire...just to name a few. Only one had an unchronological order to the events. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had the criminals use colorcoded names to keep their identities anonymous. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had an undercover cop infiltrate a gang of crooks and befriend another crook only to get shot during the process of the robbery until he confesses the truth to his new friend. Until Reservoir Dogs.If you cannot see that this entire film is just a cut and paste job then you have to be mentally impaired. And that is not an insult.As far as originality goes Tarantino hasn't got to that point yet. The point where he creates something on his own. This is just a second hand second rate cut and paste job that is only mildly entertaining on first viewing. Upon seeing the film subsequent times it only gets worse and it's very many flaws only stand out to an even more obvious extent. This is a bad movie even for someone who has never directed anything before in his life.The film starts with a discussion that might as well be about Jesus pancake syrup or the duties of the school crossing guard. None of these have anything to do with the story...much like the conversation we see before the opening credits roll. Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It's not our business it does not advance the story and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It's complete filler. A total waste of time.This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around popping up at random and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It's a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it's very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come it's more of a good it's over point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn't even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire and in some cases...shot for shot! Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast and that's even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and fwords being used like it's going out of style and it has thanks to films like this and the infamous and extreme violence is about on par with The Lion King. So if you're thinking about watching this movie...just watch a good heist movie instead. I suggestThe Killing The Asphalt Jungle The Taking of Pelham One Two Three".

The film maker's artistic judgment seems to be clouded by a bloodthirsty hatred of police officers. I am thinking particularly of a scene in which a captive police officer is mutilated by his criminal captors. The feeling conveyed to me was one of sadistic joy in the victim's suffering a sense that he deserved to be mutilated simply because he was a cop. I am sure that some misguided admirers of this film applauded the scene precisely for that reason. Unfortunately a lot of people hate the police and for them such a film functions as escapist entertainment but Reservoir Dogs seems to lack any redeeming value of another kind like a snuff movie. The only other time I've seen such poor artistic and ethical judgment in a film was in Caligula by the producer Bob Guccione where in one scene a Roman aristocrat forces a soldier to drink a gallon of wine and then cuts his belly open for the fun of seeing the liquid spill out of it. Some gullible members of the audience actually cheered when they saw that. Like Guccione Tarantino director of Reservoir Dogs may be a big fan of pornography and possibly he doesn't make the distinction between sex and violence. Certainly everything of his I've seen looks like a porno film stylistically but he focuses mainly on bloodshed and torture instead of lust and love. Unless you're in the mood for a tasteless exercise in violence you would do much better to rent John Huston's Asphalt Jungle one of the best and most intelligently made caper gone wrong movies ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Police detective Tre Stokes Nick Cannon goes undercover at an upper class private school to infiltrate a carthieving ring and find out who murdered one of the students but he soon finds that this sort of school environment is very different from the streets of L.A.The premise is very thin and unoriginal so the strength of the film is entirely up to Nick Cannon. Unfortunately Nick Cannon doesn't deliver. He tries way too hard to be funny and he only manages to make a couple of jokes work. I think he has some potential but he needs to pick better scripts. Also he should start off as a supporting actor since he doesn't really have what it takes to be a leading man in my opinion. The main problem with the film is the script since it's very lame and offensive. Most of the jokes are racist and derivative so there's another problem. Screenwriters David Wagner and Brent Goldberg come up with a bunch of annoying clichs that don't work out. They don't seem to be trying at all which isn't surprising since they are responsible for My Baby's Daddy.After Nick Cannon the supporting actors aren't any better and this is clearly a paycheck movie for everyone involved. Shawn Ashmore is okay as Iceman but his performance isn't very good here. Cheech Marin doesn't really do anything special and he ends up being bland. Kelly Hu and Ian Gomez both play detectives and they just look bored throughout the entire film. Roselyn Sanchez is sadly underused in her role.Director Marcos Siega does an okay job behind the camera. He at least tries to keep things interesting with a few car sequences that should wake up the viewer. Besides for that and a few jokes the film is a dud. The romance between Cannon and Sanchez is unbelievable and forced. Most of the supporting characters are one dimensional and they are props for Cannon's insults. The film is also pretty offensive with its racial stereotyping and outdated jokes. Underclassman could have been an enjoyable harmless film even if it isn't original. However the offensive script kills that opportunity and the movie ends up being below average. In the end unless you're a big fan of Nick Cannon skip this film. Rating 410".

The reason I give this props is twofold 1 I usually hate sophomoric humor and many films directed at a teen audience. However Cannon's quickwitted disarming lines made me laugh the whole way through. His dry comic delivery is underrated and unpredictable to say the least. As for the racism observations I'm white and I think that charge is ridiculous. Sure there's racial humor but get a funnybone  it's a joke. can't you laugh at yourself? We whites tend to have a stick up our butts  the characters played off each other. Why react with such sensitivity? The comedy definitely shines. 2 At least 46 of the characters develop to some extent. It's a kind of coming of age story for Cannon who proves not only his professional sense and skills but his interpersonal growth with peers. He's not sensitive to the rejection and pushes through adapting his behavior until he wins confidence. A lesson for most of us. While it's true that most characters are foils by comparison to Cannon the lead the supporting cast are NOT completely flat characters. The Captain two other police officers and at least two students and one teacher come to put things in new perspective or grow up in one way or another. In short this is not just the mindless fluff other viewers seem to see. Yes there were clichs and the script was often predictable but welcome to 95 of big or small screen writing in America these days. If you like sardonic wit humorous ghettotalk and a bit of silliness with some serious undercurrents growth and bonding  lessons of friendship  ignore the dissing and take a look for yourself.

And I think Cannon tries too hard at imitating the Wayans brothers he might look like them but does not even come close to their definition of funny.Another thing that was disturbing was apparently Nick Cannon was the only person who had to be black who could play basketball while the rest who were surprisingly all white couldn't even dribble pass or shoot and he amazingly single handedly crushed the other team. Awesome!!! I did not see that coming. Furthermore this movie was so predictable it could be classified as a documentary. The only thing that was both shocking and stunning was when Cannon missed a dunk while practicing with character Al. Other than that it was no surprise that Cannon did not commit a single turnover or a single miss during his basketball games. Never in the history of my movie watching career have I seen a cop take a dump during a stakeout... let alone in the bushes. It may be comic to some but it's the dumbest excuse and the most idiotic idea in letting the robbers get away. Needless to say I was not at all surprised that just as Kelly Hu and her partner were dropping the deuce the robbers got away.I get the feeling that Siega did not even try to make this film entertaining. This movie is so terrible that I think Siega meant for this movie to suck! Oh.. and don't get me started on the acting... and what kind of private schools let teachers wear tight shirts and belly shirts??? All in all a greatly planned out disaster.".

The success of Drumline made the 24yearold Nick Cannon a Miramax Star of Tomorrow. He currently has six films including the hotly anticipated Untitled Nick Cannon Project in various stages of production all slated for a 20056 release. With a name like Nick Cannon you'd half expect a Mickey Spillane dick or a jarhead fighting alongside Sgt. Fury. Instead we have a spindly babyfaced pup whose firsttime story outline is as clownish as his onscreen persona.Although structurally as lumpy Siega's first film Pretty Persuasion a dark comedy about a student accusing her drama teacher of sexual harassment. showcases a better cast acting out a darker fantasy. Kudos to the freshman director. At a time when it's difficult for a newcomer to get one movie financed Siega currently has two films in wide release. Unfortunately when combined they don't add up to one feature.".

The success of Drumline made the 24yearold Nick Cannon a Miramax Star of Tomorrow. He currently has six films including the hotly anticipated Untitled Nick Cannon Project in various stages of production all slated for a 20056 release. With a name like Nick Cannon you'd half expect a Mickey Spillane dick or a jarhead fighting alongside Sgt. Fury. Instead we have a spindly babyfaced pup whose firsttime story outline is as clownish as his onscreen persona.Although structurally as lumpy Siega's first film Pretty Persuasion a dark comedy about a student accusing her drama teacher of sexual harassment. showcases a better cast acting out a darker fantasy. Kudos to the freshman director. At a time when it's difficult for a newcomer to get one movie financed Siega currently has two films in wide release. Unfortunately when combined they don't add up to one feature.";

Trey befriends Rob Donovan Shawn Ashmore and begins to uncover more illegal actions on campus this time involving stolen vehicles at parties. Now Trey must rely on his streetsmart ways and quickwitted senses to prove to his superior officer Cheech Marin he is indeed capable of handling tough rugged crime sprees and doesn't become crushed under pressure.Trey is played by Nick Cannon the once wildly popular teenstar famous for his many appearances on MTV shows discography among several other endeavors. Underclassman was the pitiful and lackluster attempt to continue Cannon's longrunning success with the Television medium and functions as one of those subpar starvehicles we were used to watching in the nineties. Cannon isn't a contemptible screenpresence but a manufactured one spouting lingo we are supposed to perceive is cool because he says it in a time where formality is required.Not to mention he functions in a role that has been dominated by superior talent. Without even hesitating Cannon's Trey brings to mind Axel Foley from Beverly Hills Cop and the young teenagers of the TV series 21 Jump Street. Between these two examples it already brings to mind the more intriguing and thoughtful things that were done to the rebellious undercover cop character than how it has been cut and pasted into a film erected more off of clichs and action set pieces than anything else. Admittedly the opening sequence is fun to watch showing an energetic Cannon attempt to stop a van of drugdealers by chasing them through the beaches of Malibu on an allterrain vehicle. This scene as derivative as it is is entertaining because of its clear direction and reason it is photographed and illustrated clearly thanks to director Marcos Siega and doesn't feel gratuitous.The remaining ninetyfive minutes of Underclassman however feel much too gratuitous stockpiled with clichs emphasizing action and sloganeering over any reasonable character development and monotonous all the more. Cannon may possess the ability to dazzle with his goofiness and his overthetop actions but given such a mediocre script and a redundant familiar plot line has little to exercise within the confines of the writing. In addition the personality is all in the action sequences leaving the characters without a trait of identifiable humanity. Given the film's incredibly low gross and the poor critical reception it just seems that nobody bought what Underclassman was selling and Nick Cannon who proved to be immensely talented in his earlier picture Drumline suffered as a result.Starring Nick Cannon Shawn Ashmore Roselyn Snchez Kelly Hu Hugh Bonneville and Cheech Marin.

Nick Cannon chooses the right roles but the plot is not that great. Now Underclassman may seem like it has a great story but it's one of the movies thats either good or bad but it just falls in between. I odn't really know what to say about this movie. I laughed at a few scenes. But Nick Cannon can get pretty annoying as he jokes. One scene when he falls into the water and comments I think I just swolled Nemo. He keeps acting that way and it gets annoying.Now this movie is better than Love Don't Cose A Thing but I'd probably recommend Drumline before you go see this movie. It's just not right at the top. It has action and comedy but it doesn't mean it's good. I'd give it a 5.510".

Now Underclassman may seem like it has a great story but it's one of the movies thats either good or bad but it just falls in between. I odn't really know what to say about this movie. I laughed at a few scenes. But Nick Cannon can get pretty annoying as he jokes. One scene when he falls into the water and comments I think I just swolled Nemo. He keeps acting that way and it gets annoying.Now this movie is better than Love Don't Cose A Thing but I'd probably recommend Drumline before you go see this movie. It's just not right at the top. It has action and comedy but it doesn't mean it's good. I'd give it a 5.510";

	schema:reviewBody "So I've read here and there that this remake lacks the camp of the original. And I look back over 20 years ago watching The Evil Dead on a crummy rental VHS in the dark of my teenage bedroom one night. The camp? The original Evil Dead was a terrifying experience even with Bruce Campbell's over the top performance the film was a scarefest a terrifying trip even nearly ten years after its release. The camp was in Evil Dead 2 an horror comedy remaking the original already technically. This remake finds many way to bow to the original aside the obligatory visual quotes. The use of practical effects notably in an era of CGI filled movies is extremely refreshing. The gore feels painful makes you cringe churned my stomach. It successfully palliates a somewhat shallow characterization that makes it difficult to root for the characters with the exception of Mia who owes a lot to a really visceral performance by Jane Levy.And this is where Evil Dead 2013 took me by surprise. After roughly a first half of the movie taking Evil Dead fans by the hand towards hashed and rehashed territories making them doubt that this was a good idea at all the movie lets go of your hand and you're alone in the middle of the woods and it's dark and there's strange noises all about... and then limbs start flying. I won't get into conjectures that the highly conventional and overly familiar first half was made that way with the sole purpose of placing the audience in their comfort zone only to give more impact to the second half... but I would surely ask Fede Alvarez if I was to interview him. Evil Dead 2013 is a treat for the fans of gore and horror in any case. Another reminder that out of ten awful remakes sometimes one rises to the top and delivers. Not for the faint of heart for sure but if you're a true horror fan and even more if you miss your old school gruesome gore rides this one is for you.".

Although I love the original the effects don't scare me like they used to. And people who complain about the acting and script of the new movie? Come on. It wasn't perfect but it's nowhere near as bad as others are making it out to be. And Jane Levy was absolutely AMAZING in this film. I would watch this movie over and over again just to see her act.People are judging this movie too harshly. Was this movie enjoyable? Yes. Very much so. Were the effects good? The effects were A and the score was magnificent. Would I see it again? Yes. I would go see it again at the movies AND buy it as soon as it's available on Blu Ray.This movie is not meant to be a remake of the first rather a reawakening of an old and classic evil. Watch this movie with an open mind and you will love it. Watch it and compare it to the original? You will hate it because they are not the same movies. Both were brilliant but I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the old one.

	schema:reviewBody "'EVIL DEAD' Five Stars Out of FiveThe first five star movie of 2013 is this long awaited reboot to writerdirector Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic original 'THE EVIL DEAD'. It's a loose sequel that finds a new group of young adults stumbling across the 'book of the dead' from the original trilogy in the same cabin that iconic hero Ash and his friends did in the original two films. Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell who played Ash have returned as producers of the film along with their buddy Robert G. Tapert who produced the original three films. Raimi picked Fede Alvarez to make his feature film debut directing and cowriting the film along with Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody. It stars Jane Levy from TV's 'SUBURGATORY' Shiloh Fernandez Lou Taylor Pucci Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. Levy plays Mia and she's supposed to reprise the role for two more films the last of which is supposed to link this new film series to the adventures of Ash and the original films following a 'ARMY OF DARKNESS 2' movie. I grew up on these films and am extremely excited to see Raimi and Campbell picking the series up again and think they're off to a great start.The story picks up 30 years after the original 'THE EVIL DEAD' film ended with a new group of kids going to the same cabin so Mia Levy can try to detox and get over her opiate addiction. Her friends Eric Pucci Olivia Lucas Natalie Blackmore and brother David Fernandez are there as well to help her get through it. They come across the 'book of the dead' the Naturom Demonto from the original films in the cellar and Eric foolishly reads from it despite several warnings not to. He of course awakens the dead and Mia is possessed. The others originally think she's just going through withdrawals but they soon find themselves being taken over and killed off one by one as they fight the deadites for their survival.The film was made on a budget of just 17 million which is a lot higher than the original film obviously but a pretty small budget by Hollywood standards. The filmmakers decided not to use CGI except for touch ups and filmed for 70 days. The results are definitely rewarding. The film really has that 'old school' classic slasher film feel to it and it's surprisingly loyal to the original films in style. It's lacking the power of a performance like Bruce Campbell's but it is really funny and satirical more so than the first film I think but not it's sequels. The violence and gore is out of control It was first rated NC17 like the original and it really is a true hardcore horror film it's truly exhilarating and relentless. I think the filmmakers did about as good a job as they possibly could rebooting this classic series and being a huge fan it's an enormous pleasure to watch. I have no real complaints it's a masterpiece just like the original film and it's sequels!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vGn0mEPzzoQ".

Raimi picked Fede Alvarez to make his feature film debut directing and cowriting the film along with Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody. It stars Jane Levy from TV's 'SUBURGATORY' Shiloh Fernandez Lou Taylor Pucci Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. Levy plays Mia and she's supposed to reprise the role for two more films the last of which is supposed to link this new film series to the adventures of Ash and the original films following a 'ARMY OF DARKNESS 2' movie. I grew up on these films and am extremely excited to see Raimi and Campbell picking the series up again and think they're off to a great start.The story picks up 30 years after the original 'THE EVIL DEAD' film ended with a new group of kids going to the same cabin so Mia Levy can try to detox and get over her opiate addiction. Her friends Eric Pucci Olivia Lucas Natalie Blackmore and brother David Fernandez are there as well to help her get through it. They come across the 'book of the dead' the Naturom Demonto from the original films in the cellar and Eric foolishly reads from it despite several warnings not to. He of course awakens the dead and Mia is possessed. The others originally think she's just going through withdrawals but they soon find themselves being taken over and killed off one by one as they fight the deadites for their survival.The film was made on a budget of just 17 million which is a lot higher than the original film obviously but a pretty small budget by Hollywood standards. The filmmakers decided not to use CGI except for touch ups and filmed for 70 days. The results are definitely rewarding. The film really has that 'old school' classic slasher film feel to it and it's surprisingly loyal to the original films in style. It's lacking the power of a performance like Bruce Campbell's but it is really funny and satirical more so than the first film I think but not it's sequels. The violence and gore is out of control It was first rated NC17 like the original and it really is a true hardcore horror film it's truly exhilarating and relentless. I think the filmmakers did about as good a job as they possibly could rebooting this classic series and being a huge fan it's an enormous pleasure to watch. I have no real complaints it's a masterpiece just like the original film and it's sequels!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vGn0mEPzzoQ";

	schema:headline " The most remaky remake ever remade";
	schema:reviewBody "There are two ways to watch the 2013 version of Evil Dead. If you weren't watching horror in the eighties then you'll probably view this as a competent little horror flick. The acting is decent as are the special effects. There are a few bits that make you jump and other scenes are reasonably creepy. Therefore you may conclude that if you were looking for a decent horror film then you have found one.Then there's the other way of looking at it. If like me you were a fan of Bruce Campbell's shenanigans in the eighties as he depicted the wisecracking 'Ash' who was in the original trilogy then you may be thinking why did you bother watching this? I knew the remake had no humour. I was prepared for that. I can enjoy an outright horror film without the 'tongueincheekness' of the original. However the central characters are pretty damn unlikeable. Without the humour they're a miserable bunch who you won't really care much about  they're just a collection of stereotypes i.e. the blonde the brunette the jock the geek and the other one  'Mia'  who is a teenager trying to get herself off drugs and failing and therefore hardly someone we can identify with hopefully. The opening drags as we're supposed to 'get to know' the characters. It felt like this part occupied the first half of the film. I checked the timer and it had only been on for 23 minutes it felt like 45. Never a good sign.So the film plays out pretty much the same as the original. All the aspects are there  the bucketloads of blood the tree the thing we never see that runs through the wood and the trapdoor under the cabin. Therefore if we've seen it before in the original there's little point in us watching it again. Yes the film has a more 'polished' feel but there's nothing new here. They tried to stick to the original by keeping to the plot which just leaves those who've already watched the original finding little new with what's been done to the new version.If you've never seen the original and you like horror you'll probably like this. However I just felt that 'no Ask  no point.' Another great classic plundered and failed. If you want to watch a half decent remake of a horror classic only the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead comes close.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are definitely more but here is at least 10...1 After the nurse says that they've done this before with Mia and they know she will do anything to get away no one thinks to hide the vehicles keys in a safe place? Probably even left them in the ignition too because it looked as though she just jumped into the car and hightailed it out of there.Stupid.2 They have a crack addict with withdrawal symptoms and who's mother was mentally unstable roaming about in the cabin but they leave a shotgun and shells they found in the cellar lying around?Stupid.3 They find a cellar with dead cats an ominous book blood all around and a shotgun with shells and they don't think to head back and notify the authorities that there might have been a possible crime that took place there? Thinking to themselves That's o.k. we're here to help Mia so who cares if there might have been a murder in this cabin.Stupid.4 The Evil needed 5 souls to manifest itself but I only count three or four at the most. The girl at the beginning doesn't count because the Evil was put back in hell if it wasn't Eric wouldn't have needed to read a passage in the book to release it once more now would he? The dog was killed by Mia with the hammer it was never possessed. And if it were possible to possess animals then why not just possess a bunch of forest animals instead to get his 5 souls?So that's three souls from the moment the evil was released by the incantation Olivia Natalie and Eric. Mia? No her soul was returned to her body or she wouldn't have been alive at the end to fight the abomination. I'll be generous and give you David as well since he died in the cabin fire with the others but this nonsense I'm reading about the Evil getting Mia's soul and then loosing it counting as a soul claimed that's bull. In order to claim something you have to keep it. Finders keepers losers weepers.Stupid.5 After the cabin door opens with wind gushing through the cabin and Mia telling everyone in a demonic type voice that they are all going to die the nurse and girlfriend going batsh!t crazy his sister ending up in the cellar with demonic eyes and all the sh!t going on around him David still comes up with Maybe she got infected by the dead cats and passed it on to the others or better yet maybe she's just crazy like our mom was in the asylum. I mean come on there's denial and then there's just plain stupidity.Stupid.6 David buries Mia then pulls her out of the ground and she's miraculously healed? In the original the deadites were never healed they just gave the illusion of being OK to further torment Ash. And before any of you say We'll Ash was healed after he was turned into Evil Ash let me point out that this was in ED2 which was a fantasy mixed with humour type horror movie. Fans of this keep insisting this one is a more realistic approach like Raimi envisioned in the first place. Now you have a choice to make guys you can't have it both ways. It's either a more realistic approach in which case Mia should still have cuts and burns on her body or it's a fantasy based horror where anything goes. Which is it?Stupid.7 Every time something bad was going to happen wind would blow the pages of the book to an illustration depicting what was going to happen giving the audience a heads up. Great way to build suspense there Fede. Wow!Stupid.8 After Mia boils her skin in the shower the nurse finally gives in and says Her burns are too severe we have to get her to a hospital. So David takes Mia with him in the only vehicle left I might add just the two of them leaving the three others girlfriend included alone in a creepy cabin in the woods in the middle of the night where strange satanic rituals might have happened in the cellar. Last time I checked there's room enough for five in a jeep. He could have at least taken the nurse with him in case Mia's condition worsened on their way to the hospital.Stupid.9 The abomination with enough power in it's scrawny little arms to topple a jeep had difficulty dragging itself on the ground after Mia amputated it's feet with the chainsaw. If it had as much power in it's arms as was shown it should have easily been capable of doing a hand stand using it's arms to walk to get at her. Imagine for a second how freaking' creepy it would have been to see that coming at her from around the jeep upside down. It would have been something like the creatures in the Dead Space video game. Missed opportunity there Fede.Stupid.10 Mia starts walking off into the morning sun with her arm cut off and shoved into her shirt without even cauterizing the wound. I give her 15 minutes before she bleeds out and dies on the side of the road. Even if she makes it that far she still has to swim across the river that washed out the road earlier in the movie. She'd never make it with all the blood loss she would pass out and drown in the river.Stupid ending.".

But have heard only positive things about the remake I had my doubts. At last after a lot of stupid remakes this one kicks you straight in the face. In fact it's based on the original one. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were involved in making this flick and Fede Alvarez the director did a great job for his first full feature.Let me first of all say this. If you can't stand extreme gory horrors than stay away from this flick. It contains shock gore just for the gore. If you thought this was going to be a supernatural ride then forget it. This is really one for the gorehounds. Does it look like the original Evil Dead. Of course not. Back then a few effects were done with stop motion. Here we luckily have the real effects and okay here and there some CGI which I didn't mind at all. But to go back on the original. Yes it do has the chainsaw yes it do has the slapping door yes it do has the evil faces from back then and yes we do have the woods attacking a girl but not raping her like in the original. Was it scary? It never was scary at one moment but still you will watch it with your mouth open. From the opening sequence you are immediately into the Evil Dead ride. Why I do give kudos to the director is that he made the movie he wanted to make but to please the old school fans he added references to the original.The acting of course had to be good too and luckily it was. But did they do jokes like in the original. Not really that was left out here admit it we are 30 years later!Finally I'm happy to see that they didn't give a sht towards the ratings. They made Evil Dead as they wanted to make it it's full of red stuff. Not done like the new horrors with digital animation. This is old school this is great for me a must see for the buffs walking this earth. Finally horror is back with some evil dead to show you....Gore 45 Nudity 05 Effects 45 Story 45 Comedy 05".

	schema:reviewBody "Why why why why why did I get excited for this film? Why do I keep doing this to myself? A horror remake with modern gore effects and a fresh take on the best the eighties have to offer. It has to be a winner right? WRONG! This is the latest in a long line of horror remakes that just fails in almost every dept. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Halloween. Elm street. Omen. Hills Have Eyes. I Spit On Your Grave. The Fog. Fight Night. Friday 13th. Amityville. I kid you not i paid to see them all. Lined up for pre screenings or opening midnight showings. Always excited. Always disappointed afterwards. In many cases I was more gutted than the slasher victims on screen. The only two remakes that were decent was The Thing prequel and The Crazies.At least Evil Dead didn't skimp on the blood and guts. There was plenty. But it did not have an effect. Too much of something may as well be none at all for the impact on the viewer.My biggest gripe is it just wasn't scary. I was pumped when I saw the promo posters saying it was the scariest film ever. But it wasn't even the scariest film I have seen this week. The cast tried but they were either too drab and lifeless when alive or overacting and too animated when dead. Happy medium reached NOT! All in all they would have been better off leaving the original film as is to show what a great low budget horror film should look like. now when teenagers hear of the horror film 'Evil Dead' they will think of this pile of trash instead of a verified classic.".

	onyx:emotionText "Why why why why why did I get excited for this film? Why do I keep doing this to myself? A horror remake with modern gore effects and a fresh take on the best the eighties have to offer. It has to be a winner right? WRONG! This is the latest in a long line of horror remakes that just fails in almost every dept. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Halloween. Elm street. Omen. Hills Have Eyes. I Spit On Your Grave. The Fog. Fight Night. Friday 13th. Amityville. I kid you not i paid to see them all. Lined up for pre screenings or opening midnight showings. Always excited. Always disappointed afterwards. In many cases I was more gutted than the slasher victims on screen. The only two remakes that were decent was The Thing prequel and The Crazies.At least Evil Dead didn't skimp on the blood and guts. There was plenty. But it did not have an effect. Too much of something may as well be none at all for the impact on the viewer.My biggest gripe is it just wasn't scary. I was pumped when I saw the promo posters saying it was the scariest film ever. But it wasn't even the scariest film I have seen this week. The cast tried but they were either too drab and lifeless when alive or overacting and too animated when dead. Happy medium reached NOT! All in all they would have been better off leaving the original film as is to show what a great low budget horror film should look like. now when teenagers hear of the horror film 'Evil Dead' they will think of this pile of trash instead of a verified classic.";

Nowadays it seems to be a remakes b torture porn c possession moviesthese have got to go d more remakes. Heck the last original and clever horror movie I saw was Cabin in the Woods which was actually a horror themed comedy rather than a true horror film.Sadly the Evil Dead remake turned out to be just as disappointing and toothless as I expected it to be. No this film does not improve on the original. No it does not become a good horror film in its own right. Yes you have seen pretty much everything in this film before. Yes you're better off watching anything from the original trilogy.I read an interview with director Fede Alvarez which had him say something along the lines of When I saw the 80's Fly I didn't care about the original 50's version. That was the Fly to me OK Fede.....point taken. But the 80's Fly was directed by David Cronenberg who at that point was already a seasoned director who had over 10 years of experience under his belt and who is known for innovative styles and concepts. Alvarez has none of that. As I understand it his background is mainly short films. Perhaps I should familiarize myself with his previous work but let me just say he does nothing to make Evil Dead his own movie. All I saw were some nifty lighting choices and camera angles.But then again there's nothing about this Evil Dead that makes it it's own movie. You have impossibly hot actresses who still look hot even when they're shivering and drenched in gore. You have the same hyperactive MTVstyle editing that any supernatural or slasher film these days has. You have poor attempts at making this a serious film. Seriously the original was about rapist trees and crazed demons! How serious does it have to be? You have any number of tropes and clichs which make this an ultimately forgettable affair. And on top of that you have no actors or characters who grab the eye. Imagine that Ash's sister Linda was an irritating coke addict instead of a weird psychic girl. Then subtract Ash. There's your Evil Dead.One thing that made the original have such charm is that it wasn't just a low budget film it was practically a student film! I know....it's a big fanboy gripe but I found myself longing for the original whilst sitting through this Bruce Campbellless bore fest.The hype machine and rentacritic tactics will likely make this a relative box office success.

The cabin and the woods is simply not a character as it is in the original there are minutes of boring dialogue at the cabin before they even open the door. It is gory but it has little affect since the performances are so terrible that the audience couldn't give a damn if they die or not. Decent work with CGI gore but still not convincing enough. No special makeup effects appliances. Unlike other remakes dawn of the dead the Texas chainsaw massacre that actually REMAKE the majority of the film the Evil Dead seems to slightly deviate from the original screenplay making it difficult to watch without comparing it to the original masterpiece. Miseenscene is bland the props are lame especially the necronomicon and the cinematography is lacking if you consider Raimi's experimentation in the original.

	schema:reviewBody "I could literally blog every day for at least 3 months on the things that irritated me about this film.I will recap just some of my thoughts .  Possible spoiler comments below 1 The first 30 minutes played like a LifeTime story about drug addiction.2 the last 60 minutes felt like Saw meets Hostel by way of Martyrs. Just nonstop gore.3 There was not one second where I was scared.4 there was no sense of dread.5 Even though the film was supposedly about demonic possession I never for one minute really believed it. 6 The socalled hero was one of the most irritating characters I have ever seen. I could not wait for him to die.7 The characters were  at best  2 dimensional. Bland. 8 There was no emotional impact. I could care less what happened to anyone.9 The Demonic POV the Raimicam from the original seemed here more like a POV of a jogger in the woods.10 The acting ranged from mediocre to down right laughable11 The plot holes were so thick that you could drive a mack truck through it12 The film should win the award most consistently stupid things done on screen. Even for the horror slasher the actions of the characters went beyond stupid. My eyes actually hurt from rolling so much.13 The bigohsoscary demon that everybody was afraid of was the single wimpiest evil presence I have ever seen.

Not scary but impressive. And if you like gore then this is the film for you! Not just buckets of blood not gallons  whole truckloads no joke.This was a thoroughly typical teenage slashertorture porn film. No plot no logic no acting no scares no music nothing but blood and gore.Yes it was competently made. If that and tons of gore is enough for you then you will definitely enjoy it!After about an hour the woman next to me said so this is essentially about 5 really stupid people killing each other. With lots of blood. That's it? I said yup. that's itDid anybody cover their face in the movie? Sure!! When you someone pulling a needle out of the eye you will wince. That is not horror. that is not scare.. that is just 'gross out' moments.I talked to some people coming out of the theater. NOT ONE PERSON TOLD ME THEY WERE SCARED DURING THE FILM!Isn't that what a horror film supposed to do?Have we really just substituted frights and emotional scares with SFX blood and gore and think its the same thing?Its been a long time since I have seen the original I definitely intend on doing so.. it has got to be better than this.As a remake it was better than most Platinum Dune projects  but that isn't saying much.As a film by itself it is passable entertainment for gore hounds.Oh  if you must see this film then please stay for the postcredit sequence. It was the only thing that put a smile on my face.I really wished I liked this film.. But I cannot recommend it based on my experience.May yours be different than mine.3 out of 10. Generously.".

	onyx:emotionText "I could literally blog every day for at least 3 months on the things that irritated me about this film.I will recap just some of my thoughts .  Possible spoiler comments below 1 The first 30 minutes played like a LifeTime story about drug addiction.2 the last 60 minutes felt like Saw meets Hostel by way of Martyrs. Just nonstop gore.3 There was not one second where I was scared.4 there was no sense of dread.5 Even though the film was supposedly about demonic possession I never for one minute really believed it. 6 The socalled hero was one of the most irritating characters I have ever seen. I could not wait for him to die.7 The characters were  at best  2 dimensional. Bland. 8 There was no emotional impact. I could care less what happened to anyone.9 The Demonic POV the Raimicam from the original seemed here more like a POV of a jogger in the woods.10 The acting ranged from mediocre to down right laughable11 The plot holes were so thick that you could drive a mack truck through it12 The film should win the award most consistently stupid things done on screen. Even for the horror slasher the actions of the characters went beyond stupid. My eyes actually hurt from rolling so much.13 The bigohsoscary demon that everybody was afraid of was the single wimpiest evil presence I have ever seen. Think the wimpy devil from Exorcist Prequel kind of wimp.14 The makeup was not scary15 The music was so ineffective that I am not even sure there was a soundtrack.16 after 60 minutes 30 minutes of nonstop gore I felt numb. at 70 minutes I started thinking about grocery shopping.Etc. etc. As I said I could go on and on about what didn't work for me.The good? this film has two and only two good things that I can say  the SFX was very impressive.

	schema:reviewBody "IDK if there are actually spoilers but I want to be safe lol I am constantly seeing oh its not original it's not scary it's not this it's not that. I saw evil dead when I was about 11 and have loved the trilogy in whole for as long as I can remember. These movies hold a special place in my heart. Hearing of the remake I was terribly skeptical like everyone else was but the movie pretty much lived up to everything I wanted to see in this movie a REMAKE. I feel somehow just because Bruce wasn't in it people already start to lose interest I don't know why. I realize this is my opinion but as someone who's a fanboy or whatever its called of this movie I really want to know what people were wanting out of this movie sure some stuff that I wanted to see weren't in it A newer incredibly grotesque Henrietta with the original someones in my fruit cellar or a dancing headless corpse would have topped it off for me!! The acting I thought was pretty good The story I felt went along with the originals with a few tweaks here and there but nothing to really change the flow of the movie But why I gave this movie a perfect rating is the constant nods to the originals even including original sound bytes from evil dead 2 and probably one or two others that I cannot think of. What also made this movie great for me is that while it was missing Gimme Some Sugar Baby Ash You have to respect the mans reason for not being in this movie even though I like to think he could've done it keeping my fingers crossed for Army of Darkness 2 I found myself seeing Ash in all of the characters besides Olivia but maybe I didn't pick up on the nods she had to Ash if there were any. However If I could complain about anything with the movie it ended up making sense to me in the end Hint Cleansing Electric Shock However I think of Evil Dead 2 Where Ash is a Deadite then he is fine. It may not run along the same lines exactly but I like to think that's what they thought when writing the movie. All in all we must realize that the stage set for the production was on a whole other level the original first evil dead was quite a low budget movie made in the early 80's Evil Dead 2 seemed like it had a better budget to work with I am guessing they had an even better budget for this movie than any of the others. It seems they at least tried to capture the feeling of the originals by sticking with on screen effects rather than CGI. If you want to go see a movie that is a creepy gory absolute blast of a time to see. I am going to go see it again because I did not stick around for after the credits. They knew us screwheads wanted this and they delivered with what I believe is a movie that has used the most fake blood to date and to that I say Groovy!".

For some reason the demon voices all sound really stupid.

But this remake does however have the blood and guts. The film tries to redeem itself in the last 15 minutes but it just feels like you're watching a completely different movie at that point.Overall it's a bloody deja vu.

I was more scared by Disney's Bambi than this movie. Another problem is that there was not one moment where I could not see what was coming. It was incredibly predictable. The effects do look great and are the only thing that merit a 310 review. Some scenes were utterly disgusting and stupid. A lot in this movies was laughable It's almost as if they were begging to be mocked by Scary Movie 5. The characters are OK but there isn't much bond built between them and the audience. Most things that happen are ridiculous. At one point a man is stabbed directly in the heart shot with nails and then continues to survive for 40 more minutes in the movie. There was no tension just death more death blood vomit creepy voices death blood death. THAT'S THE WHOLE MOVIE no buildup at all. The music half the time was a ripoff Hans Zimmer and the other half was a incredibly annoying WWII bomb siren. Did not feel original at all very generic possibly the least original movie I've seen in a long time. So in review if you like not at all scary movies with annoying music disgusting violence stupid demons and characters and wasting 10 to see it in theaters by all means see this movie.".

The music half the time was a ripoff Hans Zimmer and the other half was a incredibly annoying WWII bomb siren. Did not feel original at all very generic possibly the least original movie I've seen in a long time. So in review if you like not at all scary movies with annoying music disgusting violence stupid demons and characters and wasting 10 to see it in theaters by all means see this movie.";

The British defenders and their allied had retreated north and west into India . The bridge of the River Kwai was placed on the socalled Burma road stretched north from the Burmese  Rangoon  into southern China . It combined a railroad with a winding track through the high mountains near the Chinese border . There had many valuable natural resources  including large large oil fields  and Japan's victory in 1942 cut off the only land route into China from outside. The mountain and jungle of Burma were some of the most demanding environments for fighting in the whole war . Burma and Thailand was strategically valuable  however  it guarded the supply routes to China where were a million Japanese troops but in such a huge country even that number could not win a decisive victory over the Allied . The film's opening prologue states  Planes from the 493rd Squadron of the U.S. Army Air Corps bombed and destroyed the bridges on the River Kwai in Japaneseoccupied Thailand. This film is based on the true events which happened during that period . In Thailand working for building a bridge over the River Kwai were a group of war prisoners  mostly Australian and Brits  Maj. Benford Edward Fox  though Anthony Andrews was earmarked for this role  Cmdr Hunt Nick Tate  Seaman Miller Timothy Bottoms  among others  under rigid orders of the camp of concentration's commandant Tanaka George Takei . Cruel conditions in the concentration camp make life very difficult and the climate also had a significant impact on the prisoners . Meantime  the bridge is bombing by an American aircraft piloted by lieutenant Crawford Chris Penn  recently deceased  but he's gunned down  being picked up by the Meo an indigenous tribe . The Meo have created a resistance group commanded by British colonel Grayson Demholm Elliott . Then  the convicts find many dangers and risks  as they are transported by rail and  later on  they shipped by sea to serve as slave workers . As they pass throughout several places and cities  Nonh Penh  Saigon  until embark on a freighter  but an Allied submarine sight the ship...The film is allegedly the following to classic 'Bridge on the river Kwai' by David Lean with William Holden  Alec Guinnes  Jack Hawkins  but this Return to Kwai is not based on the novel written by Pierre Boulle and starts where the original terminated with the blowingup of the famous bridge . However  not being an official sequel to 1957 original film  it was made in short budget about thirty years after  in fact  it wasn't even released in the United States theatres because of legal reasons  and in Europe premiered in cinemas with limited success . It does supposedly followon from true facts as depicted in that film  though the roles  historical events  happenings and incidents in both films are essentially different . It displays a functional cinematography by Arthur Wooster . And evocative as well as original musical score by Lalo Schifrin but without the unforgettable melodies from the successful first adaptation . The motion picture results to be an inferior version and made in a television style  being based on true events written by Clay and Joan Blair . The picture was middlingly directed by Andrew V.

Admittedly there is not a great deal to say critically in the film's favour but I think the current voter average is a little too harsh.The film does suffer from a large dollop of poor acting a sometimes inane and amateurish script and often allows itself to become bogged down in clichs. The stilted and often unimaginative direction makes the film seem like a television show. However at times the director allows the film to shine with some snappy and economical moments. The music is by the great Lalo Schifrin and though not one of his best works a little too simplistic and drenched in military clich it is quite catchy. But the special effects are too lacklustre to make the action sequences truly exciting.However Return from the River Kwai does have at least an interesting premise and a decent screenplay which helps carry the story well. The on location shooting makes the settings look authentic and the costumes are fairly decent. The film offers more than enough thrills and spills to keep you amused on a rainy afternoon. And of course it is great to see the always dependable George Takei and Edward Fox as well as the lovable lategreat Denholm Elliot on screen.By no stretch a great movie but one I am content to pass the time with. I do wish that television stations would program a movie like this for a daytime matine instead of that madefortelevision rubbish about some murderer in MidWest America. Return from the River Kwai is a much better effort than those kind of movies and it offers good simple lunchtime fare. At least a 510.".

There's some good action sequences at this point a staple of any of Andrew V. McLaglen's war films but around the halfway mark the action dies down and it turns into a pretty dull movie about prisoners being escorted back to Japan.  The climactic mutiny aboard the Japanese freighter and battle between a gunboat and an American submarine is just plain silly.Chris Penn is totally useless this time around and the subplot involving him and Denholm Elliott sneaking around behind enemy lines does nothing but distract us from the real story of all the prisoners.  Edward Fox and Timothy Bottoms both come across as somewhat underused but most of the Japanese cast especially Tatsuya Nakadai a Kurosawa regular come off pretty well.Overall this film comes across little more than an average TV war movie with minor action sequences some betterthanaverage photography and special effects but with a dull and meandering padded storyline.  It's pretty dull but the movie is decent enough to at least warrant some US distribution at some point in time.

The inclusion of two or three British character stalwarts like Denholm Elliot merely emphasises its comprehensive wretchedness rather than raising its status a notch. I have to say in response to another commentator that being involved in its production is  like a dose of syphilis or a conviction for indecent exposure  not something one should mention in public. Quite the contrary one's accidental exclusion from the credits should rank as extremely fortuitous. Cherish the original as the Oscarwinning classic that it is.

My aged parents with whom I watched it on one of their weekly visits were not impressed though I thought it was an absolute hoot.I nearly forgot to mention that there is a serious anomaly about 47 minutes into the film which I'll submit for inclusion on the database. The POWs are travelling by a rather ancient and decrepit train along a singletrack equally decrepit jungle railway to their destination housed in horrid old wooden boxcar like trucks. At this midpoint we see a view of the train with colourful contemporary mainline passenger coaches which look rather nice and comfortable and are certainly not made of wood.

By 1989 I guarantee you that three out of four people knew the POWs in Japanese camps were beyond malnutrition and incapable of swinging an axe let alone taking a knife and thrusting it into guard.Overcoming Japanese soldiers is so rampant here that it borders on comedy. True in Bataan American soldiers led by Robert Taylor made a mockery of the enemy but old timers form the era told me that it wasn't far off the truth because American soldiers were nourished and strong and of the Japanese only the leading Samurai got more than a handful of rice a day. The Japanese soldier was weak from severe hunger.However while the soldier was weak from hunger and mean from hunger he wasn't in the horrid condition the POW was in.This movie has POWs that make the POWs in Lean's epic look like skin and bones.That said a movie can still be watchable. This one is slightly watchable but don't expect much. In the end it's pretty much a waste of time but it doesn't leave you depressed.

Soon enough though it is destroyed after the arrival of an American bomber and camp commander Lieutenant Tanaka Star Trek's George Takei threatens to execute the ones who helped do it but the prisoners are saved by Major Harada Tatsuya Nakadai who transports them by train and boat to Japan. It is difficult journey with allied forces keeping an eye on the transportation routes the prisoners including Major Benford Edward Fox are planning escape and the shot down American bomber Lieutenant Crawford Chris Penn is joining them. Led by Colonel Grayson Denholm Elliott the PoW soldiers have joined with the indigenous people called the Meo in a resistance against the Japanese and they will help in all battles and their eventual escape. Also starring Timothy Bottoms as Seaman Miller Richard Graham as Sergeant Perry Nick Tate as Lt. Commander Hunt Etsushi Takahashi as Captain Ozawa and Michael Dante as Commander Davidson. The cast members are reasonable choices and there were certainly some eyecatching moments of gun play explosions and battle sequences but of course the original film is much better and this effort doesn't come close but it's an alright Second World War action adventure.

And it's not even like this movie has much to do with the 1957 classic in the firs place. The movie is literately set at the river Kwai for about 5 minutes at most and it focuses on some totally different characters.The movie tries to be like and adventurous WW II movie with also some action added to it but it all got done extremely bad. It really doesn't get brought to the screen very well due to its serious lacking directing which is most notable during it's so called action sequences. Ultimate low is the extremely lame and laughable fight between Chris Penn and a Japanese soldier at the airfield. Or was it supposed to be a spoof of the famous airfield fight from Raiders of the Lost Ark? Even the music hints at this a bit.The story is really all over the place. At times it's really unclear what this movie is trying to be. The one moment it's being a serious drama about the horrors of war and the other it's being a simple mindless bad action flick. It also really isn't clear were the movie is heading to. There is a lot of traveling in this movie which often add to the confusion and it really isn't made clear what is actually being the main plotline for the movie. Characters are doing lots of silly and unlikely stuff which doesn't exactly add to the movie its credibility. It all really doesn't make this movie a very pleasant one to watch.This movie was obviously just a quick and cheap way to cash in. It also seems that the movie its title was reason enough for some decent actors to get involved with this movie. Quite amazing that Edward Fox agreed to appear in this and the movie further more features some other well known and respected names such as Denholm Elliott Chris Penn and George Takei.A big mess of a movie that got very poorly done...and there is even a fart joke in it as well.310httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

And I will...going back two or three times next week.Yes I have seen mediocre reviews but there are couple of requirements to enjoying this movie 1. You have to LOVE Cirque Du Soleil. Not just like...you have to love them.2. Don't spend even one second trying to analyse the plot. It's about a young woman who is mesmerized with a young male aerialist and she tries to find him again when they are separated. Everything else are sections of different Las Vegas Cirque shows and even in their entirety don't always make sense. If you try to understand why this is here or that is there you will run out screaming.3. It helps a lot to have seen at least a few of these shows in Las Vegas because the movie selects some of the best parts from each.4. Did I mention you have to LOVE Cirque du Soleil? I think one or two people did walk out but those who stayed applauded and stayed all the way through the end credits which were very lengthy because they listed each LV show each hotel and each person on the crew of the individual productions.The film did present some of the best moments from each show and getting close added to it giving us devotees a new look at it. And with the battle scene on the rotating steel plate from Ka a look from different angles was a blessing.My favorite Cirque show in Vegas is The Beatles' Love and other fans of that production will be very happy. There are about six scenes from it with Beatles music in the film too including Get Back Octopus's Garden Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite! While My Guitar Gently Weeps and the film ends with a group shot of curtain moments for the different show casts set to All You Need Is Love. Cinematography is excellent. And the 3D is spectacular! Is it just a huge commercial for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas shows? Yes. Do I recommend it? Yes! Yes! YES!!!!".

I did not want to see one of those movies where they give you the audience's reaction so you can be spoon fed to know if something is good or not. As another reviewer already mentioned ShankruSpamBegone saw some other movie not this one. There were no scenes of audience reaction. If you cannot watch ballet because the dialogue is weak then maybe you will get bored in this movie. If you get bored watching the Olympics then you might get bored watching this movie. I threw up in the theatre watching Blair Witch project even though I was bored in it because of the shaky camera work and I was scared going into this one reading here about the jerky camera. I also saw nothing like that. At a live show you do look at many different things going on but you cannot get the close ups like you do in this movie. Another reviewer complained that there were no scenes from Cavalia which I thought odd since no Cirque du Soleil shows involve animals so why should they include another company's work that does not fit their theme? Weird comment.I have seen Ka Mystiereand Zoomanity live and I liked this movie as much as that. My wife has seen a couple others as well and liked the movie more than I. I was shocked and dismayed that the movie theatre was almost empty on a Friday night but as my wife pointed out young people would rather see CGI than real talent on the screen.".

This tale begins when a young woman Mia Erica Linz walks into a circus only to be whisk away to a magical circus. There she checks out the star attraction aerialist Igor Zaripov and becomes enamored with his skills of flight. Through a series of passages they end out in another dimension only to discover the multiple tents of the Cirque Du Soleil crew. I have seen my fair share of Cirque Du Soleil shows and recognized some of the bits taken from seven of the shows that were running in Las Vegas in 2011 O Mystre K Love Zumanity Viva Elvis and Criss Angel Believe. This movie is like experience the highlights of this type of circus that pushes the boundaries of human capability that defies the laws of gravity and physics.

	schema:reviewBody "They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and I suppose that's largely true.Worlds Away is an exception. Here what happens at several of Cirque's Las Vegas shows comes to your theater. Not everyone gets to Vegas. Only Cirque fans see all the shows in Vegas if they get there. No one can see the Elvis show since it's now closed. The traveling shows are around but that's a once a year or two opportunity to see just one show live.Reading some the reviews I'm forced to ask what did you expect?There's no plot! Well CdS doesn't need a plot and generally speaking doesn't have much more in the way of plot in Vegas shows than in this compilation. How can you curate several shows into one compilation and get a plot. I'm impressed that they have a seamless compilation. If you want a plot stay home and watch Law and Order!There's great music. Cirque's music is new age background to the performances with the obvious exceptions of Beatles' Love Viva Elvis and Michael Jackson's Immortal. Like much background music it gets lost behind the fabulous performances the gorgeous costumes the spectacular sets etc. Here however the music works to tie the parts together and it works.There are great performances...and your seats are upclose and flying around the theaters and tents. I've attended virtually every show with excellent seats and being this close and being in on the action is a treat for me.It's here. It's closer than either Vegas or a tent site. We travel to Montreal to see the new shows each May. Not every one will do that. Perhaps it'll make it's way to video. Guy could learn from Michael Eisner that CdS could make a fortune selling DVDBluRay for the shows once every five to seven yearsas the technology advances and as new fans emerge.Of course it's an hour and a half commercial for CdS in general and several Vegas shows in particular. So? Isn't Skyfall a commercial for the next James Bond movie and the DVD library? I hope it is!No clowns. Guy loves clowns...I think because they are cheapno sets and lots of competition for the parts. I hate clowns. I'm not afraid of them but they are creepy and a waste of time.I won't see it twice this go round but I recommend it. It'll make you feel sexy.And Guy I'll buy the 3D BluRay if you release it.I've also decided to go back to Vegas soon to see the theater shows again. The commercial worked!".

Well CdS doesn't need a plot and generally speaking doesn't have much more in the way of plot in Vegas shows than in this compilation. How can you curate several shows into one compilation and get a plot. I'm impressed that they have a seamless compilation. If you want a plot stay home and watch Law and Order!There's great music. Cirque's music is new age background to the performances with the obvious exceptions of Beatles' Love Viva Elvis and Michael Jackson's Immortal. Like much background music it gets lost behind the fabulous performances the gorgeous costumes the spectacular sets etc. Here however the music works to tie the parts together and it works.There are great performances...and your seats are upclose and flying around the theaters and tents. I've attended virtually every show with excellent seats and being this close and being in on the action is a treat for me.It's here. It's closer than either Vegas or a tent site. We travel to Montreal to see the new shows each May. Not every one will do that. Perhaps it'll make it's way to video. Guy could learn from Michael Eisner that CdS could make a fortune selling DVDBluRay for the shows once every five to seven yearsas the technology advances and as new fans emerge.Of course it's an hour and a half commercial for CdS in general and several Vegas shows in particular. So? Isn't Skyfall a commercial for the next James Bond movie and the DVD library? I hope it is!No clowns. Guy loves clowns...I think because they are cheapno sets and lots of competition for the parts. I hate clowns. I'm not afraid of them but they are creepy and a waste of time.I won't see it twice this go round but I recommend it. It'll make you feel sexy.And Guy I'll buy the 3D BluRay if you release it.I've also decided to go back to Vegas soon to see the theater shows again. The commercial worked!";

	schema:reviewBody "The art of circus performing is a tradition that continues to defy the test of time. One circus that continues to remain popular with the public is Cirque du Soleil the show that combines acrobatics with artistic imagination. Cirque du Soleil has taken on a number of themes over the years from dragon celebrations to Michael Jackson tributes yet many have missed the opportunity to see these shows come to life. This weekend people around the countryworld have the opportunity to see a show for themselves as Cirque Du Soleil World's Away 3D released. So sit back and relax as I dive into the artistic into James Cameron latest production. Let's start this review off with the biggest strength of the movie the visuals. Worlds Away is a breath taking experience of mind blowing sequences that show off the imagination of the performance theater. Audience members will be excited to see the performers pull off aerial ace performances as they flip and soar through the air amidst brilliant settings. What makes this movie even more entertaining is that the stunts are not just people showing off their training but are actually being used to tell a story and describe the emotions of the act. Some performances are elegant displays of finesse combining ballet and interpretive dancing to wow and amaze. Others are all about power and gravity challenging stunts that build suspense at whether or not the person will fall to the constantly moving environment. My favorite in particular involved a Japanese anime like act where performers fought on a gyroscopic platform that involved them adapting to the environment which kept it interesting. Amidst these entertaining performances are some performances that are more strange than entertaining. These skits involve oddly designed characters whose purpose was unknown to me. I'm sure there is some symbolic nature to these scenes but unfortunately I was unable to decipher the meaning behind these interludes or at least understand what each character represented. Regardless these scenes can still be entertaining but don't expect them to be as flashy as those shown in the trailer. Another factor that adds entertainment to this movie was the musical score. Those who have seen the show before will be familiar with the beautiful harmonies the orchestra creates. Each scene has its own song accompanying it designed to mirror the feelings the performers were trying to act out. Performances that were softer and more elegant used a slower track where flutes violins and vocals dominated. Scenes that were more aggressive darker and more suspenseful took on the entire orchestra relying on the drums and strings to paint the challenging nightmare the world had to offer. If you don't care about the music matching the scenes it doesn't matter because the orchestra work is still ear pleasing on so many levels. Fans of the series may recognize some of the tracks but for newbies like me you may just find yourself bobbing to the beat. So we have the stunts and the accompanying music but is there anything else that will impress the audience. I believe the visuals might also be another aspect that will grab your attention . The costumes are indeed artistic and interesting to see but usually fit the scene well. Unfortunately my lack of artistic understanding denied me the full appreciation of their design and might confuse other audience members as well. Despite the confusion though the setting itself is beautiful. The artificial rivers and ponds the misty trees of the forbidden jungle and the industrial wasteland of a steam punk nightmare are polished in every detail. Some of the scenes also included some artificial creatures that were even more impressive to watch. My favorite was the giant snake that coiled itself around the forest as the two protagonists dance their way through the air. This beast moves as it was an animatronic reptile but one can see the strings as the puppeteers work their magic to make it move. I feel though that many people will enjoy the world the designers have created for the audience. So what should I warn you about this movie? One thing is that the story is rather basic and very straightforward. It's a romance story that involves travelling through multiple worlds with each having a tale of their own that provides an obstacle for the main plot. Unfortunately the deeper elements of the story require a little more thought than I was able to understand but those who can interpret symbolism will be just fine. Another thing I noticed is the constant amount of flashing lights in this movie. These lights add more life and excitement to the scenes however those with seizure disorders are going to need to stray from this movie. Perhaps the other thing to warn you about is that this movie seems to be only available in 3D so it could be a more expensive purchase depending on your theater. Was it worth the 3D? Frankly I could have done without it but it added a smidge of detail that can be appreciated. Was Cirque De Soleil worth a trip to the theater? It really depends on if you have already seen a show. If you have then not really as I discovered some of the details were cut from the movie. Plus at the show you get a little more involved than you do in the theater. However if you've never been to a show then totally go see this one as the visuals and sound are made for the theater. What are my scores for this movie? Check them out below Fantasy 7.0 Movie Overall 6.5".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is all about a girl named Mia who meets a guy called The Aerialist and they go on a huge adventure but will never give up until they find each other. It is really nice how they care about each other throughout the movie. I think they should have more talking to each other or other people. I really like the movie because it is in 3D. It makes it look so real that I would want to reach out and touch it. There were also so many acrobats that were doing things that seemed like they are going to kick you in the face. It is really cool and I hope you like it too. The main characters in the movie are Mia and The Aerialist. They are both my favorite characters because they don't care what they come up against each time because they love each other and will not rest until they find each other. My favorite part of the movie is when they are doing one of the shows and they are falling off walls on to trampolines and got back on the wall. They must be really brave to do all of those stunts. The cast was amazing and I wish I could do that too. I would recommend this movie for ages 8 and up because younger kids would probably think it's boring. In fact it is kind of boring at the beginning but I keep an open mind and they do acrobat things that catch my attention. I hope you like the movie as much as I did. Anthony Aranda age 10 KIDS FIRST!

	schema:reviewBody "Cirque Du Soleil Worlds Away is a beautiful piece of eyecandy that encapsulates a story that I'll be damned if I can make clear to you. From what I can tell the film is about an aerialist who is smitten with the mysterious and enchanting world of Cirque Du Soleil and decides to perform with them and explore many different worlds. That's the extent of what I can provide.Even if you can only extract that this film is a ravishing piece of eclectic artful fun if a bit too wrapped up in its love for visual flair. This was a special released right in time for Christmas which I would have seen on the big screen had I not been stricken with a paralyzing flubug and was guaranteed to provide its attendees a bountiful time with lovely visuals incredible style and sensorystimulating excitement. It succeeds at that and for it it should be commended. I've never had the pleasure to see a Cirque Du Soleil show in person but I question if the story lines are as vague as the one given here. I'm all for stunning visuals but there needs to be an extractable emotion idea or story that is found inside of them.Take Ron Fricke's Samsara for example a picture with some of the best visuals I have ever seen on film. There are no words in the entire ninety minutes in it but so many morals meanings subtleties and ideas can be pulled from its amazing longshots that multiple viewings are an obligation. I have seen it twice now and have yet to grasp everything behind it. I've sort of assumed the idea that I simply will never be able to see everything in that film. I didn't expect Cirque Du Soleil Worlds Away to perplex and amaze me in an experience germane to Samsara but with all that being said I would've liked some story of some encapsulating message. Should I just assume I'll never be able to see anything here? But I am starting to think who goes to Cirque Du Soleil to get silly things such as morals or to get the benefit of a great story? It's all about the visuals clearly and for that alone this film excels in them. Director Andrew Adamson who previously worked with visuals on a macroscope on The Chronicles of Narnia film series and the Shrek franchise captures the unfolding talent and gravitydefying acrobatics with marvelous clarity and framing. I was stunned by the presence of wider shots showing the Cirque Du Soleil sets in fullform rather than closeups centering in on a piece of the action. Adamson employs a directorial style similar to that of Steven Soderbergh's in Magic Mike he wants his audience to see a bigger picture rather than a condensed minimized one.Cirque Du Soleil Worlds Away is made for three kinds of people the kind that have indulged in a Cirque Du Soleil show and relish the thought  those who crave to experience it at one point and the latter category being the curious parties like myself. It was a pleasant experience  one that zips along at about eightytwo minutes minus credits  and provides viewers with an incorruptible sense of wonder and zest. Seeing these brilliant aerialists  acrobats and performers commit remarkably talented and precise bodymovements made me almost reach for the Bengay. I can't imagine the debates among the artists on who is more sore the following day.Starring Erica Linz Igor Zaripov and John Clarke. Directed by Andrew Adamson.".

As such the plot is basic in the extreme but that's not the point. The point is to wonder at the feats and the showmanship that defies belief.The film consists of a series of montages as gymnasts perform feats of such power skill courage and beautiful grace that I found it literally incredible. At times I found it hard to believe that what they were doing was physically possible. For example two female trapeze artists swing high above the ground. One dives headlong and they catch each other with their feet the one held upsidedown by the feet of the other. Amazing enough if they had carefully positioned themselves so but do do it as one fell had me questioning how that was physically possible.The set pieces were balletic even when dancers contorted themselves into eyewatering positions. Each move appeared fluid and effortless even though beyond the range of any normal person.I also enjoy the mechanicals equipment and props that all added to the effect without detracting. A yurt for example transforms into a flying machine the wings acting as naturally as a bird's but operated by two of the cast in plain view but somehow invisible at the same time.The action was very very clever but the vision had me wondering what sort of experimental drugs the designers were on. It is a truly surreal experience.For once I enjoyed the 3D. It was well done and actually enhanced the experience.My one criticism is that although only 91 minutes it seemed longer. Some of the set pieces tended to drag on. The vertical fight scene for instance whilst a very clever idea and well executed began to drag after a few minutes. I would have preferred some of the scenes to be shorter with a wider variety of acts and scenes but that said it was well worth the money and time to see.".

Seeing the acts up close with vivid costumes and colours it would look great even if it wasn't in 3D! It would have been great if they could put La Nouba in and some of the touring shows but time and logistics constraints didn't permit. So it is a sort of promotional film for Cirque's Las Vegas productions.Generally speaking the music composed specially for the movie was only mildly memorable. I had fun though identifying the existing themes and tunes from the different shows there was even a bit of Simcha in the oldschool circus at the beginning However the one thing that bugged me after seeing the whole film was that there was too much Beatles! Although Zumanity didn't appear much for the sake of familyfriendliness perhaps and as a whole the acts selected were awesome it seemed to be one Beatles song after another. Cirque has always emphasised the use of Cirquish an invented language for lyrics which does not distract us from the act. And to add insult to injury Mystere only made a single appearance in the film a cube act I believe. How can the longestrunning Cirque show in Vegas only merit a passing mention? Thank goodness Viva Elvis only made a single appearance a trampoline act. Nevertheless the saving grace of the movie was the inclusion of much material from O and Ka. Ka really brought home the point that it was possible to do dramatic fight scenes live on stage and 'O' showed us what was possible with water.I'd still recommend Worlds Away to my friends as a gateway into what Cirque du Soleil is about.".

It can be bewildering...mysterious...it can be threatening...and yes it can be dangerous and violent. But  and this is a BIG but  it can be touching beautiful exciting and wonderful a land of enchantment where anything can and usually does happen and where anything including true love is possible. In CIRQUE DU SOLEIL WORLDS AWAY all of these things happen. Combining acts and characters from the seven Resident Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas including VIVA ELVIS which closed in 2012 this film takes the viewer along with the two main characters on a strange and magical journey where they are both helped and hindered by characters from the Cirque du Soleil worlds. One of the best things about this film is that like the stage shows themselves almost no dialog is spoken with the performers telling the story or speaking to each other with every movement.Sometimes the way the acts move the story along is a bit puzzling I'm not sure why the battles from KA were used when they were or why the CRISS ANGEL BELIEVE character was even used at all. While I wish the character of Le Bebe from MYSTERE had also been included the character of Sparky from THE BEATLES  LOVE is the real showstealer of the film. I also wish that more acts from MYSTERE had been used.One could even say that CIRQUE DU SOLEIL WORLDS AWAY also adds ideas from ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND where the heroine falls down a hole into Wonderland and THE NUTCRACKER ballet where the hero and heroine perform a a pas de deux that expresses their feelings for each other but the Cirque du Soleil take is still original beautiful and fun. I can't comment on the 3D effect used in the film as my eyesight due to eye surgery doesn't allow me to see 3D but even in flatscreen format this film never fails to keep the viewer riveted with acts like Bateau from O or the Wheel of Death from KA and the While My Guitar Gently Weeps sequence from LOVE will bring a lump into your throat.All in all take your own journey through Wonderland with Cirque du Soleil. Unlike ALICE IN WONDERLAND or THE NUTCRACKER the worlds of Cirque du Soleil are worlds that anyone would love to wander through and get lost in...and unlike ALICE IN WONDERLAND or THE NUTCRACKER the dream doesn't have to end.".

Having watched Ka in 2012 I was just blown away! James Cameron just captures the scenes so as good as what he is all credit needs to go to Cirque du Soleil. If you can watch any of the shows in Las Vegas or when touring then just do it! THEN you will understand why this movie gets a 10 rating from me. The above forms the cornerstone of the review as there are no special effects the shows are really THAT good. EVERYTHING is just top drawer. Although the storyline in the movie is predictable the journey through different shows is the closest you will get to watching a live show.".

BTW I didn't see it in 3D  saw it on Netflix I had never heard of it before but it's absolutely worth watching. It's also suitable for kids of all ages grandparents etc. so the whole family can watch together.".

The musical score was also terrific  my heartbeat seemed to follow the tempo and the beat of the drums exciting me and bringing me down at different points of the film.I didn't care much for the story though about a woman who travels through different circus worlds in order to find the aerialist she was captivated with. And though I usually watch movies for the sake of the story in this case I was willing to forgo it in this case because of the acrobatic action. That will always be the selling point of this movie and it doesn't fail to excite and awe you with its choreography and complexities.If you've never seen the live version I didn't or even if you did I believe this will still be a morethanacceptable substitute.".

	schema:reviewBody "About a half hour into Cirque du Soleil Worlds Away 3D my wife leaned over to me and blurted out Are you as bored with this as I am? Frankly I wasn't. By that point my boredom had turned into annoyance.Another scene or two passed and our mutual annoyance metastasized even further  into unconditional surrender. We had enough. But the cinematic Rubicon was passed.In the final scenes towards the end of an overlylong 85minute test of patience I found myself ready to leave. Needless to say we departed the theater in disappointment.This movie should never have been made. It's a testament to the old edict that if you're going to do something then do it right  or don't attempt it at all.How in the name of James Cameron do you mess up something as spectacular as Cirque du Soleil? Who would have thought trivializing deathdefying stunts was possible? It's baffling to imagine a production blessed with many of the world's most gifted performers with such an impressive array of set designs and costumes and some of the most innovative music ever recorded could induce a mass slumber.How bad was it? For those who have visited the Las Vegas airport recall the jumbo screen inside the baggage claim area. Think of the 45second video clips from one show after another. Imagine that highlight reel repeated over and over and over again and then compiled into an fulllength motion picture. Indeed the comparison of waiting for bags at an airport might be appropriate here except there's actual suspense in waiting for one's luggage. There's no such drama in this montage of monotony.I've seen five Cirque du Soleil live performances to date. Two were extraordinary O and Cavalia one was excellent Mystere one was average Love and one was awful Ka. My appreciation for each show was largely a matter of taste. Each and every Cirque du Soleil product that I've sampled  be it live shows or music CDs  has been a firstrate production.Then we get this clunker.No doubt this was a film with enormous potential. Bringing the very best of the Cirque du Soleil global franchise to the big screen for the first time  the audience's visual experience enhanced by 3D  was a thrilling prospect. Add the opportunity to witness some rare behind the scenes footage and truly astonishing acrobatics from a variety of different angles and this wasn't simply like getting the best seats in the house. It was like being a part of the show.Cirque du Soleil Worlds Away 3D is a reel of disappointment from start to finish. Take the story for instance. Oh wait there isn't one. The possibilities of an Alice in WonderlandThrough the LookingGlass themed narrative were obvious here. Too bad the film's creators opted instead to sew the performances together with the amateur skills you might expect from a YouTube video. There's also virtually no dialog  which doesn't help much to retain our attention. Then again what would the performer say? Oh look! There's another skinny girl up in the sky spinning on a rope! The film essentially takes the high points of what you'd see in the exact same shows on the Las Vegas Strip and transposes them on screen with no attempt at contextualizing or connecting these performances to anything that might resemble a plot. A few scenes are interesting and even mesmerizing when performed live  forget this treatment but blended together in cinema it's like visiting the Bellagio buffet tossing a little bit of everything into a giant mixing bowl and then trying to digest the contents. We may savor green bean casserole pad thai creamy horseradish and cherry cheesecake on their own. But mixed together into one giant serving wouldn't be very appetizing would it? This is what happens when you mix the firefight scene from Ka with a magical interlude from Believe with one of the worst Beatles songs ever recorded Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite. What you get is cinematic slop.If you try to please everyone you please no one. That's what the film makers attempted to do here conjoining irreverent themes with no connection. Moreover some of the dullest interludes from the Cirque du Soleil catalog somehow made the final cut while much of the best show material was inexplicably left out the very best performances are often the simplest featuring the astonishing power of the human body somehow doing what seems to be impossible. The film makers seem to have forgotten the fundamental premise that sometimes less is more.I had a hard time staying interested in performances that often looked the same but weren't. One minute we were in medieval Japan Ka. The next scene took us beneath the world's oceans O. Then we went back to the 1960's Love. And with that the film ended.Which brings to mind one final outrage. How was Cavalia omitted from the final cut? Arguably the most impressive Cirque du Soleil show of all this dazzling spectacle includes dozens of live trained horses in the performance. How or why the film makers managed to leave out some of the best scenes of the entire theatrical catalog is mindboggling and utterly unforgivable. If you can't include just a few scenes from the astonishing parade of horses in Cavalia then why even bother? Hard to believe but I'm not sure those who created Cirque du Soleil Worlds Apart 3D could have made a worse film had they tried. Absolutely nothing in this film works. Worse the standard admission price 15 is significantly higher than the normal movie ticket 11.One of the most disappointing films of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "There may be SPOILERS below.I am a huge fan of Cirque du Soleil and James Cameron. Huge fan.This movie which has been on my 'must see' list since I saw the trailer was not up to the standards of either. I sat in the theater the Malco Grandview in Madison MS trying to figure out what went wrong.Instead of being enthralled and swept up in the stunning Cirque du Soleil visuals the way I was with Dralion and every single other Cirque du Soliel show I've ever seen I sat shaking my head and trying to actually see the performances through the murky darkness searching desperately for the 'stunning visuals'. I actually tried taking the 3D glasses off to see if maybe they were dirty. Truthfully the darn trailer was more 'there' than the actual film.I expected to have an immersive experience similar to the one I had when I saw Avatar 9 times. Didn't happen. Not even close. I expected to be brought to tears the way I was when I saw my first Cirque show Nouvelle Experience. Didn't happen.I knew something was amiss when the film opened with the lead dancer telling us what the storyline of the film was going to be. Really? You have to tell us what happens before it happens? The trailer already set that up..so what's with this little exposition? Well fellow viewers if she didn't tell you what was going on you might not have figured it out.Worlds Away is a huge trailer for Cirque du Soliel shows with a 'story' thrown in to sew the different shows together. And you know what that would have been okay except the pieces that were showcased were mindnumbingly repetitive and so boring so very boring that I started looking at my watch wondering when the mishmash would be over.I am so disappointed. I parted with several hardearned dollars drove miles out of my way to get to the one theater showing the film rearranged my schedule and blew off Jack Reacher to see this. I expected better of James Cameron and Cirque du Soliel. Now I have to watch my DVDs of Dralion and Avatar to get the taste of this drivel out of my mind.".

Huge fan.This movie which has been on my 'must see' list since I saw the trailer was not up to the standards of either. I sat in the theater the Malco Grandview in Madison MS trying to figure out what went wrong.Instead of being enthralled and swept up in the stunning Cirque du Soleil visuals the way I was with Dralion and every single other Cirque du Soliel show I've ever seen I sat shaking my head and trying to actually see the performances through the murky darkness searching desperately for the 'stunning visuals'. I actually tried taking the 3D glasses off to see if maybe they were dirty. Truthfully the darn trailer was more 'there' than the actual film.I expected to have an immersive experience similar to the one I had when I saw Avatar 9 times. Didn't happen. Not even close. I expected to be brought to tears the way I was when I saw my first Cirque show Nouvelle Experience. Didn't happen.I knew something was amiss when the film opened with the lead dancer telling us what the storyline of the film was going to be. Really?

	schema:headline " Worlds Away  another mind blowing Cirque du Soleil experience.";
	schema:reviewBody "A girl named Mia goes to a rinkydink traveling carnivalcircus. While attending the circus she sees  and immediately becomes smitten by  the shows trapeze artist a boy known only as the Aerialist. As he sees her its love at first sight for him as well. He misses his trapeze and falls to the ground. But instead of going splat the ground gives way underneath him. Mia rushes over to help and she falls in with him. When she regains her senses back she finds herself in the misty dreamlike world of Cirque du Soleil whose landscape consists of numerous large circus tents bathed in glowing moonlight. The girl and the boy travel from tent to tent experiencing the weird characters and dazzling performances in each tent while desperately searching for one another in this bizarre world. That's it! I have just explained the complete plot of Cirque du Soleil Worlds Away. Not that there is really anything being given away here... in fact there is very little  if any  to give away. But the plot is not important here. It is the performances of the Cirque du Soleil performers that is. To get to the point Worlds Away is basically a Cirque du Soleil's Greatest Hits album with parts of O Ka Mystere The Beatles Love among others and actually filmed at the theatres where they are performed at in Las Vegas with the very loose plot of the two lovers traveling through the tents trying to find each other used as a clothesline on to which to hang the various acts upon. However this setup does not take away from the jaw dropping spectacle that is Cirque du Soleil. From clowns reading newspapers that are on fire to a ballet dancer dancing to the Beatles song As My Guitar Gently Weeps as rose petals drift around her and much more Worlds Away doesn't fail in the blowyourmind department.However the best was saved for last the act between Mia and the Aerialist. Does the girl and the boy find each other? Of course they do! Don't worry as I mentioned before I ain't spoiling anything. Because of Worlds Away's wisp of a storyline there isn't anything to spoil. There are no twists or turns or main surprises. Most of the acts you see in Worlds Away you have seen done before in one way or another from other Cirque du Soleil shows either from its live theater its IMAX movie shorts or its television specials. Hell you'll figure it out that the girl and the boy will eventually reunite once they  and we  start exploring Cirque Du Soleil Land! Its like I said before the movie is deliberately structured where the plot doesn't matter the performances do. You are here to have your brain dazzled not stimulated. THAT'S the filmmakers intent. Both Erica Linz Mia and Igor Ziripov The Aerialist are Cirque du Soleil pros who have been in numerous Cirque productions. To see them do their straps act forty feet in the air in the finale is breathtaking to say the least as both of them seem to almost defy gravity itself with this act! You can clearly see and respect the years of practice it took to do this and make it look effortless in fact Ziripov has performed this act before with his real life wife in certain Cirque shows. It is not only a sensual and romantic experience but it is downright astonishing to watch.On the down side to Worlds Away at times there is a clear overabundance of performances filling the screen which coupled with the loose story of the girl and boy seeking each other tends to give the film a somewhat slightly draggy and boring feel. And that may aggravate some people. When I took my girlfriend on my fourth and final time to the cinema to see it the theater was completely empty except for us and an elderly couple sitting six rows down from us. She yawned between gulps of her Dr Pepper throughout it while wondering what her boyfriend  that's me  had gotten her into. When I showed it to my mother on Bluray she wasn't impressed either even though she enjoys Cirque du Soleil. So I will say it does indeed get a wee slow but do stick with it. As I said the final act is WELL worth it.In all this is another handsome show from Cirque Du Soleil. As for director Andrew Adamson and executive producer James Cameron to which this movie had been a pet project of his for years I definitely applaud both of them.My rating from Excellent to Poor... Very Good. Well worth a look and great entertainment.".

I don't know how he did it but I do know that now the most amazing thing I've seen in a James Cameron film is NOT a special effect! The 'story' such as it is is a pseudo Alice In Wonderland setup where an earthly character gets lost in a weird world and tries to find her way out. I just wish she hadn't been lost quite so long with the Beatles... I'm not a fan. I would like to have heard and seen more from the Elvis show.

I wasn't disappointed either although it's a bit hokey.This is a very intense involving story a la the abovementioned The Fugitive except this time it's a woman chasing down her exhusband who set her up for murder. Once again we see Jones in his familiar role of chasing down the supposedcriminal.As interesting as the story is there are some credibility gaps such as why Jones didn't have a picture of the exhusband in the first place or the alwaysannoying hesitationbeforeshooting at the end which saves the good guy...and a few other things like that which are unrealistic. Will Hollywood ever stop that nonsense? However clichs aside overall it's very entertaining and always fun to watch no matter how many times I see it. Both Judd and Jones are excellent in these kind of roles.".

Once again we see Jones in his familiar role of chasing down the supposedcriminal.As interesting as the story is there are some credibility gaps such as why Jones didn't have a picture of the exhusband in the first place or the alwaysannoying hesitationbeforeshooting at the end which saves the good guy...and a few other things like that which are unrealistic. Will Hollywood ever stop that nonsense? However clichs aside overall it's very entertaining and always fun to watch no matter how many times I see it. Both Judd and Jones are excellent in these kind of roles.";

But when your dead husband suddenly shows up and you want your revenge you can get that since you've already had the punishment. These are the circumstances Libby Parsons Ashley Judd finds herself in after she is released from prison six years after her conviction. How and why the husband Bruce Greenwood framed her is not really important he just did. Now Libby tries to track him down with Matty their son as her main reason. The problem is Travis Lehman Tommy Lee Jones her parole officer who is strict in his rules. He does not believe her but of course we understand this will slowly change.'Double Jeopardy' belongs to the group of thrillers where you expect certain things to happen and you will see you were right. That is not a bad thing but it means the road to those predictable moments must have something to offer. This film has some things one of them is Ashley Judd. Maybe it was because I always like Ashley Judd but for me she was the reason this film entertained me. She plays the clever Libby in way that keeps her serious but sometimes quite funny as well. Especially the sarcastic little remarks made me smile more than once. Tommy Lee Jones is reliable as always especially in 'The Fugitive' kind of roles like this one is. Scenes between him and Judd are entertaining on themselves. Greenwood turns out to be a nice villain.Simply said if you do not expect too much of 'Double Jeopardy' there is a good chance you will have a really good time.".

Ashley Judd plays Elizabeth Libby Parsons who loses her husband Nick during a Yachting trip with him. During the police investigation it is discovered that Nick was in a financial crisis at the time of his death but left a two million dollar life insurance policy collect. Suddenly a whole set of evidence is produced to reinforce the allegation that she had a motive to murder her husband and she is convicted of murder. There is a plot problem that in reality she would have to wait seven years if he went missing from a boat before the claim was paid and it would be unlikely she would be convicted of murder without corroborating witness testimony from an independent party. Nonetheless somehow she is convicted of her husbands murder and it provides the intrigue. In prison Libby studies law in order to prove her innocence and when she phones her friend Matty who has custody of her 4 year son she accidentally stumbles on the fact that her husband may still be alive. The insurance claim has been paid to her son and her friend can use the money in his care apparently. Libby also learns that once convicted of murder of someone that you cannot be sent to trial again over the same murder and its called Double Jeopardy in legal terms. Libby is determined to hunt down her Husband for what he has done when she is released. Libby is released into supervised sentence under parole officer Travis Lehman  Tommy Lee Jones but escapes custody and sets out to track down her husband to prove her innocence. There is lots of action and Ashley Judd is such a great actress that you become emotional attached to her battle through the film. Tommy Lee Jones also performs well in his role as he breaks ranks to assist Ashley in quest to be reunited with her son in freedom.".

The scene at the BMW dealer where she gets Angie's new address. Later she obtains Nick's new and latest name and his address through a Kandinsky painting. She recognized the painting from a newspaper article about Angie's accident. It had been hanging in her house. She knew that all Kandinsky paintings were registered and used this to find Nick' New Orleans address.I'm aware of the relatively low rating of this film. I've read most of the reviews and many of them are not so complimentary. Many of these people have rated the movie as a 0 or a 1. This is one reason why the rating is so low. I will now address some of the most common complaints about the movie1. Double Jeopardy doesn't exist. The main plot point of the movie is that you cannot be tried for the same crime twice in America. Many  apparently knowledgeable  people have said that this is not true as a point of law. I'm not a lawyer but I would like to ask a question Has it ever been proved in a court of law? Has anyone ever murdered someone paid their penalty got out of jail found the still alive person and the killed them? I doubt that this has ever happened. If it does I venture to say they would find the second murder justifiable.I have always assumed that Double Jeopardy does in fact exist. Even it it really doesn't then what is the problem? In U.S. culture it does exist. It is used as plot points in many movies. Why did Charles Terry Thomas give a gun to Stanley Ford Jack Lemmon in How to Murder Your Wife.2. No credibility. There are many action scenes in the movie. Each one is believable. Taken together I guess one's credibility must be stretched. But what is the problem? This is a movie that exists for our entertainment. Is it really so important that  although she was initially handcuffed  she swims to the surface in the bay hits Tommy Lee Jones over the head with his own gun and then swims to shore is hard to believe. I enjoyed the scene. While watching it I was not thinking that it's not credible. Was Barry Kane Robert Cummings in Saboteur more credible when he while two hands were handcuffed together jumped off a very tall bridge and somehow swam to shore while police officers were in pursuit?3. Cops out of Double Jeopardy. The complaint was that although she initially wanted to kill Nick she eventually only wanted her son back and thus reneged on the Double Jeopardy plot point. My response is that she changed her mind after she realized that Simon Rider had killed his wife. She now knew that he was more dangerous that she thought. She reverted to the no. 1 priority which was to get her son back. This is not spelled out in the movie and so it's a little like Hitchcock isn't it? He loved to make the viewers think for themselves.Speaking of Hitchcock I have wondered what if this movie was exactly the same except he was the Director. Then what would the IMDb rating be? I maintain it would be close to 8.0.4. Too Predictable. Yes I admit it was predictable. I knew the moment she went to prison that she would get out and eventually be reunited with her son. So what? The ending was one of the most satisfying I've ever seen. I watched High Noon for only five minutes and knew that the Marshal Gary Cooper would have a gunfight at the end of the movie and that he would win. Didn't stop Gary from winning an Oscar at all.5. Lacks Suspense. Suspense is not a concrete thing. I can only answer this complaint by saying that for me it was very suspenseful. When she found Angie Rider's new address in Colorado and before going to the door preparing the gun  was this not suspenseful? Many situations in the movie were suspenseful. 6. The Annoying Hesitation Before Shooting. When Libby Ashley Judd and Travis Tommy Lee Jones confronted Jonathan near the end I agree that it was annoying that Jonathan hesitated before shooting. This allowed Travis to jump on him and eventually allowed Libby to kill him. I didn't like it either but it didn't bother me. This seems to be the Hollywood way. In summary Double Jeopardy is great entertainment. It's clever suspenseful and has a tearjerking ending.".

The scene at the BMW dealer where she gets Angie's new address. Later she obtains Nick's new and latest name and his address through a Kandinsky painting.

Ashley Judd is just annoying for the first hour or so of the film and it isn't until the fugitive style chase begins that the movie gets really interesting. And this of course is where Tommy Lee's excellent acting is the most entertaining and fun. He has unfortunately been somewhat typecast since his spectacular performance in The Fugitive but at least he has been typecast in a role that is always fun to watch and that he can always pull off excellently.I think it's pointless to try to argue whether or not the whole double jeopardy law can truly be handled in the way that it was described in the film but as a crime film Double Jeopardy was pretty good. Judd's husband in the film is one of those characters that's easy to hate and not only because of what he did in the movie. You just look at this guy and you immediately don't like him. That's good casting but it also completely voided any effectiveness that his auction' might ever have had. And how about that coffin scene! Who cares that no one gets buried in a coffin that has plenty of room for two! That was one of the creepiest things I've seen in a movie in years.Clearly there is nothing spectacular about Double Jeopardy. It's not going to win any awards and it probably won't be remembered for very long. But it has a certain charm that can unfortunately only be appreciated if you're in the right state of mind when you watch it. Don't expect it to be as good as The Fugitive just because Tommy Lee Jones is in it really are any movies as good as The Fugitive?.

Judd plays a wealthy wife and mother living in a waterfront home where she bonds with her sweet little son. When her husband Greenwood surprises her with a luxurious sailboat and takes her on a romantic jaunt she begins to believe that their onceshaky relationship is on the right course. However when she awakens in the middle of the night covered in blood and alone she soon finds herself the target of a murder investigation. From this moment on virtually everything that occurs in the film is preposterous in the extreme. Ludicrously she is found guilty of murder even more ludicrously she only serves 6 years for it and most ludicrously when she finds out that Greenwood isn't even dead she believes that since she has already killed him once and been tried for it she can do it again and not be prosecuted! The entire premise and title of the film is completely inane and impossible! That said the result is still a fairly gripping and intriguing experience. One is advised to completely abandon all notions of logic and reality in order to wring some enjoyment out of the proceedings. Almost nothing that Judd's character does is either plausible or sensible. She finds out her husband is alive only a month or so after being sent to prison yet she rots for 6 years and never seeks any sort of legal aid? Her stint in prison is laughable. Two burly bitches who likely would be raping her nightly instead bake her birthday cakes for her missing son. She is out of the clink about 25 seconds when she is missing her curfew and breaking and entering a schoolhouse. She then breaks away from her parole officer Jones and is on the run all over the US from then on desperately trying to retrieve her son and kill her dead husband. Jones is somehow able to completely abandon his post in order to follow her everywhere she goes. Scene after scene of thoroughly unbelievable and unrealistic situations come up. And the biggest surprise of all? Somehow Jones and Judd make it work! This film was a big crowdpleaser and in fact it does provide a considerable amount of entertainment. Jones is just playing a lessconfident lesspowerful version of his Oscarwinning role in The Fugitive but he does it well. Judd somehow manages to take the audience with her especially the female audience as she singlemindedly pursues her cretin of a husband. Greenwood does an effective job as the deplorable spouse. The outcome of the film is predetermined. The story is so full of holes it actually hurts. Yet the film still comes through out of sheer audience manipulation and actors' charisma. It was downright shocking to see Judd in a DVD featurette asserting how rock solid the story is. This woman is going to want some serious help with script choices if she plans to remain a star and if Twisted is any indication she's on the wrong path!".

For one if she killed her husband she'd STILL go to prison again for 3 reasons 1. No matter WHO she killed it would still be considered a parole violation. 2. If she killed her husband the double jeopardy clause wouldn't protect her because it would prove that she hadn't killed him before thus making the previous conviction null and void or she'd be tried for killing someone OTHER than her husband if it couldn't be proved it was indeed him she'd killed. Plus since she would have killed him on a different date time and possibly way than the first time it would be counted as a different crime anyway.Basically these thoughts kept ricocheting around my mind as I watched this movie totally destroying any possibility of enjoying the film. If you're going to make a movie like this get someone that can at least open a law book to consult the screenwriter. Maybe then they could make a script that didn't talk down to me and insult my intelligence.I give this movie 4 out of 10 stars the only saving graces being the acting and editing. I really can't recommend this film just on the sheer incompetence of the script.".

Naturally there is a darling little child involved and naturally our heart goes out to the woman who's been terribly wronged. Tommy Lee Jones is cast as her parole officer who runs a halfway house. She spends a lot of time running away from him and this leads to some wonderful chase scenes. At one point they are both underwater after she's been handcuffed inside a car. There are no real surprises in the film just some fine acting good photography and a fastpaced script that throws Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones into conflict. In spite of the formula however I thoroughly enjoyed it. Therefore I suggest it as a escape film to keep you mind involved in the perils of the people on the screen instead of focusing on your own daytoday issues. Recommended.".

Together they now have made De rouille et d'os. Is it sensational? Well um yes. Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Time will tell!Like those other two movies De rouille et d'os is about strong characters fighting their way through life against all odds. One of those characters is played by Schoenaerts the Flemish actor who is on the verge of his breakthrough in international cinema. At least that's what everyone in Cannes was talking about. Next year's American remake of the Flemish blockbuster Loft might well be his ticket to Hollywood. In De rouille et d'os Schoenaerts basically plays the same sort of character as he did in Bullhead lots of muscles little brainpower. In this movie he succeeds in embarrassing hurting or insulting everyone he cares about his child his sister and his girlfriend. He seems incapable of showing the least bit of empathy. His rude and insensitive way of treating other people would almost be funny if it weren't for the sometimes dramatic consequences. The story is about the relationship between this emotionally handicapped man and a physically handicapped woman. Although they have almost opposite characters they find each other in their mutual experience of being different from the rest. His lack of sympathy and understanding is almost an advantage for her. She lost her legs but he doesn't ask her how she copes or if she wants a shoulder to cry on. No he asks her if she wants to take a dive in the ocean with him. 'Do you realize what you're saying?' she replies. He answers by carrying her in his arms to the sea and letting her discover that she can swim by using only her arms. Audiard knows how to let his two lead actors excel. Schoenaerts is completely believable as a primitive macho who means well but screws everything up nevertheless. And Marion Cotillard is cast perfectly as a strongwilled woman who refuses to be confined to a wheelchair. I was amazed by her physical appearance as an amputee  you'd swear that she had her legs cut off in order to be able to make this movie. The visual effects are awesome. But apart from the acting achievements Audiard also has some nice visual treats. Most of the time the movie focuses on the actors but now and then aesthetics take over. The scene with Cotillard in an orca show is an example of superb directing the huge animals are filmed in such a way that it becomes clear something terrible is about to happen. De rouille et d'os shows superior craftsmanship on all levels.".

	schema:headline " Great film in a special way";
	schema:reviewBody "This Audiard film is one that grows on you. For quite some time into the film it seems both the film and its main characters aimlessly sit in their cocoon without breaking out. One feels some very vague potential in people but somehow their very lives seem the greatest impediments to its blossoming. One wonders what the film is about and where it is going. Like its characters it feels like a bunch of loose ends aimlessly hanging about. But I must say that at the end of the movie it has grown on you suddenly as the story progresses the film hatches the characters break out of their cocoon and in retrospect one feels one has been witness to the improbable and yet realistic birth of an unusual but deep love story between two common people. The story has a hidden intensity of screenplay which is intensely performed by Schoenaerts and Cotillard. It creeps beneath your skin. If you like Audiard's way of developing gradual character drama with an intensity that seems to be implicit buried beneath trailertrash but still strongly present you'll like this film. It's a story of how one can find anew a purpose in life when one feels like wasted trash. I watched this film in a full theatre of some 300 people. At the end most everybody sat silent for some minutes. It seems the film had touched something inside quite some of us there. Film as it should be.".

One feels some very vague potential in people but somehow their very lives seem the greatest impediments to its blossoming. One wonders what the film is about and where it is going. Like its characters it feels like a bunch of loose ends aimlessly hanging about.

	schema:reviewBody "There's a moment towards the end of Rust And Bone when something awful happens and we are about to witness the ultimate tragedy. For that couple of minutes the rest of the movie becomes irrelevant we are just totally immersed in this act playing out. It's a brutal but wonderful sequence and fortunately it's not the first time we have such a scene in the movie. That's pretty much what Rust And Bone is a series of wonderfully brutal sequences.The movie deals with the relationship between two fragile individuals from opposite ends of life. Ali Matthias Schoenaerts is trying to be a better father and a better man Stephanie Marion Cotillard is trying to rebuild her shattered life after a horrific accident. Their need for each other grows drastically but their real lives threaten to get in the way.As far as story lines go this isn't anything overly special. It's the kind of kitchen sink drama that we've seen Ken Loach and Mike Leigh do for ages. Fragile characters broken homes comedy out of tragedy it's the usual stuff. Only difference here is that we're seeing it all play out in France with French people speaking French and doing French things. But frankly nothing is original these days what matters more is the execution.And what sets Rust And Bone apart from other similarlythemed movies is the execution. Working class France is shot brilliantly looking gorgeous and despairing all at the same time. The special effects are topnotch and there is a somewhat jarring quality to the editing that really works.But what you really need to see this film for is Cotillard and Schoenaerts. I was trying to decide who I thought was the better actor in the film but it's impossible to choose. They are both fantastic. I've never seen Matthias Schoenaerts before but the guy is amazing. He manages to juggle pain and deadpan humour simultaneously which is quite an achievement. Cotillard meanwhile is the usual perfect self that she is. Such an expressive face and she's able to make even the hokiest of lines come off natural and genuine. I really didn't like her in The Dark Knight Rises but clearly she's at her best when she's speaking her natural language. They are what make these sequences brutal and wonderful through their chemistry and ability to suck the audience in.The rest of the film is scattered with great supporting cast performances especially Armand Verdure as Ali's son Sam. The young boy is a joy to watch and can be added to that evergrowing list of strong preteen child actors.I'm pretty sure Rust And Bone has won a few awards and deservedly so. It's amazing to watch just because it's so fun to see brilliant performances. Like I said before the story itself isn't probably that amazing. It's been done before but it's done in such a way here with those two central performances that it feels fresh and original. You really should check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cowritten by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain and adapted from a collection of short stories by the American author Craig Davidson Jacques Audiard's genuinely moving Rust and Bone is the story of two wounded people who form a bond based on recognition and acceptance of the others pain. Supported a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat the film is marked by astonishing performances by Oscar winner Marion Cotillard as Stephanie a young whale trainer struggling to recover from a horrendous accident and Matthias Schoenaerts as Ali a brutish exboxer who is unable to acknowledge or express his feelings.Rust and Bone is not a film that is easy to describe. It is raw and visceral  a punch in the gut yet it is also a film of intelligence and sensitivity certainly an art film but one that is also geared to a larger audience to anyone who has suffered pain and loneliness. When we first meet Ali he is a man with dreams of making it big in kickboxing but who is now at his lowest point. Unemployed he has just left Belgium with his fiveyearold son Sam Armand Verdure to live with his sister Anna Corinne Masiero and her husband in Antibes a French resort town on the Mediterranean. As Audiard describes him he's nothing he's a bum he's nobody. He looks just like the people lining up at soup kitchens. Though Ali appears to have a good relationship wit Sam he relates to him more like an older sibling than a responsible father as someone able to provide unconditional love. That the film allows us to see Ali as both a man of ferocious energy and innate sensitivity a threedimensional human being who elicits our empathy is a major accomplishment. Stephanie who works as trainer of Orcas at a local marine park is rescued by Ali from an overaggressive pursuer in the club where he is a bouncer and the two begin a tentative relationship. In a moment of honesty Stephanie tells him that her greatest pleasure in a relationship is to be observed I like being watched she says. I like turning guys on Get them all worked up but then I get bored. The nature of their relationship however changes forever when Stephanie is seriously injured in an accident at the pool losing both of her legs and with them her reason to live. The scene when Stephanie wakes up in the hospital to discover that her legs have been amputated is one of the most gutwrenching I've seen. After a period of recovery Stephanie now fitted with artificial legs reaches out to Ali for companionship and finds him open and receptive but brutally honest. For her he is the only person she can trust to listen to her without judgment even though in his brutal frankness he tells her that she is dressed like a whore and casually suggests that they sleep together just to see if she can still do it. Despite showing concern for her needs Ali has moments of cruel insensitivity when he picks up a girl for a onenight stand even when Stephanie is with him prompting her to ask him Am I a friend a pal a buddy like the others? If we continue we have to do it right. I mean consideration. Ali is determined to become a professional fighter and becomes engaged in illegal activities such as street fighting and doing surveillance work for his sleazy friend Martial Bouli Lanners an activity that damages his relationship with Anna and forces Stephanie to be a spectator from the sidelines. Although the film is raw there are some moments of exquisite lyricism as captured by cinematographer Stephane Fontaine in particular the scene where Stephanie interacts with a killer whale through a glass partition in an underwater tank.Despite the fact that there are some contrivances and melodrama in the plot that do not mesh with the film's gritty naturalism Rust and Bone is a stunning achievement. As Eli moves to a new level of growth not only with Stephanie but also with Anna and Sam a haunting picture emerges of two people whose inner strength allows a crisis in their life to turn into a spiritual awakening an opportunity to experience a new sense of being alive. As the Greek tragedian Aeschylus expressed it Pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until in our despair against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.".

	schema:headline " Healing in the midst of the brokenness of it all";
	schema:reviewBody "What have you done with my legs? Forget about Amour Once Upon a Time in Anatolia or A Royal Affair the best foreign films of 2012 came from France. The first was The Intouchables about a quadriplegic millionaire who hires the help of a young man from the projects while Rust and Bone centers around another unlikely relationship between a killer whale trainer and a boxer. These two were my favorite foreign films by far and I especially enjoyed this one because I am a huge fan of director Jacques Audiard who in 2009 directed the Oscar nominated A Prophet. That film was much more suspenseful as it centered on a prisoner who manages to survive inside a corrupted prison system. This time Audiard focuses on a dramatic romantic story between two tortured souls who truly learn to live after they have suffered severe physical injuries. More than a character study this film is a soul study as the two lead characters find healing under extremely rare circumstances. We are introduced to these characters in a very realistic manner. These people are afflicted in some way or another they aren't your usual likable lead characters they are deeply flawed but we sympathize with them. Like he did in A Prophet Audiard adapted the screenplay with the assistance of Thomas Bidegain based on the short stories from Canadian author Craig Davidson. Audiard's film was nominated for the Palm d'Or in last year's Cannes Film Festival and is really worth checking out. Some people had an issue with the ending because they thought everything fit together a little too neatly but I thought the final act was probably the best and most satisfying part of this film. Our physical struggles and bonds can end up strengthening our tortured souls and making us better human beings.A former boxer Alain Matthias Schoenaerts from Bullhead decides to move from Belgium to the south of France where his sister Louise Celine Sallette lives after he is put in charge of his young son Sam Armand Verdure. He isn't very responsible so he knows his sister can help him raising his son while he finds a job. He finds one as a local bouncer at a disco where he meets Stephanie Marion Cotillard a professional killer whale trainer at Marineland after escorting her back home due to a brawl. They exchange numbers but don't see each other again. Alain find a job as a security guard at a local store where he meets Martial Bouli Lanners who convinces him to begin fighting again. Martial runs an underground kickboxing tournament where he introduces Alain and they begin making some money off it. Meanwhile Stephanie continues her life at the marine land until she suffers a freak accident and loses both her legs. Heavily depressed she calls Alain and the two begin to form a special bond. She begins to go out more and even joins Alain when he goes off to fight. The two begin to support each other and despite their brokenness they begin to help each other out. Audiard is a master at creating depth and pays close attention to these random characters that end up bonding with each other but he couldn't have succeeded if it weren't for the two terrific lead performances from Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard. Cotillard was remarkable and should have received a nomination and somehow Schoenaerts manages to make his character likable despite all his flaws. There is something in the way he treats Stephanie that seems to erase all his flaws and make us want him to achieve his personal goals. The actors managed to create a rather unique and authentic relationship and for me it worked really well. Every scene that at first felt unnecessary seems to have a purpose or a symbolism later on like the way Alain looked at Stephanie's legs when he was escorting her home. Later he wins a fight he was about to lose when he catches a glimpse of Stephanie's prosthetic legs. Somehow in the midst of pain he finds greater strength and that is what makes this film so appealing. Everything which seemed so random at first seems to come together perfectly at the end. This is one of those films that stay with you long after the credits roll and it is deeply touching and moving. This is one of those films that is driven by the performances and the overall narrative of the story. The visual effects of Cotillard 's legs or lack thereof are also pretty well done. Everything about this film makes it one you will definitely want to check out. It is real it is raw and it is touching. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

The real main character in this story perhaps is Ali played by Matthias Schoenaerts. Well maybe it's not about him as well. What this story is definitely about is fighting. This story is not meant to be touching it is all about coping strategies. With Ali it's really fight or flee for Marie it's getting back on your feet after a devastating blow. Matthias does an excellent job acting a lower class man with no real education. He is simple minded and he is quite rude but he has a gentle side to him. I like the ink that Marie gets done marking the stubs of her legs 'droit' and 'gauche' left and right. To me that is a subtle way of showing that she is beginning to accept her situation. I found the casting for this movie refreshing. The looks of the characters aren't perfect. I find that I am getting tired of what seems that all actors and actresses are looking less distinctive than ever.".

I like the ink that Marie gets done marking the stubs of her legs 'droit' and 'gauche' left and right. To me that is a subtle way of showing that she is beginning to accept her situation. I found the casting for this movie refreshing. The looks of the characters aren't perfect. I find that I am getting tired of what seems that all actors and actresses are looking less distinctive than ever.";

	schema:reviewBody "After the astonishing Un prophte Jacques Audiard brings us De rouille et d'os a completely atypical love story that he himself jokingly described as a melotrash which perfectly pictures the overall tone of the film and the social classes on display.By the end of the film you will understand the meaning of the title De rouille et d'os Rust and Bone as both the elements mentioned in it portray the characters' respective adversities and the constant emphasis on their flaws as human beings.So this is a love story but like Audiard said himself the social classes on display are not your typical Colgatesmiled suitwearing warmhearted yuppie or Beverly Hills blondie shopaholic bimbo finding out she's got a heart just as big as her beachside house.This is no Hollywood romance in any way whether you think of the people we see interact or the way this whole story unfolds...it's just plain different and very refreshing. While a majority of female viewers seemed to dislike the character of Ali as a man I can tell you this is a guy most of us can relate to in some ways. Irresponsible poor rough opportunistic with the ladies questionable manners not really a good father but deep inside a good human being nonetheless.Stphanie on the other hand starts off as a very narcissistic young woman who enjoys teasing guys to admittedly revamp her selfesteem.So we've got two characters that will get us to scratch our heads thinking  How can I possibly find any of these two people likable? And the answer lies within the next two hours where Audiard and his sublime cast organically bring two ordinary characters going through extraordinary circumstances together in what ends up being a beautiful and rewarding fight to becoming better people who love each other.Now these two characters are portrayed as fighters as in most of Jacques Audiard's films. Ali is literally aspiring to become a pro MMA fighter while Stphanie following a tragic accident struggles to feel a slight bit of happiness after losing her legs.But De rouille et d'os isn't about a woman losing her legs or some guy trying to make it to the big leagues of pro fighting...This film is about the power of two united human beings and how they are able to help one another overcome their respective adversities. It does sound very heavy but Audiard made it clear when shooting the film if you watch the makingof you will see that at no point he wanted this film to be overly dramatic even when some situations that occur would usually send the characters down that path. In many ways this is a fascinating character study a quest for positivity unfolding in an emotional wasteland with glimpses of affection subtly brought to the surface here and there avoiding clichs at all times in the process.Visually De rouille et d'os is fabulous. The almost blinding sun crossing paths with the lens the beach the ocean the warm Cte d'Azur setting...If you've ever been to Antibes you will be amazed at how Audiard was able to capture the essence of that place and take it to the screen. Some people thought the pace was a little slow and there is a drastic turn of events that will seem to come out of nowhere a little bit. Some of the subplots do feel a tad undeveloped but no harm done here in all honesty. The focus remains on the two protagonists and picturing their daily living where their relationship deepens its roots.Also to those who thought Ali was insensitive  This is exactly why Stphanie feels strong when she is with him. Ali couldn't care less about her handicap. He just grabs her out of the wheelchair carries her on his back and takes her out for a swim after she spent months behind the closed doors of her apartment. There is this subtle moment when Ali takes Stphanie to his sister's place and she is all careful with Stphanie constantly feels compassionate about her and suddenly Ali a tad annoyed tells her to stop. This right there is what makes Ali so important to Stphanie  he's the only person who doesn't look at her with pity. And that is where the bold insensitive to some side of Ali becomes the remedy to her sadness.Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard are both amazing. You rarely see such an organic chemistry between two characters. This really is something special that will grow on you.Fantastic cinematic experience. Rich in both flamboyant and subtle emotions. Again some tremendous work from Jacques Audiard...and the two protagonists!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rust and Bone is new film by Jacques Audiard known largely for his  breakout success A Prophet and concerns the burgeoning relationship  between whale trainer Stephanie Marion Cotillard and street fighter  Ali Matthias Schoenaerts.  If you can avoid it it's probably best to avoid much of the plot but  given it's been fairly publicised this is fairly difficult but this is  a film that deals with disability image and to some extent class.  It's been mentioned a lot but what's really wonderful about this film  is it's complete sidestepping of exaggerated sentimentality it could so  easily fall prey to.  In the wrong hands this could be a feelgood motivational tale of a  disabled person overcoming their hardships and finding love and  personal confidence with a emotionally crippled partner who learns to  overcome his own shortcomings in a fantastical fairytale rather like  another rather successful French film that was released earlier this  year.  In all honesty too what I just described isn't completely faroff the  narrative arc in Rust and Bone.  The way the film handles its characters' emotionally however is so much  more satisfying due partly to the brilliant performances by both  Cotillard and Schoenaert but also in Audiard's writing and direction.  After all Rust and Bone is a feelgood tale eventually but it takes a  really long time to get there and doesn't revel in it.  The two leads do overcome their physical and emotional traumas through  their relationship but it is a slow process of recovery one that is  instantly recognisable in every day life.  For a film with such a potentially overthetop synopsis it does  incredibly well to stay focused on this small set of characters it  presents us as believable and relateable figures.  It poses some fascinating questions is street fighting really any more  or less cruel than training beautiful orcas to perform tricks for our  pleasure? Why do this father and son move in the first place? We only  have to assume that whatever was going on before the narrative was  worse than what is happening on screen.  What was Stephanie like before her accident? And like in Beasts of the  Southern Wild is being tough with your child sometimes necessary?  These questions leave the film open even though the main narrative is  fairly straightforward.  All in all the sheer range of emotions this film produces is testament  to it's strength.  It is difficult and charming brutal and beautiful melancholic and  humorous throughout exactly when and where it needs to be.  My only real criticism is that the narrative dips a tiny bit in the  third act once the central relationship is finally consummated which  again takes along time and initially is very matteroffact in a  suitably amusing scene the narrative begins to drag its heels a tiny  bit as the film seems to completely forget about Ali's son though his  character seems to for a bit as well but the final coda remains to  avoid sentimentality in an excellent closing few scenes.  The cinematography and soundtrack are pretty beautiful too completing  a fantastic triumph of an understated film.".

It would probably be enough to carry the film by itself but combined with Matthias Schoenaerts devilmaycare trained fighter with a well hidden heart of gold it becomes a great one. Their tempestuous relationship is the backbone here and it is never less than captivating. These are two very different people and yet they are perfect for one another... as long as both are willing to make sacrifices along the way. It is also my pleasure to report the rest of the cast are imbued with the same level of complexity as the two leads... These are REAL individuals we get to know not dull cyphers.

	schema:reviewBody "Rust and Bone a.k.a De rouille et d'os in French is a FrenchBelgian romantic drama film that stars Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts. The screenplay is based on Craig Davidson's short story collection with the same title. It tells the story of an unemployed 25 yearold man who falls in love with a disabled killer whale trainer. Jacques Audiard directs.The story starts out with an improbable tragedy. Orca whale trainer Stphanie has an accident at a tawdry seaside aquarium that leads to the double amputation of her legs. Ali arrives at his sister's house in the same ramshackle Mediterranean town of Antibes with his 5yearold son in tow.Ali's broke aimless illequipped to tend to son Sam. Stphanie and Ali first meet before the accident at a nightclub where he has taken a job as a bouncer. She has a boyfriend. He is tough bruising confident in his skin and in the sack. He gives her his number. After her trauma Stphanie calls and they enter into a relationship.Whatever digital trickery is used to strip Cotillard of her legs it's so beautifully and simply done that we soon stop thinking of her amputee status as a special effect and accept it as a simple physical truth. When things do get sexual between Ali and Stphanie their love scenes together are frequent naked graphic and sizzling hot. It's easy to believe that these two very different peoplean educated animal trainer and a barely verbal meathead  share a powerful connection at the level of their bodies a bond that they need more than they understand it. Not every viewer will be seduced by Rust and Bone's style which might be classified as romantic naturalism. There's plenty of roving intimate handheld camera in the style of the Dardenne brothers but the movie's tone couldn't be farther from Dardennes' emotional austerity. Audiard is partial to long poetic montages of light on water copious lens flares and the pulloutthestops manipulative power of American pop music. A short scene of Stphanie rocking out alone in her wheelchair to the sound of the B52s' Love Shack tells us everything we need to know about the mojo she's slowly recovering. And a later scene in which Stphanie returns alone to Marineland to reencounter the orcas who deprived her of her legs must surely represent the most exhilarating narrative use to which Katy Perry's Firework has ever been put.Looking back at the movieyou may feel surprise even shame that you managed to care so much about this nonetoooriginal story of two damaged people whose unexpected connection helps them each find their way out of a bad place in their lives. But it is a movie about letting go of shame and making way for the advent of pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rust and Bone follows the story of Ali Matthias Schoenaerts a single parent struggling to provide for his young son Sam who develops a relationship with Stephanie Marion Cotillard a killer whale trainer which grows stronger after she suffers a horrible accident.Rust and Bone is a film that opened in limited release this past weekend and recently received a nomination for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. It is carried mainly by the performances of its two stars Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts both deliver excellent performances filled with emotion and heart break as their relationship goes through its ups and downs throughout the film. The story is very unpredictable and does a great job of getting the audience to invest in these characters and getting the audience to sympathize for them as the film progresses.However be warned Rust and Bone is hardly a film for the faint of heart. Our heroine endures a devastating injury that is depicted and shown afterwords several times throughout the film. On top of that the film contains several rather bloody kick boxing sequences that may intrigue some of the male audience into possibly going to check this film out. Also the actors speak French as English subtitles are displayed on the bottom of the screen.All this being said Rust and Bone is a truly excellent picture that features great performances and an unpredictable story. If you're looking for something a little more than just your average romantic date night movie I would definitely recommend checking this one out.".

	schema:headline " Rust  Bone is the story of two broken people coming together";
	schema:reviewBody "Cotillard and Schoenaerts bring the story of two broken people to the screen in the best way I could have imagined. Famed french director Jacques Audiard is probably most known for his 2009 academy award nominated film Un prophte. This time around he makes an unconventional love story between two people. Alain van Versch Matthias Schoenaerts is a father who is having a hard time after losing his job leading to moving in with his sister. While out on a bouncer job he meets killer whale trainer Stphanie Marion Cotillard after an accident at her job she loses her legs which leads to her calling him starting up this friendship between the two as she tries to explore her new life without the ability to walk around. When he starts to fight for money she tags along and gets to see a different side of him which leads to the two developing their relationship further then friends.Audriard has made a fascinating film mainly due to the performances he is able to get from his actors. The film seemed so well made to me because these two characters go from either top to bottom or the opposite way round but either way the two characters seem so good for each other as they help the other get through life better. The film contains some very moving scenes which are set to some very modern music. A sequence set to Katy Perry's Firework is a continuing trend in the film as it is first played in front of a whale show then set to a scene with Cotillard which is the best sequence in the film. The film can get very violent most noticeable in the fight scenes Alain has to do to get money to provide for his family. There is one scene where Cotillard's character after the accident finds herself in the bed without any legs and it is just heartbreaking to see this once happy women start to descend into depression.Schoenaerts plays Alain and he is stellar as this man who cannot separate his work from his personal life. His relationship with his son has it's bad points when he cannot except that his child is weak which leads to him treating him not in the best way. His relationship with Cotillard is sweet as he try's to help this women get through life. Cotillard plays Stphanie and once again she gives another amazing performance solidifying her as one of greatest talents working today. This women quickly changes from her happy self to a very depressed women who finds it hard to deal with her life until this man comes into her life. She does transform into a happier person once he comes along to help her which leads to her helping him in the end. These two performances need to other one to make you enjoy them more.Maybe not as good as his previous film Audriard has still made a relationship movie that does not go for obvious but goes for a more personal approach as you care for how these characters develop over the certain amount of time. With fantastic performances by its leads and a great story Rust  Bone is surely one of the best films of the year.MOVIE GRADE A MVP Marion Cotillard".

This film should have gotten more recognition.With that this is a very special film. Every scene is given great attention to detail where many moments in Rust and Bone will touch your heart and have you a little watery in the eye here and there. But it's really the attention to detail with the simplest of things in the movie that give this film it's beautiful and poetic quality.The acting is superb Matthias Schoenaerts is a great and very underrated actor. And Marion Cotillard well nuff said. She's one of the best actresses out there today. Truly great acting is not being able to tell when one is acting and with so much conflict and drama going on in Rust and Bone it would be easy for the actors to sway into bad acting. But the acting is again superb all the way around from the leads to the Under Five Parts.Plus you can't beat some of the fighting scenes in this movie which doesn't show too much but it shows just enough to leave the viewer wanting more of Matthias Schoenaerts fighting another fight. Matthias Schoenaerts' character fights for his life and Marion Cotillard's character fights for hers. And as the movie progresses they fight for a love that blossoms between them. Not a film for everyone for the violence and a lot of sex but a film for people that just love to watch a great movie where characters go through rough circumstances and find beauty and love through them.I also like the fact that this movie is true and real to life. Families have there ups and downs but in the end family members forgive one another and talk once again as is demonstrated at the end of the film with Matthias Schoenaerts' character.".

	schema:headline " Counters a disjointed script with fascinating conceptual details beautiful images and intense moments of raw acting";
	schema:reviewBody "French director Jacques Audiard A Prophet counters a disjointed script with fascinating conceptual details beautiful images and intense moments of raw acting. Rust and Bone is equally mesmerising as it is clumsy but that it is ever touching is a result of some skillful albeit undisciplined filmmaking. The film's story belongs to Ali Matthias Schoenaerts a hardened man looking for a place to stay with his young son Sam Armand Verdure. With little money they house together in the home of Ali's sister Anna Corinne Masiero. Finding work as a bouncer at a nightclub Ali breaks up a fight and escorts Stephanie Marion Cotillard home. Stephanie is an orca whale trainer at Marineworld but after a freak accident at a show she is hospitalised and wakes up to find that both her legs have been amputated. Depressed and broken she calls Ali for assistance and comes to realise that with the rest of her body intact she is still capable of living. Meanwhile to make money Ali participates in sweaty unofficial kickboxing matches. As with Audiard's previous film A Prophet a gritty prison crime drama the director contrasts agonising moments of pain and violence with images that are brimming with meaning and beauty. The tone is consistent but there are bumps in the script written by the director and Thomas Bidegain. The book they've adapted Rust and Bone is by Canadian author Craig Davidson and is comprised of a number of short stories. The idea from these stories have been borrowed and developed for a whole new story and the two central characters were also written anew for the screen. Some of the theories of physicality are smart but the pastiche format of the book is too evident at times. The story structure feels episodic which leaves powerful images like Stephanie's reunion with the whale as singular isolated moments. The trajectory of the narrative is often stifled as we wait for new plot points to gain punctuality. An underdeveloped subplot surrounding Ali's security employment for example hinges on a sizeable coincidence to drive the story into its final act. The film is better as a critique of the way people fail to appreciate their own bodies until they reach catastrophic event that makes them rethink their physicality. The tight framing of the characters from the waist up removes any consciousness of the rest of their bodies. This reflects the lack of selfworth in their lives as they are only concerned by primal instincts of survival like relying on other people to mentally or physically carry them a pertinent image or scavenging for food in this downtrodden economic period.The disunity between belief and the primal thought is shown in two juxtaposing moments. Stephanie is filmed through a long lens standing alone as the mould for her prosthetic limbs sets. The shot seems isolating but the visibility of her own being reminds her that is she still alive and capable. The film then cuts to shot Ali sitting down at a computer with only half his body visible watching brawls on the Internet. It shows the immaturity of his selfpreservation in using his body for money and what he calls fun. In this instance the combination of theme and content is startlingly articulate. Audiard is less confident with romantic sentimentalism. Both characters begin to inspire each other's belief in their own physical capabilities but it's an uneven theme. Ali convinces Stephanie to sleep with him to see if her body is still functional. We know that he is promiscuous so is he just using her? The question lingers. Less convincing is when Ali claws back into the match when he sees Stephanie walking towards the fighting pitch or when she is hired to become a money handler for the fights despite seeing the brutality and juvenility. It softens the opportunity for more explosive conflict between the leads.The actors as naturalistic as they are are a little reminiscent of the film. There are flashes of brilliance including scenes of unprecedented emotional strain. But then there are stretches where Cotillard's reserved performance makes you long for more perpetuated tension and drama. It's an affecting and sometimes beautiful film but you will have to wait for its best moments.".

The film is better as a critique of the way people fail to appreciate their own bodies until they reach catastrophic event that makes them rethink their physicality. The tight framing of the characters from the waist up removes any consciousness of the rest of their bodies. This reflects the lack of selfworth in their lives as they are only concerned by primal instincts of survival like relying on other people to mentally or physically carry them a pertinent image or scavenging for food in this downtrodden economic period.The disunity between belief and the primal thought is shown in two juxtaposing moments. Stephanie is filmed through a long lens standing alone as the mould for her prosthetic limbs sets. The shot seems isolating but the visibility of her own being reminds her that is she still alive and capable. The film then cuts to shot Ali sitting down at a computer with only half his body visible watching brawls on the Internet. It shows the immaturity of his selfpreservation in using his body for money and what he calls fun. In this instance the combination of theme and content is startlingly articulate. Audiard is less confident with romantic sentimentalism. Both characters begin to inspire each other's belief in their own physical capabilities but it's an uneven theme. Ali convinces Stephanie to sleep with him to see if her body is still functional. We know that he is promiscuous so is he just using her? The question lingers. Less convincing is when Ali claws back into the match when he sees Stephanie walking towards the fighting pitch or when she is hired to become a money handler for the fights despite seeing the brutality and juvenility. It softens the opportunity for more explosive conflict between the leads.The actors as naturalistic as they are are a little reminiscent of the film. There are flashes of brilliance including scenes of unprecedented emotional strain. But then there are stretches where Cotillard's reserved performance makes you long for more perpetuated tension and drama. It's an affecting and sometimes beautiful film but you will have to wait for its best moments.";

If you enjoy thrillers especially of the mindvariety as opposed to blood and guts you will not be disappointed. I was literally on the edge of my chair shouting at the TV! We're not talking about a great classic film here but it is pretty good guiltypleasure that should keep you riveted through the end.I have one minor gripe important to me but probably not to most people Since classical music has always been a big part of my life what drew me to the film initially was that the main character is an orchestra conductor. I was disappointed in the music. Familiar themes are bastardized all the time in commercials and other venues that are designed for the general public or for special effects. But this is a story about a conductor who is working with a real orchestra Bogot Columbia that is actually playing the music not lip synching. Excerpts from a movement of a Beethoven symphony begin true enough but very soon alas the music dissolves into corny clichs that I'm sure would send poor Ludwig spinning in his grave. Unfortunately this same pattern is repeated each time we see and hear the orchestra with Rachmaninoff Tchaikovsky Brahms. Can they not let Beethoven be Beethoven must he be improved upon? On the other hand almost making up for this regrettable sin in the credits every single member of the Bogot Orchestra is listed instrument by instrument. I don't recall seeing this in a film before. Bravo. I'm sure the musicians are appreciative.".

Like the other reviewers I agree the film started off slowly and it is by no means a classic but really nice modern film noir and with some wonderful Colombian beauties. Strong cast and stylish direction raise this above the norm. I have been watching a lot of Spanish language thrillers of late. This would be a good double feature with The Body.

Definitely one of the most suspenseful films in recent memory.The imagery is solid the terror real and plausible. There is nothing in this film that could not happen in real life and if you dread isolation starvation or claustrophobia... this may bother you. It is a very strong film with no perfect characters  the emotions here are also real and very mixed just like real life.I was a little torn on the nudity and sexuality. At first I felt it was a bit much. But as the film went on I realized that the nudity was not there for an exploitative reason and actually plays an important role as the film goes on. I cannot really explain further but I will say it adds to the emotional trauma. I am grateful to Fox World Cinema for picking this one up  a real gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrs Baiz is a young up and coming film writer and director from Colombia and his early works show a definite talent for unveiling mysterious stories in a very unique way. THE HIDDEN FACE La Cara Occulta can be mindboggling until the second part of the film begins. As a story written by Arturo Infante and Hatem Khraiche and adapted for the screen by Baiz and Khraiche.The story deals with a young and successful Spanish orchestral conductor Adrin Quim Gutirrez who is offered the position as chief conductor of the Bogota Philharmonic Orchestra an enviable assignment he accepts and his beautiful designer girlfriend Beln Clara Lago agrees to move with him. They are welcomed to Bogota given a spacious mansion in which to live and Adrin begins his assignment as conductor of the symphony. As luck would have it at a party of the supporters of the orchestra Adrin is noted by Beln to be flirting with one of the violinists. Beln shares her discovery with a friend who suggests that Belen leave a note for Adrin that she will not tolerate infidelity and that she is leaving him to teach him a lesson. Finding Beln gone and the taped note on his cellphone Adrin goes to the local bar to get drunk and there meets cocktail waitress Fabiana Martina Garca who consoles him over his girlfriend's leaving him and drives the drunken conductor home and spends the night. This leads to a passionate romance and Fabiana moves in only to be gradually frightened by strange sounds that make her believe the house is haunted. Adrin continues his conducting and tries to placate Fabiana's fears until Fabiana begins to question whether Adrin had something to do with Beln's disappearance one of the police who questions Adrin is an old boyfriend of Fabiana....Now Spoiler's Alert if you watch the preview you already know this but if you didn't watch the preview you may want to not read further! The second portion of the film can be summarized in the following way In retrospect...Beln had decided she would leave Adrin a message that she's leaving and instead move into a secret bunker originally built by the house landlord to see his reaction. The bunker is soundproof bullet proof and is hidden right next to the master bedroom and bath with a secret entrance through one of the mirrors which one can see through from the inside but is just a plain mirror when viewed from outside. After recording her message she moves all her belongings into the bunker to give the impression that she'd indeed moved away and shuts herself in. The only problem is it could be opened only through a key to get out the key which she'd forgetfully left on top of the bed before locking herself in. She realizes her mistake only when she decides to end the act and come out to console Adrin who finds it hard to cope with her leaving. But one day Adrin meets and brings home waitress Fabiana only to be watched helplessly by Beln from inside the bunker. The rest of the film is of her bearing witness to goings on in the bedroom while desperately trying to let herself out to freedom.The style with which Baiz tells his story is unique and his small cast carries it off very well. Quim Gutirrez is a fine Spanish actor but needed considerably more training to pass as an orchestral conductor! Both of the lead actresses are not only beautiful to look at but are also very fine in their challenging roles. Otherwise the musical score is basically excerpts from Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky with considerable filler thrown in. The film is just not sure how it wants to be read and if it is supposed to be a suspense thriller then the trailer and the previews should be discarded. Yet it is difficult to imagine that all audiences will not be entertained by this film as it is very well made and has many levels of meaning. Grady Harp April 12".

Even though the male protagonist is rather stoic most of the time his crying scenes are well done. But the plot...oh god awful. I'm not gonna spoil it cause there are really only 2 plot twists in the whole movie that follow each other rather quickly really. But if the plot is based on a stupid egoistical and oh so incredibly stupid b....woman god I hate that woman! And the other one...just as awful. But at least she wasn't stupid. Just awful... If you can see merit in the tragedy that comes from people being awful and awfully stupid and you're horribly into cheesy fast paced romances then by all means give this one a try. If you didn't know what you're getting yourself into like myself this movie will most likely make you feel cheated. Boring after the first twist terribly predictable and oh yeah boring with a horribly open end that gives no satisfaction whatsoever. But the acting was good. It really was. So it's 310 instead of 110.Oh yeah and this IMDb censorship is ridiculous...".

It works as a psychological thriller mystery and horror. Spanish cinematography is one of the best in the entire world. Sure they tend to make strange and weird movies but it happens that I enjoy watching such films. One thinks while watching nothing is served on a plate like in American movies so one feels engaged while watching not disconnected and one cares what will happen to the characters. Everything is top notch in this film. The best part is the ambiguous ending one is left wondering how it will all resolve and how would one behave in similar situation. The movie questions one's actions and a moral compass whether anybody in the story has one or not. This will probably be remade in Hollywood but it won't outdo this Spanish masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Once you get past its slow chugging first half The Hidden Face picks up enough steam to freewheel you into its rollercoaster ending.";
	schema:reviewBody "Dubbed in English and renamed from its original Spanish title La Cara Oculta The Hidden Face is a decent thriller if you have the patience to endure its lackluster first half. Moreover there is every possibility that this film could be interpreted as a spooky ghost story as perhaps intended by writerdirector Andrs Baiz. To truly appreciate this thriller I strongly caution against watching the trailer or reading other reviews that include one of the film's best kept secrets.The plot plays out in two parts each from a different perspective that converges into a series of twists and turns before the finale. At the beginning of the first part we are introduced to Adrian Quim Gutirrez a successful Spanish Orchestra conductor hired by the Bogota Philharmonic Orchestra in Columbia. Dumped by his girlfriend Belen Clara Lago Adrian wallows in dejection at a local pub but is charmed by the affections of a waitress Fabiana Martina Garca. They hit it off and before you know it Fabiana moves in with Adrian even as the police begin investigating Belen's sudden disappearance. Sure enough before Fabiana gets too comfortable she discovers something odd about Adrian's plush residence. Before long Fabiana is plagued with a nagging sensation and suspects foul play behind Belen's disappearance. The second part is essentially a chronological prelude that places Adrian and Belen during happier times. Moving to Bogota from Spain they take up residence in a charming little cottage but Belen suspects Adrian to be a two timing womanizer. Like a curious cat Belen sets a trap to expose Adrian but inadvertently sets about a chain of events and in the process seals her own fate.Dubbing this Spanish film into English would not have been such a bad idea if it weren't for the terrible voice acting. As such Baiz has had to compromise on what I imagine would have been a dark and brooding thrillernoir. The premise is intriguing but starts off like a slow chugging steam propelled locomotive. Baiz also throws you every clich in the book from power cuts to sudden thunder claps including creepy bathroom scenes akin to those found in Japanese horror movies. Even so anyone who has seen What Lies Beneath will be in for a surprise by the time the plot gets to its darker second half. Not only does it become obvious that Baiz uses the first half to throw you off course this is where his engine picks up enough steam to freewheel you into the rollercoaster ending. Like a two punch combo when the mystery behind Belen's disappearance is revealed it hits you like a stunning jab and hook in quick succession. In shifting the premise from mystery to survival this is where Clara Lago comes in and singlehandedly delivers a suspenseful third act. On the other hand Gutirrez's Adrian is a mere meh  you are never sure if he is hiding something or if he is ominous by nature.For the most part Baiz's dependence on just three central characters pays off more so as this film appears to have been made on a shoestring budget. There is a distinct style exerted by the director and I liked how it drew me in from a soapopera like beginning through to its frantic final moments. With Gutirrez sidelined the rest of the story becomes a race to the finish thanks to Garca and Lago. In doing so both of their characters are effective in echoing the idiom Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.".

Consequently it is a film which makes you think it would be well worth watching it again but with the benefit of foreknowledge. The story revolves around a famous concert conductor whose girlfriend has gone missing. As police hover around him he begins a new relationship with a cocktail waitress. This latter girl experiences some strange events in his house.It's nigh on impossible to discuss this film without revealing spoilers. Given that the central conceit involves the missing girlfriend discovering a secret room in the house when an exowner alerts her to it a room which allows those within to observe and see but to remain in secret themselves. She enters it to test her boyfriend's loyalty by watching him but unfortunately accidentally locks herself in. It's actually a brilliant idea as it allows the film to operate in several different ways. Firstly it generates considerable suspense as we empathise easily with the woman caught in this trap. Secondly it allows the film to open up like it is a ghost story with all the requisite unexplained spooky goings on. And thirdly it works on a psychological level where once the two women become aware of one and other their actions have a selfpreservation aspect which furthers the drama and intensifies the horror. The story in fact tells the story from three perspectives the conductor and both of the women. In this way it allows the differing angles in which they see the situation to create their own dynamics. None of the characters ever fully know what the others are up to and these gaps in knowledge are used to great effect by the filmmakers to create suspense and intrigue.".

I found the male character unlikeable though this may be intentional. Other than his earning potential I can't understand why these women were so obsessed with possessing him. The guy is quite the selfabsorbed jerk.The real plot is about two women battling it out in terms that are absolutely chilling. Bearing in mind that the female leads are very attractive and surely see each other as mortal enemies one wonders how enmity can quickly grow to such extremes. Cold and brutal. Opens one's eyes to the kitty eat kitty aspect of modern female workings. It's refreshing to see a film that catches the vagaries of both sexes. Well shot well acted firmly directed. Entertaining. Some plot points were completely dropped however. Almost seemed unfinished. When you watch you will understand my meaning. I'm simply avoiding a spoiler. All said there are lasting thoughts a memorable theme and an element of horror worth checking out.".

The more of a fan you are of both movies and cinematography the higher you will rate this documentary. From silent movies to modernday the producers on this did a fine job showing examples of films from every decade up to 1990. It would be fun to see an updated edition of this to include films from the past 15 years.This video gave me a new appreciation for blackandwhite films. Some of the photography was magnificent and many cinematographers think that is the medium in which they could really show off their talents.Regarding color this documentary is where I first heard about the fabulously filmed movie Days Of Heaven 1978 which has become one of my alltime favorites. In all there are about 125 films mentioned so you may discover some gems you weren't aware of as I did.Whether you know most of these films or just a few you should find a number of things in here interesting.".

But most importantly clearly depicts how Directors of Photography over came these limitations and created new techniques which changed film history forever. Brilliant!!!! You'll never look at a film the same way after seeing this.Covers many different aspects of the Hollywood look and the different Studio looks throughout time. Also uncovers the secrets of many DP's and how they made their Stars look so incredible!!I especially like the section on Film Noir and the plethora of absolutely breath taking film clips!!! Included in this gem of a documentary are great clips from classics like the 1947 version of Oliver Twist and examples from some of the greatest DP's of all time!!! Arthur Miller...etc...Very entertaining!! Even for nonfilm buffs!!!

	schema:reviewBody "In movie documentaries and in the public's awareness of movies cinematography rarely gets much attention however important it may be. Indeed the public would probably never hear about the craft if not for the academic cover it provides for the Oscars ceremony putting it in the award lineup gives those silly prizes some more serious technical credibility as do editing and art direction. Thus when I heard about this obscure documentary I was impressed that somebody would focus on this topic and expected a viewing experience that would educate me an interested film buff who isn't aspiring to be a filmmaker more about this aspect of filmmaking. Unfortunately the documentary turns out to be more superficial. I thought Visions of Light would be more illuminating pun not intended and enlightening pun intended.The visual presentation mainly consists of a glut of shots from films over the years parading by in breathless fashion and amounts to little more than celebratory namedropping. These shots could've showed up in the context of some other documentary  about directors actors or great American films for instance  and it would've been much the same. Sometimes the montage is pointless. Why look at Quinlan strangle a guy in Touch of Evil? Is the cinematography more interesting for this particular shot? And what did the cinematographer or DP for Do the Right Thing do to convey the hottest day of the year through his photography? The documentary never makes this clear and the clips from the movie become the random scenes of a promotional featurette.What the documentary cares to teach us is not technical enough the show reiterates that DPs employ light and shadow to construct a shot. Okay well I knew that already. We glimpse many DPs chatting with the interviewer about their craft but often their talking is just anecdotes or Oh what an eyecatching scene that old master made! I wished to learn What kind of process goes into shooting a scene? What kind of buttons and dials does the cameraman manipulate? Could we have seen some videos or animations of cameras lights and other devices in action? Likewise there is no narrator to flesh out the history and technique of cinematography we mainly hear the DPs reminiscing.There is only scattered discussion of a few techniques used on a few films. It was intriguing to hear Michael Chapman mention how Paul Schrader's script for Taxi Driver was very visual and helpful for guiding his work. I would've liked to hear more about how the DP collaborates with the screenwriter director and other filmmakers not just that Orson Welles was impressed by Gregg Toland for instance.A few humorous moments include 1 Chapman observing how both he and Martin Scorsese talk rapidly which made discussing films with each other easier 2 Gordon Willis making a pompous fool of himself by casually comparing himself to Rembrandt.".

An actor has his own concerns and some of those conflict with those of the filmmaker. It is the filmmaker's job to create the vision. So too with cinematographers. Whenever one of them wrests control of a film the film is lessened from what it might have been.That's because film is a uniquely multidimensional experience. Take film music. This is is an art all to itself. Hearing film composers chat about their work is interesting and that is the level of what we get here. But hearing a talented critic of film music talk about many composers and techniques and effects is a real treat. We missed that here even before we get into some incredible examples that were overlooked because because of politics perhaps because they were too sophisticated for target TeeVee audience perhaps because the requisite talking head was unavailable.But on beyond that how wonderful would it have been to have someone intelligent use even these same examples and speak from the perspective of filmmaker. That guide would let us know the negatives of the craft sorry couldn't resist how effects can be composed across skills art design editing acting writing. It would be worthwhile. To listen to these guys a film starts with a story everyone supports the story as best they can and of these the photographer brings it to life perhaps artfully. A low point is when we are told about green is for intelligence' concerning The Last Emperor.'What a scandal. What a missed opportunity.Ted's rating 2 of 4  Has some redeeming feature.".

	schema:reviewBody "A documentary about the history and influence of movie photography featuring many of the most acclaimed and successful cinematographers of the 1960's 70's and 80's.If you're interested in how a movie is photographed  and all true cinephiles should be  this excellent documentary is a great way to learn contains a slew of captivating shots from a hundred years of cinema and captures the comments of some of the very best directors of photography ever to strike a light. It's also a little bit of a time capsule made just prior to the advent of digital photography and projection it's a glorious celebration of good old soupy celluloid and just what cameras are capable of. It starts at the birth of cinema and moves through the silent era the restrictions of sound the experimentation of film noir the move to colour the influence of European new wave and the amalgamation of all these elements into modern cinematography. Every single one of the interviewees is intelligent and articulate but also surprisingly different. They talk about technical effects like diffusion and how to light actors they talk about symbolism through use of colour and shade they talk about relationships with directors and with their subject matter and what they all share is a burning obsession to make whatever they're shooting come alive. Movies irrespective of their style or genre should first and foremost be passionate and cinematography is the key to this. I particularly like Hall's philosophy whereby accidents and mistakes may have just as much value as the most elegantly composed traditional shot and there are plenty of humorous anecdotes such as Fraker's vignette about the telephone in Rosemary's Baby. Movies contain many key elements  music and editing are just as important  but without photography they simply wouldn't exist. It is the most important and integral aspect of any film and the power of great imagery is extraordinary universal and beautiful. A coproduction of the American Film Institute and Japanese broadcaster NHK this was shown at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. Director McCarthy was Variety magazine's senior film critic for thirty years from 1979  2010 and also made another excellent feature documentary in 1990 called Hollywood Mavericks. This is hard to find my copy is from an old home videotape from a BBC TV screening but is available in Europe through the BFI and is well worth tracking down.".

I also wished for a few more esoteric examples. Most of the films discussed are the really obvious ones especially as the discussion gets closer and closer to contemporary times. The first half of the film is the best part getting into some of the history and I particularly enjoyed the look at John Alton and film noir. As a whole it's a nice compendium and there are a few interesting insights but it really lacks the depth I was hoping for.

It's compilation of many many film clips that illustrate the power of cinema as corny as it might sound over the past century or so. It gives almost all of the key times of at least American film and it gives the main players in as much directorwise and cinematography as can be. The big editing techniques are established as well stretching across from the early silents to modern times as far as 1992 anyway. As an introductory lesson you could do a lot worse I'm sure though it pales in comparison to for example the Scorsese documentaries on American and Italian cinema. It runs through the basics pretty clearly gives some very excellent clips one or two perhaps unexpected and maybe a few never seen and then leaves in its relatively short running time. For film professors the one I had the first time at any rate this is a keeper as one of the films to show I suppose. It gives the students and other casual film viewers its due though it could've been more.".

From this point of view I was disappointed.The movies used as illustration are fairly mainstream.  I had heard of almost all of them even though I hadn't seen them all.One thing that I very much have a problem with is that I think that the frame speed was accelerated on some of the silent film clips.  The alternative would have been to repeat some frames so that events would play at the intended speed but would have a slight skipping irregular pace.  24 frames per second was not a standard film speed during the silent period so many films were done in 16 18 or even occasionally 12 frames per second  I believe that the latter solution to the frames problem is preferable to comically fast pacing.Also the silent period was some what gypped in that it got the same amount of time and focus as each subsequent decade.  It should have gotten twice as much time as a decade because it includes 1910's and 1920's and all prior movie history.  Other than this minor disparity the amount of time spent on each decade is about equal.  This is good because the documentary isn't skewed toward any era.Even bias is a prerequisite for a film documentary and this documentary has it.Keep in mind that this documentary is very general.  It would be impossible to go into a great deal of depth in only 1 12 hours.  It is not for an extreme film buff.  The film is not going to be a revelation but if you are looking for a very general introduction to cinema this is a good documentary to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1982 gongfu classic Shaolin introduced Jet Li to the world but there is no breakout star to be found here in Benny Chan's take on the famed birthplace of Shaolin martial arts. No matter really though Heavenly King Andy Lau may not have the moves or the agility to match Jet Li his leading man performance here is no less terrific. Indeed what Andy lacks in the physical department he more than amply makes up for with his dramatic chops delivering a deeply moving performance as the arrogant and scheming warlord Hou Jie who undergoes a 180degree transformation under the tutelage of the Shaolin monks.This transformation is at the heart of Benny Chan's film which differentiates itself splendidly from the recent crop of period epics with a generous infusion of Buddhist teachings. These nuggets of wisdom elevate Shaolin into a surprisingly thoughtful film meditating on the fruitlessness of anger violence and hatred and preaching ever persuasiveness the merits of peace compassion and love. Nonbelievers however need not fear Benny's sure hand never lets the film become sanctimonious instead emphasising the universal truths of these teachings and demonstrating their truism through a heartfelt yarn.Written by no less than four writers the story is a gripping one of repentance and renewal set amidst a time when China was torn apart by internal strife and threatened by foreign powers. General Hou Jie was one such local warlord his hunger for power matched by that of his secondincommand the equally scheming Cao Man Nicholas Tse. A compelling opening sequence introduces Hou Jie and Cao Man as the despotic men they are at least at the start chasing an enemy right into the compounds of the Shaolin temple and paying no heed to the abbot's words to let him save the dying man.Hou's victory though is shortlived as an ambush on his sworn brother whom he suspects of ill intentions goes awry. The orchestrator is none other than Cao Man whose own tyrannical ambitions Hou had fomented over the years. In a reversal of fate the film plants Hou at the doorstep of the Shaolin temple seeking the monks' help to rescue his badly wounded young daughter. There is an obvious play on the Buddhist concept of karma here but rather than dwell too much on these implications Benny shrewdly grounds this turn of events in keenlyfelt poignancy underscoring their importance as a defining moment in Hou Jie's subsequent metamorphosis.Whereas lesser directors may have been tempted to skim through Hou Jie's redemptive journey Benny exhibits an assuredness in allowing the movie to settle down to a more measured pace before its actionpacked explosive literally finale. He also brings on Jackie Chan in an amusing role as the resident Shaolin cook Wu Dao a laidback fellow perfectly content with his circumstance. It is not unlike the one Jackie played in Little Big Soldier two years ago but it's always enjoyable to see the veteran gongfu actor back on screen especially in a particularly entertaining sequence where he uses his cooking skills to good measure against Cao Man's soldiers.Other notable supporting roles include Wu Jing as the senior Shaolin monk Qing Neng and Hou's mentor as well as Xiong Xin Xin best known as Ghost Feet Seven in the Wong Fei Hung series as Cao Man's evil henchman Jiang Yuan. Unfortunately the script doesn't quite do justice to the actors playing these supporting roles Xiong's character and Fan Bingbing's one as Hou Jie's wife Yan Xi are sorely underwritten and a waste of their considerable talent. If there is one consolation it must be that Benny has given Andy ample screen time to flesh out the complexities of his character.And what a job Andy does equally effective as the egotistical warlord on the pursuit of riches and power and as the reformed monk who realises the folly of his past ways. There's never been a doubt that Andy possessed screen charisma but here he rewards Benny's attention to his character with a richly nuanced and textured portrayal of a man struggling to overcome his angry and violent tendencies to become a better person. Just as impressive is his gongfu though no match for Jet Li's naturally but still admirable nonetheless especially when he duels with Nicholas with a long wooden pole.Thanks to some nifty action direction by Corey Yuen and choreography by veteran stunt people Yuen Tak and Lee Chung Chi the action sequences do not disappoint. But ultimately the strength of Benny Chan's Shaolin lies in how surprisingly intellectual and deeply moving it is intellectual in its Buddhist leanings of the vicious cycle war hatred and greed perpetrates and moving in its portrayal of one man's redemptive journey to free himself from his sinful past. It is a blockbuster in every sense from spectacle to emotion and most of all spirit.www.moviexclusive.com".

It also takes place on around the same time period but in a time of turmoil in China where warlords fought over the land much at the expense of the masses. Warlords which Andy Lau also appears in is great as well and I highly recommend that movie also. Anyhow Andy Lau gives an outstanding performance here as Hou Jie. Hou Jie is a ruthless warlord general. His unscrupulous actions catch up with him that result in him taking refuge in a Shaolin temple he once disrespected. His second in command played by Nicholas Tse picks up where Hou Jie left off exceeding his predecessor in immorality and cruelty. The legendary Jackie Chan appears as a lighthearted support role as cook for the Shaolin monks. This tale of redemption is a very well crafted film by HK veteran director Benny Chan. The film looks beautiful and is very well performed shot and directed. Jet Li's preferred fight choreographer Corey Yuen set up the action which of course is awesome and there are large helpings of it as well. Shaolin should please most action fans and has the potential to win over viewers who normally stay away from this sort of stuff as this is very well made and an excellent dramatic film in its own right.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Shaolin";
	schema:reviewBody "The Shaolin movie I know was one in the 80s that launched the film career of Li Lianjie who somewhat faded away until his portrayal of Wong Fei Hong in Once Upon a Time in China that launched him to superstardom. Superstars aren't lacking in this update of Shaolin Temple which promises spectacular action sequences but what's surprisingly excellent here isn't the action but the spirit of Buddhism and themes that come along with it.It isn't a remake per se of the old Shaolin Temple movie given a fresh set of characters and a premise that's remotely similar set after the fall of the Qing dynasty with warlords battling it out for supremacy and territory in China. In what I thought was quite a stark message in warning of any future infighting amongst the Chinese if they do not stand united that foreign powers are more than willing to wait for an opportunity to exploit. Economic advantages offered should also be scrutinized beyond immediate gains where corruption of the few in power would mean severe losses on a national scale.That aside this film centers itself squarely on the central character of the ruthless and cunning warlord Hao Jie Andy Lau who has no qualms in constantly gaining upper hands amongst enemies and allies even. In a wrongly calculated move to take on his sworn brother in an ambush his protg Cao Man Nicholas Tse probably had understood his mentor's philosophy that no man is indispensable to quash his insatiable appetite for power and glory and through the countless of indoctrination in the HaoJieSchoolofThought it is no wonder that Cao Man ultimately decides to betray his master. Think of it as striking when the iron is hot to become top dog and making decisions rather than taking them.In a tale about retribution and karma Shaolin doesn't deviate very far from those themes of how evil intentions can lead one astray and suffer inconsolable consequences only for religion to point one back to the path of righteousness and all things good. In some ways this resembled the story of Huo Yuanjia in Fearless where pride comes before the fall of man stripping him of everything and down to his core then comes the rebuild of character and ultimately walking the talk and redemption. Hao Jie's story follows this trajectory and there's no qualms about Andy Lau being cast in this dramatic role despite his lack of real martial arts skills as compared to his other counterparts in the film opposite the likes of costars Nicholas Tse Wu Jing Xing Yu Xiong Xin Xin and Jackie Chan who serves as comic relief as a Shaolin monkcook.But most of the costars were severely underutilized as the story with responsibility coming from no less than five writers didn't pay the others too much attention. Nicholas Tse probably had the meatier role as the chief villain who schemes and sneers while the rest are in to showcase more of Shaolin martial arts in one film except for Xiong Xin Xin being the villainous sidekick to Cao Man with no dialogue. Wu Jing Xing Yu and Ye Shaoqun all starred as the requisite monks caught up in the firefight as the latter two become part of a group who steals from the army to feed the villagers. Fan Bing Bing was a complete waste as the token female amongst the cast and although she had a scene or two in a big action sequence in an ambush little can be said once she appears on and off as the damsel always in distress.Action direction came from Cory Yuen with choreography courtesy of Yuen Tak responsible for Gallants and Li Chung Chi all veterans in their field so quality is almost assured when the combatants take on each other although I must say that most fights ended as soon as they began which is a pity. Quality also goes toward the art direction with production values culminating in the recreation of the Shaolin Temple made to resemble a bastion of compassion open to all and sundry displaced by warring factions seeking refuge at its doorsteps in tumultuous times.Benny Chan's filmography may have blown hot and cold in recent years but Shaolin establishes him back at the top of the game able to handle a big budgeted spectacle that doesn't necessarily rely on star power and action to deliver the goods but actually is a thinking man's film on the philosophical aspects of Buddhism and the balance of Martial Zen. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1982 The Shaolin Temple puts Jet Li into the spotlight as a young man highly skilled in martial arts which pathed his acting career into the fame he has today.Around 29 years later director Benny Chan comes with a new adaptation of the classic which shares a similar story with a new cast. Here we have Andy Lau Li's costar in The Warlords 2007 taking the leading role of Hou Chieh a ruthless warlord who crosses path with Shaolin Temple and sees transformation of himself from a ruthless warlord to a monk with compassion. Together with Nicholas Tse and Jackie Chan in a special appearance Shaolin marks the first Chinese blockbuster to hit the screens of Asia in 2011.The story is set in China after the fall of Qing Dynasty with various warlords fighting over the territories. Hou Chieh a ruthless warlord who bear grudges with Shaolin Temple and sets to get rid of the people around him for his own benefits was betrayed by his righthand man Tsao Man Tse. It not only leads to the death of his daughter but also makes his wife Fan Bing Bing decided to leave him for good. After being taken refuge by the cook Chan the cook enlightens him and Hou decided to become a monk in Shaolin leaving down the past behind him and start a new life. Though disciples in Shaolin bears grudges with Hou in the past they accepted Hou. Eventually we will see how Hou and the disciples defend Shaolin from the invasion of Tsao's army and the Western powers.The plot sounds no novelty in it where we can see how the protagonist repents from his sin to the mistake made in the past to how they will defend in what they believe in. Here we have seen how the Buddhist teachings have been integrated into the plot. In relating to the Buddhist teaching on the term 'you reap what you sow' with cause and effect Hou saw the fall of his power and death of loved ones by betrayal which he gets it from his belief of the dog eat dog world.Another perspective of Buddhism that can be seen in Shaolin is 'evil begins with the greed and obsession for power'. This is shown by the portrayal of the sufferings from the civilians during the civil war with warlords fighting for power and wealth. The perspective has become the main theme of the movie where not only we have seen how Tsao wanted to control the territory but also the Western powers who aims to take over China using gun power. This has somehow reflect on what has happened in today's society on how stronger bodies are getting rid the culture values and history using destructive powers.Lau's role of Hou Chieh is different from Li's leading role in Shaolin Temple in terms of characters and the incidents they have been through. Both shared similarities in their fate and enlightenment to how they find a way to save the majority of the people around them. Chan's cameo appearances as the cook provides some comic relief for the audience after having a long intense and pressure from Tse's evil character. The comic relief did not last very long since the fate of Shaolin Temple is the main concern of the film.Overall Shaolin makes a very good start for Hong Kong's film industry in the beginning of 2011 where it not only shows how Hong Kong film industry are making a turn from various disappointments in 2010 but also pins hope for better productions in the coming months.".

I can therefore heartily recommend this film.Whilst being a good watch there is also some good oldfashioned silly translations to add to the enjoyment. Don't mess with the Shaolin Temple is one fine example and another is You bastards come and attack the temple I'll send you to the Netherworld. I don't know if you get this with the English soundtrack as I was watching the subtitled version. There's a solid storyline and the usual stuff about the baddie finding redemption and making good his evil ways but it's not as 2dimensional as these plots often are as you see the effect on Andy Lau's wife and daughter in no uncertain terms. The martial arts action is good though not outstanding. Jackie Chan has a supporting role but when he does eventually get an action scene it is laugh out loud funny and absolutely true to the character he plays in the film.It's not the world's best film but it would be hard to go wrong with this if you want to watch an entertaining epic with lots of action. I'm intrigued to know how much of the battles scenes and destruction of buildings was CGI and how much miniatures. I suspect it was a mixture. I'll have to listen to the DVD commentary to find out".

	schema:reviewBody "Andy Lau gives his all. And it certainly shows on screen. I do wonder why has he not done more Hollywood movies. Maybe he does belief parts of things that he said in this movie cannot really tell you what it is but I think those who have seen it get it. The effort to make this movie a little Hollywoodlike certainly shows. I guess it is to attract audience. But I do miss closeups and landscape views since they are not that many in this movie. Action scene is wonderful but dimmed down to make pace of the movie. Overall it is understandable though lacking in power and presence of the scene Actingwise no complaints.I do feel sorry for the scene placements it just doesn't make sense. It feels rushed at times and slowed down quickly than rapid changes of action scenes and dramatic scenes. And the music with it certainly did not help since there is countless time I thought the movie was over but then the music and scene start action again. Needs to learn this one from the western counterpart.Speaking of western counterpart the villains damn they were awful. All of them through the dire of Andy's acting you get their presence. But without Andy I would beat up the villain easily they just look too nice bad acting. But given the circumstances of the greatness of the movie still A for effort. Lastly the CG and Special effects. Just because you can do big does not mean you must do big. Play it on occasion and it would look great. Play it too much and the power will fade away. I'm guessing that is why they cut and paste scenes overlapping too much when the action starts to get going. Should learn more from Lord of the Rings for the action scenes.Thank you.".

Maybe he does belief parts of things that he said in this movie cannot really tell you what it is but I think those who have seen it get it. The effort to make this movie a little Hollywoodlike certainly shows. I guess it is to attract audience. But I do miss closeups and landscape views since they are not that many in this movie.

Also action direction coming from veterans Cory Yuen with Yuen Tak and Li Chung Chi its definitely something not to be missed Benny Chan's films may not have been the best in the recent past but with Shaolin he definitely delivers a blockbuster. A movie which is not only high on action but also rich in the spirit of Buddhism.The main protagonist Hou Jie Andy Lau a ruthless warlord who bear grudges with Shaolin Temple and sets to get rid of the people around him for his own benefits is betrayed by his own brother and repents from the mistakes he made which leads to the death of his daughter. The cook Chan at the temple takes him into refuge where Hou decides to become a monk at the Shaolin which is where the Buddhist teachings come in to play. Disciples in Shaolin who bear grudges with Hou for his deeds in the past eventually accept him and in the climax war they all defend Shaolin from the invasion of Tsao's army and the Western powers.Jackie Chan's cameo in an amusing role as the cook provides some comic relief for the audience in an otherwise intense plot which doesn't last for long since it deviates from the main concern of the film. But there is one fight sequence with Chan.But what I did miss was some beautiful landscape views with its massive set pieces it was something that was expected. Also apart from the main characters not much attention was paid to the costars. No female presence as such in an overall grand movie of all sorts.In the end its definitely worth a look but you'll somehow just wish it was better. The climax with its awesome fight sequence and huge sets being exploded is also worth the watch.".

Since he started in films in the early 80s he has either been the STAR the star the costar or a mere cameo. There has been precious little in between.Until now.In an are in China where many warlords fought and struggled over territory and power the Chinese Army were cruel and violent pricks  at least that's how they are portrayed here.One of the worst of these was leader General Hou Jie he callously orders the killing of innocent villagers for fear that they may possibly be harbouring the enemy and the killing of the enemy because well they're the enemy can't argue that one. When his reluctant 2IC Cao Man expresses doubt at the level of violence and whether those targeted even deserve what is being dished out he receives an impromptu lesson 'it is better to be the aggressor and be wrong than the passive dead guy' or something along those lines.On this day though they follow an enemy into peaceful monk territory a Shaolin temple. While the monks refuse to take sides they will not allow violence on their turf and they protect the man. Initially.Hou Jie backs down on his word and guns down the soldier in an act of proactive violence pausing on the way out only to deface some sacred Shaloin signage. He gets home to his wife and adoring daughter who proudly shows him a drawing of him in action with the title 'My Daddy likes fighting' I shouldn't judge my boy might say 'My Daddy likes chips and beer! Back in cautiously peaceful time Hou Jie becomes increasingly nervous about the prospect of being betrayed or attacked  even by his good friend and ally. In another unnecessary preemptive strike Hao Jie takes his friend out in cold blood purely to advance his own station and eradicate another potential rival and hindrance to his success.Unfortunately though Hou Jie's actions and teaching eventually and inevitably work against him his former 2IC Cao Man betrays him and Hou Jie must seek refuge immediately but where? What follows is a generally rewarding tale of realisation and redemption. Jackie Chan see how long it took to even mention him! plays a humble and peaceful  yet eccentric  cook who kindly takes Hou Jie under his care.After a period of time Hou Jie embraces the life of a monk montagestyle shaving his head a la Britney for a clean start  albeit without the insanity  and finds peace for now. Because meanwhile Cao Man has effortlessly and successfully stepped into his shoes and is now just as ruthless and violent a leader.Confusingly enough in a film about a violent and cruel man realising the error of his ways we always know that this propeace film will end in violence and the action in the latter part of the film is worth the wait. There is an axfight that seemed quite realistic and dangerous a chariot chase of sorts and the wire work was used sparingly enough to be forgiven for the most part. Andy Lau proves himself an adept and reasonably athletic martial artist and there is no shortage of random monks ready to throw down in self defense of course.It takes a long while but even Jackie Chan gets to try his aching muscles out near the end of the film even though in truth his entire role and fighting scenes are thematically at odds with the rest of the film and stand out like a sore thumb. It is like Jackie has now entered the Brian Dennehy  Morgan Freeman phase of his career as the elder statesman only every director  and perhaps even Jackie himself  can't help but remember that he was once the preeminent cinematic martial artist on the planet so they clumsily try to work him in.Shaolin is a film bookended by violence the redemptive tale in the middle is supposed to provide the moral of the story I guess but that could easily be forgotten by the 30 minute finale that ends in many dead when even the monks say 'enough'.Final Rating  6  10. Muddled morals aside Shaolin is well acted reasonably well paced aside from one interminably long 'will she  won't she?' scene that I can't spoil here and contains a few of the better martial arts sequences filmed in the last few years.".

	schema:reviewBody "A competent and action pack Shaolin movie It is of a moment of distinction to proclaim that Benny Chan's latest blockbuster not only revisited the glory days of Jet Li's first ever movie but also reunited two of the biggest Hong Kong actors ever. Mr. Andy Lau and Mr. Jackie Chan appears on screen together for the first time since 1994's Drunken Master 2. The moment they appear together the screen goes on fire. It is a special little segment that excites HK cinema fans including myself. However Shaolin fails to exceed the audience expectation and the result is a competent and efficient movie that contains wonderful action sequences but nothing more.The real problem of director Benny Chan is not direction but rather the criminal under usage of Fan Bing Bing and Nicholas Tse respectively. Tse for one should be critical of his own performance. His villainous turn is neither convincing or menacing. In fact he should take a leaf out of Mainland's actor Liu Ye  book of acting. His evil laugh is more cheesy than imagined and his overacting is far too laughable than villainous. A poor effort from someone who have improved immensely in films like Beast Stalker and Pigeon Stool. As for Fan Bing Bing she performs wondrously in her extremely limited screen time. Her teary eye caught my attention but with just two significant scenes she is officially wasted.All in all Benny Chan improves from his previous Aaron Kwok's endeavor  City Under Siege. From cheesy to competent action blockbuster Chan perfectly casted superstar Andy Lau in a role that allows him to go through the motions. At the end of the day this is a highly effective film for what it is. Unfortunately as with most Benny Chan's movies the film entertains but fails to delivers anything special or original to make a good film great. Basically Shaolin is a good film but not greatNeo 2011 I rate it 7.510www.thehkneo.com".

Only Jackie Chan seems somewhat comfortable in his goofish guise as the somewhat aloof supercook. This stylistic overreliance on soapish dramaturgy lacks the same required restraint showed by directors such as Ang Lee Xiaogang Feng or even John Woo thus making the effort at times a cringeworthy lesson in bad filmmaking. The best moments come during fight sequences but even here a severe overuse of slowmotion in order to 'imbue' the tragedy or drama just tingles all the wrong receptors.

I am not at all against healthy morals in a movie but the way this movie tries to stuff you with them is getting irritating. This movie is more religious than the Vatican. The music is also very annoying not because it's Chinese but because it sounds cheesy and often sounds very western. The Chinese government can be proud. This is excellent stuff to feed your masses. It will keep them docile and loyal and hey if we can feed them a healthy portion of distrust to western society... couldn't hurt either. Americans and westerners in general are all after our precious Chinese riches. However Jackie Chan was refreshing as a notmartialartsman and the bad guy isn't bad either. The film definitely has its moments and if the above doesn't scare you off you might very well enjoy it.".

The music is also very annoying not because it's Chinese but because it sounds cheesy and often sounds very western. The Chinese government can be proud. This is excellent stuff to feed your masses. It will keep them docile and loyal and hey if we can feed them a healthy portion of distrust to western society... couldn't hurt either. Americans and westerners in general are all after our precious Chinese riches. However Jackie Chan was refreshing as a notmartialartsman and the bad guy isn't bad either. The film definitely has its moments and if the above doesn't scare you off you might very well enjoy it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first hour of this movie is great and brings out a solid emotional story mixed with kungfu. But the second half it starts to become pretty darn ridiculous with poor development. And loses the emotional value it started out with. The story is basically about a warlord Hao JieAndy Lau that starts off as a man that angry full with ambitions of power and wealth but also lacks compassion. And don't blink an eye even when taking lives. And his right hand man is Cao ManNicholas Tse. Hao Jie chooses his ambition and tries to wipe out his own sworn brother in war. And Cao Man uses it as an opportunity to overthrow Hao Jie. And Hao Jie becomes a wanted man and ends up in a shaolin temple. And Hao Jie starts to learn the ways of the shaolin temple. Hao Jie also meets one of the head monk by the name of Jing Neng played by jacky wu who looks like the Korean actor Chun JungMyung a lot. Andy Lau did a good job of playing the cold character and also a sympathetic one. Nicholas Tse tries to pull off that drunk don't give a crap looking like high all the time type of villain. But he doesn't quite seem to pull it off like how Lee Byunghun is able to pull off. The problem is with this movie is that there just isn't enough development where it's needed. Hao Jie makes a 180 degree change way too drastically and some of the characters you don't get attached to at all. Although they take up some screen time. This is mainly do to a lot of the deleted scenes that is added on to extras for the DVD. In fact I think some deleted scenes should have been added onto the movie. Cause some parts has some character development so it adds to the value of those characters. So when they die it actually leaves a bit of an impact. But that isn't the case for this movie I honestly didn't care who lives or who dies just which side wins as the end. I usually always like Jackie Chan in movies but his over the top kungfu takes away from this movie. Since this is a serious kungfu flick and not a fantasy one. If this carried the flare it had for the first half with the second half it would have been a great film but as it is. It's a pretty mediocre flick.6.610".

What we get is the tale of a very bad man a glacial Andy Lau who undergoes something of a crisis of conscience before being reborn as a pacifist fighter. Yeah the motivations don't make a whole lot of sense but in the end this is an action flick and it's absolutely packed with battles and that's what counts.Director Benny Chan is an old hand at this sort of stuff of course although he's more familiar with contemporary fight flicks INVISIBLE TARGET etc.. Still he acquits himself well with the historical backdrop throwing in elaborate chase scenes some genuinely impressive and explosive setpieces and of course all manner of handtohand combat. The entire film builds up to one massive sprawling setpiece at the climax which mixes largescale combat with fights on an individual basis and it really works. The special effects are exemplary.The story I'm less enamoured with. Lau seems slightly disinterested in the material and I never felt much sympathy for his character's plight. The nonviolence message is a bit preachy and faintly ridiculous when played out over two guys beating the hell out of each other. Nicholas Tse feels a bit uncomfortable in a role that's a far cry from the usual freshfaced hero types he usually plays and Jackie Chan doesn't get much of a look in at all. Nonetheless action fans will be in their element and I just wish I'd been able to catch myself up in the storyline a little better so that I actually cared about the characters involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shaolin is one of those stories that integrates a number of life lessons into an action adventure. This movie is akin to top grade martial arts films such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which has long been one of my personal favorites. The story gives the viewer something of a history lesson into the tyranny in China when warlords had no concern for the people only a desire to increase their territorial hold and gain power.In this story Hou Chieh commands a massive army that wages war to take control of the city TengfengHenan China. This ruthless dispassionate tyrant is portrayed very convincingly by Andy Lau who has quite an impressive film career I recall him from House of Flying Daggers. Second in command to General Hou is Cao Man Nicholas Tse who is very astute in taking in all the Tyranny 101 lessons. This film had some off the chain equestrian stunts with horses traversing stairs doing front and side flips whereas I could not help but to cringe at some of the scenes. I can only hope that no animals were harmed during the filming so PETA is not up in arms perhaps the visuals were the result of some very creative computer generated imagery but things looked very real. This is a religious based film where the territorial war spills into the Buddhist monks Shaolin temple we see that the monks are the only entity that cares for the people and the temple is the only sanctuary that the people have against the warring armies. There is a bit of a Robin Hood mini story taking place in the background of everything else that is going on with some of the monks at its core. I found it interesting that the Shaolin temple was identified as the birthplace of martial arts having seen quite a few of these tales I do not recall credit being given for where it all began. There were several recognizable faces in this tale including the Shaolin cook WudaoJackie Chan this seemed like a small role compared to some of the other big movies he has performed in but he did show he still has it where martial arts are concerned. This was a very entertaining story with plenty of martial arts and other action so much so that the two hour running time is barely noticeable. I give this film a big Buddha green light.".

A man who had everything a career a wife and daughter and a knowing ability to conquer anything in his path. Yet to quell his desires for fame and fortune his subordinate Cao Man Ncholas Tse had set him up during a dinner party with the General's own superior. During this supposed get together a militia team storms in and creates pure chaos in Cao Man's name. General Hou Jie Andy Lau escapes his death along with his wife and daughter who were then split up to escape on their own. During the frightful night the General manages to rescue his daughter and to take refuge among the very monks he was trying to evict from the province. With his daughters death his wife blames him for every bit of turmoil they had succumbed to and leaves him which causes his path to open and learn the words humility and self sacrifice. During this time of self discovery Hou Jie learns the art of Shaolin martial arts as well as becoming a kind of helper to those who really need it. His kind of mentor would be the cook Jackie Chan who gives in his own way the ability to see how a noodle bends or cooks in boiling water. Not much of a teaching tool but to Hou Jie it was more than enough to calm his nerves and his soul. I found this to be a really uplifting film to see a General find his calling and to create a chain reaction to those who felt war was the only answer. Cao Man learnt this as his ex superior gave his life to save Cao Man's during a raid of one of the last monasteries in china's existence. A riveting action film packed with emotions guns the turning of the period to the twentieth century and the music was top notch. Highly recommended for those who wish to see how China's survival depended on their most needed and most cherished institution  'The Shaolin Monks.'".

	schema:reviewBody "This is what they used to do every year in Paris to celebrate their National Day Bastille Day the 14th of July. In thousands of streets all over the city lights would be strung up bunting would appear French flags however small would protrude from windows. And for the nights of the 13th 14th and 15th they would dance to small bands in the streets all night long sometimes drinking continuously and not sleeping at all for the whole of that time. One reads about it in the books and memoirs of the period. Not that I ever saw it myself of course nor is there I suppose anyone alive today who can say he or she really did it. It was one of the many aspects of Paris life which died with the Nazi invasion in 1940 and never came back. But here it is in all its glory a whole film of it directed by the inimitable Ren Clair. There are several laugh out loud moments in this film and many tragic ones as well. Clair portrays a tapestry of life as it was lived in the streets at that time with the naughty urchins laughing and running about with no traffic to deter them the flower girls the arguing taxi drivers the snobs the poefaced matrons the wicked concierges the cleaners the caf owners the bar girls and the Apaches who are stealing wallets and getting up to no good. People laugh people cry hearts are broken and then mended again. The beautiful Annabelle plays the character Anna with great charm. She starred in so many notable films not least the great classic HOTEL DU NORD 1938 see my review. As is usually the case Clair overdoes the music on the sound track like someone putting far too much icing on a cake which is already sweet enough. But then who can complain of such a small fault when this is a film so delightful amusing and full of life and charm? And by watching it we can see the lost pleasures and pain of the celebrating Paris crowds of yesteryear dancing the nights away in their annual Gallic carnival atmosphere of gaiety and innocent abandon an era of simple pleasures which shall never come again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Citizen Kane is majestic elegant and noble.  It begins at the end we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories.  The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized.  At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straightforward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains.  Kane dared to present Man as he is rife with confusions internal contradictions and uncertainty.As the film progressed we see Kane loosely based on William Randolph Hearst the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has his marriage his friends and his integrity.  Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures alone and despairing one senses that he welcomes death.  The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently  destructive of human values.  Kane himself states If I hadn't been born rich I  might have been a really great man.What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity.  We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed.  At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world he longs for the affection of the common people.  This is symbolized by his exploitative and patronizing love for a chorus girl Susan Alexander Dorothy Comingore.  Her character is given a paperthin characterization the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane both identifying with and condemning the man.  This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar.  Wells a child prodigy had a background in Shakespearian theater offering modernized adaptations of the Classics a bold and unusual gesture at the time.  He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions he broke all the rules.  The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations.  A mastery of sound gained from years of working in the radio was another.  Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation unmatched in any other Hollywood film.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook it is studded by moments of joy beauty and emotional truth.  The supporting cast of characters most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb.  Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does.  And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made.  Hearst offended by his portrayal offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film.  When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target.  Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of selfexpression.It's influence was immediate incalculable and mostly unacknowledged the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane.  It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music.  Still the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams obsessions and fears.  Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century".

This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar.  Wells a child prodigy had a background in Shakespearian theater offering modernized adaptations of the Classics a bold and unusual gesture at the time.  He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions he broke all the rules.  The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations.  A mastery of sound gained from years of working in the radio was another.  Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation unmatched in any other Hollywood film.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook it is studded by moments of joy beauty and emotional truth.  The supporting cast of characters most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb.  Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does.  And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made.  Hearst offended by his portrayal offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film.  When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target.  Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of selfexpression.It's influence was immediate incalculable and mostly unacknowledged the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane.  It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music.  Still the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams obsessions and fears.  Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century";

He had full artistic freedom and above all power to direct  produce write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film  which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.2One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character  Charles Foster KaneOrson Welles featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life  problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona's areKANE newspaper tycoon  worked for New York Inquirer  known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor bought his wife the Municipal Opera House Financier Thatcher and threat Getty's. Hurst yellow journalist  worked for New York Journal political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor married acress Marion Davies bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures financier JP Morgan  and threat Tammany Hall.differences Susan Alexander Kane Dorothy Comingdore leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.3 The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was  was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn't comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles's characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950's. His most prominent artistic inventions were the low angled camera movements extreme facial closeups long uninterrupted shots chiaroscuro lighting overlapping dialogue  giving a realistic effect to conversations subjective camera angles deep focus shots and depth of field flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time Alfred Hitchcock  and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles's unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.There are many areas of the film which are crucial  these are some of the most important  and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece .".

	schema:reviewBody "OK look let me settle something between those who love and hate this film. A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.On the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today's standards and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes the story on the surface is outdated. However this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a MatrixStar Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example their literary works are universally loved. Yet many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today's world.My advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best I don't agree with AFI's number one ranking but I think it still ranks high. Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again you do not have to love Citizen Kane but at least respect it for what it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have an observation concerning Rosebud and I don't mean that story about Marion Davies. Everyone seems to assume that Kane saying Rosebud means he was thinking of the one time in his life when he was totally happy and had what he wanted. For years I have also assumed that. The other day something occurred to me and I am curious to know if it has occurred to anyone else.When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to or coming from? I don't recall which a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the love nest with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex  perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance loses his wife and loses his son  all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!So maybe when Kane says Rosebud he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why Rosebud is the last word he speaks.But if this is true and it seems quite logical to me then why does no one else comment upon it? Why has no one spotted it? Or has someone I just don't know it? Or could it be that this is the kind of truth that no one wants to face? That all of our lives are determined more by blind idiot accident than by design or purpose.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic Citizen Kane there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays homages and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.Released in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production Citizen Kane is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon Welles inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of Rosebudthe mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane's death we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.From a technical standpoint Welles' film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery every dissolve every long tracking shot every seamless edit every play with chronology every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art and it is for these technical aspects that Citizen Kane will always stand the test of time.However the story of Citizen Kane remains cold and distant. I didn't instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like Casablanca or The Third Man or even more recently There Will Be Blood. Often the supporting players overact and the flashbacks are tedious especially the one detailing Kane's second marriage or emotionless like the scene showing Kane's snow covered childhood. There's a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would've come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.Is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today's cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance and way back in 1941 Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His Citizen Kane is technically rich layered and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No but it was fascinating to watch. It's some very nice ballyhoo indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE 1941was perhaps the first American film since the silent era to fully demonstrate the possibilities of the film medium and the role of the camera. Welles' camera is mobile no longer the static device used to merely show faces and Toland's deepfocus cinematography revolutionary. Welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions to craft a work that is now often termed a 'textbook' of the cinema.Welles himself plays Kane in a remarkable acting performance that requires him to age progressively which Welles does very convincingly over the decades. Welles draws significant parallels between Kane and media mogul William Hearst in a statement that probes wealth power figures and what we perceive as 'truth'.Kane is presented to the audience as an enigma we never do get a fullbodied portrait of the man only snippets of highly subjective memories from those who say they knew him. In the newsreel a montage of images that details Kane's life and eventual decline a variety of viewpoints are established. He could be both a Fascist and a Communist a megalomaniac manipulating power to his advantage or indeed being manipulated himself. It is ironic that the true meaning of 'Rosebud' is never discovered by the onscreen reporters just as the true essence of the man Kane is never fully revealed to the audience. What is Kane searching for? Is it the untouched youth and innocence symbolized in 'Rosebud' or something he himself is not aware of? Kane is never truly sympathetic yet he is wholly fascinating. He seems to lament the status and power that wealth has given him If I hadn't been very rich than I may have been a very great man then buys another load of cold statues and ornaments. His cruel treatment of second wife Susan Alexander in his insistence that she train as an opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence and unwillingness to accept defeat. Kane is willing to stand alone I am Charles Foster Kane! yet seems to crave a filler to his loneliness I know too many people. I guess we're both lonely. Kane is ultimately indefinable a jigsaw puzzle that both Susan and the audience struggle to piece together into anything whole or real.Welles used actors from his Mercury Theatre to populate this story of greed corruption and vanity. Friend and close confidant Joseph Cotten becomes friend and observer Jebediah who is a witness to Kane's slide into moral decay. Dorothy Cormingmore portrays Susan Alexander a thinly veiled take on Hearst's reallife mistress Marion Davies. She possesses a similar honking Bronx whine and limited talent in her master's chosen area of success For Davies this was dramatic roles in films her talent lay in comedy. Distinguished actors Moorehead Sanford and Sloane also feature in support.One aspect that is perhaps ignored in favor of focusing on the technical innovations is the truly amazing screenplay one which offers just as many quotable snippets of dialogue as a 'CASABLANCA' or 'ALL ABOUT EVE'. Welles' understanding of the soundtrack is often overlooked. A memorable scene involves a bored Susan Alexander whining to Kane that she never gets any fun because they live in a castle. The visual portrait is fascinating with Alexander perched on a seat as a princess complete with tiara in her hair. The echo of her words and Kane's mechanical replies in the huge yet empty room speaks volumes for Welles' understanding of the film as a sum of all parts. Here the sum adds up to perfect direction acting writing photography and music.The imposing haunting Xanadu is similar to Hitchcock's Manderlay in REBECCA filmed the previous year in that the mansion operates as a both a character and a symbol of the protagonist. Kane's halffinished palace seems to come the closest to suggesting his character grandiose larger than life powerful...yet strangely empty and unfulfilled.".

What is Kane searching for? Is it the untouched youth and innocence symbolized in 'Rosebud' or something he himself is not aware of? Kane is never truly sympathetic yet he is wholly fascinating. He seems to lament the status and power that wealth has given him If I hadn't been very rich than I may have been a very great man then buys another load of cold statues and ornaments. His cruel treatment of second wife Susan Alexander in his insistence that she train as an opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence and unwillingness to accept defeat. Kane is willing to stand alone I am Charles Foster Kane! yet seems to crave a filler to his loneliness I know too many people. I guess we're both lonely. Kane is ultimately indefinable a jigsaw puzzle that both Susan and the audience struggle to piece together into anything whole or real.Welles used actors from his Mercury Theatre to populate this story of greed corruption and vanity. Friend and close confidant Joseph Cotten becomes friend and observer Jebediah who is a witness to Kane's slide into moral decay. Dorothy Cormingmore portrays Susan Alexander a thinly veiled take on Hearst's reallife mistress Marion Davies. She possesses a similar honking Bronx whine and limited talent in her master's chosen area of success For Davies this was dramatic roles in films her talent lay in comedy. Distinguished actors Moorehead Sanford and Sloane also feature in support.One aspect that is perhaps ignored in favor of focusing on the technical innovations is the truly amazing screenplay one which offers just as many quotable snippets of dialogue as a 'CASABLANCA' or 'ALL ABOUT EVE'. Welles' understanding of the soundtrack is often overlooked. A memorable scene involves a bored Susan Alexander whining to Kane that she never gets any fun because they live in a castle. The visual portrait is fascinating with Alexander perched on a seat as a princess complete with tiara in her hair. The echo of her words and Kane's mechanical replies in the huge yet empty room speaks volumes for Welles' understanding of the film as a sum of all parts. Here the sum adds up to perfect direction acting writing photography and music.The imposing haunting Xanadu is similar to Hitchcock's Manderlay in REBECCA filmed the previous year in that the mansion operates as a both a character and a symbol of the protagonist. Kane's halffinished palace seems to come the closest to suggesting his character grandiose larger than life powerful...yet strangely empty and unfulfilled.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles so I finally decided to get the film and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say it's great. The plot is great and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes about 15 to be more accurate and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane apart from his own. The story is told after his death and we see everything important that leads up to it and only in the very end do we understand him only then do we fully understand who he was and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent Welles himself is stellar as Kane and his impressive appearance along with his commanding voice makes the character a forceful sight nay experience. The characters are wellwritten and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most wellrounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles pans zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now for the one thing I can criticize in the film the pacing. It's only two hours long but it feels like much much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless as well I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However this criticism is so minor due to the ending more than making up for it that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top 250 films of all time here on IMDb. As I'm writing this it's 11. That's pretty much what it deserves in my opinion. Not higher not lower. Not the greatest film of all timethat pretty much still belongs to The Godfather I think... at least I haven't seen a better film than that yet but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general and anyone who thinks they can understand it it has a truly profound point that any manand woman should know ofpreferably through seeing the film for themselves. Don't let the fact that it's old and black  white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was a film that I had a lovehate relationship with Citizen Kane is surely it. Some of the nonscript elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet the story of Charles Foster Kane Orson Welles an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.The film's BW cinematography is arguably the best in film history. DP Gregg Toland uses highcontrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. And in some scenes bright backlighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. This is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. Throughout the film frame compositions are clever and interesting like one scene in the second half wherein a woman with her back to the camera blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see amid murky shadowy lighting it's like something from a nightmare.And the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions as a result of Welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. In one scene for example background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. But when a character walks back to the windows we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared and that renders the character small by comparison. The same optical effects show up in the Great Hall of Xanadu with a fireplace that appears average in size until a character walks back to it at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.Sound effects amplify these optical effects. For example in the Great Hall the cavernous mostly empty room strongly echoes human sounds creating the impression of some huge dark cave. The whole feel is one of oppression and death. Just terrific.But the film's story about a corpulent newspaper tycoon is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. Kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. But over time he changes. And throughout he is egotistical overbearing bombastic loud and generally too full of himself. His only real belief is in himself. He is fond of possessions but is emotionally empty. In addition to an unlikeable protagonist the script's dialogue is very talky.The film's acting is generally quite good. I particularly liked the performances of Joseph Cotten Dorothy Comingore and Agnes Moorehead. Special effects are good too and when combined with lots of stock footage create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.Some viewers love this film others loathe it. I love the cinematography and sound effects but loathe the story. Citizen Kane should have won several Oscars including especially cinematography. That it did not has caused Hollywood endless guilt and to compensate they routinely vote the film as the number one greatest film in history.But it does not deserve that lofty title. Hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem but well deserved Oscars especially for BW cinematography. Then they need to let go of the guilt.".

	schema:headline " Why Is Citizen Kane the Best Film of All Times?";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who sees Citizen Kane 1941 for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV watching it for what it is so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately the latter is usually although quite understandably the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment it was okay. This will not do. It is a great tragedy if Citizen Kane suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's Hamlet or Beethoven's 9th Symphony. In order to make this happen or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience I would like to try and explain not why Citizen Kane necessarily is the best film but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them but hey what can I lose and who doesn't love talking about Welles and Citizen Kane?One might begin with the basic fact that Citizen Kane wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics Citizen Kane was soon forgotten and the film wasn't for example screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France however the film was just discovered after the war and the leading critic of the country Andr Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. Franois Truffaut proclaimed that everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'. Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't Citizen Kane forgotten and why for one did it arouse the interest of Bazin?First it ought to be highlighted that the story of Citizen Kane is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst Citizen Kane tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed I am using the past tense and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in Citizen Kane. The film begins with the protagonist's death and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words  Rosebud  by interviewing people who knew the man. It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' Oedipus Rex as well as numerous detective stories the uniqueness of Citizen Kane lies in the use of different perspectives creating a nonlinear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels. Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of Citizen Kane and its innovative use of various cinematic means it is simply a fact that the film made the style public thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the socalled spatial realism which Bazin adored supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera include deepfocus cinematography sequence shots and deepspace composition. These had been used before but hardly with similar dare I say philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy lowangle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. Citizen Kane is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of miseenscne since it puts a lot of emphasis on prefilmic elements such as setting and lighting but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and postfilmic elements.More remains to be said but space is running out. The end of the matter is I guess that none of the individual elements of Citizen Kane are precisely individual. They have not been distinguished from one another but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story theme and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power loneliness and defeat which are reflected on the level of style using setting and editing for one to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness Citizen Kane remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry music and painting. It is like all great art a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why instead of one big nameable innovation the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions.".

There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them but hey what can I lose and who doesn't love talking about Welles and Citizen Kane?One might begin with the basic fact that Citizen Kane wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics Citizen Kane was soon forgotten and the film wasn't for example screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France however the film was just discovered after the war and the leading critic of the country Andr Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. Franois Truffaut proclaimed that everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'. Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't Citizen Kane forgotten and why for one did it arouse the interest of Bazin?First it ought to be highlighted that the story of Citizen Kane is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst Citizen Kane tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed I am using the past tense and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in Citizen Kane. The film begins with the protagonist's death and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words  Rosebud  by interviewing people who knew the man. It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' Oedipus Rex as well as numerous detective stories the uniqueness of Citizen Kane lies in the use of different perspectives creating a nonlinear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels. Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of Citizen Kane and its innovative use of various cinematic means it is simply a fact that the film made the style public thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the socalled spatial realism which Bazin adored supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera include deepfocus cinematography sequence shots and deepspace composition. These had been used before but hardly with similar dare I say philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy lowangle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. Citizen Kane is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of miseenscne since it puts a lot of emphasis on prefilmic elements such as setting and lighting but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and postfilmic elements.More remains to be said but space is running out. The end of the matter is I guess that none of the individual elements of Citizen Kane are precisely individual. They have not been distinguished from one another but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story theme and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power loneliness and defeat which are reflected on the level of style using setting and editing for one to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness Citizen Kane remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry music and painting. It is like all great art a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why instead of one big nameable innovation the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions.";

For me watching movies is a way of entertainment and enjoyment I want to have fun I want to laugh I want to cry I want to think I want to be engaged I want to guess what is going to happen I want characters that I can relate to and be attached to.

Yes the character of Kane was complex and it was a good character study. Yes the symbolic nature of Rosebud and what it represents was brilliantly done especially when we see that Kane's romantic life with his women was screwed up. But all those things are meaningless to me when I don't enjoy the movie and I am ready to die from boredom. I literally forced myself to not fall asleep all the time I was thinking There must be something wrong with me this is the greatest film of all time. Get your sht together wake up and pay attention.

What matters is that I consider myself to be fairly intelligent and I didn't see the appeal of this movie unless you are watching this for critical purposes.Now why this movie is in the top 250 and is considered a classic? That's probably because of the technical aspects of the movie and in this sense it might be a masterpiece but I just can't see people enjoying this so much to have it so highly rated because of the entertainment factor.".

After two viewings I can't say that I find it to be the greatest film of all time but any work with such a label would find it extremely difficult to live up to impossible expectations. Having said that however 'Citizen Kane' is nothing short of masterful. In 1939 in an unprecedented studio contract RKO offered young prodigy Welles fresh from his success on the stage and the radio a twopicture contract with full artistic control a promise that ultimately wasn't kept. Borrowing elements from the lives of tycoons Robert McCormick Howard Hughes and Joseph Pulitzer but especially American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst Welles and fellow screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz weaved together the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane poignantly highlighting the inescapable shortfalls of American Dream.Charlie Kane Welles rises from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher George Coulouris his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twentysix when he decides to head the 'Inquirer' for the simple reason that he thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper. Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing yellow journalism which though frowned upon by most critics proves immensely profitable. Decades later after two unsuccessful marriages and a failed bid for public office Kane sits alone in his massive unfinished Xanadu mansion the most massive impersonal and even sinister abode ever to grace the silver screen pining for the lost innocence of his childhood. This is the story of a tragic life and the ultimate testament that money can't buy happiness.The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large NO TREPASSING sign on the gate of Kane's vast and lonely dwelling we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house witnessing the enormity of Kane's wealth and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow before the light inexplicably goes out the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snowglobe and his lips utter the mystifying words Rosebud. With a sudden crash the snowglobe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. Following his death the producer of a newsreel about Kane asks a reporter Jerry Thompson William Alland to uncover the significance behind Kane's final words a wellmeaning but rather naive attempt to encapsulate a man's entire life in a simple sevenletter name.A criticism often levelled at 'Citizen Kane' is that it feels less like a warm involving biopic than a formal masterclass in filmmaking technique. It's true that Welles was exploring largely unmapped cinematic territory at the time and there's a certain sense of experimentation about the film. Mankiewicz and Welles constructed the screenplay as a series of fragmented nonchronological flashbacks each sequence filling in the missing parts of Kane's life sometimes even showing the same event from differing perspectives. Greg Toland's elaborate cinematography makes unprecedented use of deep focus in which everything in the frame  foreground background and anything in between  is constantly held in sharp focus the end result is a film that feels far more dynamic and animate than anything preceding the French New Wave. All innovation aside anybody who suggests that the life of Charles Foster Kane is somehow uninvolving really needs to revisit the film Welles pours his heart and soul into portraying the arrogant tormented and ultimately lonely millionaire and it's uncanny how the director's own tragic career drew clear parallels with that of his most memorable character.".

	schema:headline " Childhood Ultimately makes the Determination";
	schema:reviewBody "More movie review lists have awarded Citizen Kane the honor of being the best film ever made than any other film whatsoever..Deservedly so!! Why?... The superb character portrayals... Charles Foster Kane based on William Randolph Hearst was a character which sparked a lot of controversy in the movie industry back in 1941!! This film did not even win best picture that year that award was given to How Green was My Valley. Reluctance to allow a film like Citizen Kane to be released evoked a formidable indication that people had a perception of the silver screen as the purveyor of the stilted panacea which provided glossy entertainment for the movie audience!! The ugly depiction of abhorrent human nature that Citizen Kane so succinctly illustrated left a scar on the manufactured illusions of movies during this era!! So many film's entertainment agenda during the '30's and '40's were fortified by high budget fantasy!! These illusions orchestrated a premise of escapism that the moviegoers grew accustomed to!! Wizard of Oz is a stellar example...Nevertheless Citizen Kane hit the big screen and from there received unprecedented critical acclaim!!What was the attraction?.... Charles Foster Kane was a neglected and irascible man who concocted a myriad of avoidable vulnerabilities in his life. His childhood became a pitfall of doom and despair which left an indelible mark on him!! His empathy for the working class people inevitably translated to his perception of them as chattel and that he must be the ameliorated recipient of their gratitude!! His fame and fortune was predicated on the idea that the banal proletariat be relegated to the pathetic plight of a marketable commodity!! So many concepts were avantgard in this movie this is why they were widely unacceptable!! Concepts such as The life of a corporate mogul being the culprit to making Charles Foster Kane fall prey to vanity and social entitlement!! He became a victim of megalomania this was his ultimate downfall!! The dark human emotions and vindictiveness of politicians seeking election andor reelection manifested themselves through very authentic reactions from the characters in this film!! The perennial egocentric demeanor which afflicted Charles Foster Kane throughout the entire movie signified a pejorative compassion which was totally self centered!!!The character portrayal of Charles Foster Kane by Orson Wells was outstanding..Genuine feelings that were related to selfishness and avarice in this movie simply astounded me!! People have to consider the year this movie was made 1941 to fully appreciate the ideas which were thrown out at the movie audience!! No matter how reprehensible Charles Foster Kane was he was also NEWS!!! This will always be the way of the world!! This newspaper king wound up being utterly thwarted by a form of convoluted justice!!! Leaving a largess of artwork behind merely pointed out to everyone that his priorities purported a horrid arrogance!! The onus was on the movie audience to get acquainted with the despicable aspects of negative emotional qualities that Charles Foster Kane masqueraded around like coveted trophies!! Ultimately his childhood put a lethal spin on his adverse reactions to everything and played a significant role in this movie!! I strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in movies that they see this film!! Godfather Shawshank Redemption Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring and Gold Rush have all been selected as the greatest movie ever made by one critic's list or another but not nearly as often as Citizen Kane though!!! Citizen Kane is an absolutely remarkable movie!!".

You fall asleep.Surprised you think 'It must be me maybe I'm tired' so a month later you try again. But you don't even get as far as before and wake up drooling out the corner of your mouth as a bloated Orson Welles with really bad age makeup groans 'Rosebud Rosebud'. It doesn't make sense. You're perplexed. You've watched other films on the lists... Casablanca made you stand up and cheer cry laugh feel connected to all humanity. You even adore films on the list that some might consider oblique like 8 12 which you reckon reinvented cinema language weaving in and out of memory dreams psyche reality putting the human spirit up on the screen making you cheer laugh and feel connected to all humanity. So why does CK leave you so cold? You wonder 'What's wrong with me? Am I stupid or something?'Your borrowed DVD copy gathers dust notice how the lender never asks for it back? taunting your unquiet mind You must watch me I'm the greatest film of all time! But you shudder at the thought. Life's too short and after all there's more engaging things to do  like scraping plaque off the dog's teeth.Years pass. Finally you can take it no longer. You think 'To be a serious film lover I MUST watch Citizen Kane! Maybe I was too immature before  yes that must be it!' So you gird your loins and sit  awake!  through the whole thing. The whole turgid ponderous dull vacuous plodding dank catastrophe. It's even worse than you feared. An emotionally and intellectually empty story. Your average six year old can invent a more complex engaging tale.Genuinely puzzled you ask people who name it as one of the greatest films of all time why they like it and with barely concealed superiority that phoneys are wont to adopt they wax lyrical talk about the haunting mystery of the final words Rosebud rosebud. You notice there's no feeling behind what they say. They also talk a great deal about Gregg Toland's cinematography with liberal references to deep focus and you appreciate this you really do the cinematography was damned fine best thing about the movie. That shot which started outside the window then tracked back into the room was really cool. But you just don't believe a movie is made great by cinematography alone. In all your inquiries you never once hear the following phrase spoken from the heart God I love that film.So here you find yourself reading IMDb comments.Well let me tell you this There's Nothing Wrong With You! You Are Right! It's Overrated Flashy Unintelligent Rubbish!One day perhaps one can but dream the coolest greatest most admired film being in the world will point out the bleeding obvious nakedness of this bloated Emperor and the assorted film critics film studies teachers and others who need to be told what to think by an authority figure shall squirm and CK shall drop off the lists once and for all.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane who was the editor of the New York Journal.  He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball which falls to the ground a shatters.  News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane's life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune.  Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died.  The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying rosebud' as his last word.  Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane's mansion called Xanadu.  It has a sign that says no trespassing' that is hung from the outside gate.  The shot is very dark and gloomy hinting that maybe Kane's life was the same way.  He was a very powerhungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom.  Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie.  The camera work lighting acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time.  Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie.  He was the leading character producer and director basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate.  I thought that this movie was well done.  It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique although if you didn't know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow but most of the symbolism is easily recognized.  One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane's life and career are out of control.  Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well.  The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable.  This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate symbolism great actors interesting storyline excellent camera shots lighting and sound techniques.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time.".

It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique although if you didn't know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow but most of the symbolism is easily recognized.  One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane's life and career are out of control.  Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well.  The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable.  This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate symbolism great actors interesting storyline excellent camera shots lighting and sound techniques.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of Paprika Steen since the very first time that I saw her play a role in a movie. Since then I've seen several others of 'her' movies and I must say that she's always unbelievably good. Her performances often mean the difference between a good movie and an excellent one and that is something that made me look forward to her debut as a director. I hoped that she would be at least as good as a director that she would be able to do her magic trick once again but this time from behind the camera...In this movie we see how a couple is trying to deal with the loss of their teenage daughter who died in a tragic car accident. Their whole life seems to have stopped and everything they do or everything that is said to them reminds them of her leading to an emotional outburst. And both parents have their own way of dealing with the pain. While the mother tries to pick up her old life again by returning to her job as a social worker who has to take care of abused children her husband seems to lose all grip on reality. He's only focused on one thing and that is to find the person who killed his daughter. It doesn't matter to him that he loses his job as an architect or that his relationship with his wife deteriorates fast. All he wants is revenge...As I already said earlier in this review I was really looking forward to this movie and I sure had some very high expectations about it. And almost all have been fulfilled. Once again this is a very interesting Scandinavian drama and Steen proves that not every good movie that comes from the North needs to be a Dogme film. She has managed to make a good drama with apparently different smaller story lines that all connect to each other in one way or another. If the director isn't careful this means that the entire movie will feel quite messy but Steen sure knows how to avoid that trap. This is a solid movie and by far one of the best debuts that I've ever seen from a director.Once again the acting is very good. Not that I expected otherwise. I'm used to watch Scandinavian movies and I'm always a bit surprised to see how many good actors they actually have over there. Sofie Grbl I had seen before in Mifune's Last Song and Lena Endre I still remember from Trolsa. The others were more or less a surprise but I liked them just as much.In the end I'm convinced that this is the type of movie that might appeal to a larger audience but even those who are already quite familiar with the Scandinavian movies and more in particular the Dogmefilms may well enjoy it. I know I certainly did and that's why I give it a rating in between 7.510 and 810.".

As it is it's more laudable for the sum of it's parts than as a finished article. 610";

This unleashes the ghosts of the highwaymen from the first film who seek out the descendant of Liselotte's previous character in an effort to redeem themselves.Whilst the humour is on the surface largely slapstick there is much commentary and satire on the state of German politics as well.The film is fastpaced and suitably lighthearted with some delightful musical numbers. Indeed even the opening credits are sung.The special effects though are distractingly bad and like its predecessor the lack of adventure in terms of scale settings and cinematography really reflect the lack of confidence in German cinema at this time compared with during the Weimar Republic. Clearly the nation was reinventing itself after the horrors of the war and the selfdeprecating humour and satire aimed at politicans and bureaucrats reflect the desperatelyneeded change in attitude towards leaders after the disaster of the Third Reich.However for all of its lack of artistic spirit this film reflects the reinvention of Germany as a modern democracy able to laugh at itself point honestly to its shortcomings and leave well and truly behind its former insularity and nationalistic temperament. Thus it is a reflection of a much more positive and mature people who are just starting to find a new place for themselves as coleaders in a modernising Europe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Spukschlo im Spessart or The Haunted Castle is a West German film from 1960 so this one had its 55th anniversary last year and it is the second film from the Spessart series. Lilo Pulver returns and there are more familiar faces in here for example director Kurt Hoffmann. I watched this one right after having seen the original first film from a couple years earlier and while I already felt the first wasn't memorable at all I must say that this sequel is even weaker clearly inferior on many occasions. It runs for roughly 100 minutes too and focuses mostly on the areas comedy romance and music. There is more music than in the first. And there is also a slight ounce of horror in here. But it's not really intended to be scary and it also isn't scary especially by today's standards. There are many scenes with dancing ghosts and it felt a bit embarrassing to me maybe when the film was at its weakest. In addition I must say the story was very forgettable too. In my opinion one film would have been more than enough already and this second movie adds extremely little. This is especially disappointing as I was curious about the young Heinz Baumann but he is in line with all the other mediocrity we are served here. Watch something else instead and it's embarrassing to see how highly some people rate this film 4 stars is already generous and that the franchise still was not over at this point.".

	schema:headline " A Masterwork of British Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "In Life of Brian Python created what John Cleese called simply our masterpiece. As a piece of writing it is the most impressive of the three feature length Python movies. The scenes remain episodic but there is a much more coherent narrative than in the earlier Holy Grail  I loved HG too but for different reasons. The characters well about one or two of the characters have acquired some subtle shading which is rare in comedy and alas rare in British comedy in particular. The plight of Chapman's Brian is one that I really cared about although his death is also extremely funny upbeat and one of the truly iconic moments in British cinema.The story must be fairly well known. Brian is born at the same time as Jesus with whom he leads a kind of parallel life thus allowing the team to lampoon and satirise everything from religious zealotry and mob hysteria to 1950s biblicalsword  sandals epic cinema. It does this by marrying historic situations with more modern attitudes thus we have revolutionary Stan who wants to be Loretta and have the right to have babies the old man who can't understand why he's being stoned for saying simply that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah! the gruff centurion correcting Brian's Latin grammar while he's trying to daub antiRoman slogans on a wall and the gentle centurion asking each of a line of the condemned crucifixion? Good while ticking them off on his clipboard. Interspersed with this is slapstick pantomime women I'm not sure there are any real women in Python which is probably its greatest failing and a small amount of the trademark Python surrealism the spaceship the prophet talking about the sons misplacing the things owned by their fathers who had placed them down only just a moment ago etc. In short something for everyone  except perhaps committed Christians.A lot of attention has been paid to whether LoB is blasphemous. The Pythons claim not and I'm not sufficiently religious to care very much. On the surface I disagree. There are also occasional sideswipes at ancient Jewish custom  although to be fair only stoning which if you'll pardon the pun might be considered a fair target. Jesus is not criticised but the film's central message seems to be be in the right place at the right time and even a man called Brian can become God. Almost the last line is from Eric Idle saying you come from nothing and go back to nothing which doesn't suggest that the man on the mount at the beginning is a divinity no matter whether he's talking sense or not.Most importantly though LoB is refreshingly satirical. There always was an element of this in Python mediaeval Christian philosophy lampooned in the Holy Grail for example this new learning amazes me Sir Bedevere explain again how sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes so if she weighs the same as a duck she must be made of wood and therefore  a witch. I guess LoB attracted attention because the satire had never been so bold or obvious before. This is also what makes LoB such an incredibly funny film to watch but put it this way  despite what Rowan Atkinson may have once said  I'd be very surprised if the Python's weren't expecting the Spanish Inquisition.That shouldn't put you off though. Unless your faith is too weak to survive Python's gentle humanism watch this movie  you'll probably love it.".

	schema:headline " Still one of the funniest films of all time.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's impossible for me to be objective about this film.  I know every scene and line by heart.  Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did and actually misses the joke which is on them they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon.  No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity which as in so much Python did is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of i.e. surprise.Also nostalgia value.  MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes before I even reached double figures.  I gobbled up every programme film and record in a space of a couple of short years so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful so I go all mistyeyed when I see it.  Bizarrely we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.But noone watches PYTHON anymore except that dorkish clique.  My brother only a couple of years my junior is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then.  But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself accessible to anyone who found the very male elitist academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?How can I implore you to watch this?  It's got a straight narrative with some of the greatest setpieces and dialogue of any film ever.  It's not a great FILM comedy  Terry Jones is no Gilliam  but the style suits the humour perfectly allowing it to breathe and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon and squabbling about petty things like big noses and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland with a massive Roman statue being wheeled and a set of crucifixes being planted a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.This is the film's true triumph  it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion.  By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man Python reclaim history from symbol and myth.  It brings the body back into history.  Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak ironic conclusion listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully and in context it's NOT comforting  the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing  the film is a learned commentary on power totalitarianism repression language gender the writing of history the politics of subversion the complicity of the repressed.

	onyx:emotionText "It's impossible for me to be objective about this film.  I know every scene and line by heart.  Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did and actually misses the joke which is on them they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon.  No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity which as in so much Python did is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of i.e. surprise.Also nostalgia value.  MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes before I even reached double figures.  I gobbled up every programme film and record in a space of a couple of short years so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful so I go all mistyeyed when I see it.  Bizarrely we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.But noone watches PYTHON anymore except that dorkish clique.  My brother only a couple of years my junior is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then.  But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself accessible to anyone who found the very male elitist academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?How can I implore you to watch this?  It's got a straight narrative with some of the greatest setpieces and dialogue of any film ever.  It's not a great FILM comedy  Terry Jones is no Gilliam  but the style suits the humour perfectly allowing it to breathe and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon and squabbling about petty things like big noses and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland with a massive Roman statue being wheeled and a set of crucifixes being planted a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.This is the film's true triumph  it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion.  By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man Python reclaim history from symbol and myth.  It brings the body back into history.  Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak ironic conclusion listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully and in context it's NOT comforting  the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing  the film is a learned commentary on power totalitarianism repression language gender the writing of history the politics of subversion the complicity of the repressed.  Myth is thrown to the wind  the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum sic?.

Even when a scene doesn't get the laughs it could've or should've it turns out to be a scene brimming with a cleverness that could only exist in the Pythonesque universe.  2 the director Jones and designeranimator Gilliam lay the groundwork for this realistic atmosphere of 33 A.D. and bring out what is the best in the acting Pythons or otherwise famous British comedian Spike Milligan has a role of note.  Held over from the sets of Franco Zeferelli's Christ film the Pythons use all these locations and settings and little details to spring out their wild brilliant gags.

	schema:reviewBody "When a film is still funny 25 years after it's made and doesn't feel particularly aged even a quarter of a century later then you know that you've struck gold. The famous Monty Python crew once again take a wellknown subject and make a lot of fun of it. This time the subject is religion or more specifically Christianity. Everyone who knows at least a little about Christianity which is pretty much anyone from the western world will probably be able to laugh at something in this movie. Unless of course you are very Christian yourself in that case you will probably feel that the film is blasphemousI don't personally think so since it makes fun of the followers and the general stupidity of people and organizations back in 30something A.D. rather than Jesus and his teachings. The plot is about as incoherent as the usual Monty Python team film though it should be noted that like Monty Python and the Holy Grail it is an actual film and not a series of sketches like for example the Meaning of Life. It's about as paced as they usually are most of the scenes contain a lot of jokes and then they move on to the next scene after about five minutes of jokes and sight gags. This is unfortunately the problem with their films if you don't like the jokes the film might seem extremely slow to you of course one could argue that Monty Python mainly make movies for the jokes sake but they could do better on the pacing for the sake of viewers who don't like all those repeated jokes. That's not to say that I don't like them I laugh at them most of the time heck I laughed so hard that I almost got stomach ache from it at one particular instant. But I guess that a lot of people won't like them for this way of making movies. Oh well. You can't please everyone. The humor is great it's standard Python wacky crazy humor so every Python fan should enjoy it. People who don't like Monty Python should give this a chance too if they have at least a little humor and they aren't Christian extremists. Christian believers can probably laugh at it too like I said it's not the religion itself it's more the brainwashed followers that the film makes fun of. All in all a great film for fans of the Python crew and people who have a sense of humor about religiona dark sense of humor that is. I recommend it to fans of Monty Python people who enjoy dark humor and people who can laugh a little at the less intelligent parts of Christianity. I fall into all three categories and I loved it. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been reading the reviews and I'm just happy to see that there still are some people out there who appreciate real comedy. For anyone who is willing to actually watch the movie and not expect a zoolanderish barrage of fleetingly funny moments this is definitely one of the funniest movies in the history of film. One may watch this movie a hundred times and still find parts of it he never noticed before. The scene with Michael Palin chained up to the wall in the dungeon is possibly the most perfect absurd comedy sketch in existence. Oh what I wouldn't GIVE to be SPAT at in the face! Even better than the Dead Parrot! And the movie has a wonderful unity as well as a massive semiserious satire of not just religion but humanity in general. Two of them went to Oxford three to Cambridgethese guys are well educated and their work is absolutely brilliant simply funny on the surface and hilariously complex beneath. This movie IS better than Holy Grail and is the python's finest work.".

Then a group decides Brian is the Messiah and he cannot convince them he is not . Brian joins the Peoples' Front of Judea one of several dozen separatist groups who actually do nothing .Irreverent and often sidesplitting satire of Jesus Christ movies that will probably offend some catholics  including many Political and Social comments . Graham Chapman plays the title role born in a manger just down the street from Jesus Christ's and spends his life being mistaken for a messiah . This is the tale of of a man whose life parallels Jesus  it results to be the most sustained and funniest film from Britain's bad boys . Six cast members played 40 various characters such as Graham Chapman  John Cleese  Terry Gilliam  Eric Idle  Terry Jones and Michael Palin . Well produced by George Harrison a huge fan of Monty Python he felt so strongly about the movie he pawned his home in London and his office building to raise the 4 million  . According to the diaries of Michael Palin a possible title was Brian of Nazareth which was strongly favored by Palin Graham Chapman and Eric Idle . In the end this was never used perhaps to avoid title comparisons with Jesus of Nazareth 1977 whose leftover sets were used for filming parts of this film . However when the film was released in Italy in the early 1990s it was titled Brian di Nazareth . Originally financed by EMI but they backed out when they believed the script to be blasphemous . EMI was sued by the Pythons and settled out of court. Finance was then arranged through George Harrison who thought it was the last chance to have another Python film creating Handmade Films for this purpose . Though the movie has been directed by Terry Jones only to avoid the frictions and conflicts there were in Monty Python and the Holy Grail 1975 Terry Gilliam directed at least two scenes the very first one with the arrival of the Wise Men and the Nativity and the abduction of Brian by the aliens as explained in the commentary.Lively Original Music by Geoffrey Burgon  including jolly final song sung by Eric Idle . Colorful as well as evocative Cinematography by Peter Biziou . The motion picture was well directed by Terry Jones . In 1965 with his friend Michael Palin he made The Late Show 1966 for television which was his first success and he wrote for many other TV shows . But Jones' greatest success was the zany Monty Python's Flying Circus 196974 with Palin Graham Chapman John Cleese Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle and other hits such as Jabberwocky  The meaning of life  Monty Python and the Holy Grail and this Life of Brian  among others .".

In Life of Brian the comedians go after the one institution that has always had trouble accepting satire religion specifically the Christian Church. Seen as blasphemous Life of Brian needed an eleventh hour rescue for Beatle George Harrison to finish the film. The church was wise to wonder what the Pythons were doing. Life of Brian is filled with questions of the role of religion in society why people often feel they need religion and the age old question of What would happen if the 3 wise men went to the wrong stable on that night they brought gifts to the young savior? There is typical Python silliness throughout the movie set up early where listeners at one of Jesus' sermons held at tea time of course think they hear that blessed are the cheese makers. But the most important part of this film and it's charm are the questions of religion. No matter your faith you will find scenes in Life of Brian unsettling provocative and humorous possibly all three at once.

I might point out that I have heard a minister make mention of this film in his sermon and he was not condemning it. Even now supporters of this film have to keep on driving home the point that this film is NOT about Jesus. Yes Jesus does appear and is portrayed reverentially in the film what the Pythons say about not being afraid of the blasphemy laws is a load of big talk. The laughs come thick and fast. If mishearing Jesus's words as Blessed are the cheesemakers is blasphemous then schoolchildren all over the world commit blasphemy when they sing Dance then wherever you may be. I am the Lord of the Dance Settee. If creating a fictional character whose life runs parallel to that of Jesus is blasphemous then Lew Wallace committed a blasphemy when he wrote Ben Hur. In a recent Channel 4 documentary about the film Polly Toynbee said there is a great humour vacumn at the heart of religion. It's true. The way some religious groups got so hot under their clerical collars about it takes your breath away. When the film opened in Glasgow the late Pastor Jack Glass well known arch enemy of Billy Connolly presented the cinema manager with four nails. Glass told the manager this was because he was crucifying Jesus all over again. Much as he would have disliked itGlass had a few things in common with Billy Connolly. Both came from a Glaswegian working class background both had beards and expressed their strongly held views irrespective of what other people thought. Glass also had a bit of a knack for making people laugh although unlike Billy Connolly this was not intentional. Most of the religious nuts who opposed and continue to oppose this film have never seen it but these people aren't noted for their broad mindedness. Some have seen it and probably would have sat their scowling and not laughing as it was what they saw as their Christian duty. But frankly it's very hard to sit through this film and not laugh. Brian's ride in the spaceship is hilarious. There are also some brilliant lines in the film. Come on you religious fanatics. Get a life. Have a laugh. Your faith must be very flimsy if it is harmed by a film that is just meant as a joke.".

So if you are not already chocking with guffaws forget about this tripe and go do something more rewarding such as setting your car on fire for ex..Oh this is about a guy who's born at the same time as Jesus Christ but next door from an annoying womana real man playing the part. Then his life takes a parallel course to that of the Messiah but in supposedly funny ways all the way to his own crucifixionthat because some other condemned men took his place when he Brian was pardoned.

Oh and a leper who was cured by Jesus but who's P.O. now because he doesn't get any alms money anymore. I'm not making it up.The basic idea behind the plot is one of those which have been forever floating around and about which people write stories make movies. Like that of the guy who lives some adventure only to wake up and realize it was only a dream or the manwoman whose life alternates between dream states and awakened ones to realize at the end the dreams were the reality after all and the perceived reality just a dream. Here is about a guy who becomes an unwilling Messiah. I wrote a story about the same topic at that time by coincidence and there was nothing gratuitous about it as it was the way I reacted to the horrendous news coming from Guyana about the mass suicide or murder of almost a thousand followers of cult leader Jim Jones who died also in that tragedy. The point I tried to make there is the same Brian makes when addressing the crowdin the only scene worth to be watchedthat people should stop looking for salvation elsewhere than in themselves because the most probable outcome will be that they'll fall in the hands of some selfserving charlatan who will only used them for his own benefit. Now had LOB been structured around such an idea that could have probably made for a better and more intelligent film but it is obvious that Monty Python was going here for the easy laughs so the claim that they intended to do something deeper more serious than a simple series of sophomoric sketches rings rather hollow.In all basically a good idea one that could have worked well even as a comedy in the hands of people really giving serious thought to it. 110.".

It would have been one of the most pedestrian segues on an episode of Flying Circus.Moreover religious fundamentalism seems far too easy a target for the Pythons.

Moreover the scenes never seem to end quickly enough after the points have been scored. The same wells whether PFJ infighting or crowds slavishly following and misunderstanding prophets are visited so often that the movie becomes predictable and stale adjectives not often heard in reference to the most influential sketch comedy troupe of all time.The best bits here are more lowbrow Romans with sophomoric names that send the centurions into uncontrollable giggling fits and straight faced fullfrontal nudity. Even in these cases though incredibly slow pacing saps some of the humor. A gag about speech impediments for example takes ages to play out to its conclusion. The film ends well though with a perfectly earnest Eric Idle singing the hilarious earworm Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.Some religious groups and even entire nations Ireland and Norway took the Pythons' bait and reacted with great offense to the release of Brian a fact that says a lot more about the time period than it does about the movie which hardly justifies such a response. From a contemporary perspective Flying Circus seems far more subversive than Brian in the sense that it forged new comedic ground and tested the limits of the television format. Brian doesn't reach beyond what the Pythons had already achieved and in failing to succeed at anything different compares unfavorably.".

In the growing and learning part of life catholic schoolboys attend a rather strange church service and ditto sex education lesson. Onto war where an officer's plan to attack is thwarted by his underlings wanting to celebrate his birthday and an officer's leg is bitten off by presumably an African tiger.

	schema:headline " Monty Python's final film adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "The famous British comedy troupe Monthy Python crafted this bizarre collections of their special brand of humor as their last film together loosely tied by the common theme of the everlasting search for the Meaning of Life this series of sketches make a very good closure for their film adventures as it seems as a return to their roots in the TV show Flying Circus and dedicated to long time fans.

It's safe to say that this movie contains some of the best and the worst the troupe has done however their most mediocre work is still better than most modern comedy out there.The movie also foresees the future careers of both Gilliam and Jones as directors their film style particularly Gilliam's is now mature and almost fully developed. Gilliam's short The Crimson Permanent Assurance is an outstanding segment that could even stand alone on its own and that presents Gilliam fully in form as a wild fantasy director.While this was their last film the group seems to be at its peak when talking about acting from John Cleese's Dr. Spenser to Graham Chapman's near perfect impersonation of Tony Bennet the acting never lets down and even when some scripts are dull even for their time the Pythons as actors never disappoint.Something worth to notice are the great quality of the songs performed in the film. they are not only written with their high quality witty humor musically they work very well and rank among the best the group has written in their history together.Still the movie may be overlong and at times tedious to people not used to the team's brand of humor. Specially considering that The Meaning of Life has more in common with their early roots than with what made them famous. Also probably some of the jokes are definitely outdated now however The Meaning of Life is a very good display of the gang's different sides.While maybe not as ingenious as Holy Grail and definitely nowhere near the masterpiece Life of Brian the Pythons last movie is still a very good comedy to watch. However this certain brand of humor may be appealing only to fans of the Python's TV work as it has more of those early roots than of their past film adventures. 810. An acquired taste indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The moment you start watching Monty Python's Meaning of Life and you see the unexpected movie within the movie The Crimson Permanent Assurance in which an office building turns into a pirate ship you know you're in for one hell of a surreal ride. Meaning of Life is the Pythons at the zenith of their lunacy filled with shocking moments of violence offensive behavior repulsive bodily functions and all sorts of jawdropping bric a brac. Whether or not the movie truly intends to make us ponder the meaning of life or not is debatable but you have a great time watching it. With an aquarium full of fish as a sort of Greek chorus we explore the 3 stages of life birth growth and death. The faint of heart better beware Meaning of Life has scenes that would even today barely fly in the land of the Puritans. Michael Palin as a dirtpoor father of 100 children leads an epic musical number against birth control. Eric Idle while singing about the vastness of the universe witnesses a constellation take form of a naked woman giving birth. John Cleese plays a headmaster who teaches sex ed by having intercourse with his wife in front of his class it's easily the least erotic sex scene in cinema history. And in Meaning of Life's most famous scene the revolting gluttonous Mr. Creosote Terry Jones literally eats until he explodes. The film lampoons several touchy topics Catholic dogma basic human stupidity and selfishness the foolishness of war in a brilliant parody of Zulu with Michael Caine in a brief cameo and even death itself one man is able to choose his death in which he is chased off a cliff by a mob of topless women. Yet it's not entirely gratuitous. In fact the Pythons make several good points birth control shouldn't be denied to anyone especially those too poor to have children. Gluttony is wrong and will in time punish you itself. We only live once so we better enjoy the ride. It's noholdsbarred madness and it's Monty Python at their best. Meaning of Life doesn't have the same cult following as Holy Grail but it's certainly one of their best. If you can't handle gore sex vomiting or lunacy steer clear. For those willing to take the chance check out Monty Python's Meaning of Life and maybe we'll figure out as the title song says if mankind's evolving or is it too late?.".

	schema:reviewBody "The third and last real film by the Monty Python crew. First they made fun of the medieval times and its beliefs. Then they gave the earliest followers of Jesus a whooping'. Now they... well they pretty much cover every stage of life in the search for the 'meaning of life'. The film unlike the two other onesMonty Python and the Holy Grail Life of Brian is basically a series of sketcheswhereas the two aforementioned films had progressive plots much like the seriesMonty Python's Flying Circus. As such it's pretty much like watching an episode of said series if the episodes were nearly two hours long. Of course this means that if you like the series you'll like the film. To this date I have yet to meet anyone who likes the group and doesn't like the series so I guess it was a good idea. Despite the title it has reasonably little actual philosophy and such but I doubt any Pythonfans will be completely devastated by this. As another new thing for a Pythonfilm it's also a musical. There have been one or two musical numbers during the previous films and the series but nothing this major. There are about 89 musical scenes in the film complete with choreographed dancing lead singers and backup vocals. Of course it's all done in typical Pythonstyle so not a single one of them is what you'd normally expect from a musical. The comedy is pretty much the same as usual from the Python troupe with some misses but mostly hits. Plot is pretty much nonexistent but what there is is good. The pacing is good but because of the film's allsketch content it gets somewhat dull around the middleas Cleese also points out in the 'making of' featured on the DVD. The acting is all pretty good. The special effects are nice. Not much else to say since you already pretty much know the Pythons' style of humor from the series and the two earlier films. And if you don't you should probably check out either of the films first or even better one of the more sober episodes of the series. I recommend this to any fan of the Monty Python group particularly those who prefer the Flying Circus over the two other films since it's more sketchcomedy than the others. 810".

	schema:headline " A great comedy which may be crass and rude but is not lacking in typical Python wit";
	schema:reviewBody "The best thing about Monty Python's The Meaning of Life is without a doubt the short film that opens it. Directed by Terry Gilliam and originally conceived as an animated sequence The Crimson Permanent Assurance is a crucial step in Gilliam's career as a director. His previous two solo efforts as director the inconsequential Jabberwocky and the brilliantinitsownway Time Bandits saw him developing his visual style much further than he did for his scenes for Monty Python and the Holy Grail with Time Bandits arguably being the first 'Gilliamesque' film he made. Still Time Bandits didn't see his style fully developed and The Crimson Permanent Assurance is an even more bizarre film but with a far more confident and clearcut visual style. Simply put Gilliam was ready for Brazil. This segment is the best in the film from a cinematic viewpoint without a doubt and even gives some of the other segments a run for their money in terms of the quality of the comedy which involves office clerks who become pirates. Yes it is quite strange.The issue a lot of people have with The Meaning of Life is that it is crass and rude and even sillier than the Python standard. It's shock humor but for the majority of the sections of the film work so well and are so clever even in their lack of class that I would not hesitate to put The Meaning of Life on the same level as Life of Brian though it's not as good as Monty Python  The Holy Grail. That's not to say this isn't 'Pythonesque' because it's very much so they're just completely liberated by the medium of film to say and do whatever they please. Indeed there's something in here to offend nearly anyone but there's also a fair bit in here to please everyone even a wonderful scene in which Gilliam's 'supporting feature' The Crimson Permanent Assurance suddenly intrudes on the events of the film.The Meaning of Life is constructed as a series of skits and though many have suggested that it is hence not as much of a narrative movie as their previous two efforts. I tend to disagree with this viewpoint. Yes this film is a series of skits but they are all elaborately set up within an overarching 'commentary' on the general theme of the movie the title. There is one section of the film which is both entirely unnecessary and honestly quite bad is 'The Autumn Years' an unfunny and vile piece centered around Terry Jones in a fatsuit repeatedly vomiting and eventually exploding. Basically all of the rest of the film is very very funny and even the jokes which fall flat within scenes like Live Organ Transplants and Death don't go terribly wrong because the overall quality of the scenes and sections are so high and the concepts behind them very funny. Gilliam's animations work excellently within the film and this would sadly be the last time we saw a distinctive Gilliam animation within a major film.The Meaning of Life is great comedy. It's crass and rude and goes for cheap humor often but it's mostly handled with a great deal of wit and intelligence that elevates even the section involving the world's most pornographic sex education class to a high level. Perhaps in retrospect this film's flaws are more obvious than those Life of Brian suffers from but both are ultimately on the same level.910".

	schema:headline " least in the Python 'trilogy' but parts are wildly successful and memorable";
	schema:reviewBody "Taking a slight departure from the story structure of The Holy Grail and Life of Brian the Monty Python troupe went back to their 'Flying Circus' TV days to cook up this philosophical musical ultraviolent sexual total streamofconsciousness look into what makes up our lives and if there is a meaning to it. It's split up into parts starting off with the Miracle of Birth extending into the Miracle of Birth in the Third Role a part on war a part on sex and so forth. This time Python goes even further with the outrageousness the delayed punchlines the wit almost nothing is taken prisoners. They go after religion children schooling business fat people television you name it they go for it all in the quest for the 'meaning of life'.I saw the film twice last year and bits on TV and I had pretty much the same reaction the second time as the first. Like with many of Python's sketches the strengths usually outweigh the weaknesses depending on who's stronger in the bit I loved the Miracle of Birth number with Michael Palin's Every Sperm is Sacred song which spirals into one of director Terry Jones's most inspired numbers I had big belly laughs when Gilliam as a resident got an impromptu kidney operation as the bystanders barely seemed affected the Mr. Creoste sketch was crude but blatantly over the top the timing in the school scenes and the battlefield scenes was very sharp. But in the end the parts are more memorable than really on the whole unlike with the other two films. They set themselves up for a challenge to make a comedy successful without the sort of core that was in Holy Grail the search by King Arthur and other knights and Life of Brian a man mistaken to be the messiah. Sketches and specifics in the Python world are when they're at their best and aspects like the animation and the overall scheme of getting the punchlines or lack thereof right isn't affected. What can be said is that some of the bits that don't work well as others keep one wanting to get to the next best bit luckily this all leads up to a manic scene of Chapman running away from dozens of naked women. It's always a spectacular romp with the Pythons and even when they're at their worst and most vile and and strange there is one scene I have no explanation for its watchable. Maybe some scenes like with other comedies from my childhood that I'm still amused by will become funnier as time goes on like little injokes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Taking a slight departure from the story structure of The Holy Grail and Life of Brian the Monty Python troupe went back to their 'Flying Circus' TV days to cook up this philosophical musical ultraviolent sexual total streamofconsciousness look into what makes up our lives and if there is a meaning to it. It's split up into parts starting off with the Miracle of Birth extending into the Miracle of Birth in the Third Role a part on war a part on sex and so forth. This time Python goes even further with the outrageousness the delayed punchlines the wit almost nothing is taken prisoners. They go after religion children schooling business fat people television you name it they go for it all in the quest for the 'meaning of life'.I saw the film twice last year and bits on TV and I had pretty much the same reaction the second time as the first.

This segment continued to expand because according to Gilliam nobody told him to stop . Furthermore  special mention to the death sketch where Arthur Jarrett  Graham Chapman  has chosen to die while pursued by naked girls . Six cast members played a lot of characters such as Graham Chapman  John Cleese  Terry Gilliam  Eric Idle  Terry Jones and Michael Palin .

I have to admit the humour and format is a bit out of date but when you consider it's all over 20 years old and all still funny you realise how ingenious it actually is. Anyhow despite what other fans have said this is almost certainly Monty Python's best film. Sure it doesn't quite have the satirical cleverness of Life of Brian sure it isn't as creative as Holy Grail and despite the fact a lot of fans like this because it's quite similar to the flying circus show it doesn't get as close to that as 'Now for something completely different' did probably because that contained sketches directly from the show and sure John Cleese denied rewriting the script which would of made the film even better but it does have one thing that the show or any of the other movies for that matter doesn't have... Conplete and utter frequent obscenity. Seriously from the beginning to the end it's got sexual near blasphemous and death based humour but because I was watching it with my brother and not mother or any older generation I hardly noticed. That was until the live organ transplant scene. Seriously that was the funniest most shocking scene I have ever seen in Monty Python or possibley ever. You have to watch it to get it but damn. It's also got everything Monty Python's stuff other stuff has got including an incredibly surreal 'middle of the film' Your'll love this film if you like Monty Pythons unique brand of humour or if you enjoy fatalist dark sexual toilet violent offencive or any other kind of shock value humour. Oh yeah It's also got Boobies. I think it also contains the fword a few times but I don't think it was used more than in Life of Brian so from that side it was less obscene but on the whole this is the liveaction plot less philosophical South Park movie.".

Not that's it's a bad movie there's enough funny stuff to give nearly every viewer a good laugh at some point or another but it's just not consistently funny which is the mark of any great comedy. My favorite was probably the bit about the English Army officers fighting in Africa in the 1870's when one of them wakes up to find his leg missing. The doctor says Must have been bit off by a tiger. A tiger here in Africa?Well maybe it escaped from a zoo. This was the sort of lunatic dialogue which made their earlier work great. But too much of it is just gross out humor. The fat guy was pretty funny but the liver sketch was just disgusting. And Cleese doing live sexed in front of a bunch of bored schoolboys just made me want to cringe. Like I said it seemed to me the guys knew they were past their prime and instead of just letting the humor flow naturally they tried too often to force it out. With decidedly mixed results.     510".

	schema:headline " And Now For Something Completely Wasted";
	schema:reviewBody "The cancer that robbed us of Graham Chapman in 1989 not only snuffed out the life of one of Britain's great eccentrics it also left this sad shaky undigested lump of a film as the last will and testament of that great comedy troupe he so stolidly centered Monty Python's Flying Circus.Like the first Python film more than a decade before And Now For Something Completely Different this was a collection of sketches. But rather than refining material first performed on the BBC the six Pythons created a wholly new piece more or less about the purpose of human existence. The patchwork nature of this project is hard to ignore and even commented upon within the film but the real problem with Meaning Of Life is how sourly unfunny it manages to be.Have you ever wondered about how so many philosophers have the letter S in their names? Neither have I but the Pythons manage to beat this frail idea into the ground in the form of Michael Palin and Eric Idle as a pair of middleaged Americans stuck for dinner conversation. How about organ donation? It turns out a cruel bloody trick played on Terry Gilliam as a Jewish Rastafarian for some bizarre reason. War is cruel especially when you are a World War I officer enacted by Terry Jones whose troops decide to throw him a surprise birthday party in the midst of battle.John Cleese manages to come off best by appearing in the one good sketch here a pedantic schoolmaster so mindnumbingly boring he can't keep his class interested even while showing them how he has sex with his wife. As you can see I have now entered...oh do try paying attention! Cleese avoids most of the rest of the movie another plus for him. Those Callard  Bowser commercials probably seemed a better idea at the time and they were.On a commentary track for the DVD principal director Jones and Gilliam who directed a meandering opening sequence about pirate accountants and some smaller bits talk very contentedly about the film Gilliam enthusing about how smooth and professional the troupe performed at this time. They are smooth but rarely funny.The one sketch the two directors criticize in the whole film is a bit where two men dressed as a tiger apparently make off with someone's leg. It strikes them as very early Python and indeed it is from a time when their inspired mindwarping silliness made them comedic successors to the Beatles as George Harrison often maintained.The sketch is dodgy but it's about the only glimmer of that old light to be found. Otherwise the Pythons seem more interested in outraging viewers than entertaining them with healthy doses of blood vomit and religionbashing. There's a saying the worst thing you can give creative people is anything they want. That the Pythons enjoyed no censorship and a big budget puts them too often at their selfindulgent lazy worst.Maybe the problem was that Cleese Palin Gilliam and Idle had already struck out successfully as individuals by this point and saw the whole Python deal as just a few extra bob rather than anything important. Maybe the long layoff since their last big project Life Of Brian made them shyer about speaking their minds regarding weaknesses in each other's material. Maybe they needed to give Chapman more to do. He was the star in Brian and Monty Python And The Holy Grail a cheerfully daft center for the others to bounce off of. Here he stands out mostly for a scene where he is chased by a group of barebreasted maidens.The breasts are nice anyway almost making up for the fact their placement has no point. Nothing has a point in Meaning Of Life and after more than 90 pointless minutes of it you will never be so happy to see Death arrive to crash the party.".

The patchwork nature of this project is hard to ignore and even commented upon within the film but the real problem with Meaning Of Life is how sourly unfunny it manages to be.Have you ever wondered about how so many philosophers have the letter S in their names? Neither have I but the Pythons manage to beat this frail idea into the ground in the form of Michael Palin and Eric Idle as a pair of middleaged Americans stuck for dinner conversation. How about organ donation? It turns out a cruel bloody trick played on Terry Gilliam as a Jewish Rastafarian for some bizarre reason. War is cruel especially when you are a World War I officer enacted by Terry Jones whose troops decide to throw him a surprise birthday party in the midst of battle.John Cleese manages to come off best by appearing in the one good sketch here a pedantic schoolmaster so mindnumbingly boring he can't keep his class interested even while showing them how he has sex with his wife. As you can see I have now entered...oh do try paying attention! Cleese avoids most of the rest of the movie another plus for him. Those Callard  Bowser commercials probably seemed a better idea at the time and they were.On a commentary track for the DVD principal director Jones and Gilliam who directed a meandering opening sequence about pirate accountants and some smaller bits talk very contentedly about the film Gilliam enthusing about how smooth and professional the troupe performed at this time. They are smooth but rarely funny.The one sketch the two directors criticize in the whole film is a bit where two men dressed as a tiger apparently make off with someone's leg. It strikes them as very early Python and indeed it is from a time when their inspired mindwarping silliness made them comedic successors to the Beatles as George Harrison often maintained.The sketch is dodgy but it's about the only glimmer of that old light to be found. Otherwise the Pythons seem more interested in outraging viewers than entertaining them with healthy doses of blood vomit and religionbashing. There's a saying the worst thing you can give creative people is anything they want. That the Pythons enjoyed no censorship and a big budget puts them too often at their selfindulgent lazy worst.Maybe the problem was that Cleese Palin Gilliam and Idle had already struck out successfully as individuals by this point and saw the whole Python deal as just a few extra bob rather than anything important. Maybe the long layoff since their last big project Life Of Brian made them shyer about speaking their minds regarding weaknesses in each other's material. Maybe they needed to give Chapman more to do. He was the star in Brian and Monty Python And The Holy Grail a cheerfully daft center for the others to bounce off of. Here he stands out mostly for a scene where he is chased by a group of barebreasted maidens.The breasts are nice anyway almost making up for the fact their placement has no point. Nothing has a point in Meaning Of Life and after more than 90 pointless minutes of it you will never be so happy to see Death arrive to crash the party.";

If I can make it to the second sketch the aquarium with the fish I'm hooked. Now I can't spell out too many of the situations without ruining the surprises but I can't resist those fish.We see an underwater scene with a fake fish swimming slowly back and forth. Another fish enters and they exchange gruff Good mornings. One by one other fish swim into the scene and each time there is the same good morning exchange very ritualized and formal. There is a brief conversation between the fishes. All of them have hideous humanoid face. Anything new? Wot? I say anything new? No nothing much new. One of the fishes faces the camera and exclaims Look! Howard's being EATEN. And the camera shows us that the fish are in a restaurant aquarium the kind from which ultrafresh live fish are hand picked to serve as an entre.We see the fussily dressed waiter bending down to show the customer his nicely prepared decapitate piscine preparation.Hmmm one of the fish wonders aloud. Makes you THINK doesn't it? Then the opening credits roll  Monty Python's Meaning of Life. Granted this description loses something in being transposed from one medium to another but if you don't find this amusing you may not appreciate the rest of the film.There are some dozen or so sketches none of which fall entirely flat but some of which are stronger than others. The most offensive by far is the fat man M. Creosote who waddles into a fancy French restaurant in the fattest FAT SUIT known to man or beast. He literally drags his belly along the floor. The staff rush to seat him and cater to him. Throughout the film much of the humor derives from the unflappability of the cast no matter how dire the circumstances  selling one's children for use is scientific experiments losing a leg Woke up and  one sock too many or death. The waiters provide the rebarbative M. Creosote with a bucket to puke into and M. Creosote uses it  not delicately but voluminously all over the floor and the other diners. When he's eaten and drunk what appears to be the entire stock of the restaurant no more than a tiny head on a balloon of a body dribbling vomit the waiter entices him into trying just one more dessert wafer thin. The waiter gingerly feeds it to him then dives behind a wall as M. Creosote explodes like a bomb drenching the entire interior of the establishment and causing all the other customers to become ill.I see I've already ruined two gags. Okay. I'll try reining myself in. But I'm compelled to mention some dialog in the scene in which death visits a quartet of diners at home because of some tainted salmon mousse. An American man in a loud jacket and tie removes his pipe and begins to argue with the Grim Reaper. Shuddup! orders the Reaper. All you Americans talk too much. You talk and talk. You say things like 'I wanna tell you something' and 'Just lemme say this!' I'm laughing too hard to go on and it's just as well that I quit now. But maybe I should add that the last sketch following Death shows us a heaven staged like a Las Vegas show and it's ridiculed. Maybe Monty Python in deliberately throwing away any attempt to define the meaning of life has bootlegged a philosophy into the story after all. Marcus Aurelius recommended waiting for death with a cheerful mind and observed that death looks at all of us and the best we can do is smile back. Like other Stoics he assumed that people should not fear that which is natural. Why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature and nothing is evil which is according to nature Albert Einstein described his own attitude towards death in similar terms. It is a natural event. If you're uncertain about this being your cup of tea my advice would be to watch it for ten or fifteen minutes. If you aren't grabbed by then watch something else.".

The Mr Creosotescene as it's called being the most disgusting and overthetop part the part showing the war in Africa and two men dressed as a tiger being among the funniest.For someone not too familiar with Monty Pythons work this might not be a good start. Rather one should try to watch one of their more lighthearted work. While i find this movie to have it's points actually i think many parts are quite funny there is still a streak of black which disturbs the experience. I know a lot of people who dislike this movie and granted it's not for everyone. But for fans of Monty Python or their brand of comedy in general there are still parts here well worth watching.

The humour present is perhaps more appealing to nonfans as a sticking point is the Pythons' continual obsession with intellectualising trivial issues. Here they trivialise intellectual issues which is far more satisfying.As with any Python activity it's really very hit and miss and there are plenty of misses. The end for one. A rant by Terry Jones at the thencurrent state of the film industry seems a bit like pots and kettles and the second section Growth and Learning just goes too full out to shock. In fact most of the film is like this with a juvenile need to offend which is odd considering even the youngest Python was forty at this stage. Yet this urge to break every last taboo gives us digs at Catholics Protestants Mormons Jews Africans and Americans. We get women talking openly about their periods and young naked children discussing reproduction with their father. There are also some gratuitous topless shots at the end though I won't complain about that part too much. At the time it was all probably very risqu and daring though it seems strangely tame and even inept these days.The opening minifeature The Crimson Permanent Assurance seems a gracious attempt by the team to allow Gilliam a Brazil tryout. It's nicely directed better than the main film in fact though doesn't really go anywhere or indeed be funny at all. It ends with a song feebly playing on the words AccountancyAccountant Sea. Still it only lasts fifteen minutes I suppose... The opening proper is a ghastly sketch with Cleese as a heartless Doctor saying lines like Can I put the tube in the baby's head? Cleese... posh bloke that shouts... no I still don't get why that's supposed to be funny.But there is a fair amount of good stuff in there if not exactly sidesplitting. The one bit that did make me laugh out loud was the least sophisticated moment and arguably the most famous the Mr. Creosote restaurant scene. An insanely obese man who vomits everywhere including four times over the back of a cleaning lady this puerile grossout humour is undeniably amusing. This then leads on to another great moment Eric Idle's French waiter leading the camera away to explain his philosophy on the meaning of life. Having explained it and seeing the underwhelmed response Idle starts screaming at the camera telling us what to do if we don't like it.Fighting Each Other is another nice segment with three brief satires on war. Perhaps the best is where an army captain trying to fight his way out of a bunker is given gifts by his regiment. Seeing Chapman trying to avoid enemy fire while being presented with a fulllength grandfather clock is an amusing touch. Idle appears as an embittered Scots soldier bemoaning the fact that a soldier can shoot people and be praised for it but a civilian cannot. At home they'd hang me. Here they'll give me a fg medal! My favourite bit though has to be Eric stepping from a fridge in a neon pink suit walking out into space while singing Galaxy Song. It's not particularly funny but it does get across some of the sense of scale and wide scope that makes this film rewarding. Well it would if it didn't also highlight the film's modest budget. There's also an Oliver! spoof and a mickeytake of Johnny Mathis to contend with. Gilliam oddly only gets one sustained cartoon a nice sketch about leaves committing suicide.Okay it all could have been a lot better. Despite what their fans would have you think quality control are two words unlikely to have troubled the Pythons. But this is a refreshing change of tack for the group even down to Idle's Noel Coward take off. Usually Coward in Python would have sung about currency or foreign politics but here he just gets to reel off a ditty about penises. It's this nolimits fullbore attitude that makes for interesting if not actually all that funny viewing. And as the final Python film then the ultimate question of life itself was a subject they were long overdue in tackling. 610.".

Having explained it and seeing the underwhelmed response Idle starts screaming at the camera telling us what to do if we don't like it.Fighting Each Other is another nice segment with three brief satires on war. Perhaps the best is where an army captain trying to fight his way out of a bunker is given gifts by his regiment. Seeing Chapman trying to avoid enemy fire while being presented with a fulllength grandfather clock is an amusing touch. Idle appears as an embittered Scots soldier bemoaning the fact that a soldier can shoot people and be praised for it but a civilian cannot. At home they'd hang me. Here they'll give me a fg medal! My favourite bit though has to be Eric stepping from a fridge in a neon pink suit walking out into space while singing Galaxy Song. It's not particularly funny but it does get across some of the sense of scale and wide scope that makes this film rewarding. Well it would if it didn't also highlight the film's modest budget. There's also an Oliver! spoof and a mickeytake of Johnny Mathis to contend with. Gilliam oddly only gets one sustained cartoon a nice sketch about leaves committing suicide.Okay it all could have been a lot better. Despite what their fans would have you think quality control are two words unlikely to have troubled the Pythons. But this is a refreshing change of tack for the group even down to Idle's Noel Coward take off. Usually Coward in Python would have sung about currency or foreign politics but here he just gets to reel off a ditty about penises. It's this nolimits fullbore attitude that makes for interesting if not actually all that funny viewing. And as the final Python film then the ultimate question of life itself was a subject they were long overdue in tackling. 610.";

The man is hilarious and much more able to combine that hilarity with pathos than Jerry Lewis. The problem iswas Bud Abbott.

So you could put Martin  Lewis together in a movie and have a complete film. But with Abbott and Costello Lou could provide all the comedy but Abbott could not sing or be romantic or dance or do anything to carry part of the film. And that is very clear in this film.Don't get me wrong. This is an entertaining film And the focus is Abbott and Costello. But most AC films have to bring in some romance so here they bring in John Carroll and Kathryn Grayson. In most AC films they have to bring in some music so again here they turn to John Carroll and Kathryn Grayson. As a result as with most other AC films Rio Rita becomes a musicalcomedyvariety film...and who does that better than MGM with its high production values?

But AC are very funny here both in terms of Lou's slapstick and the team's witty dialog.Due to World War II the plot of the old musical by the way almost every song from the original Ziegfeld production has been eliminated has been modified to bring in a Nazi spy plot to trigger the action but it works.As Abbott  Costello films go this is pretty good and well worth a watch.".

	schema:headline " Two Guys in Texas";
	schema:reviewBody "RIO RITA MetroGoldwynMayer 1942 directed by S. Sylvan Simon stars those two funny guys from Universal making their MGM debut Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in a rare case where the movie for which they are appearing is lifted from a Broadway show rather than than the use of an original screenplay. Based on a Florenz Ziegfeld 1927 musicalcomedy by Guy Bolton and Fred Thompson later adapted to a largescale 136 minute part color motion picture for RKO Radio 1929 featuring Bebe Daniels John Boles and the comic antics by Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey this latest edition which might have been something for MGM's resident comics Red Skelton and Rags Ragland to MGM's credit acquires the services of Abbott and Costello while the titled character played by Kathryn Grayson is one of secondary importance.The revised plot with special material by John Grant finds stranded vacationers Doc Bud Abbott and Wishy Dunn Lou Costello working at a Texas pet shop earning enough money for their return trip home to New York. After their boss fires them for losing a customer's dog Doc and Wishy hide themselves in the trunk of a parked car with New York license plates unaware that its owner radio singer Ricardo Montera John Carroll is not heading for New York but coming from New York bound for the Hotel Vista Del Rio to reunite himself with his childhood sweetheart Rita Winslow Kathryn Grayson the hotel's owner. With Maurice Craindall Tom Conway acting as manager with Jake Peter WhitneyTrask Arthur Space and Gus Dick Rich as his assistants Rita acquires further help by hiring Doc and Wishy jobs as hotel detectives. By doing this the dual not only encounter Nazi spies in their midst but a crate of shortwave radio concealed inside miniature apples adding to the confusion.Others in the cast are Patricia Dane Lucette Brinswick Barry Nelson Harry Gantley and Eve Puig Marianna. Songs by Harry Tierney and Joseph McCarthy Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg include Long Before You Came Along sung by John Carroll and Kathryn Grayson Agua Caliente sung by Rangers The Ranger Song Rangers Carroll and Grayson Rio Rita sung by John Carroll The Brazilian Dance performed by Brazilian dancer Eros Volusia in her Hollywood movie debut Ombres Legeres The Shadow Song sung by Grayson and The Ranger Song. John Carroll's rich baritone singing is pleasant enough but his speaking with Spanish accent makes one wish of having either a Ricardo Montalban or a Desi Arnaz in his place. For Kathryn Grayson a likable screen presence with a fine voice does have one very dull moment during her operatic vocalization of The Shadow Song. As much as the Abbott and Costello comedies are funnier over at Universal than the three they did for MGM RIO RITA is still quite entertaining the MGM way. Though not generally known when it comes to Abbott and Costello titles at least not as forgotten as their once elusive Africa SCREAMS 1949 RIO RITA follows the then familiar pattern of song interludes by romantic leads and amusements by the comics. At MGM Costello retains his dopey fat guy character as before while Bud still the straight man who gives the orders is given a rare chance to break away from his partner from time to time for romancing mostly offscreen with an attractive young woman named Dotty Joan Valerie. While Lou can be naturally funny at times there are moments where his comedy antics are forced and just plain silly.

	onyx:emotionText "RIO RITA MetroGoldwynMayer 1942 directed by S. Sylvan Simon stars those two funny guys from Universal making their MGM debut Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in a rare case where the movie for which they are appearing is lifted from a Broadway show rather than than the use of an original screenplay. Based on a Florenz Ziegfeld 1927 musicalcomedy by Guy Bolton and Fred Thompson later adapted to a largescale 136 minute part color motion picture for RKO Radio 1929 featuring Bebe Daniels John Boles and the comic antics by Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey this latest edition which might have been something for MGM's resident comics Red Skelton and Rags Ragland to MGM's credit acquires the services of Abbott and Costello while the titled character played by Kathryn Grayson is one of secondary importance.The revised plot with special material by John Grant finds stranded vacationers Doc Bud Abbott and Wishy Dunn Lou Costello working at a Texas pet shop earning enough money for their return trip home to New York. After their boss fires them for losing a customer's dog Doc and Wishy hide themselves in the trunk of a parked car with New York license plates unaware that its owner radio singer Ricardo Montera John Carroll is not heading for New York but coming from New York bound for the Hotel Vista Del Rio to reunite himself with his childhood sweetheart Rita Winslow Kathryn Grayson the hotel's owner. With Maurice Craindall Tom Conway acting as manager with Jake Peter WhitneyTrask Arthur Space and Gus Dick Rich as his assistants Rita acquires further help by hiring Doc and Wishy jobs as hotel detectives. By doing this the dual not only encounter Nazi spies in their midst but a crate of shortwave radio concealed inside miniature apples adding to the confusion.Others in the cast are Patricia Dane Lucette Brinswick Barry Nelson Harry Gantley and Eve Puig Marianna. Songs by Harry Tierney and Joseph McCarthy Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg include Long Before You Came Along sung by John Carroll and Kathryn Grayson Agua Caliente sung by Rangers The Ranger Song Rangers Carroll and Grayson Rio Rita sung by John Carroll The Brazilian Dance performed by Brazilian dancer Eros Volusia in her Hollywood movie debut Ombres Legeres The Shadow Song sung by Grayson and The Ranger Song. John Carroll's rich baritone singing is pleasant enough but his speaking with Spanish accent makes one wish of having either a Ricardo Montalban or a Desi Arnaz in his place. For Kathryn Grayson a likable screen presence with a fine voice does have one very dull moment during her operatic vocalization of The Shadow Song. As much as the Abbott and Costello comedies are funnier over at Universal than the three they did for MGM RIO RITA is still quite entertaining the MGM way. Though not generally known when it comes to Abbott and Costello titles at least not as forgotten as their once elusive Africa SCREAMS 1949 RIO RITA follows the then familiar pattern of song interludes by romantic leads and amusements by the comics. At MGM Costello retains his dopey fat guy character as before while Bud still the straight man who gives the orders is given a rare chance to break away from his partner from time to time for romancing mostly offscreen with an attractive young woman named Dotty Joan Valerie. While Lou can be naturally funny at times there are moments where his comedy antics are forced and just plain silly. Routine exchanges between Bud and Lou revolving Pike's Peke 10 You're Not There and the reenactment of Wheeler and Woolsey's original Drinking Pulge from their RIO RITA 1929 film are among their finest along with one with Lou believing he's encountered talking animals.

	schema:reviewBody "When MGM lost a contract deal to sign Abbott and Costello in 1941 Universal Studios in a conciliatory gesture loaned them out to their movie rival. Universal was willing to put the comedy team in as leads rather than support roles and the boys apparently had a talented agent to wrest them away from the larger studio. MGM was so aggrieved that they almost filed a lawsuit but apparently cooler heads prevailed with Rio Rita the first of three pictures MGM put the boys in.For fans of Abbott and Costello who have seen plenty of their films one of the first things you notice here are the absence of their many recycled film bits like 'Slowly I Turned' and 'Who's on First?'. The MGM writing staff did a decent job of coming up with their own funny dialog for the pair like the 'Pike's Peak' gag. Production values run a notch above Universal as well obviously MGM had a lot more money to spend on extras as evidenced by the rather lavishly costumed Volusia dance number. It would have looked a lot better in color though.The setting is the Hotel Vista del Rio in Del Rio Texas which wouldn't mean much to most viewers but that was also the home town of Imus in the Morning's fictional radio character the Reverend Billy Sol Hargus. Imus hasn't used that bit for many years now but once you've heard it you remember it.As for the story things get muddled rather quickly after the main plot element is revealed. Radio station KPKO is a front for a Nazi fifth column enterprise attempting to smuggle bombs into the country. There's some business about a secret code book and planting information in the radio's broadcast commercials but not a lot comes of it all. Even the presence of a 'talking' German Shepherd held some potential for Nazi intrigue but instead the talented canine did an amusing rollover gag with Costello.In fact one could almost make a case for the picture being a musical but with widely disparate genres in play. There's an early riders on horseback segment doing a Texas Rangers song while John Carroll and Kathryn Grayson offer up a few tunes as well with Grayson showing amazing voice control in an operatic number that in all other respects was virtually unlistenable. Things eventually come together to expose the Nazi bad guys in the end but once it's over one begins to wonder what the picture was all about.".

RIO RITA is an updated entirely rewritten version of Florenz Ziegfeld's comic operetta previously filmed in 1929 with star comics Wheeler and Woolsey repeating their roles from the Broadway blockbuster. Bud and Lou receive first billing due to their great popularity but the new production is a primarily a vehicle for pretty young soprano Kathryn Grayson ANCHORS AWEIGH SHOW BOAT KISS ME KATE! who was then being groomed for MGM stardom as an answer to Universal's Deanna Durbin. Hence the focus is on Grayson who performs several good songs including two from the original show and an operatic aria which displays her formidable vocal ability.Even more than AC's other early movies comedy takes rather a back seat to music and romance. Even the dated dramatic situation involving Nazis infiltrating a Western ranch original to this version is secondary to the charms of the leading lady. RIO RITA is not unlike Abbott and Costello's introductory Musical Comedy film ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS a matter of taste. Fortunately it is a taste that can be acquired. Personally one loves Musicals is fond of Kathryn Grayson and is an admirer of Abbott  Costello therefore one was thoroughly primed to enjoy this.

None of these were among their best movies and this is easily the least enjoyable of the three. Nice cast backing up the boys but far too much focus on the bland romance between Kathryn Grayson and John Carroll a poor leading man I've never been a fan of. He uses a particularly laughable Latin accent here. Also too much singing! And it's that operay type singing too. You know what I mean  deep bass from the guy and high soprano from the girl. Not my thing. As for the comedy it's pretty bythenumbers Abbott  Costello material. A few good lines and gags but nothing for the career highlight reel. The car spinning gag Push the button! is probably the movie's best scene and that's in the first twenty minutes. For diehard AC fans or fans of Ms. Grayson's singing.

Rita is a big star on the station and has eyes only for Montera who they had a brief encounter with 10 years previously.  He arrives next morning with the boys still in the back of the car and immediately gets on his horse and rides off to the plains.  He grew up with the rangers.  Ricardo not remembering Rita meets up with her and comes on fresh to her After a boring song.  After she reminds him who she is the rangers then appear and they sing the only good song in the movie. Bud and Louafter an absolutely hilarious  and I mean HILARIOUS!! routine with the car find themselves wondering around starving.  After stealing fake apples used by the nazi owners they are really radios they are more hungry than ever. A waiter lays a table right where they are lying and they eat the food. After the waiters chase them away Rita tells Lucette also after Ricardo that she sent them the food.  She then employs the boys as house detectives. The boys have to get Lucette away from Ricardo and the manager has to get a broadcast out that night to fellow nazis in code. This is a hilarious top Abbott and Costello comedy.  There is a good background story and plenty left over for the boys to do many routines and wordplay.  If only they made more films of this standard.  They did make better films though. The only downside is the many songs.  Kathryn Grayson performs a never ending opera number which slows down the pace.  The rest of the songs after 10 years of watching this movie and STILL laughing I can sit through.Look out for the best bit  Lou trapped inside a giant washing machine!! Abbott and Costello fans will certainly not be disapointed with this movie.There was something so special about the films they made in the early 40s that I just can't define!   Wonderful!".

	schema:headline " MGM ruins yet another comedy team!!";
	schema:reviewBody "During the 19201940s MGM made a ton of wonderful films. However when it came to comedies especially comedy teams they really were inept. Here is the track record With Laurel and Hardy Hal Roach Studios released films through MGM and MGM didn't touch the productions. When they did a MGM films without Roach it resulted in THE AIR RAID WARDENS and NOTHING BUT TROUBLEtwo of their worst films.With Buster Keaton he was a genius during the silent era. His first MGM film the CAMERAMAN was pretty good. But then they soon began making sound films they got the brilliant idea of pairing Keaton a brilliant physical comedian with Jimmy Durante a loud and brash comedian. This mix naturally didn't work and they all but abandoned physical comedy. This effectively ruined Keaton's solo career.With the Three Stooges the studio didn't know what to do. So they let them go after making a few bizarre films like DANCING LADY where the Stooges played solo acts in a Clark Gable and Joan Crawford film.With the Marx Brothers although A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and A DAY AT THE RACES were classics soon the studio put them in insipid formulaic films like THE BIG STORE and AT THE CIRCUS. Gone were their wild and crazy earlier style of films and many believe their films with Paramount DUCK SOUP HORSE FEATHERS and others were their best and most consistent films.With Abbott and Costello after a long string of very successful films with Universal they were loaned out i.e. bought for several films to MGM. This resulted in three rather bland films. MGM decided the team was a flash in the pan and returned them to Universalafter which the team went on to make many very successful films.So the fact that I wasn't impressed with RIO RITA is no big surprisethe MGM folks simply had no idea how to make this type of film and spent very little making it. This is very surprising that with the success of Abbott and Costello in their previous films. That MGM a very highclass studio would make such a cheap looking film was amazing and it was much cheaper than the films the team did with a much smaller Universal Studios. For example in the bad segment at the garage near the beginning of the film you can see the seam in the sky and the sound is terriblelike they are filming in a warehousewhich is what they seemed to be doing throughout the film. To make things worse they used very cheap background paintings. Why oh why didn't they do any location shooting? The total effect is pretty claustrophobiainducing though still watchable.Aside from bad sets the film features a lot of singingand awful lot of singing. I guess the studio saw it more as a Kathryn Grayson and John Carroll film instead of an Abbott and Costello one. MGM can't completely blamed for this as all but one of their previous films at Universal had too much music as well. As to the humor while Bud and Lou seem game the routines aren't particularly good or inspired. Having them in a very contrived plot involving Nazi agents in Mexico! also didn't help.Overall watchable but that's all. A definite comedown from their prior films.".

There are several  excellent routines but they are submerged in a tedious and  unbelievable plot of romance and espionage. MGM was developing Kathryn  Grayson who does not get star billing as a contract player and would  probably have taken advantage of A and C's box office appeal to  showcase her. Unfortunately her performance is quite wooden though  perhaps she could not do much with the material given.

	schema:headline " Perhaps the greatest of all films";
	schema:reviewBody "I have read a lot of understandably negative reviews of the movie 'Brazil.' Brazilin its proper form is a long film at well over two hours it has many cutaways to dream sequences that are only loosely related to the rest of the film and the narrative story is not always the driving force of the film which many people find confusing.  With all these things going against it Brazil is clearly not a film for everyone.All that being said Brazil is my very favorite movie.  Those things previously described as reasons that some people will dislike the movie are the very reasons I love it.  The story is both simple and complex depending on how you look at it and this kind of paradox is what makes for great art. There I did it!  I used the 'A' word and not lightly.  Brazil is an art film and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Sam LowryJonathan Pryce is our hero an unambitious bureaucrat within the ranks of the Ministry of Information.  The only place he is willing to be more than a drone is in his dreams where he is some sort of angelic knight fighting to save his dream girl.  While running an errand for work Sam comes face to face with a woman who is the very image of the dream girl and his life is forever changed when he surrenders his tranquil unambitious life in the attempt to pursue the woman.This movie is less about the story than it is about the atmosphere in my opinion.  Terry Gilliam is a visual genius and this movie marks his peakso far in producing a visually stunning film with due apologies to Adventures of Baron Munchausen and 12 Monkeys which are beautiful in their own rights.

	onyx:emotionText "I have read a lot of understandably negative reviews of the movie 'Brazil.' Brazilin its proper form is a long film at well over two hours it has many cutaways to dream sequences that are only loosely related to the rest of the film and the narrative story is not always the driving force of the film which many people find confusing.  With all these things going against it Brazil is clearly not a film for everyone.All that being said Brazil is my very favorite movie.  Those things previously described as reasons that some people will dislike the movie are the very reasons I love it.  The story is both simple and complex depending on how you look at it and this kind of paradox is what makes for great art. There I did it!  I used the 'A' word and not lightly.  Brazil is an art film and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Sam LowryJonathan Pryce is our hero an unambitious bureaucrat within the ranks of the Ministry of Information.  The only place he is willing to be more than a drone is in his dreams where he is some sort of angelic knight fighting to save his dream girl.  While running an errand for work Sam comes face to face with a woman who is the very image of the dream girl and his life is forever changed when he surrenders his tranquil unambitious life in the attempt to pursue the woman.This movie is less about the story than it is about the atmosphere in my opinion.  Terry Gilliam is a visual genius and this movie marks his peakso far in producing a visually stunning film with due apologies to Adventures of Baron Munchausen and 12 Monkeys which are beautiful in their own rights. The oppression of the bureaucratic life is felt by anyone who watches this film and the freedom experienced in the dreams is a fantastic counterpoint.

	schema:reviewBody "I really can't tell you how much my first viewing of this movie knocked me out. Nearly twenty years ago before Terry Gilliam's reputation is what it is today seeing this in a cinema without knowing ANYTHING about it it was one of the most unforgettable movie experiences of my life! Still is. I was a Python fan since childhood and well aware of Gilliam's animation work but nothing could prepare you for just how bizarre funny scary and disturbing 'Brazil' is. It's still one of the most original and inventive science fiction movies ever made with a surreal retro future quite unlike anything seen on a movie screen before or since. Gilliam mixes Python's anarchic intellectual humour with Orwell Kafka and Theatre Of The Absurd elements and comes up with something really special. John Sladek kinda sorta wrote some stories in a similar territory before this and Dean Motter has written some comics since but 'Brazil' is really in a world of its own! Jonathan Pryce was fairly obscure at the time and an odd choice to play the leading role but is perfectly cast and it's hard to think of an actor who would have been as convincing and sympathetic. The rest of the cast includes an amusing cameo from Robert De Niro Kim Greist only her second movie after 'C.H.U.D.' of all things! as Pryce's love interest Python's Michael Palin and a bunch of excellent Brit character actors  Bob Hoskins Ian Richardson Ian Holm Jim Broadbent etc.etc. It goes without saying that when I praise 'Brazil' I am ONLY referring to Gilliam's cut. This is still an utterly brilliant movie one of the very best of the last twentyfive years. I can't recommend this movie highly enough it is a masterpiece pure and simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "Regarding the symbolism in Brazil of course that's the point. Lowry's dreams are not all that unique. They are a result of the regimented world he lives in. Look at all of our modern films the two dominant characters are the rebel and the ordinary joe living a mundane life who somehow escapes from it or begins to do outrageous things.That's why I hated Titanic well partially. Rose is breaking out of her supposedly constricted life. It's propaganda. It makes it appear that the freedoms we have now are exactly what we need in order to escape from the restriction of prejudices and ignorance. Rose tied herself into the evergrowing straitjacket of modern political myths. But in order to glorify those myths Cameron had to denigrate our past and all that it stood for making its adherents look like chauvinistic fools. The person I know who liked Titanic the most liked it for that reason  she wanted to escape from her own life and envied Rose. But such people always stop there. They live in their fantasies and never stop to investigate why they feel their lives must be escaped from.Another note about the samurai he fights is that it continued to suddenly disappear. Lowry initially didn't know what he was fighting for one. There really is no definitive enemy to fight. We are boxing shadows. It is a system which has no heart or kill point. That's part of the frustration particularly for those who can't think abstractly. Most of them lash out at the media. They can't locate who they're fighting and so they accept the lies.Listen to the opening interview on the television. The terrorists are refusing to play the game. The assumption is that they are simply jealous because someone else is winning the game. Why play at all? Any hope of that is over though. The 60s was the last gasp of opposition and it got swallowed up. Now the nostalgia for protest is a marketing tool. Consumption is a replacement for thought. When you feel angst you go shopping. We've been convinced that our anxiety is caused by something other than what it really is. Commercials are not about selfgratification but selfdoubt.I read an interview with Gilliam in which he said the reason he could no longer live in America is that there was an unwillingness to think about anything. In the end you are fighting the conditioning you have received from your entire culture in essence fighting yourself and struggling to regain control of your own mind. Parallels between Lowry seeing his own face and Skywalker seeing the same in Return of the Jedi are illuminating.The point that Gilliam makes in the end is that the enemy is ubiquitous yet intangible. Lowry wanted to run from it go far away never realizing that you can't escape. We still think in terms of a locus of power. But Gilliam throughout the last part of the film continually crushed our naive hopes that somehow we can act out the fantasy that many of us may have to get away find the girl of our dreams and live in a trailer in a beautiful setting.Because we have no fear of physical control we assume that we are free. Some Americans still believe in the myth of rugged individualism. The system is built on lies and that's what Gilliam was showing. It's a State of mind. You can't escape. The only place that you can be free is in your head. He got away from us as they say at the end. That's really the only hope we have left.On a lighter note I derive so much glee from watching Lowry's mother walk around with a boot on her head.".

It posits a dark future world where the government has become a gigantic bureaucratic beast.  The simplest exchange requires mountains of paperwork and a strict adherence to procedures has replaced anyone's ability to critically think about what they are doing or stand up to the brutality they know lurks around them.  Sam Lowry is a man who seems more than happy to live as a cog in the giant machine.  When he sleeps however  he flies through beautiful blue skies towards the woman of his dreams.  As he attempts to correct an oversight by the Ministry Of Information for whom he works one of the more obvious nods to Orwell which has resulted in an innocent man's death  he finds a woman who appears to be the one in his dreams.  The line between his dreams and his reality blur ever further as he goes deeper and deeper into the government machine to find out who she is.Terry Gilliam once again seems to have spared no expense in making sure every visual element of the world adds up to a cohesive whole which makes you feel as if you're really experiencing the characters' surroundings. And of course  it is a world rendered realistically enough to feel feasible  and yet surrealistically enough to leave an unforgettable impression on you.Despite the simplicity of the main plot  the movie is full of subtexts and images which carry a message even though you may not see them on the first viewing.  In one scene  a man is buying clean air from a vending machine along the street.  The sides of the highways are walls of billboards which hide the barren environment beyond.  A group of people carry a banner that announces Consumers for Christ in a store decorated for the holidays as a small child tells Santa she wants a credit card for Christmas.  Actually therein lies one of the things that may turn some people off to this movie. It seems Gilliam had so many things to say about the state of society today that some people may find the movie lacks a coherent message once it's done. The ending will no doubt come as a shock to many people as well  but it was refreshing to me to see something well outside the Hollywood conventions for a change.My only real complaint was that Robert De Niro's character was so enjoyable but saw so little use.  Other than that  however  I thought it was a film which presents some compelling things which deserve serious thought  even though most people probably won't be able to get past the trademark Gilliam visual quirkiness to see what he is saying.  Eight and a half out of ten from me.".

His Brazil features homages to numerous other films ranging from Modern Times to The Empire Strikes Back and its plot is broadly similar to Nineteen EightyFour. Yet the result is intriguingly fresh and creative.The best adjective to describe the movie's tone is whimsical. It's the type of scifi film with an almost childlike fascination with strange sights and happenings. Rarely has a film so pessimistic been this much fun. Many scifi films since Brazil have attempted a similar approach usually with little success. The chief problem with most such films e.g. The Fifth Element is that they get bogged down in plot at the expense of emotional resonance. Brazil avoids this fate while the movie possesses psychological and thematic complexity its plot is fairly simple and the humor quirky as it is never relies on throwaway gags. Even the oddest moments have a certain poignance.The story seems to take place in a fascist alternative world. It isn't the future exactly. The technology is weirdlooking but hardly superior to anything in our world. Money transactions are sent through pipes in what looks sort of like a crude version of ATM. One of the film's several nods to silent movies occurs after a character tries to stuff one of these pipes with wads of paper. The pop culture references are positively retro from the title song to scenes from the film Casablanca.The evil of the government in this film is driven not so much by cruelty as by bureaucratic incompetence much of which is played for laughs. But some of the scenes look eerie today in our post911 world and are good fodder for conspiracy theorists. Pay particular attention to the scene where the official boasts that the government is winning its war against the terrorists. The movie is ambiguous as to whether there are any real terrorists and we have a sneaking suspicion that the explosions are caused by the government itself. The plot is set in motion by a typographical error leading an innocent man to be arrested instead of a suspected terrorist. The movie is not about this man but about a meek government worker Sam Lowry Jonathan Pryce who's observing from the sidelines. Robert De Niro has a cameo as the wanted terrorist whose crime from what we see consists of doing home repairs without the proper paperwork.I have noticed that most of the classic dystopian tales are fundamentally similar to one another. But Brazil approaches the genre in a uniquely psychological way. Sam Lowry is different from the standard protagonist who rebels against the government due to noble motives. He doesn't seem to have any larger goals than his own personal ones. He isn't trying to make the world a better place. He's only longing for a better life for himself one more exciting and romantic than the humdrum existence he currently occupies where he's beset by an overbearing mother a pitiful boss and a dull job. In the midst of this bureaucratic nightmare state he cares only about such matters as getting his air conditioning fixed and stalking a female stranger who physically resembles his fantasy womanor so he perceives. The woman as played by Kim Greist appears in his fantasies as a helpless damsel with long flowing hair and a silky dress who sits in a cage while he battles a giant Samurai warrior. The reallife woman he pursues also played by Greist sports a butch haircut drives a large truck and has a cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth.It's a testament to Pryce's performance that he commands our total sympathy the whole time. We feel for him and go along with the romantic adventure he attempts to create for himself. His nervous stammering personality is one that would have been easy to overdo yet Pryce strikes just the right note especially as we begin questioning the character's sanity. At one point another character tells him that You're paranoid you've got no sense of reality. But who wouldn't be paranoid in such a setting? The scene brings to mind the old joke that goes You're not paranoid. Everyone really is out to get you. The movie inhabits such a whacky surreal world full of strange people and sights that Sam Lowry almost seems sensible by comparison. Creating a character like this was a fresh innovative twist on a genre that normally loses sight of human personalities.".

The movie deals with a computer error that causes havoc for the protagonist Sam Lowry.  Sam Lowry is someone who dreams of living as an individual away from the system of Big Brother.  The movie is heavily influenced by George Orwell's classic novel 1984.  Brazil1985 is the closest thing to a perfect adaptation of 1984 for the big screen.Brazil1985 is more well known for what happened behind the scenes than anything that happens in the film.  There was a bitter battle between the director and producer that ended up in the cutting of the film much to Terry Gilliam's disapproval.  As a result there are three cuts of the filmdirector studio TV.  I've seen both the 142Minute and 132Minute version.  In my opinion the 142Minute edition is the definite one to watch.Jonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry does a great act in showing someone who is imprisoned by the system.  Robert De Niro plays Sam Lowry's alter ego Harry Tuttle in an eccentric role for the actor.  At first De Niro wanted the role of Sam's best friend but instead got the role of the spy Harry Tuttle.  The film retains the forbidden love affair between Sam Lowry and Jill Layton that is an important element in 1984.  A lot of scens that involved Kim Griest were cut due to the dissatifaction of her performance from the director.Brazil1985 is Terry Gilliam's masterwork and a well directed piece by the filmmaker himself.  The set designs are dazzling and the depiction of city life is nothing short of amazing.  The title song is one of the most famous tunes.  Much better then 12 Monkeys1996 because this is a more complete film.  Brazil1985 is part of a trilogy that includes Time Bandits1981 and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen1988.This trilogy is really about the progression of life that begins in Childhood continues in Middleage and ends with Old age.  Brazil1985 is really about the uncertainties of middleage.  The samurai dream sequences are a marvalous example of the symbolisms they provide for the movie.  Bob Hoskins gives a dark humorous act as a government plumber.  The dream sequences with Sam Lowry and his dream girl are beautifully romantic.".

The movie has a very complex sequence of events which require more than one viewing for full understanding. In fact the first time i saw Brazil i didn't enjoy it much. But then i gave it a second chance and the pleasure of watching it increased exponentially. The more I watch it the more I discover hidden aspects and new ways to interpret this masterful creation. The scenario is extraordinary mixing long pipe lines and a almost omnipresent Gothic atmosphere. If you didn't like the movie the first time you saw it don't be by any means discouraged. This movie requires patience and an active role from the viewer. Finally Brazil deserves special praise for all the dreamlike sequences of the main character and the music fits in perfectly well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' is one heck of a film. A weird twisted fantastical tale of the sheer absurdity of an Orwellian society the films draws inspiration from a lengthy series of sciencefiction and dystopian novels and films  including Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis 1927' Ray Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451 or Franois Truffaut's 1966 adaptation' Franz Kafka's 'The Trial or Orson Welles' 1962 adaptation' Anthony Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' or Kubrick's 1971 adaptation and more than anything else George Orwell's 'Nineteen EightyFour' adapted just one year earlier by Michael Radford. Masterfully blending the horror of this misguided totalitarian government with Gilliam's gloriously absurd brand of Monty Pythonesquire humour 'Brazil' depicts the absolute folly of the direction in which our society is heading.Whilst 'Nineteen EightyFour' showed us a frighteningly effective police state in which evildoers are brought to swift and inharmonious justice 'Brazil's' equally formidable Ministry of Information doesn't even work properly. At the very beginning of the film when the carcass of a swatted insect falls into a typewriter the machine mistakenly issues an arrest warrant for a Mr. BUTTLE rather than the suspected terrorist Mr. TUTTLE. The result of this minor bureaucratic foulup will be the deathbytorture of the completely innocent Mr. Buttle the degradation of his unfortunate family and the precipitation of the events of the film featuring mildmannered unambitious dreamobsessed urban worker Sam Lowry Jonathan Pryce.We first meet Sam Lowry in his own dreams as a silverwinged birdlike mythical creature soaring through the open air free from the constraints of the fascist government that would later destroy his life. He seeks out his dream girl Kim Greist who calls his name softly from beneath a thin floating veil. This is the first of several mythic dream sequences full of idealistic notions of love happiness and freedom though the restrictive power of the Ministry of Information's totalitarian regime threatens on more than one occasion to rob him Sam of the only moments of happiness he can experience within his own mind. In one compelling later dream sequence Sam must battle to rescue his beloved dreamgirl from an immense monolithic like samuraimachine which might be interpreted to represent the allpowerful technology of the Ministry of Information. When he discovers his own face behind the monster's mask it is symbolic of Sam's own willingness to take part in such a regime.In his real life Sam Lowry is a fairly dependable but decidedly unmotivated computer worker at the Department of Records. His jittery boss Mr. M. Kurtzmann Ian Holm relies entirely on Sam to get him out of occasional tight spots and fails to notice that his seemingly hardworking employees are switching their computer monitors to the day's classic movie screening as soon as his back is turned. Despite the pressure from his influential plastic surgeryobsessed mother Katherine Helmond Sam has absolutely no desire to be promoted to the Ministry of Information until that is he spots his dreamgirl in real life  named Jill Layton  and desires to learn as much about her as possible. Sam is shocked to learn that Jill is considered a potential terrorist in league with the elusive heaterengineer terrorist Harry Tuttle Robert De Niro and so he sets out to protect her from a grisly fate.'Brazil' is a visually magnificent film brimming with unparalleled production design by Norman Garwood set direction John Beard Keith Pain and costume design James Acheson. Roger Pratt's inventive cinematography beautifully captures a dark and menacing society that at times descends steeply into complete surrealism. The film's enigmatic title refers to Ary Barroso's catchy South American song 'Aquarela do Brasil Watercolour of Brazil' which is a theme used frequently throughout the film most noticeably during Sam's dream sequences. The opening lyrics of the song go as follows Brazil  Where hearts were entertaining June  We stood beneath an amber moon  And softly murmured 'someday soon'  We kissed and clung together  Then tomorrow was another day  The morning found me miles away  With still a million things to say. Perhaps the film's title 'Brazil' refers to this eternal place of bliss and happiness a seemingly unreachable place under the brutal dictatorship of society.While the film certainly borrows ideas from a varied assortment of previous works 'Brazil' is simply unlike anything you have ever seen before. Simultaneously it is a stern condemnation of fascism and a lighthearted hilariouslyabsurd satire of government. The ending to the film is particularly powerful with Gilliam offering us a typical happilyeverafter ending and then yanking it away in the final seconds. After all in such a dystopian society a happy ending is not only unlikely but it is damn near impossible. Curiously Sam does eventually find his happiness but it comes at the cost of his own sanity and he starts to absentmindedly hum the title tune as his torturers depart and the credits begin to roll. Could this possibly be construed as a happy ending? It's definitely unlike any other that I've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an edited version of the review I wrote for Brazil on the site where I recently bought the 132 minute singledisc bluray verson of the movie For those who don't know the history of this movie  there are at least three different versions. It was originally released in Europe as a nearly two and half hour long film. The studio that financed it didn't like that version because it A. was too long B. was too uncommercial and C. had a dark depressing ending. The contract they had with Gilliam stipulated that the movie had to be less than 2 hours and 15 minutes so it could have multiple primetime showings in theaters. They suggested he cut the ending.Gilliam refused so the studio took it upon themselves to create the Love Conquers All version which chopped out almost an hour of footage  they only kept the parts that showed the main character Sam in a heroic light anything that contributed to the SamJill love story and anything that featured Robert DiNero. And of course the ending was changed to a happy ending by removing the final scene. Also to make the plot easier to follow they used some alternate takes some deleted footage and hired voice actors to overdub dialog.Unsurprisingly Gilliam didn't want that version released so he finally edited the movie down to 2 hours and 12 minutes kept the dark ending and made a few other minor changes and the studio was contractually obligated to release that version to theaters in the United States.It's the US version that appears on the standalone bluray the other versions are available on a Criterion 3disc set. I'm happy to have the bluray version because it's the first time I've seen the US edit since originally seeing the film in a theater on a college campus shortly after it first came out.I can't really write an unbiased review of the movie because from that first viewing I became obsessed with both Brazil and Terry Gilliam's films in general. I bought all his movies on VHS as soon as they came out and eventually replaced them with DVDs. I bought the Criterion Final Cut version of Brazil as soon as it came out.It's one of those films you'll either love or hate. If you mostly go for typical Hollywood blockbusters then you'll probably fall in the hate camp. However if you like artistic movies that make you think a bit this one's for you. Its alternatereality retrofuturistic look makes it seem nearly as fresh and amazing today as it did when it first came out. And the background plot of a bloated government bureaucracy turning the country into a surveillance state in response to a perceived terrorist threat  I know it was based on things happening in England at the time but it's like Gilliam had a crystal ball and looked 20 years into the United States' future. The alternating between reality and dream sequences and the general Gilliam quirkiness will probably put a lot of people off but it's what drew me to this movie in the first place.If you become fanatical about the movie like I am you'll need both the US version and the Criterion release. To fully experience the film you need to see every version even the Love Conquers All version because each one includes bits that aren't in any of the others. And technically Brazil is a Christmas movie so be sure to watch it during the holidays with your loved ones.If you do decide to watch Brazil and find that you like it give some of Gilliam's more recent movies a try like The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassis and The Zero Theorem. Really if you like odd outofthemainstream movies that you'll be thinking about for days after you see them you can't go wrong with pretty much any Terry Gilliam film.On the other hand if you hated this one best steer clear of Gilliam entirely.".

Today in our society that is scared into semiparalysis by the threat of terrorists and the overly oppressive response of our own government this movie is more relevant than ever. If yoy pay attention you may actually walk away from this movie with a profound sense of understanding. Most everyone I have recommended this movie to has been deeply moved in some way by it.

The bleak world that we see is truly bizarre and visually astonishing by representing a domineering world run by an unfair bureaucracy and technology that has gone chaotic because of obsession daily routines and power. Its a materialistic society thats filled with unfair rules and regulations. The special effects are spellbinding with the gizmos and gadgets that flow through the film. The engaging screenplay is excellent in representing the disturbing life style of this future and the script filled with sharp satire and amusing black humour and wit. The set and art direction is nothing but breathtaking while the plot might have it's flaws but the superb detail and imagination that went into it you just glaze over it.

The story has it's tense mysterious and macabre moments that seem to gel perfectly while the dream sequences that Sam has were simply splendid and very hypnotic and the same goes for the haunting music score that spirals with emotion.The performances were good and quite colourful but nothing really spectacular Jonathan Pryce is charming as the love struck Sam Kim Greist is elegantly mysterious as Jill Layton the girl Sam's after Robert De Niro as a chirpy plumberterrorist Tuttle Bob Hospkins as Spoor the repair man Katherine Helmond as the obsessive mother of Sam Mrs. Ida Lowry and Ian Holm as the twitchy Mr. M.

But 'Brazil' was surely his magnum opus.His work entails more than a shade of Python naturally hints of Roald Dahl and something else uniquely him.Brazil is astonishing. It's almost a take on 1984 with a pretty ineffectual hero standingin for equally ineffectual Winston Smith. He is an honest and diligent man who discovers a foulup which he tries to put right only for things to go disastrously wrong. In time he finds himself fighting the system and pursuing a rebellious young woman truck driver Orwell's 'Julia'. As the movie progresses we are led through a series of tableaux which leave us wondering just how much of what we see is actually in the real world and how much is the hero's deluded imagination. For those who like neat little denouements it can be a disappointment. The best thing I think is to just go along for the ride.That ride takes us through some great parodies of the present. We have setpiece monolithic ministries with incomprehensible bureaucracy. There are legions of dangerously dumb guards a ruined environment that is boardedout of view by idealised advertisements and much more. There are also some great characters played very believably by an equally great cast. Small visual Pythonesque gags popup all along the way. Rich old women desperately trying to stay young cramped little offices were desk space is fought over unreliable technology and Kafkaesquire confusion. The sniffing machine that got a little too intimate was one of many little touches that had me laughing out loud.You can get lost in this movie. And perhaps that's what Gilliam intended. Whatever it is it's a piece of unique theatre that does what it does extremely well. You just may not enjoy it. A bit like Dali's cloth watch.".

	schema:headline " Astonishing concept always stimulating to watch but ultimately bites off more than it can chew.";
	schema:reviewBody "Terry Gilliam is in dark subversive mood with this Orwellian fantasy. While the film has extraordinary futuristic sets appropriately offthewall performances and more ingenious ideas than you usually find in a dozen other movies put together it still has its share of flaws. For one thing there seems to be too much going on for the eye and ear to fully absorb. Not that I mind watching movies which demand the concentration of the viewer  in fact I rather like films that are challenging and thoughtprovoking  but Brazil is extraordinarily hard to follow even for those who give it the level of attention it demands. Perhaps it's one of those films best treated as an experience more than a narrative. Also its extreme length is a drawback as the film passes the two hour mark one begins to fidget a little with discomfort.In a futuristic state bureaucracy has literally gone mad and people have lost their identity working in bleak absurdly formalised offices where they spend practically the whole day carrying out monotonous paperwork. Sam Lowry Jonathan Pryce works in the Records Office under the preposterously fussy eye of Mr Kurtzmann Ian Holm. Lowry survives day after day of uninterrupted boredom by daydreaming of himself as a winged superhero protecting the world from various villains and monsters and wooing a gorgeous blonde woman Kim Greist. Due to a printing error an arrest warrant is issued for a lawabiding citizen named Mr Buttle the real warrant is intended for a heatingengineerturnedterrorist named Tuttle played with surprising comic flair by Robert De Niro. Buttle is duly arrested and tortured to death but his neighbour Jill Leyton Griest again is determined to clear the name of the wronged Mr Buttle which she does by relentlessly pestering the various agencies involved in the mixup. When Sam realises that the blonde beauty of his dreams actually exists and that the authorities are out to silence her he breaks away from his deskbound existence and tries to assume the heroic role he has so often dreamed of in a doomed effort to protect her.Brazil is a dazzling film on many levels especially in its depiction of a frightening society where the hours spent sleeping and dreaming are infinitely more desirable than the depressing waking hours. Gilliam seems to be suggesting that his invented world is the culmination of every social mistake in history from the McCarthy era witchhunts to Stalinism. It is certainly one of the bleakest and most damning visions of the future ever put on film. Pryce carries the film excellently as the everquestioning everimaginative hero in a society where everyone else has forgotten how to question and imagine. Griest is terrific as the girl of his dreams whose real self turns out to be tougher and more resourceful than he could dare believe and De Niro's small role as the dashing saboteur is very amusingly played. Brazil is not for all tastes and resolutely demands several reviewings in order to take it all in but it still stands as encouraging evidence that creativity and originality lurk in the shadows of post'70s cinema. I give it a 7 from my personal viewpoint but a 9.5 for its cult potential.".

And having a problem with Terry Gilliam and watching this film is kind of like eating something you're allergic to. The reaction is instant because this movie is just so much Terry Gilliam.The word that i usually drift towards when watching one of his works is absurd. It seems to me that the feeling of absurdity is what he always aims at. Usually he also hits his target. The question though is if this makes his movies good or not. Of course things are not that simple. It's always possible to admire or appreciate something without actually liking or enjoying it. That being said i can't really say i've ever enjoyed one of Gilliams films i came closest with Twelve Monkeys but i have admired a couple of them for their undeniable originality and intelligence.Brazil was difficult for me. The Orwellian world in which it takes place is a very dominating factor in the movie. Although i perceived it to be about humanity as are most such sad visions of the future the humans here really take a backseat. The setting this future world is grand and painstakingly overworked. From the smallest hissing pipe to the greatest open space there is an attention to detail that speaks volumes about both vision and lack of budget restraints. Of course today the future in Brazil seems irreparably old and dated but that is almost always the case with sciencefiction and visions of the future and it didn't bother me.What did bother me however was that i didn't really know how to follow the storyline in Brazil. Of course one might say that the storyline was not the point here and you might be right but i find that to be a problem in and of itself. Characters enter from the side without good explanations things happen that i understood very little about and of course dream sequences were added and spliced in a way that sometimes made it difficult to know what was reality or dream. Probably that was also something deliberate.In the end i think that me and Mr. Gilliam simply don't mix. His brand of very black comedy just doesn't strike the right note with me. It's absurd to the point where i don't know how to react. And here we have two hours of disjointed storyline and bizarre events that sometimes seem to have very little to do with each other. It's not the kind of black comedy you laugh at and at the same time it didn't feel heartfelt in any real way. An impressive display of vision and budget no doubt and with a surprisingly good ending of course i count on understanding the story enough to judge but lacking something to keep it all together.".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one put a Monty Python twist on a dystopianOrwellian whichever term you prefer sciencefiction fantasy? The answer might not be clear but as long as Terry Gilliam knows it it can be done. The Monty Python and the Holy Grail director begins his career of daring realitybending films with Brazil maybe his greatest or if not most signature film.Named after the iconic song Brazil is a quirkyspirited and outlandish futuristic film that operates subtly and with peculiarity as only Gilliam would have it. Unlike the more popular dystopian films of today you can't rely on themeheavy dialogue to understand Gilliam's warning to society you have to sit and absorb the bizarre imagery seemingly irrelevant dream sequences and comic downplay of dramatic events. Once you understand why it's there and stop worrying about exactly what it means the genius becomes clearer.The film stars Jonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry an unambitious bureaucrat who works for the Ministry of Information in a very mechanical society with an extensive yet inefficient process for bringing criminals namely terrorists to justice. Therefore a small printing error leads to the unlawful arrest and death of Archibald Buttle not Archibald 'T'uttle. Lowry must investigate the error and in the process comes across a woman Kim Greist whom he recognizes from his dreams where he's soaring in the air with wings toward a beautiful woman in white robes. He decides to pursue this woman and it leads him down a dangerous path.Gilliam introduces us to this society by showing its excessive yet seemingly unreliable technology. Sam's air conditioning breaks down gourmet food is needlessly ground into globs and everything has a large and obtrusive cord attached to it. All this seems strange because its on the periphery of what's happening to Sam so it can easily be dismissed as excessive detail. On the contrary it's what quietly makes this Gilliam's masterpiece.The more human story is in Sam's pursuit of this dream in reality a dangerous feat. Claiming early in the film that he wants nothing for himself this woman is the only exception. He pursues it relentlessly and it costs him. As completely absurd as some of the events occurring to him appear to be these trippy sequences ultimately test his character despite their strange tactics.Icing all this is the quirky Monty Python style. It's not the humor that lends itself to the film but sort of the spirit of Monty Python. Even Michael Palin plays a small role to sort of perpetuate this feeling. Since everything goes mostly unexplained this humor compounds the oddities of the film poking fun at the excessiveness whether it be Sam's mother's face lifts and same surgeries that slowly kill her friend or playing up the dialogue between Sam and other characters such as Tuttle De Niro in the midst of an abnormal scenario.Brazil might not be a sciencefiction film for everyone but it deserves classic status for lovers of the genre. It's just very untypical in its delivery going for a hallucinogenic and more discomforting style of filmmaking that Terry Gilliam has made a name for himself on. It won't appease the average viewer who demands more direct service between himherself and the creative mind behind the film but it will offer a lot to ponder to those who like partaking in that when the credits role.Steven CVisit my site httpmoviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been thinking about what should be the name of my review's summary but I'm not going to invent bicycle here because Matserpiece is still the most appropriate word to describe Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Many times in my life I have encountered people who've never been able to understand this film. Actually I almost never argued because it's certainly different kind of moviemaking. Different view. And it's not for everyone. I recently purchased the collector's DVD box and was stunned once again by the level of Gilliam's visual aesthetics. I've had pleasure seeing only one of his films in cinema  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  and it's a big pity because Brazil is certainly worth it too. But behind the perfect visual picture there's much more. And this is something that can't be seen by those people who don't understand the film because they aren't able to correlate the exterior look and it's inner contents. Often compared to other geniuses of surrealism like Luis Bunuel Marco Ferreri David Lynch and even Federico Fellini Gilliam continues tradition of brilliant and stunning imagery while also attempting to express the workings of the subconscious. But Gilliam's touch adds new lines to the cinema of sur extending it with amazing Pythonstyle sense of humour. Actually surrealism in my opinion is impossible without the thin humour and it maybe makes Gilliam the last great cinema surrealists of the XXth century. Before purchasing DVD last time I've seen Brazil was about 5 years ago and thought that I've remembered it very clear. But when I rewatched it it's been quite different experience. There's something in this film that makes possible reviewing it multiple times and find new details and plot treats. In general it's a unique dystopian avantgarde that can't be compared to anything else. Unitary sample as they say.".

I have watched it many times since that initial viewing and Brazil never fails to impress me on some level with its dark humor its light humor its message of unswerving optimism or its message of unforgiving fatalism.I have tried to impress others with the depth and breadth of this film with varying success but have concluded it's something others just have to discover for themselves.

Moments of genuine chilling emotion are juxtaposed with the darkest comedy to make them if anything even more potent.And yet the plot forms nothing but the merest of bones to the Brazil experience and it is an experience.

But that's about it.Brazil is truly an astounding work and a mustsee not just for lovers of scifi or cinema  it's an indulgent plush epic a treat for the senses that stimulates on many levels.

	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.This strange and original work is a French film about Nazi Germany done in English. There are no subtitles. Director Volker Schlondorff is German the screenplay is by veteran French writer JeanClaudeCarriere who has scores of films to his credit including Bell de Jour 1967 and Valmont 1989 and the star is the American John Malkovich who plays a French simpleton named Abel Tiffauges who ends up as a servant in Field Marshall Herman Goering's hunting estate during World War II and then later in a Hitler youth academy for boys.Malkovich's Abel is enormously sympathetic because he has suffered but harbors no bitterness because he genuinely loves children and because he has a certain magic about him based on his childish belief that somehow he will survive any catastrophe. In a boy's home as a child he survives the brutality of a proto Goeringlike fat boy and then later as an auto mechanic he overcomes a false accusation of child molestation. Both of these little stories are vividly rendered and seem entirely realistic. Then begins Abel's war time adventures and it is here that the story becomes as some have observed something of a fairy tale. Abel is able to leave his barracks at the prison to wander about where he meets a blind moose and then a German army officer at a deserted cabin in the woods. This leads to his being established at Goering's hunting estate and from there to the Hitler youth academy where he is treated as a privileged servant. We see the Nazis as just another part of the bizarre personages of his world.The depiction of Goering as a kind of selfindulgent Nero living in opulence as the world burns seemed entirely believable.

	onyx:emotionText "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.This strange and original work is a French film about Nazi Germany done in English. There are no subtitles. Director Volker Schlondorff is German the screenplay is by veteran French writer JeanClaudeCarriere who has scores of films to his credit including Bell de Jour 1967 and Valmont 1989 and the star is the American John Malkovich who plays a French simpleton named Abel Tiffauges who ends up as a servant in Field Marshall Herman Goering's hunting estate during World War II and then later in a Hitler youth academy for boys.Malkovich's Abel is enormously sympathetic because he has suffered but harbors no bitterness because he genuinely loves children and because he has a certain magic about him based on his childish belief that somehow he will survive any catastrophe. In a boy's home as a child he survives the brutality of a proto Goeringlike fat boy and then later as an auto mechanic he overcomes a false accusation of child molestation. Both of these little stories are vividly rendered and seem entirely realistic. Then begins Abel's war time adventures and it is here that the story becomes as some have observed something of a fairy tale. Abel is able to leave his barracks at the prison to wander about where he meets a blind moose and then a German army officer at a deserted cabin in the woods. This leads to his being established at Goering's hunting estate and from there to the Hitler youth academy where he is treated as a privileged servant. We see the Nazis as just another part of the bizarre personages of his world.The depiction of Goering as a kind of selfindulgent Nero living in opulence as the world burns seemed entirely believable. The overall portrait of the Germans in an objective and balanced manner was refreshing and thoughtprovoking and one of the strengths of the film. The Nazi eugenicist is contrasted with the officer who was part of a failed plot against Hitler both men enormously sincere and dedicated the one unbalanced the other unlucky.This is not a film for those looking primarily to be entertained.

	schema:reviewBody "This 1996 film which was not released in the U.S. until 2000 in the rental market offers a fresh German perspective of World War II.  It puts a more human face on the people of the Third Reich much in the same way as Das Boot'.  We are used to depictions of German soldiers as brutally evil soulless killing machines and there is a bit of that here but this film mostly presents a softer more balanced portrayal.  This is the story of Abel an affable simpleton from France with a love of children and animals no there are no undertones of pedophilia.  Prior to WWII he is wrongly accused and convicted of child molestation.  While working in the work camps he is captured by the Germans and through a series of events ends up as a prisoner of war worker in a training school for Hitler youth.  He is emotionally seduced by the romantic notions of Hitler's national socialism and the great devotion to the fatherland that is being taught there.  And of course he loves working with the boys.  The Germans notice this and how much the boys like him as well so they ask him to recruit more boys for the school from the local countryside.  Things go along well until the Russians invade and the only defense of the school must be made by the students who are well trained in the art of war.This is a terrific story that gives us a more realistic look inside Germany during the war.  No it wasn't an idyllic free society.  But it wasn't exactly a factory for mechanized inhuman killers as it has been routinely portrayed either.  We come to understand that what we considered evil was being presented to the children in terms that seemed good and noble.  They felt as if they were on an idealistic quest not on a diabolical mission of subjugation.The direction of this film was expertly done.  Volker Schlondorff's presentation of the story though slow moving at times offered an excellent character study of Abel and was patient in proffering revealing looks at the people and the feelings of those around him.Malkovich is fantastic as the nave and slow witted Abel.  He is wonderfully childlike and sincere in his portrayal reminiscent of his role in Of Mice and Men'.  This is the best I can remember him in quite some time.This is a poignant and compelling film of substance.  I rate it a 910.  The sophisticated viewer will enjoy it.".

This complaint sounded plausible but a glance in Encyclopedia Britannica reassures our confidence in the production's respect for authenticity. It suggests that Volker Spengler's characterization may be on the mark.During Hitler's Putsch in 1923 Goring sustained a painful injury whose relief by means of morphine turned him into a drug addict nearly the rest of his life. This influence in turn made him alternately elated or depressed he was egocentric and bombastic delighting in flamboyant clothes and uniforms decorations and exhibitionist jewelry. We see all these traits in Spengler's scenes e.g. in his drunken alternation between a tirade and a blue funk at the fact that someone else had shot a stag that he wanted to shoot. When a soldier enters to bring him some really bad news Goring is already so gloomy that he barely raises his hand from the table to salute and his Heil Hitler is just a slurred grunt.The article also establishes his corpulence and luxuriousness to a point resented by his colleagues in the party. His hunting interests enabled him to obtain a vast forest estate in the Schorfheide north of Berlin where from 1933 he developed a great baronial establishment called Carinhall full of artistic war booty to which he retired whenever he could.The film showed Goring as an often jovial man given like Hitler to occasional fits of imperious screaming. This behavior according to one book I read recently was to be expected of any top leader of the Third Reich not merely as a habit but as a deliberate technique. People outside of Germany were slow to take Hitler seriously as a threat because this conduct was so strange to them. They did not realize that German culture of the time regarded it as a standard part of the fatherly role. Therefore as Hitler understood well the more he screamed and shouted at his countrymen the more closely they would identify him as a father figure and the embodiment of Der Vaterland.Many superstitious beliefs have been associated with precious stones. The novel explains that Goring was not unique in imagining that plunging his fingers into a bowl of gems would drain away nervous energy and uncomfortable emotions. Other sources recount that when Hugo von Hofmannsthal's first poems appeared under a pseudonym they were so heavy with sensuous Weltschmerz that one critic declared they must have been written by an opulent old man while dipping his fingers in jewels. He would soon be surprised that the poet was still a youth. So even this strange indulgence of Goring is in keeping with the ambient culture among those few who could afford the experience.One could say much much more about this complex film but perhaps this elucidation of just one minor aspect suggests the multilayered care with which it has been put together.".

Abel's only joy comes from tending to protecting and helping children a love that many in the film mistake for paedophilia.Pretty soon Abel finds himself working for the Nazis firstly at Hermann Goering's hunting lodge and later at Kaltenborn Castle an elite training camp for Hitler Youths. At both locations Abel's fawning attitude toward children epitomises Nazi delirium. Nazism like Abel's whole being is a pathology bent upon preserving and protecting a certain chosen people. It's an ethnic pathology which mirrors Abel's own drive to photograph and preserve a very specific idealised view of youth and beauty. What the film stresses is how both stances operate in a cloistered secluded realm in which the distinctions between the internal and the external world no longer hold both Abel and Nazism creating fantasy fairytale narratives for themselves and their believers. In this regard everything Abel does though benevolent and altruistic in his mind leads to great violence. And so Abel like the film's Nazis is mild mannered has little insight into his nature lives in a fantasy world always defers to authority does not believe he is hurting anyone and yet causes great harm. This Nazi pathology the desire to not see a form of disavowal that is hardwired into the very structure of modern life is still very much a part of our modern or postmodern world.The film ends with Abel rescuing a Jewish child. For Abel love is by definition always neverending and always excessive he loves all children. This brings him in conflict with Nazi ideology which of course demands that he kill the boy. This contradiction leads to Abel betraying his masters during the film's climax and subsequently wading off into the sunset with the Jewish boy on his shoulders. Hauntingly the duo think that they're protecting each other with magical powers. They are now each other's chosen one a stance which itself now foreshadows contemporary politics protecting the Jew to protect oneself protecting Israel to protect America.Aesthetically like Schlondorff's earlier film The Tin Drum The Ogre takes the shape and tone of a dark grisly fairy tale. Some passages recall both Goethe and the Brothers Grimm and a hunting sequence Renoir's The Rules of the Game though Schlondorff tones down his customary surrealism and removes all sexual subplots present in the original tale his eyes now on the more direct tastes of mass market global ie Western audiences.810  Ranges from great to watered down and very poor but Malkovich sucks us in.

	schema:reviewBody "Through the eyes of a French man who never grew up The Ogre depicts wartime life in Hitler's Germany.  At the same time that the film takes up loaded questions of power and subjugation recreating the process of recruitment and training for the Aryan army it further challenges the viewer by presenting the growing Nazi regime in a very human way.  A great deal of the variety in characterization and the breadth of reach can be attributed to the fairytale nature of this film.  By introducing the character Abel as a troubled and weak youth the film is able to trace his life's events under the spell of Fate.'  And indeed Abel is sheltered and provided for throughout the course of events even when faced with the most irrational of men. In film characters are arguably always proponents of a few key traits around which a believable person is constructed.  In a fairytale this is true to a greater extent.  So of course a combination of the two leads to a meeting of quite extreme characters.  In The Ogre we are presented with a man who cares so much for children and animals that he is unable to see any evil in their presence.  This oversight or in the heavyhanded symbolism of the film blindness is the basic motivation behind all events.A great deal of the film is artfully done with many subtle displacements to stimulate emotions in the viewer.  Although the oftmentioned 'front line' is never seen instead we are faced with the massacre of hundreds of wild animals.

	onyx:emotionText "Through the eyes of a French man who never grew up The Ogre depicts wartime life in Hitler's Germany.  At the same time that the film takes up loaded questions of power and subjugation recreating the process of recruitment and training for the Aryan army it further challenges the viewer by presenting the growing Nazi regime in a very human way.  A great deal of the variety in characterization and the breadth of reach can be attributed to the fairytale nature of this film.  By introducing the character Abel as a troubled and weak youth the film is able to trace his life's events under the spell of Fate.'  And indeed Abel is sheltered and provided for throughout the course of events even when faced with the most irrational of men. In film characters are arguably always proponents of a few key traits around which a believable person is constructed.  In a fairytale this is true to a greater extent.  So of course a combination of the two leads to a meeting of quite extreme characters.  In The Ogre we are presented with a man who cares so much for children and animals that he is unable to see any evil in their presence.  This oversight or in the heavyhanded symbolism of the film blindness is the basic motivation behind all events.A great deal of the film is artfully done with many subtle displacements to stimulate emotions in the viewer.  Although the oftmentioned 'front line' is never seen instead we are faced with the massacre of hundreds of wild animals.  The childhood friend of Abel returns to him in the form of the military official in the forest and yet Abel does not make a connection beyond a vague similarity.

	schema:reviewBody "Tournier is among the great French writers of the latter 20th century maybe the only one living competitive enough for the Nobel prize. The movie is however rather unsatisfactory even if Malcovich does a good job. The reason for the lameness of the production is that the director never dared to explore more fully the darker side of Tiffauges to make it clear why people were afraid of him why he could not build friendships and so on. Apparently the producers were afraid that if they made the main character more graphic this would really turn him into a pedophile and alienate the viewer. Here is the big hitch in putting great books on screen. In cinema characters most often end up gaining the sympathy of viewers. So in view of making the character likable and keeping hope alive that one day he would be able to survive his obsessive manias the screenwriter and the director deliberately twisted the end. In the movie Abel turned into a real Christopher carrying the childJesus a Jewish refugee from a concentration camp as a sign of his Christian redemption but... in the book Tiffauges does not survive the crossing of the Mazurian swamps on the contrary he deliberately drowns together with the young boy in a tragic culmination of his unending obsession with young children. This is why the original title of the book is Le roi des aulnes the elvenking from Goethe's dark poem. Even if I greatly admired the book I long suspected Tournier to have been carried too far away in his creative search up to the point of inventing a kind of mania which does not belong to the list of pathological states. Such nonsexual pedophiles obsessed with children but harmless and protective do they exist? Are there really people who want to protect children from growing up?".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the tenure of Western Metaphysics conceptions of History have for the most part followed logical and foundationally epistemological models.  The causally linear chain of historical events has at its inception a causa sui which in turn results in a progression of events much like the links in a chaina conception that postmodernists have at the very least challenged. Volker Schlndorff also challenges or at a minimum complicates the metaphysical heritage of history in his film The Ogre. Schlndorff foregrounds the importance of history by setting his narrative during the TwentiethCentury's most seminal moment World War Two.His criticism however filters through his miseenscene.  Throughout The Ogre monuments of historically influential figures or symbols make their presencei.e. Jesus cathedrals the swastika aristocrats etc.  And the film is replete with very dominant straight lines.  But Schlndorff subverts the dominance of these straight lines on several occasions.  When Abel and the other French prisoners are transported via train to their prison camp Abel looks to the exterior at a series of telephonetelegraph lines running concurrently.  In an eyeline match the camera provides us with a point of view shot aligning our view with Abel's.  Eventually however these lines end by moving offscreen to the top.  In another instance Abel assists his fellow prisoners in the digging of trenches.  Abel's task is to lay rope or wire along the distinctive lines of the trenches.  In one shot Abel moves increasingly deeper into the frame lengthening the line not only of the trench but of the rope or wire as well.  But with a quick 180degree edit to a medium shot the lines disappear.  Throughout The Ogre institutions are associated with structures composed of bricks or other patchwork materials such as stained glass windows.  The construction of these establishments are founded not upon linearly laying brick upon brick but by piling a brick upon two other bricks in such a way that they interlock to make a whole. In other words institutions are built by the confluence of numerous factors and not a direct relation from an immediately preceding event.  In fact intersecting lines appear throughout The Ogre and the numerous shots in which the characters are displayed through the filter of these enmeshing lines exemplify their effects upon the lives of the characters. The strongest representatives of Western Metaphysics in the film are the Nazis and the Hitler Youth program for which Abel is a servant.  In one scene the boys line up assembled in a courtyard listening to a speech by their headmaster.  This scene takes place at night and in a swooping crane shot the boys are indistinguishable from the night.  The boys look ahead and their supervisors are lit from behind by the flames of torches hence making them appear only as shadows.  This spectacle seems particularly reminiscent of Plato's Allegory of the Cave.'  The boys' headmaster informs them that they no longer have parents and that they now belong to the Fatherland. This proclamation also calls to attention Plato's ideas respective to the Academy and the necessity to remove children from their parents for the purposes of indoctrinating the youth with concepts to which their parents would be adverse. Schlndorff also directly criticizes the Hitler Youth program through the very materials on which they trod.  In one shot the boys are gathered on a driveway paved with cold gray bricks.  The pavement is deteriorated and formed by disparate bricks in opposition to the strongly embroidered buildings around them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pay Or Die is the story of Police Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino and his struggle against the infamous Black Hand who has moved over from the old country in Sicily and is terrorizing the new Italian immigrants just trying to make it in a new country. The Black Hand is sad to say an unhappy reminder of what they left.During the course of the film at one point Ernest Borgnine and Zohra Lampert as Mrs. Petrosino drink a toast to President Theodore Roosevelt. It's not just an idle toast. Not told in the film is the fact that as Police Commissioner Roosevelt recognized the talent in Petrosino and made him a personal protg and started his climb up the NYPD promotion ladder.What attracted TR to Petrosino is the no nonsense way he dealt with criminals. Petrosino was not a guy who believed in civil liberties and rights for criminals. He'd be lost in a world of Miranda. But he was as he saw it representing the forces of law and order against a completely ruthless enemy. Just the guy you need to fight a war on terror.His life and tragic death are dealt with in a way that makes Petrosino terribly human. Zohra Lampert's character who marries Petrosino survived him by decades dying in 1957. She and Borgnine make a perfect couple on screen. In the supporting cast Robert Ellenstein stands out as an Italian shyster lawyer who gets a really tragic comeuppance.Pay Or Die is a well constructed albeit B picture without any frills. It holds up well for today and should be in the ranks of great gangster films.".

	onyx:emotionText "Pay Or Die is the story of Police Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino and his struggle against the infamous Black Hand who has moved over from the old country in Sicily and is terrorizing the new Italian immigrants just trying to make it in a new country. The Black Hand is sad to say an unhappy reminder of what they left.During the course of the film at one point Ernest Borgnine and Zohra Lampert as Mrs. Petrosino drink a toast to President Theodore Roosevelt. It's not just an idle toast. Not told in the film is the fact that as Police Commissioner Roosevelt recognized the talent in Petrosino and made him a personal protg and started his climb up the NYPD promotion ladder.What attracted TR to Petrosino is the no nonsense way he dealt with criminals. Petrosino was not a guy who believed in civil liberties and rights for criminals. He'd be lost in a world of Miranda. But he was as he saw it representing the forces of law and order against a completely ruthless enemy. Just the guy you need to fight a war on terror.His life and tragic death are dealt with in a way that makes Petrosino terribly human. Zohra Lampert's character who marries Petrosino survived him by decades dying in 1957. She and Borgnine make a perfect couple on screen. In the supporting cast Robert Ellenstein stands out as an Italian shyster lawyer who gets a really tragic comeuppance.Pay Or Die is a well constructed albeit B picture without any frills. It holds up well for today and should be in the ranks of great gangster films.";

Ernest Borgnine is the hero a policeman who takes on the dreaded Black Hand that was terrorizing shopkeepers and various other innocent lawabiding people by forcing them to pay protection money or else. It's the usual cops and robbers story but with more heart than most and with an unusual setting stunningly realized by set designer Darrell Silvera. That the story happens to be based on fact gives the movie gravitas. Although it's filmed as melodrama the film is in many respects a semidocumentary of tenement life much of it sadly true. There's nothing romantic about the Mafia depicted in this movie. They're presented as the brutal thugs they really are without a trace of sentimentality. The sympathy here is all for the poor people of the streets and for the man who was their champion.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I am writing this it's star Mr. Ernest Borgnine has just received a lifetime achievement award from the Screen Actors Guild and is still an active performer in his midnineties. With his Oscar for MARTY and his performances in films like FROM HERE TO ETERNITY THE CATERED AFFAIR THE DIRTY DOZEN THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE THE WILD BUNCH EMPEROR OF THE NORTH POLE and numerous other titles and a stint as Lt. Quinton McHale on television it has been a long and varied and distinguished career  far worthier than the shocked dismissal he received when he got that Oscar. Congratulations Mr. Borgnine.Definitely one of his high points was this 1960 crime filmbiography on the career of the detective on the New York Police force Lt. Joseph Petrosino. Joe Petrosino is the perfect answer to bigots who only see Italian Americans as linked to crime by being criminals. In fact he was determined to eradicate those very criminals who were preying on the hard working Italian Americans in the United States. And he came damn close to doing so Petrosino made the Black Hand a personal study to the point that he was THE expert on it. He kept up pressure on the mob and undid much of their damage on the ItalianAmerican community. But not all of it  it was too well organized for only this one man to fight. In 1909 he had a bright idea of traveling to Sicily and tracing the leadership of the mob to it's root. Brilliant in concept it was foolhearty in actual practice. Petrosino was shot to death in Palermo.The killer was never tried and convicted and it looks like Petrosino in following his information may have been set up.This version with Mr. Borgnine is pretty close to the actual story of the extortionmurder gang of the BLACK HAND and the Lieutenant's fight against them. And it does go to the tragic conclusion...which is handled so well that repeated watchings make one feel that maybe this time Borgnine will escape. Of course it does not and sadly could not happen.He is recalled for his bravery and struggle and his murder by New York's finest and the people he tried to protect. As for the mob boss in Sicily  he did not quite escape his deserved fate. A more evil man Mussolini did not like the mob because they were setting up a rival power group to his. The mob boss was arrested in the late 1920s and found guilty of some criminal charges requiring imprisonment. He was put into a dungeon like prison on an island near the mainland. During World War II Il Duce ordered the prison be abandoned and it's staff and prisoners taken to mainland prisons...except this boss. He was left abandoned and locked up and either was killed in some Allied bombing or starved to death.".

Thus he dedicates himself to cracking open the secret web that extracts money from honest shopkeepers. There is of course some violence but it's not spread on thickly which keeps the story in central focus. Petrosino's personal life is somewhat complicated by an Italian girl Lampert whom he's attracted to. At least that gets a pretty girl into what's otherwise an all male cast! Trouble is he's middleaged while she's attracted to a younger guy. So all in all will he be able to get beyond crime's chokehold on the neighborhood and maybe help his private life at the same time. Borgnine delivers in robust fashion appearing in most every scene. His cop is likable maybe too much so for the toughness he must displaybut that's debatable. Lampert's a pleasant surprise as the neighborhood girl. I can see why the cop was stuck on her. Too bad actress Lampert didn't have an Alist career she certainly had the talent. It's also a strong supporting cast of ordinary looking guys that fit their part including familiar stalwarts like Simon and Marley. There's also a general and wellplaced refusal to glamorize anybody or anything. Little Italy thus comes across as a struggling ethnic neighborhood looking for a chance to enter the American mainstream but held back by criminal elements carried over from the old country. All in all it's an engaging movie with a few surprises that holds interest despite a lengthy runtime. Just as importantly it shows that a lead actor doesn't have to be handsome in order to win an audience.In passing It was about this time 1960 that the similarly themed The Untouchables with Robert Stack started its popular run on TV 195963.".

That's what is so good about these old black  whites. They end up being slices of history and entertaining too. Al Capone used to do the same thing they do in this movie i.e. extort money from people who have little choice but to pay. Police protection only worked well for police and not 100 of the time either. Anyone else was basically on their own and the movie captures this quite well. There is also a little bit of the Elliot Ness of the famous Untouchables in this movie. A special squad is put together to fight back Italian to Italian which ups the ante considerably. Entertaining and amusing story of one man's life to standup and make a difference even at the cost of his life? That's a good value lesson. Good movie to eat a sandwich and have a tasty drink with. Put up or shut up? NO! It's more serious than that! Pay or Die!".

That's what is so good about these old black  whites. They end up being slices of history and entertaining too. Al Capone used to do the same thing they do in this movie i.e. extort money from people who have little choice but to pay. Police protection only worked well for police and not 100 of the time either. Anyone else was basically on their own and the movie captures this quite well. There is also a little bit of the Elliot Ness of the famous Untouchables in this movie. A special squad is put together to fight back Italian to Italian which ups the ante considerably. Entertaining and amusing story of one man's life to standup and make a difference even at the cost of his life? That's a good value lesson. Good movie to eat a sandwich and have a tasty drink with. Put up or shut up? NO! It's more serious than that! Pay or Die!";

Typical wallflower Janie too hates both her parents the three who suffer individually in silence in their home life. Janie tries to steer clear of both her parents.

	schema:reviewBody "Of the 250 films I've seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler's List is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him.Ricky Fits the drugdealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in nonpromiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie they say Where's the beauty in a plastic bag? And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it? Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience  they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me walk into a preschool and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother? Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick. They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.What if I asked you this question What do you want in life? Most people would say happiness. But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positivethinking philosophy a philosophy of selfaffirming mantras and harsh selfdiscipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Selfhelp is just a euphemism for selfdeception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it's religion money or even love.In spite of American Beauty's greatness there are problems. Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultracritical. Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.Problems aside Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!Look closer.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind and most of them cannot be answered. In my view a film that makes me think after I watch it is secondtonone and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie as well as with the symbolism.  However what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening Carolyn Burnham isn't far behind.  Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley Ricky Fitts Thora Birch Jane Burnham Mena Suvari Angela Hayes and Chris Cooper Col. Frank Fitts only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film as well as Alan Ball for writing it.  I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality language drug content and violence the film obviously deserves its rating.  However none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing and all of them add to the plotline of this film.  While I don't think that this is a film for children I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a comedydrama I don't see anything about this film as funny.  Sure there are some comedic moments but by the end those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a lighthearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama don't see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think and are entertained by an excellent cast excellent directing and an excellent screenplay this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating  1010".

	schema:reviewBody "American Beauty is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream'  yet in the end only one character truly attains it.Having seen Happiness only recently I could not help but draw comparisons both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people in their own unique way all strive to be successful or simply 'happy'. But here the similarities end the characters in Happiness undergo a selfrealisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence and go on to wallow in their own depravity. Happiness shows no signs of redemption whereas in American Beauty the audience is offered a sense of hope of salvation though the characters must endure a similar fate or more accurately they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.The pivotal character upon which this theme centres is the father Lester played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption Lester transforms from being a loser.Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well he shows Lester on his 'path to enlightenment' pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced forming a steady rhythm of TV commerciallike vignettes which prove very comical if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film My life is like a commercial. And how this rings true like in Happiness all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite depressed depraved and desperate.Lester's wife played by Annette Benning is the most successdriven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film's tone of moral conviction. In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success is the maxim she adopts from the 'king' of real estate Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film for Benning's pawn life is all about keepingup appearances. This is where Lester differs from her his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of 'normal life' and following what his heart desires.Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit as does his daughter and Ricky or pay the price as does his wife and the Colonel. The irony inherent in this film and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.This film left me gasping for air its hyperrealism conveys at the same time a portrait of the suburban comedy a joltingshock of realisation and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who to varying degrees all strive for a certain 'American Dream' yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label the beauty of American Beauty is that it sits halfway between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.".

Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label the beauty of American Beauty is that it sits halfway between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.";

No word of dialogue is unnecessary no character exaggerated everything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you should know that already. Once you look closer at this movie and see Beauty in every frame it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty in everything around you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the movie. Every character is a part of each of us the Lester Burnham of change the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure the rebellion of Jane the defeated Barbara the false control of Angela and the Colonel and the real control of Ricky. To me Ricky not Lester is the center of this story he somehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth and downfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every time I see it and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that scene is simply the greatest monologue ever written.I listened to the message of American Beauty  look closely and you can find Beauty in anything  and it changed my life. I rose out of a long deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Beauty in the world I can't even stand it and it feels like my heart is going to burst.This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.".

Looking at it now I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched or maybe too unordinary to be worthy of its praise but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it you know you've seen something.A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb this is visually a superior film for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine a less strong role but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look her typical teenager role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim but her performance evokes both innocence and experience and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley as the videotaping boy next door is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense but like Spacey he sinks into the role. His purpose in the film unlike anyone else's is a mystery thus making him the most enigmatic person.Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience but never has a movie been known to move its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life no matter how predictable or tacky it appears this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives so therefore when they are over we each have something to remember.".

I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed but not so with this one.Kevin Spacey plays this part to a T.  He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should be nominated.The support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled Teenagers in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance worthy of a supporting nomination as well.This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition he is completely infatuated with her beauty.  Using this as his inspiration he attempts to change all aspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage his job his ego and his libido.The music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.The plot can get rather involved but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go.  I was simply involved hook line and sinker.See this movie more than once and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say trash.This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.My Rating 1  10  10".

	schema:reviewBody "This is by far one of the best if not THE movies of the 90's. American Beauty stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of American Beauty is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him a daughter who practically hates herself and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden he sees his daughter's friend Angela and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes the dreaded by most Americans a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves the precious moments in his stupid little life. You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure but don't worry you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100.Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is in order to be successful one most project an image of success at all times. You can tell she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again seems horrible but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.The supporting cast Thora Birtch who plays Janie Lester and Carol's daughter is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela Janie's best friend Lester's crush and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits Ricky's mom and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky everything is so quite and she says I'm sorry what?. Ricky says Mom no one said anything. When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation Ricky says Mom I'm leaving. Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better she knows this is best and says OK. Wear a raincoat. Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "And there were a lot of great ones this year. I will also say something even possibly bolderthat Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is saying a LOT given this man's past roles and his talent. I used to think he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK I see what all the fuss is about. Now he's up there with my favorite actors of all time with James Woods Steve Buscemi Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky enough to see a free screening this afternoon and boy am I glad I had the privilege. In fact this review might not even be that coherent it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you have trouble even putting your feelings into words. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it it did to me when I first heard about it Spacey plays a man who describes himself as a loser with Annette Bening as his horrible shrewish selfabsorbed pathetic btch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either despite the fact that you can understand why she turned out this way with her as a mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in the world outside of Happiness you find out about the family who just moved in next door. At first the strange son seems like the most messedup member of their brood but after you get to meet his exmilitary abusive homophobic terrifying father and his withdrawn sad headcase mother you realize he is the most normal member of the household by far. Then the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend which trust me is a lot more fun entertaining and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon he is having the most entertaining amusing midlife crisis ever seen in the history of cinema. He just doesn't give a k about what he does or says anymore and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he does.I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times most of it horrified amazed laughter at what is happening and the things that are coming out of the character's mouths especially Spacey's. He had at least a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual applause and cheers. I can't say enough good things about this movie. You think after the first five minutes that you know how the movie will end. Well Spacey's opening narrative does give it away but trust me the events unfold in a way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you can see what a character is going to do next what violent or selfdestructice act they will commit but you turn out to be wrong.Without getting too pretentious here the movie lives up to it's themetagline of ...look closer. THe characters are not what they seem up until the end and even then they surprise you. At least two characters that you are POSITIVE you have figured out do or say something that turns all your preconceptions of them upside down while making your jaw drop and your heart ache. You will leave the movie with a smile though and that is maybe what I expected least of all.Words just cannot do this movie justice. See it for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "On a scale of 0 to 100 I gave American Beauty a score of 99.Wowno I mean that. American Beauty is a film that takes my breath away each time I watch it and every time I do watch it I notice something newer something more exciting and something more funny. There is honestly no other movie like this and if you haven't seen it there is something donged in your head and you must do so now.Lester Burnham Kevin Spacey is in a midlife crisis caused by his stressed wife Carolyn Annette Bening and rebelling teenage daughter Jane Thora Birch. When Lester and Carolyn go watch Jane cheerleading they meet Angela Hayes Mena Suvari and Lester caught in sudden lust for Angela decides to change his life. Angela and Jane's friendship is not all it seems too because Angela only brags about how many times she's done it with guys and stuff. That doesn't help an already insecure Jane very much but she finds solace in the arms of the nextdoorneighbours' son Ricky Fitts Wes Bentley. Ricky himself from a broken home as well and Jane find they have a lot in common and eventually turn out to be soulmates.Everything about this film is so darkly clear it is extremely obvious why the Academy loved it and it is very obvious to see that I love it. Spacey brings Lester wildly to life in a performance reminiscent of Spacey's acting coach Jack Lemmon. Also on top form is Annette Bening in an overcontrolled performance that is just so instantly loveable. While all the attention went to these performers it is also Thora Birch especially Mena Suvari Wes Bentley and a quiet Allison Janney that manage to steal the show just as much. Sam Mendes is an excellent director this is his first feature and he is a British man directing an Americanbased film! And he won an Oscar for it! That's an amazing achievement ditto to Alan Ball who's script is effectively a stunner and an instant winner.The best film of 1999 the best film of its decade and for now anyways American Beauty stands tall as the best film ever made.".

	schema:headline " LOOK CLOSER at this BEAUTiful AMERICAN film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sam Mendes' big screen directorial debut will one day be mentioned along with classic greats like Psycho Vertigo 2001 and Sunset Blvd. which it cleverly mimics in a certain way. That way I won't ruin it if like me you stayed away from all reviews and talk about American Beauty until you actually saw the movie. To my surprise I somewhat succeeded. The script wonderfully written by Alan Ball who like Mendes is doing his first try in this certain ball park and hitting a home run. Sorry for the cheesy analogy but I may talk like that through out this review because this is the kind of movie where words can do no justice and it's almost impossible to translate your feelings into words. A similar experience happened to me earlier this year with Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. But back to American Beauty.When You've Got Nothing To Lose You Might As Well Risk Everything.Tagline for this film.That is probably one of the most accurate taglines I've ever read in my life. Lester Burnham Kevin Spacey in what may be the best role of his career which used to be Swimming With Sharks is reaching his midfourties. Uhoh midlife crisis time he rarely ever talks to his daughter Thora Birch whose feelings for him border on hate. He and his wife Carolyn Annette Benning being able to make me forget about In Dreams constantly bicker and the whole Burnham family quietly sit at the dinner table except for the occasional quibble about this or that for instance Mom why do we have to listen to this elevator music? The new next door neighbors the Fitts move in one day. Colonel Fitts Chris Cooper giving one of the finest supporting character performances this year is a hardcore Army officer. Every six months he makes his son Ricky take a urine test to make sure he's not on drugs. His idea of fun is sitting in front of the t.v. at night with his wife Allison Janney watching shows of Army Cadets training. Ricky Fitts is a hopeless optimistic. He is what Dawson from the Creek wishes he could be. Ricky walks around everywhere with his hand held camcorder while selling dope of the side filming all the beauty in the world. Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world that it overwhelms me and my heart feels like it's going to cave in. He finds a new subject to add to his beauty collection of film. Lester's daughter Janey. At first she doesn't like his new interest in her and thinks he's weird but as the film progresses they get to know each other and she starts to understand Ricky and instead of thinking he's weird thinking he's special. Special in being able to find beauty in the most minor and trivial things you can think of. Would you like to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed? That turns out to be a 15 minute shot of a plastic bag flying in the wind right before it snows. One night Carolyn in an effort to help Lester save his relationship with Janey although it could be her trying to save her own relationship with her daughter makes Lester go with her to a basketball game at Janey's high school where she cheerleads. Lester meets Janey's best friend Angela Mena Suvari in an interesting turn from Choir Girl in American Pie. Angela sets something off inside Lester and wakes him up from his 20 year sleep and makes him start changing and living life to the fullest. I feel like I've been in a coma for the past 20 years and am just beginning to wake up. Although this is work of an ensemble cast this is really Spacey's forum. The acting throughout this film is remarkable. Newcomer Wes Bently was excellent as the outcast Ricky who came off as shy yet confident. The cinematography in this film is majestically beautiful in every frame it's almost as if you're invited right into the scene. For instance in one scene when Spacey came home from a cocktail party with Benning he was in the refrigerator getting a root beer and out popped Suvari I was so entranced into that scene that I actually felt Spacey's startle when he saw her. This movie could be categorized as a drama although throughout the movie I had a smile on my face. I got to know these characters almost as if as friends. In a gossipy kind of way I couldn't wait to see what happened next because this film was a look behind the scenes of real suburban life. These people portrayed really do exist in the world. Somewhat like the people in Happiness the people and what they do are just like things families you know do or even your family does. The last scene of this film is amazing. Although it starts too early way before it's ready to it pays off at the end. With tensions building and emotions rising the inevitable climax will leave you breathless while making you wish it wouldn't happen and that somehow it would change. There is so much more to say about this movie and so much left out but I can't help it. Sam Mendes' American Beauty is an instant masterpiece as Lester says in the movie You have no idea what i'm talking about I'm sure. But don't worry..... You will someday. I believe those are words to live by for explaining the brilliance of this film even though critics and audiences love it now it won't truly be appreciated until after it's time.".

The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out Goodfellas L.A Confedintil Pulp Fiction to name a few. This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much also did Wes Bentley Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever.

	schema:reviewBody "Someone put it best in one of the reviews I read earlier This movie is exactly the result of people trying to make a socalled art movie and still win the best picture oscar. American Beauty shamelessly trots out every imaginable convention of what an art movie is and then glosses it over with cute shooting a relatively short run time and face pace. It says virtually nothing about any of the supposedly unusual or profound content that ostensibly is its subject matter. Apparently issues of wouldbe gravity making cameo apperaances constitutes a profound social comment. It is a great jumble of clichs spoilers here maybe The neurotic wife the homophobic army man That he turns out to be gay is not of any consequence since anything serious is not given attention in the film it is a cute afterthought. Though it would be a serious point if this movie had anything to do with realityThe white collar dick with a midlife crisis the artist who sees beauty where no one else can the pretending promiscuous cheerleader. Are there any characters that aren't stock? I cant believe anyone commented that this is in any way realistic. This is not a portrayal of of American life. In reality the teenager with an abusive psychotic homicidal father does not have 40000 and cannot conveniently run away to his friends in NYC. The middleaged man unjustly fired from his job does not conveniently have information he can use to blackmail his bosses for 60000 and live happily ever after. Living in a duplex as a teenager is nothing resembling duress that would be living on less that one U.S. dollar a day as millions of people do. This could easily qualify as propaganda When you are rich you dont have to worry your problem is only that you are not looking beneath the surface to see the true hedonistic beauty that life is really made of. Well I agree that this beauty does exist. Unfortunately though I am going to burst the bubble of one of the supposedly most profound scenes in the movie The plastic bag. Look closer they say and you will see the beauty in reality. Yes! but this is not reality! Plastic Bags do not blow in circles for 15 minutes. That scene could practically never have occurred in nature Im sorry I did look closer and it was so obviously being manipulated off camera that it was absurd. That sums up the movie fairly Look at what we call beauty we say it is natural but we are really manipulating it. If wind machines or whatever they are technically called are really the wind then this movie is really based in reality. Sam Mendes and Alan whatever his last name is the writer are daring the viewer to be as dumb and gullible as they hope they can be. And to my amazement they succeed. If we throw together a whole bunch of artistic clichs and it doesnt make sense to you then you are dumb. Anyone who has a modicum of sanity and any concept of criticism has seen this movie as the charade it is and I stand firmly in their camp. I literally exclaimed out loud though I was by myself What the Fk??!! at the beginning when Kevin Spacey says In a way I am already dying paraphrased. It is the zenith of selfconsciously pseudoprofound inanity.Disclaimer for the inflammatory nature of this post This is really just intended to be a rant as I am insensed at how many people cant see this movie for what it really is. I am not trying to analyze this movie in a deliberate or cogent way. If any wants me to argue more clearly then email me. And you will get a more thoughtful earful than this.".

	schema:headline " The greatest trick Kevin Spacey ever pulled...";
	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Spacey is a genius or at least a veritable magician.  A couple of the folks with whom I saw American Beauty said afterwards It was great  Spacey was incredible.  His performance it seems is enough to have convinced people that they had just watched a decent movie even though there is little else to recommend the film.  The other significant plus is the advertising campaign  marketing it as a funny drama and a moving comedy is an ingenious way of disguising the fact that it is neither. Since there are only two or three really good laughs in the piece it isn't really funny enough to be a comedy but since it's written by someone who used to work on Cybill that's hardly a surprise and since it only gets vaguely dramatic towards the end it doesn't maintain the atmosphere of a drama.  But the audience happily accepts this schizophrenic mess because the adverts told them to.  The adverts also told them to Look closer. Again this is a tiptop marketing ploy since it implies hidden depth significance and meaning without the content actually being there.  The average audience member is going to think Wow that plastic bag blowing around must be really poignant because this is a DEEP movie.  Heaven forbid that they should actually think for themselves.  Look closer indeed.What then of the characters?  Well what characters?  Every one on display here is little more than a stereotype from  fortysomething midlife crisis guy to the uptight careerdriven wife to their moody teenage daughter to the moody teenage boy to the homophobic soldier who  gasp  turns out to be gay etc etc etc.  Take the gay couple across the street for example. They are only around for two or three scenes and only then to provoke some more bigotry from Lieutenant Colonel Asskicker.  They might as well have been two cardboard cut outs labelled Gay for all that they were able to develop.  I know they are only supporting characters but if you're going to do a movie which tackles the issue of homosexuality you could at least have some believable homosexual characters in it rather than 2D cliches.This is indicative of the whole ghastly contrived nature of this film. Characters don't feel like characters because they don't behave in an even remotely plausible manner they don't behave consistently and they seem to stumble through from one setpiece to the next.  For example Spacey getting a job at Happy Burgers sure that's amusing but the whole thing is engineered just so he can catch his wife out and then it's dropped.  It doesn't fit in with any discernible character arc but is simply contrived to get a cheap laugh.  What about Ricky Fitts at the beginning?  You've just moved into a new neighbourhood you sell drugs but you have an incredibly strict father and you notice your new next door neighbour at a party.  Do you A introduce yourself chat to the guy find out if he's the sort who will report you to the police etc. before making your move or B march right up and offer the dope to him there and then because it expedites the action? Or how about the daughter's friend towards the end of the movie.  You're 16 years old you've just had a blazing row with your best friend and your car is parked outside.  Do you A run off leave the house asap and drive straight home or B slink off downstairs and hang around interminably just in case Kevin Spacey shows up to carry out his perverted subLolita fantasy?  I could go on all day...The direction is dare I say it directionless.  Sam Mendes should stick to his socalled risque theatre productions at the Donmar Warehouse.  His debut film as I have intimated reeks of incoherence.  In addition to the tonal uncertainty there is no clear directorial vision.  The only memorable images are borrowed from Blue Velvet and Lolita the rest of the time it seems to be left to the cast to try to carry the picture whether through Bening's OTT hyperactivity or Wes Bentley understatement.  When you look at The Straight Story or The Insider or even The Sixth Sense it galls me to think that this has been nominated for Best Direction...That this movie is so highly rated by critics IMDb users and Oscar personnel is a great shame because ultimately its success is a testament to people's stupidity.  A substantial crowd of nonthinking buffoons easily satisfied by the occasional cheap laugh and a couple of relatively strong performances have been sold a complete lemon.  This film is not deep. There is no coherent philosophical notion of either truth or beauty evident.  A few shots of Ricky Fitts looking sullen and waving his camcorder around do not I'm afraid amount to a radical thesis on the nature of the world.  And nothing can get over the contrived episodic nature of this Dgrade screenplay.Someone earlier on this comments page claimed that they could not like anyone who didn't love American Beauty for it would mean that they have no soul.  Well babe by the same token I will proudly say that anyone who does like this movie can't be my friend because they clearly have no brain. Look closer everyone I implore you.  Frankly American Pie is a more profound movie.  Dump this rubbish and go and see The Insider.  Think for yourself if you're able...My rating 3 10".

	schema:headline " Everything that's wrong with Hollywood distilled into two horrible hours. Spoilers.";
	schema:reviewBody "Now let me see if I've gotten this straight Saving Private Ryan an epic tale of honor glory and sacrifice set against the backdrop of what was possibly the most important single day of the Twentieth Century was not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.However American Beauty a movie whose heroes are a middleaged pedophile who casually endangers the future of his family and the nextdoor drug dealer who finds beauty in people getting their brains blown out is.I see.American Beauty might work as satire if 1. it weren't telling us something we've KNOWN for fifty years  that the suburbs are not this perfect Ozzie and Harriet world of smiling whitebread people  and 2. if the characters depicted in the movie were in any way REALISTIC. Instead American Beauty is a parade of the most tiresome Hollywood cliches of the 1990s. I don't care how pathetic Spacey's and Bening's characters' lives are  would they really be THAT devoid of any redeeming values? Are we supposed to CHEER Spacey as he quits his job smokes pot and lusts after seventeen yearold girls all to the detriment of his young daughter? Are we supposed to laugh at the exMarine's idea that the world NEEDS certain rules and standards in order to work? Clearly we are. These are not characters at all but ciphers. Indeed the exMarine is one of the most laughable ciphers at all. He is the parody of the Evil GunToting GayBashing RightWing Military Nut taken to its furthest extreme. As columnist John Leo recently put it the only thing they forgot to do was to make him a tobacco company chemist and a trustee of a segregated college. And the final revelation that the gaybasher is in fact gay himself is the final piece of this Hollywood stereotype a move meant purely to make sure this character and his worldview that of the importance of morality and of the necessity of rules in society is completely discredited.And I know I know I'm not reading between the lines. I need to look closer. Well I submit that those who glowingly praise this movie are looking TOO closely. It's easier to lose sight of the larger message a movie sends when you examine any one element too closely. And all that the people who made this movie have proved is that they live on an entirely different planet from the hardworking Joe and Jane America they claim to so brilliantly expose  the same Joe and Jane America that keeps Hollywood in business.Ordinarily I'd rate a movie like American Beauty about a 3. But since it was without question both the most offensive AND the most overrated movie of 1999 move over The Phantom Menace and since more needs to be done to counterbalance these morons who think it's the next Citizen Kane I feel I have no choice but to go with my original gut instinct and give it a big fat 1. For years I've made it a practice to save every ticket stub from every movie I've seen regardless of its quality. Nevertheless my American Beauty ticket stub now sits in tornup shreds at the bottom of the concessionarea garbage can. It seemed a fitting gesture toward this Oscarwinning piece of putrescent pap.".

	onyx:emotionText "Now let me see if I've gotten this straight Saving Private Ryan an epic tale of honor glory and sacrifice set against the backdrop of what was possibly the most important single day of the Twentieth Century was not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.However American Beauty a movie whose heroes are a middleaged pedophile who casually endangers the future of his family and the nextdoor drug dealer who finds beauty in people getting their brains blown out is.I see.American Beauty might work as satire if 1. it weren't telling us something we've KNOWN for fifty years  that the suburbs are not this perfect Ozzie and Harriet world of smiling whitebread people  and 2. if the characters depicted in the movie were in any way REALISTIC. Instead American Beauty is a parade of the most tiresome Hollywood cliches of the 1990s. I don't care how pathetic Spacey's and Bening's characters' lives are  would they really be THAT devoid of any redeeming values? Are we supposed to CHEER Spacey as he quits his job smokes pot and lusts after seventeen yearold girls all to the detriment of his young daughter? Are we supposed to laugh at the exMarine's idea that the world NEEDS certain rules and standards in order to work? Clearly we are. These are not characters at all but ciphers. Indeed the exMarine is one of the most laughable ciphers at all. He is the parody of the Evil GunToting GayBashing RightWing Military Nut taken to its furthest extreme. As columnist John Leo recently put it the only thing they forgot to do was to make him a tobacco company chemist and a trustee of a segregated college. And the final revelation that the gaybasher is in fact gay himself is the final piece of this Hollywood stereotype a move meant purely to make sure this character and his worldview that of the importance of morality and of the necessity of rules in society is completely discredited.And I know I know I'm not reading between the lines. I need to look closer. Well I submit that those who glowingly praise this movie are looking TOO closely. It's easier to lose sight of the larger message a movie sends when you examine any one element too closely. And all that the people who made this movie have proved is that they live on an entirely different planet from the hardworking Joe and Jane America they claim to so brilliantly expose  the same Joe and Jane America that keeps Hollywood in business.Ordinarily I'd rate a movie like American Beauty about a 3.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this in theaters back in 1999.  I loved it.  I really really loved it.  I've seen it four or five times since and each time I like it less.  I just saw it again a couple of days ago and I stopped it before it was over.  At that moment I decided to sell my DVD.  It has now been excised from my DVD Collection about which I have considerable pride.The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn't know what it wants to say.  It takes a bunch of characters constructs various relationships between them and sets them loose to run around for two hours at the end of which what have we learned?I've heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate  Fight Club.  Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism.  With Fight Club the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece who seeks to replace it with fascism.  In American Beauty the anticonsumerist is first of all a total hypocrite and second of all has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was.On the hypocrisy charge consider the oftquoted scene when Lester Burnham magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey yells at his wife Carolyn played in an overthetop caricature by Annette Bening for placing too high a value on material things in this case a sofa.  Fine.  He makes a good point.  No one else seems to have noticed however that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird.  Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself which is the very apex of materialism.There are lots of other things that we don't see and I never noticed until I looked closer how conspicuous they are in their absence.  We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene.  They never make any reference to being cheerleaders.  The whole concept of cheerleading then is merely a mechanism and quite a contrived not to mention cliched mechanism at that to introduce Lester to Angela.I also noticed when I looked closer how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is.  Lameo  Geekboy  Take a whizz It's just horrid.  And why exactly was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website?  First of all her breasts don't appear to need augmenting when I saw this in theaters I thought she must want to reduce her breasts but upon looking closer the computer monitor clearly says augmentation which means a process of adding to.The worst flaw of the film by far is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act.  The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin.  For the love of God who let those two howlers slip through.  Bad enough that either made the final cut but both?!!  It defies understanding.The scene that made me turn the film off this final time that I watched it was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together.  I was never very comfortable with this scene because call me conservative I'm just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen or so and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend.  But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary. Fair enough Angela had it coming.  But for Ricky to not only accept Angela's principle that ordinariness is bad but to use it against her... that bothered me.  Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being.  Ricky having been set up clumsily as a heroic character shouldn't have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle.The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along.  It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go.  The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester's murder.  Now that subplot is a bit ridiculous and was cut for a good reason I agree.  But why leave the set up if you're cutting the payoff?  Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says You know I'm joking right?The sequence where Col. Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of Three's Company.  Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw and nothing else.  That's a classic example and the most blatant I can recall from any film of bad contrived plotting. What exactly was up with Mrs. Fitts?  Presumably her scenes meant something in some previous unreleased version of the story.  The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences... Ricky just happens to be working there and he works there just long enough to meet Lester!!!  And what selfrespecting drug dealer would give a man 2000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he'd be willingable to pay for it later?  It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have 2000 in cash while jogging but I know you're good for it isn't much better.This film is ambitious.  There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it.  There are a lot of really good ideas.  But on a fundamental level it just doesn't work.".

There is NOTHING in this movie worth watching  well except a half nude scene aha! so it WAS a softporn movie or?".

I did not knew that guy till yet. But it seems that he is some kind of mentally ill reincarnation of Ed Wood.The movie is really not worth any description. There is a blue avatarish creature in a spaceship orbiting earth a Pretator like other creature and a Lost in Space 1965 look a like robot. Also some college students. All of them interact somehow without any sense or story line. They walk around on grass now and then you see a tree. Guess the whole film location was not bigger then 100 square meters. Maybe somebody's garden or a lawn beside a motorway station? Oh! Also there are some laser beams in a 1970s movie stile.I was fascinated by the most unnecessary nudity plot ever added into a movie. Its somewhere at the beginning of the film. Some chicks hike to a cabin. Then one of both instantly starts undressing while the other one walks without any reason a few meters into the forest. The conversation and the music gives you the feeling that you got accidentally the wrong disc and you are watching some kind of weired hiking soft porn. The second chick undresses during she walks into the forest and apparently just throws her cloth on the ground. Which really makes no sense in any way. After making sure that you have seen enough breasts the predator thing shows up and kill her or whatever i do not care.Well if you wanna see the most unnecessary nudity scene ever then watch the movie to this point. Then hit the stop button and bump your head for the next 40 minutes rhythmic against the wall. I guarantee you! It will be much more fun and hurt less then watching the rest of the flick.".

And truth be told the title of this movie is one of the most unimaginative ones I have seen in all of 2011. But all the same I decided to watch the movie because I had nothing else to watch and I was semiinterested to see just how they would be making fun of these movies.Then as I sat down to watch the movie I realized that this wasn't a spoof in the likes of Epic Movie Date Movie Scary Movie and all those types. No this was actually a serious movie. That baffled me especially when they picked a title like that.All throughout the movie I was sitting there with the sensation as if I had put on an old 1980's horror movie because it definitely had that feel to it.Well let me start with the bad things in the movieAt some point in the movie Ava played by Cassie Fliegel states that English was the simplest language she had encountered in the universe. And this comes from a far superior race in evolution and technology. Wait? Back it up just a notch. In the beginning of the movie when she is in her spaceship and launching that robotar down on Earth the text on her console is in English! Are you kidding me?The scythe creature that Ava was hunting it looked like something they had copied from the Feast movies. At least the design of the face did. The rest of it was basically just a guy in a jumpsuit and it was painstakingly obvious that it was just that! And the part about it turning invisible can anyone who have seen Predator raise their hands as say 'I have seen that skill somewhere' ?Moving on to Ava herself. Clearly a rip off of the creatures from Avatar mixed with something from XMen. And also you would think that when choosing a corporeal form to manifest on Earth you would select some clothing suitable for the environment not a snug tightfitting latex suit! A lot of the dialogue in Aliens vs Avatars was halting at best and makes you wonder who exactly talks like that in such situations.Okay then moving on the good parts of the movie The cast they actually had some decent enough people in the movie despite them having a bad script and poor dialogue to work with. Most memorable was Ginny You playing Dana and Jason Lockhart playing Tyler.Aliens vs Avatars had some good enough camera work in it and there were some pretty nice scenic moments as well.However as an overall entertainment Aliens vs Avatars is not really all that great. And I thought it was going to be a comedy making fun of recent scifi movies so I was sorely disappointed to find out it wasn't. I suppose if you are a fan of anyone on the cast list in this movie it would be worthwhile to sit down and watch it otherwise don't bother with this movie unless you have absolutely nothing else at hand. But wait isn't there usually something showing on TV?".

Looks so cheap. I know that it's a low budget movie but why sell it in stores? They are robbing buyers money. Don't buy this movie. They are selling you dirt.Thank you for reading this review.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay why are you reading reviews of a movie called Aliens VS Avatars? Just judging by the poster and title you can already tell it's going to be terrible. But whatever. Here you are and I guess I should supply you with my review of the film.The film starts off with an asteroid hitting earth and some alien is in it. A bunch of women go to find out what happened and the monster turns invisible and rips off the movie Predator. If that still doesn't sound bad to you keep reading. It gets way worse.The avatars the rip off of the movie Avatar fly down something else while we get a boner watching the women in bikini's when suddenly the alien ruins all the fun and kills all of them. The scene then switches to two men in a house discussing matters. Really cheesy matters. Unbelievable matters. Awhile later they go with a bunch of women and go camping somewhere. The avatar then goes onto earth as a human where the main characters are camping. Already too much has happened in. The pacing is terrible in this film! SLOW DOWN!Oh we now have another scene of a dead woman and a couple didn't care when they saw it. What?After a completely long time of boredom the alienpredator rip off chases a woman from the camp with some really cheesy TV movie music and then it kills her. This is the greatest masterpiece I have ever seen. Lots of story! Then it's morning and everybody wakes up. They all have a talk and the pacing starts getting okay when suddenly they see a bloody patch on a rock with a shoe covered in blood as well and the avatar that had formed into a human. Yes there is lots of cheesy TV movie music. They then get the avatar and find out that she's an avatar not a human. The avatar then makes a woman unconscious. I don't know for what reason I'm sorry I fell asleep while the avatar was talking. The avatar walks with the humans and is introduced to the other campers. They then go on a random walk and...oh haven't you heard enough? You should know by know that this is going to be a terrible film when you watch it! This movie is in my worst movies of all time list! Overall a 1.110!".

It didn't sound or feel like that the movie had a proper script because the dialogue is so awkwardly delivered giving it an improvisatory feelbut with none of the actors being good at it and incredibly random. The story is very lazy in pace and so structurally scant that if one thought that the movie was without a plot it would be entirely excusable. What there is of one makes very little if any sense Ava's origins story and her purpose in the story is more perplexing than intriguing and there is an overkill of nudity almost all of it irrelevant and just there for the sake of it.

The acting is poor all round and that's being kind Victoria De Mare is the only one who stands out and that's more to do with her looks than her acting.Overall laughably terrible with nothing good about it.

It was so funny in a bad way that we ended up seeing it from start to finish.The movie is about some young people camping in a forest next to a military base. The meet the Avatar which has made herself into a human. I did not understand why because she quickly reveal what she is.

The special effects were so bad that you would think they were made in Microsoft paint. We started to laugh just 2 minutes in the movie because the acting was so poor. It was so funny in a bad way that we ended up seeing it from start to finish.The movie is about some young people camping in a forest next to a military base. The meet the Avatar which has made herself into a human. I did not understand why because she quickly reveal what she is.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a terrible movie. Almost everything about it is bad from the pace over the plot to the acting  not to mention the special effects which has to be put in quotation marks. But it is a bmovie and anyone who expects otherwise is bound to be sorely disappointed. However anyone who knows their bmovies and appreciate naive lowbudget cinema would probably agree that Aliens vs. Predators has all the qualities of a bmovies that's so bad it's good.The plot is pretty simple to begin with but becomes increasingly absurd as it progresses. We follow a group of college students on a camping trip in the woods. The group of characters includes the typical stereotypes including the geek the nerdy Asian girl the jog the tomboy and the spoiled and snobby girl. Unbeknown to the college students an alien life form called the Scythe prowls the very same forest. And it's out to destroy mankind. Having to start somewhere it has set its sights on the college students whom it offs one by one. Meanwhile a benevolent alien called Ava Cassie Fliegel who looks like a third rate Navi is on a mission to hunt down the Scythe. While her corporal form is in orbit above Earth in a spaceship she controls a humanlooking avatar also Cassie Fliegel on Earth. The surviving college students join forces with Ava and using a mechastyle battle robot called Robotar they must destroy the Scythe before it destroys Earth.The Scythe is able to transform into anything whose DNA it has been in contact with plus it has the ability to become invisible. This obviously amounts to elements lifted from both The BodySnatchers and The Predator. The Scythe is really just a guy in a rubber suit and looks more cheesy than scary. With the Scythe chasing college students around in the forest and killing them in ways that include various amounts of gore the movie appears to also be heavily inspired by the Friday the 13thfranchise. Indeed with elements lifted from a variety of sources including the title's reference to Avatar and Aliens the movie is an example of parasitic cinema it's an exploitation movie really. Such parasitism is not uncommon in bmovies and it was particularly common in horror and scifi bmovies of the '60s '70s and '80s. The Robotar is also just a guy in a suit and reminds me of The Power Rangers if anything.Aliens vs. Avatars was obviously made on a low budget and combines cheesy practical effects with horrendous CGI. The acting is generally wooden and substandard in many ways. Some of the characters have potential but they are generally butchered by the Scythe before they are developed enough for the viewer to actually sympathize with them. Thus when they are killed it really has no effect on the viewer. The plot combines the linear nature of the straightup slasher movie with elements from scifi and Japanese battlesuit action which does result in a completely absurd and ridiculous storyline full of inconsistencies and flaws. The film even resorts to the cheap trick of making use of topless scenes as if to appeal to the most hopeless male viewers.In other words Aliens vs. Avatars has everything a bmovie should have. This means that it is unintentionally hilarious at several levels. While its truly distasteful elements are its misogynist and slightly racist tendencies and perhaps its parasitic nature which I am sure has lured some people into thinking that it was actually crossover between the Aliens and Avatarfranchises it is generally an enjoyable movie to watch because it pretty much fails at everything. What it does capture and this is what makes it enjoyable is the spirit of the slasher movies of the '70s and '80s and fans of that genre will probably enjoy the film for that reason. Overall this is a bad  very bad  movie which fails in pretty much every aspect. Its one strength is that it is full of those elements that make bmovies worth watching. Those who do not appreciate bmovies are bound to absolutely hate Aliens vs. Avatars and should just stay away from it but I think that bmovie fans will enjoy it exactly because of all its flaws. The rating in this review reflects its qualities as a bmovie as a proper movie it would probably only be worth half a point or something.".

There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot  there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive  although you know what's coming next still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline  the story moves fast from one scene to another making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times it's hard to keep up even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication  there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after I believe. 6. its realism  okay pun intended. The movie explains or at least tries to the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons 1. its poor character development  although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main characters after watching the movie. Yes the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else if you ask me. 2. too many distractions  I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy  I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid Inception overused this trick. In conclusion its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!".

There is only one word to describe the cinematography the set designs and the special effects and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening you feel them.

His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If Inception is a metaphysical puzzle it's also a metaphorical one It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dreamweaving and Nolan's film making intended to seduce us mess with our heads and leave an everlasting impression.To conclude I would just say before your life ends do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!

	schema:headline " Inception has a lot of ideas and it doesn't do anything with them";
	schema:reviewBody "I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes bad writing or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250 it received praise from critics cashed in a lot of money and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things the folding city the collapsing cliffs the train in the street are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I'll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that shocking ending would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It's not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don't want to know anything.Cobb DiCaprio takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer's Murphy mind. As a reward his contractor Saito Watanabe will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can't return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie this is Cobb's main inner conflict that before he fled the country he didn't get a chance to see the kids' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio's fatherinlaw. Why doesn't Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn't he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It's a long distance relationship but it's something. Well apparently no one thought of that and so the main character's main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting DiCaprio was good. But if you've seen Shutter Island You've seen a third of Inception. Dead wife small kids a sense of loss a pretty wooden house in a field all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island it's all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy's mind. This is called inception. Hence the title I guess. Everyone says it's impossible to do so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie but instead of getting into a vault Cobb's team has to get inside someone's mind  which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix you plug yourself into yet another deeper matrix. There I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn't enough there is Ellen page's character Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I'm fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It's the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy who just inherited a huge corporation to dissolve it because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy's mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don't care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren't high they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I'm only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix but I'm not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe's character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself I don't give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don't tell us what consequences it would have they don't show us what happens with the company they don't do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay so I didn't like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer's unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest cityfolding scenes were so short there wasn't really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well I'll give them that. Cinematography was good bordering on too much shaky camera.Here's the paragraph about the endingThe big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real then it's stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream then it's a stupid cop out on Nolan's part. An excuse for all the things that didn't make sense. It was all a dream so screw you audience.".

	onyx:emotionText "I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes bad writing or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250 it received praise from critics cashed in a lot of money and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things the folding city the collapsing cliffs the train in the street are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I'll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that shocking ending would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It's not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don't want to know anything.Cobb DiCaprio takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer's Murphy mind. As a reward his contractor Saito Watanabe will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can't return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie this is Cobb's main inner conflict that before he fled the country he didn't get a chance to see the kids' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio's fatherinlaw. Why doesn't Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn't he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It's a long distance relationship but it's something. Well apparently no one thought of that and so the main character's main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting DiCaprio was good. But if you've seen Shutter Island You've seen a third of Inception. Dead wife small kids a sense of loss a pretty wooden house in a field all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island it's all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy's mind. This is called inception. Hence the title I guess. Everyone says it's impossible to do so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie but instead of getting into a vault Cobb's team has to get inside someone's mind  which happens to look like a vault.

The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio Ken Watanabe Joseph GordonLevitt Marion Cotillard Ellen Page Tom Hardy Cillian Murphy Dileep Rao Tom Berenger and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001 A Space Odyssey it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's scifi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it and then it asks well Nolan asks for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it nor does it have any trickspeek behind the curtain typeup its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone thematically speaking and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies interpretations are many with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with that of course wont work for everyone but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre rest assured thrill seekers Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled rollercoaster ride aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains exSmiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said there's something for everyone here making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into giving the character the air of believability he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable very much an axis in the narrative while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise too for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.510".

	schema:headline " In a Decade Inception May Be A Religion";
	schema:reviewBody "Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. Inception is no exception to that rule but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion i.e. The Matrix 1999 The Cell 2000 Abre Los Ojos 1997  its American remake Vanilla Sky 2001 you really can't look away nor should you.Inception is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb a world class criminal who with the help of a team of sleep experts works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role but unlike many other films he has starred in this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other costar. Instead this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the Matrix movies. There are slowmotion shots but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director andor Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said there was still a lot about this film I still don't get and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 is a film I've seen a couple of times and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following though as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.".

Inception is no exception to that rule but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion i.e. The Matrix 1999 The Cell 2000 Abre Los Ojos 1997  its American remake Vanilla Sky 2001 you really can't look away nor should you.Inception is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb a world class criminal who with the help of a team of sleep experts works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role but unlike many other films he has starred in this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other costar. Instead this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the Matrix movies. There are slowmotion shots but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director andor Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said there was still a lot about this film I still don't get and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 is a film I've seen a couple of times and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following though as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.";

	schema:headline " One of the most overrated films ever! The most undreamlike film about dreams I've ever seen!";
	schema:reviewBody "What do David Lynch Luis Bunuel and Wes Craven have in common? They have all created far superior films about dreams on a fraction of Christopher Nolan's budget. For a film about dreams everything looks so dull and drained of color. Inception never feels surreal like a dream. It feels like ridiculous PG13 action sequences strung together by character's explaining it's all a dream within a dream etc. When watching this film I thought of far superior films about dreams and alternate realities Bunuel and Dali's Un Chien Andalou 1929 The Blood of a Poet 1930 The Wizard of Oz 1939 Hitchcock's Spellbound 1946 Meshes of the Afternoon 1947 Dr. Sues' 5000 Fingers of Dr. T 1953 Le Jetee 1962 Fellini's 8 12 1963 Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors 1963 Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits 1966 Who Wants to Kill Jesse 1966 Valerie and her Week of Wonders 1970 Viva La Muerte 1970 The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie 1972 Tarkovsky's Solaris 1972 The Hourglass Sanitorium 1973 Eraserhead 1977 Altered States 1980 Time Bandits 1981 Pink Floyd's The Wall 1982 Forbidden Zone 1982 Videodrome 1983 A Nightmare on Elmstreet 1984 Dreamscape1984 Brazil 1985 Paperhouse 1988 The Bmovie Beyond Dreams Door 1989 Santa Sangre 1989 Jacob's Ladder 1990 Kurosawa's Dreams 1990 Total Recall 1990 Naked Lunch 1991 Arizona Dream 1993 John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness 1995 12 Monkeys 1995City of Lost Children 1995 Lost Highway 1997 Dark City 1998 The Matrix 1999 eXistenZ 1999 Being John Malkovich 1999 The Cell 2000 Waking Life 2001 Donnie Darko 2001 Muholland Drive 2001 Demon Lover 2002 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004 Strange Circus 2005 The Fall 2006 The Science of Sleep 2006 Pan's Labrynth 2006 Paprika 2006 and the list goes on and on and on. 100's of French and Asian films hell even the Nightmare on Elmstreet sequels.In Inception Leonardo Dicaprio plays Dom Cobb a dream thief who can enter people's dreams and steal top secret information. Like his character in Shutter Island which had better dream sequences Leo is obsessed with his dead wife and longs to go home to see his kids. He's given a mission by a corporate boss to enter a rival's dream and implant false information. By completing this mission he'll be able to go home to his kids. Dom hires an architect played by Ellen Page to create false dream worlds. Then there's his agents who are one dimensional rip offs of characters from The Matrix A far more entertaining film For a film about dreams you'd expect a little Fruedian sex or nudity. Oh no we don't want are dreams to go beyond a massmarketed PG13 rating. Or how about at least abstract surrealism or stream of consciousness dialog? Instead we have all the character's taking time out to explain everything to Hans Zimmer's overblown music. In the words of Ariadne Wait Who's subconscious are we going through exactly?. That's odd a shootout on skis James Bond style and Look I'm floating like in The Matrix Lets not get to bizarre or fun Maybe I'm being critical because I'm by no means a fan of Christopher Nolan. Momento and The Dark Night were good films but should never be mentioned in the same breath as HItchcock or Kubrick. People really anger me comparing Inception to Blade Runner or 2001 A Space Odyssey. Even Avatar had more heart and soul than Inception. In Avatar I actually cared about the characters and felt like I was in a different world. In this film how am I supposed to care for rich corporate suits who want to steal secrets. How about having an Exxon executive jumping in the dreams of a BP executive? If it's all a dream within a dream within a dream of one dimensional Hollywood characters why should the audience care? And why take 150 mins. to tell a story when it could of been done in less than 2 hrs.?On one note the special effects were impressive and the film did have great acting. I think this film could of been good if it was more colorful and dreamlike and maybe 45 mins. shorter. Inception fell cold and flat of having a heart and soul. Why do films now look gray poo brown or washed out in color? Movies used to be so much brighter. Compare this film to Suspiria 1977 What Dreams may Come and Edward Scissorhands and you'll see what I mean. Spending 200 million dollars on a film that could of fed a 3rd world country for 10 years is more of a nightmare than a dream. All that money spent and it still looks visually boring artless and dull. As a person who practically makes minimum wage and lives off Ramen noodles I watch scifi and fantasy films for an escape. Why would I care about a rich corporate rival who has a bad relationship with his father? Boohoo! In the end I felt like I was viewing the unimaginative dreams of Wall Street brokers. This is a film made by a room fool of people rather than an artist with a vision. A mass marketed product like fast food masquerading itself as nutrition. For this film to be in IMDb's top 5 is a joke this is mediocre at best. People are saying that this is better than The Wizard of Oz Pulp Fiction Blue Velvet or Citizen Kane. I must be dreaming no I kicked myself and this is for real.".

As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime then trust that you 100 will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology although coming out as a rather poor film in my opinion then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time you would expect a lot to take place but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left.

And Nolan as always delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio perhaps only equalled in The Aviator which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely.

	schema:reviewBody "Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film or setting the expectations too high as film geeks all are guilty for however for Christopher Nolan's Inception this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way something which is extremely refreshing even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs which I for one do not agree with however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond or Gondry on a huge budget because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fanboy gushing but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time maybe I would find something about it I didn't like but not the first time. The way it is cut means that there is always action on screen if not then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything all I have to say is that is what this film is about that is what makes this film so great layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight but he handles it perfectly similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page whom I usually hate gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film much like District 9 yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog httpthedeletedscene.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out and like most of DiCaprio's films it blew me away.Inception is a wellmade movie filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding there were only about two moments maybe three seconds in total where i noticed that visual effects were being used of course defying gravity is pretty difficult. The plot was very pleasingly intricate with a twistandturn keepyouontheedgeofyourseat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island which i also enjoyed very muchseeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenadethrowing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very wellcomposed score which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unless you call this movie a masterpiece. Then you are.Damn 1000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.Spoilers.The film is 2.5 hours long yet feels like 5.2 and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish conflictfree exposition which does not bode well for repeat viewings.The learning about the dream world scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page's characters already knew what was being explained. The similar learning about the matrix scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.There's another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That's it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad! Let's not forget this whole idea of one corporation oneupping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him or us or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor's bath mat. Come on. The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don't need to know anything else yet the film keeps piling on needless information.If this is a heist film where is the threat of being caught? A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph GordonLevitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour realtime. The guy from Bronson does his thing whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events but rather straightforward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a physical presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn't even have anything to do emotionally with Leo's goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn't even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He's separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn't happen.In fact Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell you can even put Page there since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he's crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.Leo's lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a 'so what?' moment when the problem is solved for him and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn't send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It's integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical and in turn but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101 Lesson 1 and Nolan got that wrong. That's why I don't believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else's dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go genius.Pretty much everything this film does wrong The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.PS The 'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It's getting as bad as that tired old 'It's all a dream' scenario. Oh wait...".

	schema:headline " Scifi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time it's either allvisualsnosmarts G.I. Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus. In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity and this is where Inception shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right years.Once the film ends you'll want to watch it again for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damned.Of course a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island. He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight. The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value 910 Excellent".

	schema:reviewBody "What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase the thrill of romance the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! What is the most resilient parasite? An idea says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around Extractors who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival Inception is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which I imagine is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance thematically with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the scifi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitchperfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph GordonLevitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI there are some pretty mindblowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes smart sexy femme fatale sexy brainy girl very beautiful men in very beautiful suits and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!".

Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which I imagine is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance thematically with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the scifi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitchperfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph GordonLevitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI there are some pretty mindblowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes smart sexy femme fatale sexy brainy girl very beautiful men in very beautiful suits and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!";

You have great special effects a scifi conundrum beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension you couldn't care less about any of the characters why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get one over on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 1010 it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul has to grab you you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone honestly say they cared about anyone on show here.By the way here's an idea why don't you bring the children who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them to you if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous but the fact his father who lives in Paris is bizarrely there in the US to meet him how did he know and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible just there's nothing really there no substance.".

Inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well.Characters Great actors whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades. However the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense emotion and any sort of cohesiveness. Sir Michael Caine and Tom Berenger's performances were appalling and the team of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry. Action For a dream world the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical Hollywood bounds. Car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot building shootouts and melodramatic bullet wounds as always one character is wounded critically the team must save him however the character can still fight. Plot This movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling. Not only was Inception's puzzle ending blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw. The overly complicated puzzle piece effect which Nolan was trying to achieve was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop.I will credit the movie with one notable mention. Nolan managed to work a Matrix style fight scene which have been overdone by Hollywood since the early 2000s into the small confines of an elevator.In the ending Inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be. While the movie takes place in a dream world where bounds are limitless the movie itself is sterile clich repetitive and unimaginative. This is even further compounded by one dimensional characters and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma.Perhaps Christopher Nolan's true intent was to make a sterile and lack luster movie aimed strictly at making today's selfabsorbed and obtuse Facebookhipster generation feel smart.Inception can be compared to a class presentation where the student is unprepared. To hide this the student uses convoluted and circular logic to stammer through the presentation and pass the time. It is obvious that the student knows nothing and has wasted several minutes talking about a subject that could have been explained in seconds. Nonetheless since the student used big words talked excessively and is deemed to be in the mainstream the class gives a standing ovation regardless...".

For example in the first Matrix film the viewer understands the profundity of what is being delivered through metaphor a feature that the subsequent Matrix films sadly missed. In this film here everything is painstakingly explained. To me this speaks volumes.Secondly great actors yes. BUT ALL miscast and given appalling dialogue in an appalling script. I mean Ellen Page was great in Juno but here she comes out with painfully mechanical lines in the same way that Joseph GordonLevitt also does. In the same way that every character does.

Oh yes it's a vain attempt to look mean and manly because the poor man still has unfortunately for him such a baby face.Why is Cillian Murphy's character chosen to be their means of helping LDC's character get back to his kids? And isn't it convenient to have a dream sequence in a blockbuster that resembles a James Bond film snowcovered chase scene? Why does the film have to go on for two and a half hours instead of one and a half? And most importantly if Leonardo De Caprio's character is so severely screwed up about his wife why o why does he have to be the main character in this film?

I actually had to register to IMDb so I can explain why this movie is so bad. Seeing that this piece of garbage is rated 9 out of 10 made me wanna vomit. But enough about that let's get to the serious issues with this movie. 1 Leonardo DiCaprio has not changed his role for the last 5 years. Am I the only one that notices this? He always plays some guy that has deep seated emotional issues relating to the loss of a loved one. Can he play anything else besides the loner that lost the love of his life and now has psychological scars that go so deep they hit the street he's standing on? 2 Why didn't they shoot his stupid wife anytime she showed up? He wasn't the only guy on the team that knew she was out to mess things up. Why not say Hey guys if you see my wife shoot her because she's going to get us all killed. She's not real and is already dead so go ahead and blow her away so we can get back to work.? 3 The dream world was the dullest I have ever seen. Oh man...M.C. Escher stairs a train driving down the street buildings that go sideways and upside down... That's all they could come up with? Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was more imaginative than the supposed dreamworld. I'm pretty sure most dreams have more random stuff than that happen in them. Where's the offthewall imagination? I don't think anyone that says they had the weirdest dream explains it as Well the world was the same but a train showed up. And? That's it. Everything else was completely normal. Weak. 4 If I wanted to watch Call of Duty I'd play the game. All of the shootout scenes looked like they were taken from Game Informer magazine screen shots. 5 How come when they went to Limbo it was in DiCaprio's mind? Can anyone explain that? Is there just one Limbo that in all this movie world's history of dream exploration but only he and his stupid wife got to and did stuff in? Or was his team two of whom knew how messed up in the head he was too dumb to say Why don't we keep you out of this and go into someone else's head just in case this turns out badly?. 6 As far as 9 out of 10 really folks? go watch Citizen Kane Lawrence of Arabia or even The Dark Crystal if you want a good movie that can standup to even the most mediocre critical observation.".

	schema:headline " A Potpourri of Vestiges Review Buuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture till date";
	schema:reviewBody "Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre or inquisitively titillating depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia The Prestige Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag which gave him the carte blanche that a storyteller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu who wants him to do an inception planting information into someone's mind. In order to accomplish this unprecedented task Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe Ellen Page and Joseph GordonLevitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet but whether it would become Buuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado but also for the average viewer who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS One has to imagine it to believe it. 910httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie attempts to turn something into history. By treating both sides of the intense conflict between the leftist terrorists and the political elite of postwar West Germany in the 70s and 80s with equal respect its main message is perhaps this it's all over. The movie shrugs off the ideologies involved and turns its focus on the two biographies of Grams and Herrhausen instead.Some of the previous comments have remarked that those two really didn't have much in common. Even their involvement with terrorism wasn't particularly similar  Herrhausen the banker was simply a victim. He had known of course that he was a likely target but only his death not his life was molded by the RAF terrorist movement. Grams on the other hand was a terrorist for roughly two decades and died most probably by suicide during a shootout with the police. I believe that the only way in which these two biographies could be linked without a tremondous and strained analytic effort was by representing them both as parts of an historical phenomenon. The movie doesn't really need a clear connection between its two protagonists other than this they're part of the same historical constellation. It doesn't aim at explaining this constellation. It aims at telling us that it IS historical.How could this be of interest to German audiences? While I don't want to reduce the movie's appeal to this  there's a lot of intriguing material in it  I think the explanation lies in the German present not in the past. Mostly unnoticed overshadowed by the more severe transformations in the Eastern part of the country the old West has changed quite thoroughly as well. And the changes are accompanied by certain tendencies of framing recent history in collective memory as it were. We now like to regard all the political conflicts of the years before 1989 as finished and done with. Germany we want to believe is totally different from what it was back then. This urge for discontinuity is rather questionable actually... Anyway that's where both the fascination and the problems and perhaps the ultimate failure of the film lie. Or so I think.".

Mostly unnoticed overshadowed by the more severe transformations in the Eastern part of the country the old West has changed quite thoroughly as well. And the changes are accompanied by certain tendencies of framing recent history in collective memory as it were. We now like to regard all the political conflicts of the years before 1989 as finished and done with. Germany we want to believe is totally different from what it was back then. This urge for discontinuity is rather questionable actually... Anyway that's where both the fascination and the problems and perhaps the ultimate failure of the film lie. Or so I think.";

	schema:reviewBody "Feeling like a swan song 82year old French auteur Jacques Rivette's Around a Small Mountain is a charming and utterly captivating lament for the passing of time. At 84 minutes long the shortest Rivette film to date it evokes nostalgia for a bygone era of small traveling shows and circuses with their posters peeling underneath last summer's morning glory vine shows that relied on an intimate connection between performers and audience. Set in the Languedoc region of Southern France the mountain in the original title is the Pic Saint Loup but it can also be said to reflect the mountain that one woman must climb to be liberated from the stranglehold of the memories that have run her life.The main form of entertainment in the mountain village is a singletent circus performed to a sparse audience. Though Alexandre Andr Marcon one of the clowns says We're the last classics but they refuse to rung the curtain down. As the film opens Kate Jane Birkin a former circus performer now a textile designer in Paris is stranded on a country road as her car breaks down. Her improbable but charming savior is an Italian traveler Vittorio Sergio Castellitto who bypasses her then turns around and comes back to help. Without saying a word he fixes her car and leaves without saying goodbye. Of course the two are destined to meet again and it is at the circus in the nearby town that Kate is revisiting after an absence of fifteen years. Vittorio takes an interest in Kate and impulsively decides to rent a room above a caf and attend the circus performance that evening.At the show Vittorio watches a routine perhaps performed hundreds of times that involves two clowns a bunch of ordinary dinner plates and a pistol. From the audience Vittorio emits a burst of laughter an unlikely event that startles even the performers. Although the antics of the clowns seem tired and outdated and much of the humor seems strained there is still a certain magic in the performance that brings back the memory of days gone by. Gradually we learn that the circus was once owned by Kate's father and that she left fifteen years ago after her lover Antoine died in a tragic onstage accident an event that has been buried deep within her and one that she has been reluctant to confront. Vittorio does not overtly convey any romantic intentions yet he pursues his interest in Kate in a laid back understated way. Though she is withholding and aloof their relationship is sweet and their conversations very real. She states that she does not want to change because she has gotten used to her pain but softens as Vittorio tells her The dragons in your life are no more than princesses longing to be free. With the aid of the other circus performers that include Marlo Jacques Bonnaff Kate's daughter Clmence JulieMarie Parmentier a trapeze artist her niece Margot Helene de Vallombreuse Wilfrid Tintin Orsoni and Alexandre Kate is assisted by her fiends to face her demons.Though Around a Small Mountain is playful it is also enigmatic as witness one sequence in which the actors emerge from a tent then circle around to come out again offering a phrase or moral directly to the camera any of which could apply to the film. As we come to realize the circus is like life and according to Vittorio the most dangerous place in the world but Kate's willingness to come to terms with her fears make it also the place where everything is possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is very short for a Rivette film and its delineation of his themes is correspondingly clear simple skeletal  suited to the simplicity of the little dying circus whose director has himself recently died and whose remaining members say this is its last tour. Castellitto's character encounters Birkin's on the road when the vehicle she's driving which pulls the circus tent has broken down. He arrives in a shiny German sports car like the deus ex machina that he is  the present equivalent of Cocteau's motorcycles.An essay by the French critic Hlne Frappat relates this to other Rivette films and analyzes its themes. This can be found on the Groupement Gnral des Cinmas de Recherche website and there is also a translation of the essay into English online. This provides a skeleton key to the skeleton key so to speak.Ms. Frappat doesn't mention it but Vittorio Castellitto falls in love with Kate Birkin from then on and yet after lingering around the circus for a week or two he is called on to business in Spain and leaves her. By participating in a reenactment of the dangerous whip trick that had accidentally killed the most important person in her life 15 years earlier Kate is purged of the lingering sorrow and guilt she has been feeling. She may not presumably return to her Paris occupation of dyeing cloth for designers. I tend to agree with 'Variety' reviewer Boyd Van Hoeij that Jane Birkin's performance is more emotionally rich and her character is more rounded than Sergio Castellitto's. Castellitto is a versatile pro and it's a bit surprising  perhaps he's overawed?  that he doesn't endow Vittorio with more nuance. As Van Hoeij also notes Rivette uses a lot of improvisation and potentially the most fun are the clown numbers intentionally threadbare at the outset then enriched at Vittorio's presumptuous suggestion in subsequent performances. The artificiality of the film is underlined by the fact that during the circus acts the audience is almost never seen.The film may provide a kind of skeleton key to Rivette as Castellitto's quoted remark suggests and thus may specially appeal to students of his work. On the other hand it lacks the richness of the director's preceding three films the 2001 'Histoire de Marie et Julien''The Story of Marie and Julien' the 2003 'Va savoir' and the 2007 'Ne touchez pas la hache''The Duchess of Langeais.' But in its simplicity clarity and its sense of resolution this is very much an enlightened artist's late work and resembles Shakespeare's late Pastoral romances.Nominated for the Golden Lion at Venice. Shown as a part of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "AROUND A SMALL MOUNTAIN aka 36 Vues Du Pic Saint Loup is the latest and possibly final film from French director Jacques Rivette one of the acknowledged masters of the French New Wave. This is a slight film from the veteran and at a brief 85 minutes it is certainly his shortest. Its thin plot is set against the backdrop of a small traveling circus that is playing to empty houses. It stars Italian actor Sergio Castellitto as Vittorio a man who stops and helps stranded motorist Kate Jane Birkin a performer who is rejoining the circus after a long absence. Vittorio follows the circus around from town to town for a week and a tentative romance develops between him and Kate. As usual Rivette's film is a mix of comedy drama romance and the abstract musings on the mysteries of life with minimal action and minimal dialogue much of it obtuse and artificial. This poignant film deals with themes of grief loss regret and redemption and it treats the world as a stage as Rivette uses this insular world of performers to hold up a mirror to our own lives. The mountain of the title is more of a metaphorical one. Rivette interrupts the personal drama with reprisals of an oldfashioned clown routine. The cast includes many regulars who have appeared in the director's previous films. Around A Small Mountain may be slight Rivette but for admirers of this 81yeaold director's unique style and his languorous pacing that will be more than enough to satisfy them. For others though this may prove to be a bit slow and dull.".

I was in my Yul Brynner phase when this one came out and I can still see it over and overmuch as I feel about The Magnificent Seven the Return of the Seven The Journey or The King and I. I couldn't help but wonder if he actually played that harpsichord. He obviously couldn't sing and only spoke the song while he played the tune on the lady's harpsichord.Yul Brynner was a smoker and the cigar is ever present. I met him in 1972 out in Malibu and I asked him if he could quit smoking for his health's sake. He said Nope. Too hooked. He was and sadly for his fans it was his undoing. He signed a photo for me for my birthday that year which I still cherish. The world lost a great actor when he passed. He was the best in a Western wearing black and walking that walk...a man of few words.".

I was in my Yul Brynner phase when this one came out and I can still see it over and overmuch as I feel about The Magnificent Seven the Return of the Seven The Journey or The King and I. I couldn't help but wonder if he actually played that harpsichord. He obviously couldn't sing and only spoke the song while he played the tune on the lady's harpsichord.Yul Brynner was a smoker and the cigar is ever present. I met him in 1972 out in Malibu and I asked him if he could quit smoking for his health's sake. He said Nope. Too hooked. He was and sadly for his fans it was his undoing. He signed a photo for me for my birthday that year which I still cherish. The world lost a great actor when he passed. He was the best in a Western wearing black and walking that walk...a man of few words.";

When Weaver who fought on the Confederate side finds that his house and farm had been auctioned by Brewster as enemy property he guns down the man who had acquired his farm and stole his girlfriend Ruth Adams Janice Rule. Now the town wants payback and hires a selfappointed dispenser of instant justice.Nattily dressed in a black suit and a ruffled white shirt Jules is the strong silent type equally adept at playing poker reciting poetry and playing the harpsichord as he is engaging in work and play with his guns. He is well paid to finish the job but soon discovers that his prospective victim may be more honest than those who are joined against him. Although he makes the statement that he is no longer human Jules' actions prove otherwise as he develops a sympathy for Weaver becomes attracted to Ruth and finds aid and comfort with the Mexicans in the village who have been shunted to the outskirts of town by the corrupt bosses. When Jules seething with frustration goes on a drunken rampage and nearly destroys the town single handedly Sam makes a truce with Matt to get rid of the mysterious stranger and the showdown is set.Yul Brynner turns in a compelling performance as the son of a slave who wants justice more than another payday. While there is a tendency in many films to glorify murderers for hire we can relate to Jules more as a flawed human being with a troubled past than as a coldblooded killer. Unfortunately the other characters are not as well developed and George Segal seems miscast as the vengeful war veteran. Janice Rule is lovely but is given little to do except stand around and look pensive. The less said about the musical score the better. Suffice to say it did not add to the pleasure of watching this film. Being a Yul Brynner fan however I found Invitation to a Gunfighter a satisfying experience a film whose themes of racism and interracial love were advanced even for 1964 when consciousness about civil rights was exploding.".

But as Shakespeare most memorably put it all are punished.It is a trifle heavy on the morality and I'm guessing a vehicle dreamt up for Brynner. But I still stand by this film as an all time favourite. I really like the interaction between Brynner and Janet Rule whose low voice and gentle persuasion chip away at the gunfighter's hard edges. For all its imperfections it has some of those ingredients I always want to see in a film flawed but compelling characters a troubled romance a different world peopled by humans not heroes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Invitation to a Gunfighter is a film searching for a consistent tone. By turns it's stilted silly and melodramatic and the result is mostly just confusing. The kernels of a very good movie are present but often left unpopped. For example the town is initially portrayed as morally upright and Brynner's character as amoral and the film tries to flip this on its head. The trouble is we rarely see anything to prove this instead we're forced to fill in the blanks ourselves from sparse pieces of vague dialogue. The story is so buried in subtext and so much is not shown that scenes like Yul Brynner's drunken rampage is robbed of its dramatic potential because we haven't seen anything that would seem to justify it. On it's own that could have been a powerful idea since Brynner's character is given a backstory like nothing these townsfolk have ever known but in that case the movie devotes far too much time to the troubles of the townsfolk instead of focusing on Brynner's inner turmoil.The acting is all over the board in this one as well. Brynner's performance can't be faulted he's his usual simmering silent presence but seems miscast in a role which could have been quite interesting if it weren't so poorlywritten. Janice Rule seems confused in her role as Ruth Adams and well she should be forced to serve as the love interest betweencount themthree men all trying to kill each other at some point or another and spends most of it looking vaguely sad and disinterested and Pat Hingle is neither evil enough nor serious enough to make a compelling villain. Clifford David fares better as the perpetually angry Crane and George Segal as the unfortunate Matt Weaver is just about the only member of the cast that seems to have any idea what he's doing. The rest of the townsfolk are a mixture of clichs and stereotypes that make it seem as though Yul Brynner mistakenly wandered onto the set of Blazing Saddles. Brynner's presence and the multilayered operatic scale of the plot might warrant repeat viewings and the film should be credited for trying to tackle weighty issues of morality and racism but ultimately Gunfighter misses its mark. The classic mantra in storytelling is show don't tell and this film doesn't do that rendering what should have been a very good movie into a very mediocre one.".

Years later I saw it again in 2006 and still had the same view I have since watched it 3 more times.This is without a doubt for me Yul Brynner's best film from what I have seen. I am not really a fan of his but in this movie he gives a truly commanding performance that stands out. From the opening moment you see him hoisting himself onto the roof of the moving carriage to sit at the front by the driver until the ending where he makes Brewster The town's crooked boss played by Pat Hingle kneel and admit his ways it is compelling viewing. The sexual tension between Brynner and Janice Rule simmers below the surface. The moral issues explored such as racism in the town are quite weighty although they are more implied than rammed down your throat. Also Union and confederate allegiance issues exist in this town even after the war is over.Matt Weaverplayed well by a young George Segal returns home from the war to find his house sold out from under him. Then he is wrongfully accused of murder and the town having been whipped up into a frenzy by Brewster decide to hire a gunfighter to kill him. The job is eventually taken by Brynner and there is an interesting twist where the tables are turned when the town feel the gunfighter is not earning his money.This film kept me fully entertained with its strong performances from the three leads and other decent performances too from the rest of the cast. Although this is not one of the all time great westerns it is certainly one not to miss and any western fan should seek it out. 710".

Invitation To A Gunfighter in spite of starring Yul Brynner George Segal Brad Dexter Pat Hingle and Strother Martin and being directed by Orson Welles collaborator Richard Wilson is ploddingly paced and acted like a low budget C movie. The score from David Raksin is intrusive and completely out of sync with the nature of the piece whilst the back lot location is all too evident.The piece briefly picks up entering the final third where thankfully Brynner is asked to earn his pay outside of walking around glumly but it's a false dawn as the finale has all the excitement of a runny nose. I'm in the minority judging by the comments written for this film thus far so maybe it caught me at a bad time but the chances of me ever seeking this one out again are remote to say the least. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "Invitation to a Gunfighter doesn't qualify as your typical horse opera. This loquacious pretentious and ultimately sluggish sagebrusher about racism and civil rightsa little ahead of its timeforeshadowed Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter about a gunfighter hired by a town to protect it from a triggerhappy former Confederate soldier. Clearly producer  director Richard Wilson and wife Elizabeth had other ideas in mind when they contrived their offbeat screenplay from veteran television writer Alvin Sapinsley's adaptation of a story by Johnny Carson's Tonight Show monologue writers Hal Goodman and Larry Klein. Invitation to a Gunfighter bears the burden of social consciousness. Can you imagine its executive producer Stanley Kramer of The Defiant Ones Guess Who's Coming to Dinner The Juggler and RPM doing a picture that shunned racism and civil rights? Mind you Kramer also produced the classic Gary Cooper oater High Noon and there is a touch of High Noon in Invitation to a Gunfighter. Although Yul Brynner graces this frontier yarn with its striking presence and modulated performance Invitation to a Gunfighter just isn't very memorable. For example our antiheroic gunman doesn't demonstrate his marksmanship until 43 minutes into the story and he provides only an exhibition of his shooting skills without actually either wounding or killing anybody.Ostensibly the story takes place in the New Mexico Territory in 1865 after the conclusion of the American Civil War. A lone Confederate soldier Matt Weaver George Segal of The Owl and the Pussycat who has spent five weeks walking home returns to find his farm where he had buried his mother in the hands of a former Union soldier John Medford Russel Johnson of TV's Gilligan's Island mustered out of General Grant's army. Naturally Weaver is shocked by this revelation and rampages into Pecos to confront Brewster about the sale of his property. In the process Weaver's arrival awakens several townspeople chiefly a onearmed former Union soldier Crane Adams Clifford David of Fort Apache the Bronx and Adams pursues Weaver into Brewster's house where he wounds him in the arm. The sheriff veteran character actor Bert Freed hauls Weaver off to jail where Doc Barker Alfred Ryder urges Weaver to hightail it out of town for good. They explain that his father's farm went on the auction block Brewster bought it and sold it to Medford. Eventually Weaver kills Medford and occupies the property. The Civil War claimed its share of sons and husbands from the town of Pecos and has a dire shortage of young fit headstrong men prepared to confront the single Confederate. The town boss Brewster Pat Hingle of Hang'em High has dispatched Crane to Santa Fe to hire a gunslinger. When Crane shows up with a twogun kid Dancer Dal Jenkins of Will Penny who he has promised 300 Jules runs him out of town with the merest flick of his hand. Indeed Jules stands in the shadows of a veranda and his presence scares Dancer off. Brewster is furious and Crane explains that the best gunfighterJuleshad already left town. Jules step out of the shadows and presents himself to Brewster and the town. The hotel innkeeper recognizes the Creole gunslinger. Meanwhile Brewster has trouble pronouncing Jules' name so Jules give him a lesson in pronunciation. Soft g silent s Jules teaches Brewster D'Estaigjust a touch of diphthong. Predictably Brewster still cannot correctly pronounce Jules' name but he forks over 500 to the stuckup Creole gunfighter Jules Gaspard d'Estaing Yul Brynner of The Magnificent Seven to kill Weaver. Brewster ignores the cries of Doc Barker who complains that Brewster is dispensing the legal right of due process so that Matt could tell his side of the story. Later we learn that Medford lied to Weaver and forced him to kill him in selfdefense. Jules however isn't your ordinary paid gunman. He has a mind of his own and dictates his own terms. He refuses to ride out to Weaver's ranch and kill him. Instead he elects to stay in Pecos board at the emporium and wait for the starving ammunition hungry Weaver to arrive so he can shoot it out with him.Later we learn that Matt lose not only his farm but he also lost the woman that he wanted to wed Ruth Janice Rule of The Swimmer who has married the onearmed Crane. Initially Crane argues against allowing Jules to board in the emporium but Brewster wins out and Jules watches the stormy relationship between the unhappily married Crane and Ruth. Crane's loss of his arm has soured him and turned him to liquor. Crane can no longer play the harpsichord. Jules appears to be proficient with the musical instrument. Interestingly Brynner would play a piano in Frank Kramer's Adios Sabata several years later. Ruth wants to know if she can dissuade Jules from killing Matt. Jules sums up the town in a brief speech. I'm in business for money and pleasure too. A town that hires a gunfighter is always a henhouse with just one rooster a few fat capons a few clipped wings. What happens when a man with a gun walks in? Nevertheless Jules behaves oddly. He visits the Hispanic population across the bridge that divides the town into separate entities. The Hispanic spokesman confides in Jules about Matt He is the only man here who treats us like men. Indeed the Mexicans bring food but he still needs ammunition so he tries to steal from the emporium. Jules confronts Weaver but refuses to kill him initially because he wants to get an idea who is adversary is.The ending of Invitation to a Gunfighter is not what you would expect. The characters shoot off their mouths more than their sixguns. The dialogue is eloquent but the action is virtually nonexistent Brynner's Magnificent Seven costar Brad Dexter is squandered in a superficial supporting role as a chiseling stable keeper who tries to sell the protagonist a lame horse.".

It's always a pleasure to watch Yul Brenner at work and he really carries this movie. George Segal is okay as his presumed antagonist but the real bad guys in this movie are not so easily identified.

The guy was afraid of his own shadow.Jules Gaspard d'Estaing Yul Brynner maintains that he's 'not human' while relying on a fast gun and an unusual insight into the human condition as he sizes up the residents of the small Western town. Hired to kill a returning Confederate soldier George Segal who threatens to shake up the existing order in the proUnion town 'Jewel' begins to realize that his intended victim has more integrity and courage than the folks who hired him. A not so subtle backdrop of racism against Mexicans in the divided town also works it's affect upon the Creole born gunman.Personally if I were handling the script I wouldn't have had d'Estaing resort to a drunken rampage to bring the town to it's knees. I feel he would have had a more forceful impact if he'd taken on the town head on. However I found the exchange between Jewel and the citizens kind of interesting. When the sheriff Bert Freed drew down on him Jewel shot the gun out of his hand but when Crane Adams Clifford David did the same he was shot dead for his trouble. It made me wonder if Crane's shooting was fatal because of Jewel's professed love for Ruth Adams Janice Rule or whether the shooting angle provided no other way to defend himself.I'm a little conflicted on Brynner's performance here. Perhaps because Jules d'Estaing was a conflicted individual himself trying to find his way in an unsettled West with a history of personal abuse and racism himself. I thought his characterization would have been helped if he took his own advice as given to Ruth Adams and that was to smile once in a while.".

This and the fact that it's dialoguedriven rather than actionoriented give it a TVWestern vibe the action mainly takes place at the close. You have to listen closely to catch all the verbiage. Despite these arguable drawbacks there are several things to appreciate particularly Brynner's charisma as the mysterious gunfighter he made baldness cool. There's a revelation about him in the last act that I didn't see coming. Rule plays a quality character and is easy on the eyes plus it's interesting seeing Segal when he was so young. The tone's mostly serious with a couple worthy insights but there are also some amusing moments like when Jules Gaspard d'Estaing Yul gives instructions on the proper pronunciation of his name.

	schema:reviewBody "Gang of Four is hard to find words for. However I think it does address in a detached and engaging manner the themes of comingofage and community in the lives of several young women at an elite prestigious acting school? And gender seems to be the most specific definer of these themes. The teacher Constance at some point in her professional career made the decision to exclude male students from her school. This in turn informs the lives of her young actors who are each expected to play male role and female roles.

	onyx:emotionText "Gang of Four is hard to find words for. However I think it does address in a detached and engaging manner the themes of comingofage and community in the lives of several young women at an elite prestigious acting school? And gender seems to be the most specific definer of these themes. The teacher Constance at some point in her professional career made the decision to exclude male students from her school. This in turn informs the lives of her young actors who are each expected to play male role and female roles. Claude seems especially affected by this form of teaching and experiences much confusion in discerning men and in her own gender identity.Lucia another of the four has disgraced her family over her refusal to marry a preselected husband.

What I liked about Gang of Four was how the four main characters the girls in the acting class who share a small house together have a way of turning everything into a dramatization of things as their alternative to such a packed in environment that is squeezed progressively tighter by the mysterious man and the ambiguously existent conspiracy he speaks of.The reason I don't have much else to say is because Rivette's direction seems too static somehow but there is intrigue in his style and in his stories.

Yul Brynner plays Sheriff a righteous Arab revolutionary while Sal Mineo plays his young disciple who sets him free from captivity and certain death. An Arab nurse Madlyn Rhue an embezzling oil worker Jack Warden and a mad Arab Anthony Caruso are also along for the ride. Can they make it to a bordering nation and freedom or will they all perish in the desert? Although it's Grade B and cartoony in comparison to the way more popular and sophisticated desert film Lawrence of Arabia also from '62 Escape to Zahrain is actually more compelling which is different than saying it's better it's not. It's just more immediately satisfying. Two other survivalinthedesert films that Zahrain brings to mind are Flight of the Phoenix and Sands of the Kalahari both released in 1965. If you like those two films you'll definitely like this one. As great as they are Zahrain is as good or better.There's some serious action at the beginning and end of the film but the heart of the picture is the long trek through the desert and the interplay of the characters. Sheriff Brynner and Ahmed Mineo have had it with the corrupt officials of Zahrain who rape the land with the technology of the Americans but then greedily keep the cash for their own filthy rich lifestyles meanwhile the citizenry wallows in poverty and ignorance. The nurse Madlyn was educated in Europe and doesn't understand the reckless passion of the revolutionaries. She's against them because she's nursed the wounded  dying followers of Sheriff mostly youths. The American Huston Warden is viewed as part of the problem by the revolutionaries but they need him to escape and survive. And then you have the freakin' crazy Arab Tahar Caruso also called Frankenstein or Franky by Huston. Is he friend or foe or neither? Also on hand is a pleasant cameo by a major star from that time period but I don't want to give it away.The film was shot in the Mojave Desert California but you'd hardly know as the filmmakers did a great job of giving the illusion that it's somewhere in the Middle East. My wife for instance guessed that it was shot in Egypt.At 93 minutes the film doesn't overstay its welcome.FINAL WORD Despite being a serious Grade B picture Escape from Zahrain is Grade A in heart. The film is bookended by quality action sequences but its core is characterdriven. You get to know these characters as they trek through the sweltering desert. Their strengths and weaknesses are revealed and you can't help but start to care for them just as they develop a sense of community amongst themselves.Criminally underrated and unknown Escape to Zahrain ranks with the best desert films Grade B though it is. It's also one of Yul's best and the other principles. No kidding.GRADE A".

	schema:headline " Brynner on the run";
	schema:reviewBody "With an obligatory bow for a few political polemics regarding the Middle East Escape From Zahrain is essentially an action adventure film about the leader of a rebel faction being broken out of custody and escaping from a Middle Eastern principality. Zahrain is a mythical country along the lines of MuscatOman Yemen or Qatar or better still the more well known Kuwait. With the ruling class living fabulously wealthy lives due to oil most of the people are barely scratching out a living. In the next century a place like Zahrain would be a breeding ground for terrorists.Yul Brynner is the rebel leader and Sal Mineo is an idealistic student who leads a group that springs Brynner and a few others who are along for the ride. They include some common criminal types Anthony Caruso and Jay Novello and one unusual one in Jack Warden formerly employed by the big oil cartel but now in prison for embezzlement. Can't be too pleasant for him in a third world jail. Losing the truck they escaped in they hijack due to Warden an ambulance belonging to the oil company and get driver Leonard Strong and nurse Madelyn Rhue as well.

	onyx:emotionText "With an obligatory bow for a few political polemics regarding the Middle East Escape From Zahrain is essentially an action adventure film about the leader of a rebel faction being broken out of custody and escaping from a Middle Eastern principality. Zahrain is a mythical country along the lines of MuscatOman Yemen or Qatar or better still the more well known Kuwait. With the ruling class living fabulously wealthy lives due to oil most of the people are barely scratching out a living. In the next century a place like Zahrain would be a breeding ground for terrorists.Yul Brynner is the rebel leader and Sal Mineo is an idealistic student who leads a group that springs Brynner and a few others who are along for the ride. They include some common criminal types Anthony Caruso and Jay Novello and one unusual one in Jack Warden formerly employed by the big oil cartel but now in prison for embezzlement. Can't be too pleasant for him in a third world jail. Losing the truck they escaped in they hijack due to Warden an ambulance belonging to the oil company and get driver Leonard Strong and nurse Madelyn Rhue as well.

It's the sense of reverie in the walking around for Rivette  a cinematic flaneur  the city has to be walked in order to yield its insight. The insight is in the train tracks that lead out atop the Arc in the construction developments at the outskirts of Paris where now at the outskirts of fiction the world is a mass of gaping and colorless structures.

	schema:reviewBody "Rivette in minor selfimitative mode echoes of Duelle and Celine et Julie vont en bateau exploring one of his usual obsessions  a suspected vast conspiracy uncovered and struggled against by glamorous looking women. Carelessly plotted and filmed the boom makes frequent appearances at the top of the frame and one wishes that the clangorous natural soundtrack had been cleaned up at least of traffic noise the film's best aspect is the Parisian setting  here a city seemingly under assault by developers  many of the locations are in a state of decay transition or destruction  this is not the Paris seen either by tourists or in most movies. As Marie LaFee Bulle Ogier has just been released from a year's sentence she finds it impossible to breathe when she enters an interior hence there is not a single indoor shot in the movie apart from a brief elevated train trip and a night spent in a parked car  and even these are open to the outdoors. After encountering Baptiste Pascale Ogier three times according to Baptiste once is accident twice is chance three times is fate Marie pairs up with this strange young woman who fancies herself as Marie's protector from the allseeing Maxes spies who are everywhere. Marie encounters her former lover Julien Pierre Clementi and the two women deduce from a briefcase full of newspaper clippings and a map of Paris divided into 64 segments that he is involved in some sort of conspiracy all three are followed by a threatening but ineffectual Max JeanFrancois Stevenin. There are elements of fairy tales the lions the dragon in the playground and scifi the eyes which Baptiste feels compelled to slash the spider web but despite the pervasive humorlessness it's hard to take this movie seriously. The whole thing seems like a silly trifle concocted primarily for the amusement of the participant's  especially at the end when Rivette seems to abandon the film completely and simply keeps the camera rolling on a martial arts lesson between two of the actors.Still worth seeing for Paris and the always wonderful Bulle Ogier. Rivette is never uninteresting even when he's not entirely successful.Seen March 27 2007 at Florence Gould Hall at the French Institute NYC.".

Carelessly plotted and filmed the boom makes frequent appearances at the top of the frame and one wishes that the clangorous natural soundtrack had been cleaned up at least of traffic noise the film's best aspect is the Parisian setting  here a city seemingly under assault by developers  many of the locations are in a state of decay transition or destruction  this is not the Paris seen either by tourists or in most movies. As Marie LaFee Bulle Ogier has just been released from a year's sentence she finds it impossible to breathe when she enters an interior hence there is not a single indoor shot in the movie apart from a brief elevated train trip and a night spent in a parked car  and even these are open to the outdoors. After encountering Baptiste Pascale Ogier three times according to Baptiste once is accident twice is chance three times is fate Marie pairs up with this strange young woman who fancies herself as Marie's protector from the allseeing Maxes spies who are everywhere. Marie encounters her former lover Julien Pierre Clementi and the two women deduce from a briefcase full of newspaper clippings and a map of Paris divided into 64 segments that he is involved in some sort of conspiracy all three are followed by a threatening but ineffectual Max JeanFrancois Stevenin. There are elements of fairy tales the lions the dragon in the playground and scifi the eyes which Baptiste feels compelled to slash the spider web but despite the pervasive humorlessness it's hard to take this movie seriously. The whole thing seems like a silly trifle concocted primarily for the amusement of the participant's  especially at the end when Rivette seems to abandon the film completely and simply keeps the camera rolling on a martial arts lesson between two of the actors.Still worth seeing for Paris and the always wonderful Bulle Ogier. Rivette is never uninteresting even when he's not entirely successful.Seen March 27 2007 at Florence Gould Hall at the French Institute NYC.";

Le Pont Du Nord is at the tail end of this streak and is a minor achievement in comparison. However.Even minor Rivette is fascinating and the prospect of a female Quixote traveling through a late 70s Paris in a period of destructionreconstruction with call backs to the radical '60s and a sly nod to Fassbender's Third Generation and a score by Astor Piazzola is enough to make anyone excited. There is something else too that I have not seen much commented on the friendship between the two female leads related as they were in real life is a genuine pleasure to watch and exists somewhere other than acting as we are used to thinking of it. Generally recommended for fans of the director and the performersI would say very strongly recommended no hesitation.".

Together the crew receives a summons to fly into raging Pacific storm at night to risk life and limb and rescue a raft load of Japanese survivors on the verge of drowning. The film is a stark reminder of what these courageous men face in their tireless efforts to save lives. Excellent acting from Widmark Brynner and Chakiris make this a worthy tribute to the profession. Unfortunately the clumsy use of miniatures and models diminishes the visual power of this fine movie.

The US Airforce vehicle of choice to perform these rescues was a seaplane made by Grumann aircraft named the Albatross. This airplane was designed to make open ocean landings even during inclement weather conditions. Flying these missions was considered very hazardous peace time duty.

The three are Colonel Richard Widmark Lieutenant George Chakiris and Sergeant Yul Brynner. You're supposed to take only essentials but in this situation all three men are taking a lot of baggage along. Both Widmark and Brynner met and lost their true loves during World War II and Chakiris blames himself for the deaths of several people during another mission ten years earlier that both Widmark and Brynner were on.There are some very nice flying and rescue sequences in Flight From Ashiya aviation buffs will love this film.Best performance in the film has to be Yul Brynner the half Japanese half Polish American sergeant who decided to make a career of the Armed Services even after World War II. My guess is that Brynner probably served in the 443rd Division of Nisei and served in Italy as well as North Africa where his flashback takes place.Widmark was a civilian pilot who ran an airline in the Phillipines before World War II where he met Shirley Knight. What happens to both of them after Pearl Harbor and the invasion of the Phillipines shapes Widmark's attitudes. Last year Dennis Quaid and Ashton Kutcher did a film about the Coast Guard Rescue Force called Swimmer. A lot of Flight From Ashiya was incorporated into that film.

	schema:reviewBody "This is despite a fairly epic attempt at storytelling and a heavyweight cast a snoozefest. The pacing is very dry and ultimately predictable and the storyline is trite contrived and pat. Widmark Chakiris and Brynner are on a rescue mission and as their plane approaches it's destination each of them has a flashback to another dramatic time for them. Chakiris' is the most believable as he recalls a tragic rescue attempt of some villagers caught in an icy mountain range. Widmark recalls meeting a photojournalist Knight and falling in love against a wartorn backdrop. Brynner remembers meeting a foreign girl Gaubert who he can only communicate with visually since they don't speak each others' language. Parker gets the film's most pointless  thankless role as a woman who pines for Brynner back at the base. The film ranges from stodgy to overwrought with many unintentionally amusing moments and some really ripe dialogue. Made at a time when studios were still getting used to a little more freedom with immorality it wants desperately to be cutting edge and racy yet is hopelessly oldfashioned and silly. There is NO attempt at period flavor. Knight's story is set in 1941 yet her hair and clothing are early sixties she even wears a skirt almost identical to Parker's whose story takes place in 1964! Her awesome mane of hair could easily have been styled into a neato '40's 'do but alas no one did. Widmark and Knight's story tries to cram a twohourmovie's worth of clichs and dramatics into about 20 minutes. They literally fall hopelessly in love after one plane ride! The same can be said of Brynner's affair. He gives his seat to a girl on a bus and then can't live without her. This whole section of the film is ludicrous but Gaubert is quite lovely. The ending of this sequence is surreal and jawdropping! It must be seen to be believed and is almost worth sitting through the film for. There are worse ways to spend two hours but this is hardly rewarding entertainment. There is also a hilarious before and after narration by a man who sounds like he did voiceover for army recruitment shorts.".

However in fairness he was a civilian pilot married to a beautiful photographer when both were captured by the Japanese and place in an internment read work until you die camp.Japanese soldiers are usually depicted as introspective souls that carry out their duties only after tortuous reflections on their lives as in Bridge Over the River Kwai. This movie didn't follow that formula but didn't get into the real details of camp life either.Yule Bryner doesn't appear to be Japanese but then he didn't like the King of Siam either.

As might be expected there's a framing story about an AirSea rescue. This story runs far too long for the limited amount of interest it generates. One of the problems is that we don't know the people who are being rescued at all. Although the screenplay tries to work up a bit of interest and sympathy per medium of a young Japanese boy this is so transparent a device and it is too clumsily handled in dialogue acting and direction that it just doesn't work. Within this framing story are set three long flashbacks Widmark has one about his lost love and Brynner has one about his lost love. Between these two there's another which starts off with Widmark then diverts to Chakiris and his first encounter with Widmark! At least he lovely Daniele Gaubert prevents the film from generating total torpor  despite its moderately sized budget location lensing and fair special effects. The movie has also two distinct photographic styles which provide some technical interest in deciding whether the atmospheric lighting is the work of Burnett Guffey and the bland material is Joseph MacDonald's contribution  or vice versa!".

You may remember that epic CGI action sequences at the beginning and a super duper action scene at the end with an extended black hole in the middle that dealt with a covert romantic triangle.Okay. Take that endless middle section full of torment and opposite allegiances like Buridan's ass that starved to death between two bales of hay because he couldn't make up his mind. Now chop that long middle part into three or four shorter parts and interpolate them at regular periods throughout the film. These are the back stories of the three men aboard a Grumman flying boat on a rescue mission in the North China Sea. And  boy are they dull.George Chakiris the young pilot is haunted by the memory of his rescue chopper causing an avalanche in the Alps and killing those he'd intended to rescue. Well that's not a love story but you get the general picture. Chakiris is haunted by guilt and is uncertain about his flying skills. The second story belongs to Richard Widmark the colonel in charge. He was a commercial pilot in World War II captured along with his wife by the Japanese in the Filippines. She was denied medicine by her captors and she and her baby died in child birth. Widmark still hates Japs. These things run deep he mutters.Then we get Yul Brynner's tragedy. A paratrooper in North Africa he falls for a lovely Arab girl but her family forbids the affair to continue. Brynner races to her house shouts up at her window that he'll be back some day and they will be married. Then he must zoom off in a Jeep and join the others on the demolition team. But his girl defies her family and runs after the jeep. She finally catches up with them just after Brynner has lighted the fuses that will blow a brick bridge to smithereens. By happenstance  or Kismet in her case  she comes to a halt just under the bridge flings her arms open wide and shouts MICHEL to Brynner. Boom. She disappears in a puff of smoke like a stage magician.If you think all this misery is too much you still have to suffer through the chief action of the film of which we get glimpses from time to time. Widmark Brynner and Chakiris are still flying that Grumman through a powerful storm to rescue a raft filled with Japanese.Will Widmark hesitate to try a landing in an impossibly heavy and confused sea? Will Brynner talk him into it? Will Widmark finally yield? Does he successfully land the plane? Does he break his arm in doing so? Must Chakiris then take over the controls and get the overloaded flying boat skillfully off the sea and into the air? Are all the crises resolved at the end? You'll have to watch it to find out.I wish it were possible to say that the action scenes  the flying through the storm the scenes on the raft in the tossing swells the Japanese bombing of the Filippines the plowing of the Grumman through the whippedup sea were exciting but they're really not. The airplanes are clearly models and not done very well. The raft scenes were shot in the studio tank. The special effects are hardly an improvement on director Michael Anderson's much superior The Dam Busters made in 1955.I hate to sound sour about this but the performances seem lazy or inept as well. Of course it's difficult for any actor to overcome a stilted script. But to see a mature Yul Brynner stumbling around with a cane trying to speak English to a young woman who speaks only Arabic and French and to hear him using slang words like crazy as if he were fifteen years old is almost grotesque. And here he is with the other members of the combat engineers fighting a delaying action and he and the rest wear the spiffiest cleanest most finely pressed uniforms known to man or beast. Their helmets are as glossy as their boots. Chakiris a good dancer was never much of an actor and this is one of Widmark's most lackadaisical performances.See it if you must but it's not very good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the reason that Rivette is the least popular  yet by far the most secret profound and precious  of the New Wave directors is that he can't be pinned down to a belief. He isn't political though corporate conspiracies are a factor in many of his films he isn't an occultist though his films are filled with Zodiacal symbols the tarot magicians he isn't interested in putting humans under the microscope like Rohmer though he is minutely attentive to what breaks people apart and brings them together. No rather politics the occult and humanity are like the vines tying together the raft through which he floats in the void. They are methods to generate material curiosity and as lit students would say a narrative where none necessarily exists. I hope I'm making this clear  Rivette actually LONGS FOR a worldwide political conspiracy preferably controlled by a dark magus operating from some deceptively plain apartment in Paris with the whole human comedy under his spell because he knows that the alternative what most people call reality would be soul death. He wants more mystery more confusion more action. Unlike Godard he isn't looking for utopias certainly not those that can be brought about by politics he wants the world to be as it is in all its unfathomable malevolent messy beauty.As JeanPierre Kalfon says in L'Amour Par Terre  one of Rivette's most insidious and fascinating films by the way  I don't want to make life better than it is I want life. Rivette like many filmmakers who have disavowed their faith has really only sublimated his religious quest. His obsession with the creative process its false starts abrupt detours and unknown destinations is unmistakably of a spiritual nature. As it turns out he is obsessed with stories because the world as we know it exists in order to contain them. For Rivette God is not an obscure savior  what are we being saved from?  but a generator of fictional material the ultimate creative artist. If the other world is defined by its permanence its frozen perfection this one must contain everything that can possibly exist and the human artist such as Rivette then becomes like a sort of middleman between heaven and earth  he gives form to the transitory thus translating it for eternity.Rivette's strangeness can be boiled down to his attempt to mirror God's mind by disavowing any ultimate truth. God requires stories in order not to be bored stories require a world ruled by space and time where they can play out in a bounded setting with a beginning and end the world requires life in order to act out these stories. Stories in short require that we die. The two words that best describe Rivette's movies dark and childlike come from the fact that to accept that we are in a virtual fictional realm you must become as naive as a child for whom death is not real yet who is subconsciously haunted by what it might mean. We die but only because we're in a play. We die as children but the curtain eventually rises  he finally gives us a peek at what's behind it in his presumably final film Marie et Julien.  All this and more is part of why Rivette is so successful at blending the occult and the everyday  there is nothing more occult than the fact that we're here at all pretending we know what we're doing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I feel lost and out to sea watching this stuff but maybe that's how you're meant to feel? It's like you are watching the rites of a cult. Do you even want to understand? Not me not really. I have this strong feeling that Rivette is a mystic.The outline of the plot is that you have three friends Emily Charlotte and a guy who I think was called Silvano they do a play in an apartment the idea is that the audience turn up and watch in silence whilst being directed around the apartment by a guide. Obviously this is not something you can do for a large audience. Anyway I quite like the idea although the jostling would be unbearable. The play they are doing is basically a theft of an early play from a guy called Roquemaure who just happens to be in the audience.It's also improvised as Silvano is being naughty and is getting himself drunk in reality rather than just drinking ginger ale from the whisky bottle prop. So Roquemaure is appreciating this anyway and decides he's going to get these three Thespians to act in a new play of his which he is going to get them to do in the same style i.e. the audience will follow the players around his mansion. So this is like mutual theft Silvano has stolen Rocquemaure's play Rocquemaure steals Silvano's style. It's not the first act of theft we're going to see here Rocquemaure gets one of the actresses as a supposed audition to do an ad lib the results of which he then impregnates the play with. Rivette really rubs this in towards the end Rocquemaure keeps on writing down things that people say to him for incorporation in future plays. So one of the points of the film perhaps is that art and life are really the same thing and that artists steal from each other. There are also allusions to Rocquemaure's script being modified by his butlerfamulus Virgil behind the scenes. That is that artists are collagists collaborators plagiarists in short not so auteurist as they would have us believe.Anyway it becomes clear that the play Rocquemaure is putting on is really an almost unadulterated transcript of a real life mnage  trois involving himself the magician Paul and a woman called Beatrice set in the very places it happened. Paul is there the whole film observing the rehearsals and sticking his oar in. Rocquemaure as a high jest perhaps has a woman Emily play Paul's part and gives him the name Troppman. Obviously there are romantic liaisons going on throughout this.This is a film that may well reward study there's too much to take in too many implications. What I did catch though were the numerous implications and insights about the creative process. One further one is that it becomes clear that one of the main motivating factors for Emily and Charlotte is the cash and they probably would have stopped working on the play without it as they had lost belief. There are probably religious connotations Rocquemaure is like some sort of Wagnerian God controlling all of these puppets.The film is also very playful at first we think that some of Paul's magic or some of the magic inherent in the magnificently particoloured villa may be malfeasant. However like in a RobbeGrillet movie it's is all heavily disclaimed at some point all we are watching is a fantasy.I love this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "L'amour par terre Love on the Ground begins  as so often with this director  with people doing something that takes a while to be made clear. A group of rather bourgeois men and women climb the stairs in an old apartment building they are ushered into a series of rooms by a set of male twins  the first of many times in the film where the twinning theme will be used. They watch a series of farcical scenes played out between a man Facundo Bo and his two lovers Geraldine Chaplin and Jane Birkin and it becomes clear that they and we are watching a play performed in an actual apartment. A play that quickly spills over into reality as the actor Silvano proceeds to become drunk on the real whiskey that he is drinking instead of prop whiskey  and the playwright Clmont JeanPierre Kalfon responsible for the piece uncredited by Silvano who is apparently director and adapter as well as star turns out to be in the audience.It's just another piece of theater blending into life fantasy intertwined so expertly with reality that it's impossible to say at most points in the film whether we're watching a play a dream reality a vision of the future or a ghost story another marvel from the French man of mystery Jacques Rivette. The three actors far from being chastised by the playwright all end up quickly encamping at Clmont's ridiculously extravagant white classical mansion apparently in Paris when we first see it but with the sound of the sea evident in at least one later scene it is a house on the borderlands between the conscious and unconscious between the players and their roles. Soon Charlotte Chaplin and Emily Birkin are playing roles that we find are thinly veiled autobiographical elements in the playwright's life and soon they seem to spin out of control emotionally and towards insanity as do most of the other guestsactorswriters involved in the improbable scenario.Filled with references to Dante Virgil and Beatrice mythology and early French history Clovis and the Zodiac which appears in mosaic form on the floor of the rotunda of Clmont's mansion with sorcerers and premonitions of death longlost lovers who return at impossible moments this is Rivette's most overtly magical and bizarre film since his pair of mystic genre films from 1976 Duelle and Norot and like those films and much of the best of his work it is so long and complex that one viewing can hardly do it justice or suffice to touch more than a handful of its mysteries. Possibly the most significant of its literarytheatrical references is to Shakespeare both in direct quotation a minor character is translating Hamlet into Finnish and turns out  like many other characters to speak flawless English and to know Shakespeare by heart and in the references to Shakespearian acting conventions as both Emily and Charlotte at different times play the pants role.It may also be the most selfreferential film in an ouevre that is filled with films that spill over into each other with clear nods to Out 1 Cline et Julie vont en bateau and the two 1976 films and many elements that point the way towards later theatricallyinfluenced and ghostentranced works like La Bande des quatres and Histoire de Marie et Julien. And like much of his best work it is completely unpredictable and contains elements of comedy tragedy the surreal and farce mixing in such an elegant fashion that whether the film will end in madness murder love or friendship  or all of the above  remains impossible to guess until the credits roles.A masterpiece rich and complex and a film I will return to over and over....I'm only scratching the surface here.".

It's been adapted very freely from Cyril Tourneur's play The Revenger's Tragedy so the soundtrack shifts from French into English for the more lyrical bits of verse. Music is provided by an onscreen chamber orchestra fiddling away in a corner of a dank Breton castle.No you decide every five minutes or so. It cannot possibly get any more bizarre than this! Lo and behold it promptly does. Bernadette Laffont makes a splendidly wicked Pirate Queen in the crossdressing tradition of Joan Crawford in Johhny Guitar or Barbara Stanwyck in Forty Guns. The normally fragile and tremulous Geraldine Chaplin makes a suprisingly ruthless fullblooded avenger. She must have the most wonderfully long sinuous hands of any screen performer since Max Schreck in Nosferatu.An unmissable treat for anyone who has a weak spot for truly deranged cinema Noroit is widely unavailable these days. Like its companion piece Duelle it's part of a fourpart series that director Jacques Rivette was never able to complete. A great shame! I find both these films utterly compulsive and hypnotic while much of Rivette's later work is tediously dry and academic. Even in the most dismal of wornout video copies taped off some obscure German cable channel at 4 AM Noroit and Duelle are worth seeking out.".

As an experimental film that does not seek to tell a story nor make any impressive aesthetic propositions in the way of say David Lynch it does well to stay in archives. Jacques Rivette is by all means a notable director whose films should be seen but far from being an exemplary work of his Norot is a doodle made in the margin of his white list. At best it gives an insight into the director's character and really should be out of bounds to anybody other than Rivette heavyweights.A lack of a coherent narrative can be compensated for through other means such as through a Beckettian abstract aesthetic or through a Bergmanesque dreamscape. There are numerous films that sack story to discover the other facets of cinema but this one does not sincerely arrive at any kind of relevant revelation. With the liberty to fiddle with cameras and a cast Rivette works out what cinema can't achieve more than what it can. It's viewing interest is comparable to reading the private notes of an established artist or author to better understand how he comes to put together his more meritorious works.That said there are certain moments which suggest that Rivette is indeed trying to communicate with an audience and not just getting on with his personal pursuit. Bearing in mind that this film is adapted from a 5 act play Rivette on occasion inserts the notion that the characters are conscious of the fact that they are actors. To begin with realism or dramatic calibre of any other description is deliberately I presume humiliated by actors who for example shamelessly continue to breathe whilst lying dead on the ground. Also the script somewhat bizarrely alternates between French and high register English at times when they choose to honour the heavier lines of the original script. An infuriating cacophony emerging from the onscreen band of musical pirates provides the soundtrack for the pseudodrama which further reinforces the idea that this film consciously reflects its genre. Perhaps then Norot is a film about itself and behind the chaos is a group of characters desperately trying to find themselves a narrative to fulfil their existence.Still this is a film that is very tiresome to sit through and even if the ideas outlined above were indeed Rivette's intentions there are works that portray them much more neatly. Norot comes across as a tangled mishmash of propositions and is as pleasing as a beginner's violin scale practice.".

Or better yet the film we are watching as devised by unseen minds above shaping its world. Bridged by actors and nonactors who act parts knowingly or unknowingly who may be chess pawns moved in turn by other pawns. The idea is that eventually we never get to find out how much of what we saw was this game and whether or not the game was imagined or masking a sinister plot.So far so good a complex film in which to superimpose the various grids. Yet at the same time not so complex after all rather obvious in how it handles us the various keys.For example describing the play he's staging the director says that he welcomes the challenge of bringing order to the convoluted mesh of different roles that the world of the play is chaotic but not absurd. Does anyone have doubts that we're watching a surrogate Rivette describe the film? Then the stuff about conspiracies. The idea is of course that they may or may not be true yet in getting there we are treated with naive politics about money ruling the world a policed monitored world.In the finale we get some rather interesting insinuations about where the mind conspiring for answers in the face of an uncertain world leads us. When anything is imagined to be possibly true nothing is.The one notion that holds some actual power in all this is precisely the one that is not explicit. A film noir plot elusively unraveling in the background of so much distraction about a mistress and her exlover arranging murders as suicides. Why to what end again open ends. We may or may not imagine this but this ambiguity is ours.We would later find in the films of David Lynch and Raoul Ruiz all this situated back in the imaginative mind where all our fanciful storytelling begins and where the illusionary images bent by desire we use to represent reality are born. In more cinematic ways more fluid. This maintains the appearance of an ordinary world it's talky and the camera is not adventurous. It's never really dangerous except until too late or passionately engaged in its codas.But one of the places this mode begins is here in nascent form. Earlier yet it was film noir which the film references and even innovates in an important way ingenious for its time by making the noir plot the vague inference and the karmic forces of noir the explicit reference and actively recognized by the characters. Although it often appeared clearcut and about a simple crime it was riskier stuff in the right hands.A few more words on this with noir we view a threatening cityscape where cast upon it are shadows of the mind illusions of desire about a woman or money which in turn distort what is perceived of reality. With the postnoir landscapes such as in Lynch we experience instead the world of the mind  now the shadows are inverted they're pieces of reality which seep back as filmic devices which the mind arranges into a movie plot that sustains the illusion! This is for me one of the most fascinating journeys available in cinema from Shangai to Inland Empire and Rivette's film may not have refined as much but it's an important link in the transition.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few critics noting Rivette's general lack of recognition in comparison with Truffaut Godard Rohmer and Chabrol have wondered if his late start might have had anything to do with it this film didn't have its American release until 1962 or a British premiere until 1964 by which point the New Wave was already a wellestablished movement in people's minds and this long 16mm talkfest about conspiracies and theater must have looked weird and out of place even compared to the experimentation of Godard.I'm not so sure. Rivette's films have usually been hermetic worlds unto themselves most readily relatable to each other and to the worlds of theater and other movies  apart from La Religieuse all of Rivette's work over his first 30 years of featuremaking seem to inhabit what has been called his House of Fiction an area just a little off from the real world and one in which obsession madness and duration at 140 minutes Paris is one of his shortest films rule. Also his focus on the lives and romances of women and the nearexclusion of the kinds of macho American gangsterinfluenced characters that inhabit many of Godard's and Truffaut's early films wouldn't be likely to endear him to wider audiences. Interestingly enough Rivette is just as obsessed with Americana as his contemporaries and in fact the first words spoken in this film are in English haltingly read aloud by a young woman in a tiny and somewhat decrepit apartment in Paris.Before this as the credits roll we see Paris a grimy silent and derelictlooking 19thcentury city of endless 5 to 7 story apartments and wide but empty streets our first view is from an unseen train accompanied by eerie music heavy on wailing strings and percussion by Phillippe Arthuys  the soundtrack is spare but frightening and beautiful throughout. A title June 1957 and we enter the world of Anne our young reader and her contemporaries a lost and unfocused group of intellectuals bohemians actors and writers. Anne hears crying and screaming from an apartment next door  the young woman within seems both upset in tears and ecstatic  she know's Anne's brother Pierre who apparently is in danger from somewhere something somewhat  it is unclear  the same danger that murdered Juan and before him Assunta. She has the look of excited madness as she claims that the whole world in fact is in danger. Anne is confused she meets Pierre at a caf and he shrugs it off.Next we find Anne and Pierre both at a party lots of mostly young intellectuals squeezed into another tiny apartment  a man plays guitar and the conversation revolves around this same Juan who was also a guitarist and composer only it appears that he committed suicide  or did he? We are also introduced to Philip Kaufman apparently a famous American writer though he seems destitute and unhinged here. There are cameos by the director and Claude Chabrol and the talk is charged and political but directionless. Snatches of conversation withheld glances bespeak something going on conspiracies and traitors and some evil that hangs over everyone...eventually Anne accompanies Philip on a long walk filmed very much like a scene out of a hardedged American noir where he expounds on his own conspiracy theories. Everything it seems revolves around this Juan and when Anne falls in with a troupe of actors rehearsing a seemingly impossible adaptation of Shakespeare's Pericles she finds out that the music to it was by Juan but it is apparently lost.Gerard the play's director soon casts Anne as a replacement for one of his many departing actors there is much made of people leaving and disappearing throughout the film often for unsaid or unknown reasons. Anne and Gerard become romantically entwined also but like most romances in the film it is ephemeral and unpredictable and both have other entanglements. Eventually Anne takes it upon herself to find a tape of this music which becomes the driving force of the latter half of the film if this portrait of halftruths and romantic obsessions with dark powers and political intrigues can be said to have a real plot at all. It's a red herring of course much like the Maltese falcon another homage to or parallel with the world of noir  in fact psychologically if not plotwise this may be the most noirish of all the early New Wave films.I first saw Paris probably 15 years ago in the crappy old cut version available on VHS in the USA and this was my first rewatch in the fine recent release from the BFI on Region 2 DVD. It's fascinating to return to it again after having seen nearly all of the director's subsequent work and to find that nearly all of his great themes and interests are present in this first feature made 50 years ago complex romantic tangles obsessions with conspiracies that may or may not exist the city as playground female friendships theater  nearly all of Rivette's life's work can be found in nascent form here. One marked difference from everything that comes after is in the soundtrack postsynchronized here and this is rather unnerving when one is used to the direct sound that the director has mastered. Yet it works in Paris the lack of street noises and the focus on individual voices and the eerie soundtrack music contributing to a view of the city as nightmarish a place of loners and loneliness of the permanent outsiders of madness in the face of an obscure modern world. The last scene as Anne's gaze wanders off following birds flying across the water is emblematic too of this cryptic loner. Nothing is truly revealed and more questions remain than were ever answered.A masterpiece and for my money every bit as important as any of the other films from the dawn of the New Wave.".

The black and white cinematography suits the tone perfectly even if the very poor quality of the film makes it hard to tell and it's supported by some disorienting editing and a great use of light and shadows. There's also a really terrific score probably one of the best for this genre. Even though the film runs 140 minutes it never really feels boring as the conversations between characters are gripping enough to keep the viewer's interest. The story is rather strange as it appears to be nonlinear and occasionally irrelevant but it seems to work out at the end. However unfortunately the end is a complete disappointment as it attempts to hammer home some political viewpoints that just end up being confusing and then coasts to a unsatisfactory finish without really tying up any of the loose ends.

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose that's a bit of an oxymoron to blend New Wave and classical literature. After all New Wave is the cinematic movement that prided itself with trashing the standard literary formula. I equate New Wave to freeform jazz which trashed the standard classical music structure in favour of expression  improv.Well I'm not a big fan of New Wave or freeform jazz so it was rather begrudgingly that I watched this film. Surely enough it begain in a sort of expressionistic delirium prompting me to say oh great. here we go again. haiku anyone? But suddenly it reins in and a very lucid story materializes out of the haze. I was pleasantly surprised. There are many compelling allusionsif not outright parallelswith the classic play Pericles Prince of Tyre as well as Molire and Goethe. This means that the film adopts a certain bit of structure which is highly unusual for New Wave. I found it very refreshing. With philosophical overtones of Sartre and Camus as well it's by far the most headscratching beardstroking New Wave film I've seen and it's not just existentialistic babble either although there is a hefty share of existentialism.Its biggest flaw however is that it seems to attacks too many themes at once and in so doing it dilutes the power it could have had. There's only so much that can be packed into a film even if it is 140 mins. As a few other reviewers have pointed out the ideas presented are truncated. Mere fragments. The director intended this as we see in a dialogue where two characters discuss how the play Pericles is a very fragmented tale which comes together only at the end. HOWEVER in the case of Paris nous appartient it doesn't seem to come together. Whether this was deliberate irony on the director's part or whether it was just poor execution I can't say. But either way it left me unfulfilled.It is possible that I missed something. Perhaps I should see it a 2nd time but unfortunately it falls just shy of the goodenoughtoseea2ndtime mark. I did enjoy it and I'm glad I watched it but I probably wouldn't care to see it again.If you see this movie and agree with what I've written then I think you'll enjoy the film Orphe 1950.Oh and just a word about the music in this film since I've already made the analogy of jazz it's... well... wacky. It's really the equivalent of jazz improv except with symphonic instruments. At times it fits the absurdity of the moment perfectly. But at other times especially during the dialogue it can be a bit distracting. I kept wondering to myself how much better it would have been with just a single brooding piano instead of the experimental orchestra noises. But music is entirely a personal taste so you may enjoy it.".

A neighbour of the room is in a frenzy stating that his brother Juan refugee from the regime of Franco was killed and now they are all doomed. Later through her brother Pierre the girl makes the acquaintance of a group of his friends. Juan's suicide is a hot topic and considered controversial by the members of the group whose peculiarity is being politically skeptical having revolutionary ideologies. Among them there's the responsible for a theatrical mise en scne of the Shakespearean drama Pericles as well as Philip an American refugee from McCarthyism with paranoid conspiracy theories. He slaps Terry femme fatale and former lover of Juan currently in a relationship with Gerard and blaming him for causing or induced Juan's death. Anne begins to establish confidence with Philip and coincidentally takes part in Gerard's recital by replacing the previously designated actress. So Anne because of her own curiosity and thrust by Philip's speeches inherent suspected conspiracies begins to investigate to resolve the problem which changes during the course of history and is never exactly identified. In addition even the clues and the same investigations of Anne prove unnecessary because they do not lead in the end to the solution of the mystery s. Looking for a recording the girl comes across a doctor named De Georges connected according to Philip to a secret organization struggling for power. Worried about Gerard's safety the girl is more and more involved in the business around him and the suicide of Juan by focusing his suspicions on Terry.

Eventually after the death of Pierre probably killed by Terry Anne comes out more confused than before while Terry and Philip go away together.CommentThe film opens with a sentence written by Peguy Paris n'appartient  personne witnessing the reception of the city and its cosmopolitan being. The opposite word game of the title mirrors the revolutionary circle that is created around the characters even if their actions do not often lead to a continuation of the plot or a clarification of the events deliberately concealed behind a network of small details basically unnecessary. It is therefore a plot similar to the mystery or detective genre although at times romantic thriller and drama but differs considerably from the canons that characterize the genre also because it is only deluded to the spectator the possibility of interacting as a detective like the illusion chased by Anne.Rivette exhibits the elusiveness of reality through these McGuffin making the film volatile and playing with the spectator actions often take a short time while unnecessary dialogues and acts are dilated at length varying the speed of the detach between sequences.A film that can irritate in its subversion as a revolutionary rebellion it imposes a careful vision but not an analysis regulated by specific narrative parameters. At times cryptically dreamlike an aura of mystery a sort of anarchist esotericism constitutes a veritable manifesto of the Nouvelle Vague. Less romantic but similar in concept to L'Amour fou it is a very thoughtful film especially at political and existential level Probably Rivette's masterpiece it exhibits in a refined way its idea of elusiveness really hard to decipher. A conceptually violent and subversive work from the title ironic that being invisible to the main public at the same time supports and in a certain way confirms the deepest cinematographic essence.".

The camera takes a very nonjudgmental and distanced view of the action which wellsuits this story where all the characters seem to have a different opinion of things.

Kurosawa also seems interested in the clash of Western individualism with the more Eastern concept of traditionalism and duty in Japanese society.  He does this very slyly having a dutybound character protecting an individual and an individualist looking out for the whole.  The characters appeal to conceptions of what's natural to justify their actions and it is here with the idea of a natural ecosystems that the film really seems to come together.  Much like the forest world around them the characters each with specific roles inhabit a social ecosystem full of competition and cooperation.

	schema:headline " A Weird Mesmerizing Exposition on Individualism and False Dichotomies";
	schema:reviewBody "Kiyoshi Kurosawa has had his duds. Guard from the Underground 1992 was mediocre at best Bright Future 2003 was pretentious and Eyes of the Spider 1998 was dreadfully boring. The first time I sat down and watched Charisma 1999 I had written it off as another Kiyoshi dud but a future rewatch proved that it's likely his third best film  behind Cure 1997 and Kairo 2001.The key to enjoying this film is to recognize its two primary themes individualism and false dichotomies. The value of the individual is contrasted with the needs of society as a whole and the false dichotomy is the illusion that one must choose between one or the other. Kiyoshi communicates these ideas through symbolism. The tree named Charisma represents the individual human being while the surrounding ecosystem represents society as a whole. The false dichotomy presents itself when each character is forced to choose between protecting Charisma or the surrounding ecosystem. Without recognizing these symbols it is impossible for the viewer to appreciate the entertaining content of this film.One of the more interesting characters is the lady botanist. She previously studied individual plants but claims that she learned nothing from them. She believes that most people are led astray when they look at the individual plants without observing the forest as a whole. This panoramic outlook is fueled when the ecosystem suffers a gradual decline. The botanist claims that the Charisma tree is poisoning the ecosystem and must be destroyed to preserve the surrounding environment. The cop asks her if there's a way for both to survive but she says that it is impossible. However it is divulged later on that the botanist herself is accelerating the destruction of the environment by dumping large quantities of poison into a nearby well. Her logic is that a quick death and restoration is a better option than the slow gradual decline that Charisma is currently inflicting. This must be a very painful decision coming from a character that values the needs of the many over the needs of the few.The tree's guardian takes more of a natural selection angle that the dominant individual should rightly survive irregardless of the consequences. He needs force to protect the Charisma tree which is why he wants to persuade the cop to join his side. When the guardian makes reference to the rules of the forest the viewer will correctly remember that the kidnapper in the opening scene made reference to the rules of the world and since this movie uses the forest as a symbol for the human world we now understand that both characters share the same essential outlook. You see the rules of the world represent the false dichotomy of choosing between the individual and society. The world maintains order by forcing people to make this decision and blinding them from recognizing that a third option does indeed exist. The guardian seems to subconsciously recognize this third option but his obsession with Charisma aka the individual prevents him from realizing it.This is where Koji Yakusho's character comes into play. He is the swing vote of sorts because his status as a policeman gives him the power of authority. However he seemingly plays both sides first opting to protect the first Charisma tree and then opting to destroy the second Charisma tree. To confuse matters he also destroys the botanist's poison well. Why does he act so erratically? Because he believes that both Charisma aka the individual and the forest aka society need to survive. For him the problem is the way the question is posed. Rules and force attempt to establish a false dichotomy that allows for only two wrong choices instead of the correct third option. Therefore he chooses to help one Charisma and kill another switching sides to keep the balance between the two forces. This film comes full circle on this theme near the end. The cop redeems his earlier mistake at the beginning of the film getting both the kidnapper and hostage killed by saving the botanist near the end without killing the kidnapper another symbolic representation of avoiding a false dichotomy of choosing one or another by saving both.The policeman's refusal to play by the rules of the forest causes chaos on a local level which is first depicted by the sledgehammer killings in the small town and then by the tree guardian's murder of the botanist's assistant. In addition the men in black initially hired to retrieve the first Charisma for its apparent monetary value turn on the local environmentalists and kill them. Even more striking is that these men in black turn down a briefcase full of money and refuse to give the tree guardian a ride a complete deconstruction of their previous personas that valued money above all else. And since the events within the forest act as a microcosm of the whole world this local chaos manifests into a worldwide pandemonium. The policeman walks out of the forest to witness the nearby city in flames. His decision to rebel against the rules of the forest has now resulted in the deconstruction of the rules of the world.This is a very wellwritten movie that is consistent and efficient in its structure. Viewers with an attraction to odd quirky deliberately paced arthouse films should love this. The environments are also beautiful and moody and the chilly weather makes this film essential viewing during the late autumn months. A truly great film with more creativity and imagination than a dozen others combined.".

	schema:headline " Proceed with caution";
	schema:reviewBody "Some sources have called Charisma a thriller. Fangoria the horror magazine had Charisma on its Video Chopping List which should imply that it's at least a thriller if not horror. They also ran a review of it online. The Netflix summaryalthough they are notoriously way off base so one should know to take them with a pound of saltdescribed Charisma as an existentialist ecothriller. Although there are a couple nifty deaths in the film it is not at all a thriller or a horror film. It is basically an arthouse drama centered on a tree. There are hallucinatory aspects there is humor and we could generously say that there's a lot of poetry to the film. But the only relationship that Charisma has to the more macabre and suspenseful genres is that as a Japanese film it shares a disregard for linear logic similar to many Japanese genre films.The story concerns a detective named Goro Yabuike Kji Yakusho. After an odd screwup at work that resulted in the death of a member of the Japanese Parliament Yabuike is put on a leave of absence. He decides to head to a forest. For some strange reason he doesn't come prepared he has no place to stay and he walks around in his everyday street clothes. He starts off by sleeping in an old car until it's set afire. He happens upon a scrawny tree that's supposedly incongruous for the area. A metal tubular framework surrounds it. There are IV bottles and tubes hooked up to it. Apparently some guy is guarding it and chases off anyone who gets near it. Yabuike meets the tree's keeper. He meets a woman botanist. The keeper and botanist are arguing about the merits of the tree and whether it is killing the forest. Yabuike keeps bouncing back and forth between the two getting filthier all the time. Each wants him on their side. He gets somewhat involved with a woman who seems like the botanist's sister. A bunch of commandolooking guys keep showing up trying to take the tree for commercial purposes. Yabuike keeps getting into strange situations people always show up in the nick of time from out of nowhere and people keep eating plants in the forest that are maybe poisonous and maybe hallucinogenic. The bulk of the film when there's some kind of action consists of people arguing back and forth about the tree alternated with strange nonsequiturs in the dialogue and plot.As you've probably discerned already it's not exactly easy to describe the content of the film. That's because it doesn't exactly make much sense. Westerners might assume that there's some deeper cultural context to the film that maybe it speaks of some current events in Japan andor invokes some wellknown mythological or artistic references but in director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's interview included on the DVD it sounds like the film was simply precipitated by the emerging environmental movement in the late 1980s he admits that the script is 10 years old and that he later tried to graft some human drama onto it. Kurosawa adds that he's not quite sure what the film is about and he's not sure if it works. I don't think it works either. The story is not at all compelling it tends to drag too much in spots and the lack of exposition and logic end up hurting more than helping. My wife ditched out after a half hour.But I wouldn't say it's a complete failure. There are interesting elements here that might make Charisma worth watching for viewers with particular kinds of interests as well as diehard fans of Japanese cinema.The most conspicuous asset is that Kurosawa is amazing at visual composition. If I were to recontextualize Charisma as something more like a series of still photographsstill with moving elements if that makes senseit would easily get an 8. Almost every shot is very rich compositionally. Kurosawa must take incredible care in getting his actors placed and moving to the exact right spotsotherwise known as blockingwith complex varied sets and background elements that usually create multifaceted visual paths for your eye to wander around.

There will often be several layers of this. He tends to place the camera unexpected distances from his actors. A lot of shots are wide and stay wide and motionless for a whole scene. There is a relative absence of closeups. He also uses lighting in very unusual ways. All of these unique approaches tend to work with the sole exception of some of the darker scenes or scenes with a bit too much backlighting. If you have any interest in visual composition Charisma is worth checking out for that alone.Also interesting are the subtextual and metaphorical aspects of the story.

Starting from a more literal level the story can be seen as gradual working toward redemption for Yabuike. He ends up redoing the event that brought him to the forest only this time he gets it right. More abstractly the Charisma tree and the events surrounding it can represent everything from mass human interaction with a unique individualistic human to a parable about natural law to a polemic against imperialistic nations in the world perhaps even the U.S. There are also numerous suggestions throughout the film that the forest is some kind of alternate reality perhaps even Hell. We never see anyone leave by the way even though they talk about leaving. These ideas are intriguing but they all require the viewer to do a lot of work the film can be a catalyst for them but that doesn't help make the film entertaining or compelling.Proceed with caution on this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "Some sources have called Charisma a thriller. Fangoria the horror magazine had Charisma on its Video Chopping List which should imply that it's at least a thriller if not horror. They also ran a review of it online. The Netflix summaryalthough they are notoriously way off base so one should know to take them with a pound of saltdescribed Charisma as an existentialist ecothriller. Although there are a couple nifty deaths in the film it is not at all a thriller or a horror film. It is basically an arthouse drama centered on a tree. There are hallucinatory aspects there is humor and we could generously say that there's a lot of poetry to the film. But the only relationship that Charisma has to the more macabre and suspenseful genres is that as a Japanese film it shares a disregard for linear logic similar to many Japanese genre films.The story concerns a detective named Goro Yabuike Kji Yakusho. After an odd screwup at work that resulted in the death of a member of the Japanese Parliament Yabuike is put on a leave of absence. He decides to head to a forest. For some strange reason he doesn't come prepared he has no place to stay and he walks around in his everyday street clothes. He starts off by sleeping in an old car until it's set afire. He happens upon a scrawny tree that's supposedly incongruous for the area. A metal tubular framework surrounds it. There are IV bottles and tubes hooked up to it. Apparently some guy is guarding it and chases off anyone who gets near it. Yabuike meets the tree's keeper. He meets a woman botanist. The keeper and botanist are arguing about the merits of the tree and whether it is killing the forest. Yabuike keeps bouncing back and forth between the two getting filthier all the time. Each wants him on their side. He gets somewhat involved with a woman who seems like the botanist's sister. A bunch of commandolooking guys keep showing up trying to take the tree for commercial purposes. Yabuike keeps getting into strange situations people always show up in the nick of time from out of nowhere and people keep eating plants in the forest that are maybe poisonous and maybe hallucinogenic. The bulk of the film when there's some kind of action consists of people arguing back and forth about the tree alternated with strange nonsequiturs in the dialogue and plot.As you've probably discerned already it's not exactly easy to describe the content of the film. That's because it doesn't exactly make much sense. Westerners might assume that there's some deeper cultural context to the film that maybe it speaks of some current events in Japan andor invokes some wellknown mythological or artistic references but in director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's interview included on the DVD it sounds like the film was simply precipitated by the emerging environmental movement in the late 1980s he admits that the script is 10 years old and that he later tried to graft some human drama onto it. Kurosawa adds that he's not quite sure what the film is about and he's not sure if it works. I don't think it works either. The story is not at all compelling it tends to drag too much in spots and the lack of exposition and logic end up hurting more than helping. My wife ditched out after a half hour.But I wouldn't say it's a complete failure. There are interesting elements here that might make Charisma worth watching for viewers with particular kinds of interests as well as diehard fans of Japanese cinema.The most conspicuous asset is that Kurosawa is amazing at visual composition. If I were to recontextualize Charisma as something more like a series of still photographsstill with moving elements if that makes senseit would easily get an 8. Almost every shot is very rich compositionally. Kurosawa must take incredible care in getting his actors placed and moving to the exact right spotsotherwise known as blockingwith complex varied sets and background elements that usually create multifaceted visual paths for your eye to wander around.

The ending of this film does not match the interpretation that ebossert below describes. If the collapse of society were due to Yabuike's rejection of the dichotomy this would be a wrong ending. It creates another dichotomy and actively goes against the film's own stated philosophy that the destruction rather than preservation of both would lead to chaosextinction. The chaos seen at the end of the film is something different. What is being contrasted in this film is not society with individualism but society with an individual. Just as it's insane to allow a destructive individual to continue to exist and taint a society for his uniqueness it's also excessive to kill that person to protect society. There has to be a way to save boththat's Yabuike's plan. The nonlinearity and philosophy seen in this film and countless other Japanese films draws through perhaps unconscious cultural channels from Buddhism. Particularly in Zen Buddhism the form most popular in Japan all is changing and inseparable. There is no individual for we are all intricately and inextricably bound by forces tying us togethercause and effect. The solution to the problem then is not to kill the individual to protect society as the botanist wishes nor to let the forest be killed to protect the tree as Kiriyama wishes. Yabuike's solution is chance. Pure random chaotic chance. Since all are equal kill this one let this one survive. This explains the men in black who may represent the forces of nature who simultaneously break away from the false paradigm with Yabuike. They throw away their caps lifting the mental ceiling off and he no longer has any qualms about risking one person's life to save another in a hostage situation. The ending is a bit dramatic for an otherwise deliberatelypaced film more accurate would have been a subtle understated change in society but that's difficult to depict when your film is already 100 minutes long. In short Kurosawa Kiyoshi created with this another excellent film that watches like a good book reads. I had to take several pauses to reflect on the ideas and parallels depicted on screen. If you're reading this now chances are you're just discovering Kurosawa as I did years ago. He is now my favourite director and Yakusho Kouji my favourite actor. I highly recommend watching and rewatching both of their films!".

Then I've seen Karo and was amazed because it had a completely different style. Scary and finally apocalyptic in a way I've never thought it would go. Charisma is the third Kurosawamovie I've seen and again its style is amazing. Sometimes the camera watches a scene from far away and gives the action a distanced neutral look. The shots in the forest are amazing. Sometimes green and lush sometimes misty and foreboding.But what about that story? I've read many interpretations  that this is an analysis of Japan's society that this is a neutral which would fit the style look at a confrontation of wrong and right. Well that's all rather intriguing  but no it doesn't satisfy me at all. Now that I think about it I'm actually very disappointed by the story. No one in this movie acts rationally which lifts the movie away from reality and lessens its social commentary. It had flashes of brilliance where I clearly saw what Kurosawa was aiming at  but he could not sustain his ideas for the full running time. Sometimes I thought this was a parody and all Kurosawa wants to do in the end is laugh at the viewer who was expecting something that makes sense.That said I have to admit that it gives you a lot of thought fodder  just not in any rewarding way. Even if it is a clever commentary on Japan's society that would not be enough for almost 2 hours. So the only really great thing about this film is its visual glory. I'm still not sure whether I like Kurosawa's movies or not. I certainly won't forget them.Rating 610".

There were a few shocks and surprises along the way but the  sheer length of the movie and it's ambiguous ending renders it hard for me to recommend.As someone else stated it does make you think and that is probably what all good  films hope to achieve. One would just hope for a clearer thoughtscape to ponder on.";

The cop walks away because he feels sympathy for both victim and victimizer as he later reveals to his superior and the film quickly shows that nonaction or a refusal to be involved in the world compassion from a distance has dire consequences.Kurosawa seems to be concerned here with the law of nature the ways of the world. If life is a game with stakes of life and death how do we play it and how does it reflect on the universe. The phrase the rules of the world is repeated later in the film it's a linchpin holding themes together but how does the film pursue this broad philosophy does it poetically infer something important? The cop protagonist is brought into a mysterious forest world which is threatened to be tipped off balance by a rare toxic tree. It doesn't take a lot to understand that this secluded ecosystem stands for the world at large but I like that Kurosawa readies him for this existential playground by stripping him of manmade identity this contract established between the individual and society preparing him for an initiation process where the self will be reinvented born anew with new perspectives.It's downhill for me from this point. Kurosawa pursues his argument by a schematic representation by an obviousness of symbolism by characters drawn to clearly stand in opposites who literally speak out their role in the film. A character wants to destroy the tree to save the surrounding ecosystem another wants to protect it because it's unique. We understand this but they go on to tell the camera.Kairo's strong card for me is the grand guignol representation of an abstract world the stage of a horror theater where the self is dissolved. In Charisma Kurosawa reaches for a similar absence of logic but only as means of formulating logic on a secondary level by an allegory of this stands for that. I like the fact that I'm watching a film morally and aesthetically preoccupied one that tries to grapple with ideas but it's not a surreal film and it doesn't evoke a picture of a meaningful world by poetic means rather it draws one by rational ones.This illustrates the failure of allegory for me. An allegoric world is an abstraction of a part of the world we recognize with the abstraction used to concretely talk about that part. The basic means are cryptic as opposed to poetic. Once we grasp the key that abstracts it's no longer a challenge.The cop wavers between the two sides until he settles for a point of view that encompasses both. This balancing act of selective involvement that upsets the rules in the world of the film and brings chaos can be meaningful if we accept that a new world can only come to pass through the fires of destruction.Philosophy by means of an allegory makes for a boring film for me and more for a film that doesn't stimulate the senses but invites pen to paper in an effort to decrypt a riddle.It's a difficult film but not very bright.".

When Goro Yabuike a detective from Tokyo lost his way in an isolated and peculiar community in a countryside he started getting involved with different groups of people who were disputing over this one tree they called 'Karisma Charisma.' The tree was imported from outside of the country by the director of the asylum who passed away and later the community learned that the tree was actually poisoning all other trees and grass around it for its solo survival. They argued whether they should protect the tree which was destroying the woods or they should get rid of the poisonous tree to save the woods. The 'Karisma' tree becomes a medium of their communication and Yabuike the outsider suddenly got a position to play the God to make the decision. Kiyoshi Kurosawa is trying to show a conception of nature in the film. The answer the detective Yabuike suggests is that the chaos over the 'Karisma' is based on human's selfish interest and not the natural order. The director Kiyoshi Kurosawa mathematically composed the rule of a game in a fictional story setting. 'Karisma Charisma' is a very interesting psychological and philosophical film.".

When you read the synopsis you'll probably realise that the writer and director Kiyoshi Kurosawa is working on many different levels and you'll equally stay involved with the story due to the outstanding visuals.

My first viewing was focused on the ecological themes present throughout the film the whole idea of man's control over nature without realising that nature doesn't reason. It just is. Applying Spinozan logic nature is the infinite essence of the universe and doesn't need controlling. Nature doesn't act out of emotion and reason it is perfect and simply is. There's just so much more thematic material open to interpretation so it's hard to place one specific genre to the film but Kurosawa skillfully builds up disturbing dramatic moments with his trademark perfect camera work boasting stellar cinematography of the Japanese landscape.The film might not be my favourite but 'Charisma' is certainly up there as one of Kurosawa's best films. If you're interested in strange but nonetheless interesting examinations of reality then be sure to check this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I watched this was with my mother. My parents were always victims when I wanted to watch 'artistic' videos. Charisma was very engaging and my mom made it to the end. The main character a detective goes on a vacation to clear his mind and gets involved in the problems of a small town mostly surrounding a dead tree nicknamed 'Charisma'. The director takes this minimal theme and keeps it interesting throughout. At one point the detective comes to a realization that the town's obsession with this tree is just stupid and that it's a sort of metaphor for all of his own problems of dealing with people in his own life. When the end credits began to roll my mom felt so insulted that she actually said 'WHAT THE HELL IS THAT IT? For years anytime we parked at a shopping mall or supermarket my mom would point at a tree and say 'park over there by Charisma'. We always had a good laugh and that kept the movie in our minds. No other film stuck in my mom's mind ever.But the film grew on not just me and my mom but everyone who I unwittingly got to watch it. Yes I've seen Charisma many times and LOVE it. If a director can take a dead tree make a film around it and make people sit through it hate it then come back to it that's entertainment.Think of cult films like Rocky Horror Picture Show. Charisma has the elements of what makes a great cult movie yet it's filmed in such a stylish and enjoyable way  the characters are all especially likable  that you can't pass this off as just bmovie stuff. It's a classy oneofakind film about a dead tree told in a poetic yet cinematically fun way that will just draw you back to watch now and then with new people in tow just to see their reactions.I wish there were more films like this. But even Kiyoshi Kurosawa who directed Charisma never struck lightning twice. This in my opinion is his masterpiece and he never got close to this again.This is great cinema! If you feel you need a cleansing from this film seek out another Japanese movie called Summer Time Machine Blues. It'll knock your socks off.".

A crime film though that formally switched between extreme realism Rivette seams to be famous for letting the actors improvise a lot and absurd postmodernism  but after all a fine story about criminals. Only that the criminals were not typical gangsters a young American played by an Italian but as he did it convincingly I accept it and the childlike and wild and very sexy Maia Schneider. And many more. Oh and two pofaced musicians who perform the soundtrack of the movie before our eyes live so to say.And above all this movie was very funny  you wouldn't expect such a funny film from a filmmaker who is weird enough to make a motion picture that has a running time of 13 hours.I should mention that the girl with whom I saw the movie had a headache afterwards. So be careful.".

A crime film though that formally switched between extreme realism Rivette seams to be famous for letting the actors improvise a lot and absurd postmodernism  but after all a fine story about criminals. Only that the criminals were not typical gangsters a young American played by an Italian but as he did it convincingly I accept it and the childlike and wild and very sexy Maia Schneider. And many more. Oh and two pofaced musicians who perform the soundtrack of the movie before our eyes live so to say.And above all this movie was very funny  you wouldn't expect such a funny film from a filmmaker who is weird enough to make a motion picture that has a running time of 13 hours.I should mention that the girl with whom I saw the movie had a headache afterwards. So be careful.";

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed five films by Jacques Rivette before this one so I'm accustomed to his bizarre style and overall I love it. However MerryGoRound the sixth Rivette film that I've viewed is very poor compared to the others. The storyline is a muddled mess that didn't make sense for me either on a straight literal level or on a symbolic level.Why would any sane man fly from NYC to Paris just because an exgirlfriend sent him a telegram asking him to do so?Why didn't anyone especially sis Leo call the cops after Elizabeth was kidnapped? Why would Leo and the attorney's secretary enter an abandoned building alone to rescue Elizabeth i.e. without the cops? After escaping kidnapping why would Elizabeth enter back into negotiations with the very people who kidnapped her? After Leo and Ben fail to find Elizabeth at the graveyard they are counting pennies between them to see if they have enough for cab fare back to the hotel suggesting that they came from Rome and NYC respectively with no cash on them. Who would travel so far from home being absolutely broke? Why was it necessary for the fake Mr Danvers to be a psychic medium? The segments of Leo running in the woods and the anonymous girl running in the sand dunes didn't fit in with the film in any way.Overall the screenplay here looks like an assemblage of elements that were randomly picked out of a hat.This film is truly unworthy of an otherwise GREAT filmmaker like Jacques Rivette. If you've never seen a Rivette film before then do not start here because this film is a POOR representative of his work.".

At a gypsy camp a woman saves a photo out of the fire and restores it. On the photo Cocteau recognizes Cgeste from his film Orphe. He tears the photo into pieces and throws it into the sea. Immediately Cgeste himself jumps out of the water. He brings Cocteau to a rogatory commission led by Heurtebise and The Princess from the film Orphe. Cocteau admits that he has constantly attempted to enter a world which is not his own a world that is beyond the limits of man and that disobedience is like a religion for him.

One would hardly imagine a cinematic poet like Jean Cocteau would be so crass as to make something like a mere sequel to his acclaimed OrpheusOrphee 1950. And instead what Cocteau does is to give us perhaps cinema's first metafilm. The film itself is an autobiographical fantasia of his whole life. Playing various versions of himself Cocteau glides through the film as a time traveler in search of his place in the universe. He called it an active poem.The film was shot on location at Les Baux in the South of France a landscape whose rough limestone canyons appealed to Cocteau even more than Greece. Francine Weinweller and the main crew put up at that gourmet's mecca the Hostellerie de la Baumaniere. Francine had a costume part in the film as La Dame qui s'est trompe d'epoque. All the icons out of Cocteau's past were woven into the visual testament  mirrors horses flowers tapestries and many of his friends  Dermit Marais Yul Brynner Picasso and his wife among others appeared.Unfortunately for Cocteau public and critics weaned on the literature of commitment popularized by Sartre and Camus turned their backs on Le Testament d'Orphee finding it a selfserving celluloid relic oddly out of step with the times. One voice however and an important one praised the film. Young Francois Truffaut winner of a large prize for his film Les Quatre Cents Coups had turned the money over to Cocteau to help finance Le Testament. Truffaut liked the finished product which he considered a remake thirty years later of Le Sang d'un Poete. Truffaut was not alone in seeing Cocteau judged by his previous films as one of the main precursors of New Wave filmmakers.Le Testament d'Orphee is a misunderstood masterpiece. Brilliant!!!!".

He wanders a fantastical land and encounters various characters from his works of fiction. It's not a plotdriven film at all. It is more of a personal voyage of the director's. It was the last film he made and is clearly intended as a swansong and a summary of his work.The film often works best when it is at its most surreal. Many of the effects are extremely simple yet beautifully executed. For instance the part where Cocteau reconstructs the flower bit by bit is very nice likewise when Orpheus leaps out of the sea. Towards the end there is even a very striking invasion of the colour red that can't help but be very memorable imagery. There are moments of the bizarre sprinkled throughout the picture.

Now I'm about the same age he was when he did the Testament. I remember the time period for the second and third pictures having grown up in it. But how all three of these films really transcend time as Cocteau is trying to show you works of art should! I had to rely on the subtitles for the sense of the lines but it was no matter. I don't remember anything else like these films. They are political to the extent they lobby for the poet's point of view. And in spite of the black and white and old prints their effect is most striking. Orpheus Descending and Testament sometimes look like the inspiration for Rebel Without a Cause. And Testament has some pithy comments on modern technology and the short comings of air travel that seem funnier and more relevant today. And toward the end of Testament having the red blood and the red hibiscus in this black and white moviehow many times has that been imitated by computer technology? But it is what the poet saw then not what technology makes commonplace and commercial today.On the discs for Blood of the Poet and Testament are two separate bonus features documentaries of Cocteau in fading Technicolorbut oh how interesting they are as well. At some point Cocteau says it was Picasso who taught them all to see. But what a treasure trove of talent Paris produced in the first half of the twentieth century. I hope this kind of sharing of artistic discovery can take place on the internet. Maybe it is already happening and I just don't know it. But I do know people who care for seriousbut not heavy and sometimes wittyartistic expression let alone movies should see all three of these movies and the docs which accompany them.".

But it is what the poet saw then not what technology makes commonplace and commercial today.On the discs for Blood of the Poet and Testament are two separate bonus features documentaries of Cocteau in fading Technicolorbut oh how interesting they are as well. At some point Cocteau says it was Picasso who taught them all to see. But what a treasure trove of talent Paris produced in the first half of the twentieth century. I hope this kind of sharing of artistic discovery can take place on the internet. Maybe it is already happening and I just don't know it. But I do know people who care for seriousbut not heavy and sometimes wittyartistic expression let alone movies should see all three of these movies and the docs which accompany them.";

This movie touches the possible cyclic nature of the time and sometime it even goes even further suggesting that  ALL TIMES reside within ONE or NONE  Well we're not supposed to understand it  I loved the dig at intellectuals.I would recommend this movie to all surrealist and anybody who has the eternal question  WHY?! This movie is not an answer nor it asks question. Just OBEY the natural laws and see the movie 910".

	schema:reviewBody "The third film in the socalled Orphic Trilogy of Jean Cocteau Testament Of Orpheus Le Testament D'Orphe Ou Ne Me Demandez Pas Pourquoi! is also the third film in The Criterion Collection release boxed set and while it's the best of the trio it's nowhere near a good film. It does have perhaps the best scoring and a dozen or so moments in its eighty minutes that have some spark of creativity but Cocteau is so narcissistic and the film so selfindulgent and replete with outdated special effects such as Cocteau running film in reverse on numerous occasions that one feels almost embarrassed for him. Also the previous two entries in the trilogy set the bar so low that Cocteau did not really have to do much to improve upon their failures and he didn't do much.Despite his claims to the contrary Cocteau was certainly no poet of any stature and his lack of writing skill can be seen in this undeniably dreadful screenplay loaded with the most clichd claims about poetry and art and the most banal and absurd imagery imaginable even as Cocteau believes it is deep. Part of the odd charm of the film and its predecessors is that Cocteau really does believe the crap he spews. At one point in the film he even states 'It is the unique power of the cinema to allow a great many people to dream the same dream together and to present illusion to us as if it were strict reality. It is in short an admirable vehicle for poetry.' Not only is the sentiment false and highfalutin' but it's read by Cocteau with such earnest inanity that one wonders whether he really could believe such tripe and not have to restrain a guffaw.Testament Of Orpheus is the least embarrassing of the socalled Orphic Trilogy but it still does not rise above the sci fi schlock of the 1950s films which often had bold premises but failed merely in technical and acting aspects. This film is not even bold. It's puerile and trite and Cocteau is an embarrassment to all real poets. The cinematography by Roland Pontoizeau is often framed poorly and the music by Georges Auric is woefully inappropriate in many places. Had Cocteau actually been a real artist this film and perhaps the whole trilogy and his canon may have been intriguing glimpses into metafilm decades before the twin banes of Abstract Expressionism and Postmodernism dulled contemporary painting and literature. Even the often repetitive Charlie Kaufman scripted films of recent years are leagues ahead of this garbage in terms of narrative twists depth and real characterization. Instead Cocteau was a jack of all arts and a master of none a narcissistic unwitting walking clich in the flesh. I tire of apologists for this sort of manifestly bad art who always try to claim that a work of art that is so terrible is simply 'too deep' or any other such nonsense to be properly critiqued. While truly great art has often been dismissed in this manner by bad critics Testament Of Orpheus is not only not great art but manifestly bad art. Its premises and claims are easily seen through for they are so shallow and that is what kills it as a film. One can only wonder what part they had in Cocteau's demise. One can dream can't one?".

Not to mention Cocteau's own Sang d'un poete 1930! in which the relatively simple technical ideas of Testament d'Orphee were already worked out and even better too.

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I first saw Orphee decades ago I thought it one of world cinema's Greats a work of Art and underplayed panache that literally transcends Time. That was Part 2 of Jean Cocteau's Orpheus cycle in 1949  in 1932 Part 1 Le Sang D'un Poete set the scene in a whimsical primitive way and Testament was the convoluted Part 3 which became his final film released in 1960. First thing  if you enjoyed Orphee I recommend not watching this immediately afterwards it's a contrast between gold and brass. Second thing  if you don't like pretentious art films this is a special case it's still by far the best pretentious film I've ever seen and worth watching for its selfconfidence. If you do like pretentious art films then to come clean I'm one of the denser people so disparaged by the previous exalted commenter therefore I have nothing I can impart to you. I've always considered this only as Cocteau's Testament  it's all about him and his thoughts of posterity at 70.Cocteau as film maker and poet stands between two worlds accused of being guilty of Innocence and is condemned to Life while his last film makes itself around him. There's a lot more to it involving going backwards forwards and sideways in Time and Timelessness with or without trick photography all of the cast large or small spouting codheavy aphorisms with gossamer realism or relevance. It gave him a chance to revisit the subject and as he admitted at the end of the film to give some of his old friends Casares Perier Dermithe etc a job in the revisiting  after all he was by now to use his own words from Orphee now rotten with success and could get away with murder. He died twice in here  even the Motorcyclists Of Death only wanted his autograph  and he lived and died to tell the tale. I can see where Banksy got his inspiration for his recent Mobile Phone Lovers from. I take away the image of Cegeste's image being saved from backward burning only for the image to be torn to pieces that cerebral scene was worth the eighty minutes! The twenty minute wordy trial scene gets tiresome as you gradually realise its pointlessness apart from the padding out of the temporal running time. But there's plenty of tremendous imagery and heavy moralising throughout Cocteau was incredibly talented big on surrealism the occult and symbolism of all kinds all more or less intellectual dead ends and as with many other big thinkers full of mumbo jumbo before and since he agonised over the merits and demerits of the Catholic Church another dead end. Whereas with Orphee he made a film that could be enjoyed over the generations by all kinds of people with various levels of brainpower he created here a film so obscure it only plays like an injoke raspberry to the world of the end of his life.So there you are  I do quite like Le Testament D'Orphee so hopefully Cocteau won't be sad wherever he is it's just I'm not a poet and have an old nose for Art and Artifice. No matter how unique or interesting this film is to me or even for that matter to those of a higher intellect he was simply having a laugh.".

	schema:headline " Like watching some of Jean Cocteau's home movies after taking a couple hits of acid....";
	schema:reviewBody "My summary is NOT meant to be sarcasm but an accurate description of what I saw in Testament of Orpheus. It really does play a lot like a home movie of Cocteau'scomplete with his friends making guest appearances. A few of the more notable ones are Jean Pierre Leaud Pablo Picasso and Yul Brynner. As for the plot it's really hard to describe and it is VERY freaky. It's sort of like a combination of a dream the life of Cocteau time travel and Greek mythology all rolled into one very strange film. If you try to make sense of all this it will probably make your head explodeand it seems pretty clear that Cocteau had no intention of making the film understandable or doing a traditional narrative. Because it is essential a vanity project and an art film I really cannot rate it. However I think I'm very safe in saying that the film probably holds no interest to the average viewer but is something best seen by Cocteauphiles and lovers of the avant garde or surreal.As for me and my own opinion about the film's merits I thought the project was very repetitivethough it did have a few moments of interesting introspection by Cocteau who plays himself through the film. Sadly though despite his introspection this is yet another Cocteau film in which he overused slowmotion and rolled the film backwards again and again to achieve his artsy effects. Essentially you see nothing new here in the way of techniqueshaving seen this is Blood of a Poet thirty years earlier. And it does not have any sort of lasting appeal or a coherent story like Orpheus or Beauty and the Beast his two masterpieces. Skipable if you ask me but a mildly very mildly interesting piece of performance art.".

It really does play a lot like a home movie of Cocteau'scomplete with his friends making guest appearances. A few of the more notable ones are Jean Pierre Leaud Pablo Picasso and Yul Brynner. As for the plot it's really hard to describe and it is VERY freaky. It's sort of like a combination of a dream the life of Cocteau time travel and Greek mythology all rolled into one very strange film. If you try to make sense of all this it will probably make your head explodeand it seems pretty clear that Cocteau had no intention of making the film understandable or doing a traditional narrative. Because it is essential a vanity project and an art film I really cannot rate it. However I think I'm very safe in saying that the film probably holds no interest to the average viewer but is something best seen by Cocteauphiles and lovers of the avant garde or surreal.As for me and my own opinion about the film's merits I thought the project was very repetitivethough it did have a few moments of interesting introspection by Cocteau who plays himself through the film. Sadly though despite his introspection this is yet another Cocteau film in which he overused slowmotion and rolled the film backwards again and again to achieve his artsy effects. Essentially you see nothing new here in the way of techniqueshaving seen this is Blood of a Poet thirty years earlier. And it does not have any sort of lasting appeal or a coherent story like Orpheus or Beauty and the Beast his two masterpieces. Skipable if you ask me but a mildly very mildly interesting piece of performance art.";

It's just one pointless existential tableau after another which may be Cocteau's aim but it fails as substantial entertainment.

This is the last film of Cocteau film marked by the built in time style and it constitutes a legacy of Orpheus the way it is will or inheritance if you will of the director himself.As the third part of the trilogy it is the walking of a full circle in the human being done in two ways  on a personal level from childhood and the first life old and last life and historically from mythology to science and modernity. On foreground is the idea of the fateful moment in our existence the intersections of our past present and future existences still seeking their own sense separated from one another and the constant questioning of the miracle of the human presence. Poetry and science holding hands are grinding up to interfere in the mysteries of the mythological story. Their results are not greatly productive but they are and give comfort to those who have been vocated to them. We are shown the most severe a burden and that is to being a judge of others and instead of indulging in spacetime to get security logic and predictability. Somewhat Kafkasian those who stand before the law are waiting their trial. The director shows his ability to see the development of different actions and characters in a long time plan and also provide his place into them.The development of action shows us that more important are the desire and ability than the effect and power of cash rivers. To such titles we can turn only to sigh because they are uttered as pieces of rock of the time and the history of cinema that are long forgotten and kicked out of the way of modern man that took a sharp turn passing them with their topless cars.httpvihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Le Testament d'Orphe is an uneven work compared to the more achieved and better realized Orphe to which it is very tightly related of course and for this reason may not appeal to everyone even those who were enchanted by Cocteau's visual poetry in Orphe. There are of course a good number of puzzling scenes but they remain quite tame compared to Le Sang d'un Pote a much more hermetic and typically surrealistic film a la Bunuel and Cocteau's approach far from being that of some elitist intellectual is in fact caring for his audience. The imagery presented to us in Le Testament is often introduced by Cocteau's off voice and very often also by himself on screen. I always felt welcome to his world comfortable in his poetic universe because he truly seems preoccupied by how we react to what is shown to us. The numerous scenes with the Hibiscus flower are at the heart of how the various components of Cocteau's clockwork interact for the benefit of his spectators. We marvel at simple things now Cocteau debunks the symbolism of the second part of the Trilogy we're reminded that Cgeste and Heurtebise are the fruits of an early poem by Cocteau. We are reunited with the Princess Maria Casares and Heurtebise Franois Prier at a tribunal where everything and everyone now seems to be less threatening where everyone is taking oneself less seriously than in Orphe. Le Testament is truly a work of love of true affection from Cocteau to everyone of us.There is nothing pretentious here and only a few philistines may remain impervious to Cocteau in the same way as they likely are to poetry in general. Poets are the least well understood workers in our society and for the densest among us they are probably completely useless parasites living out of public charity. But if Cocteau's message is to be of any significance today to his fellow humans 50 years after his death it is that poetry does not need to be some hermetic language published in expensive editions for a happy few enlightened elite cut from the rest of society. One of Cocteau's pioneering contributions is his use of the cinmatographe  as he liked to refer to it  as a tool for a poet to convey the mechanics of his mind to something tangible. He often said e.g. watch the fascinating documentary Jean Cocteau Autoportrait d'un inconnu 1985 on the Criterion edition of Le Sang d'un Pote a mustsee to truly understand Cocteau's cinema that the poet does not control what he thinks what he imagines etc. he is merely a conduit between some immaterial but powerful source call it God the gods or whatever and his fellow mortals. Cocteau was the first recognized published poet to use cinema successfully and creatively to express poetry from the privileged and original point of view of a poet. His most achieved work in this respect was La Belle et la Bte but the Orphe trilogy is a close contender for that matter. Furthermore unlike other surrealists and fellow artists of his era such a brilliant one with so many luminaries from times the likes of which we will never see again  ours is a whole different universe whose output was mainly through painting and literature exclusively Cocteau's poetic films are not only still among us but through the contribution of scholars or simply cinema lovers still resonate to this day and enjoy a second or third life thanks to the democratizing effect of digital technology. And this is where his effect and influence on us is at its most vivid and significant.One can rightly argue that Cocteau's cinematographic book of tricks gets rapidly limited as we watch his films and that his gimmickry may appear a little bit naive especially to 21stcentury eyes. However one must be reminded that what we witness by viewing his films is the vision of a poet and this is where the viewer must try to put him herself i.e. to discard our unforgiving CGIsaturated view of film images and concentrate on the symbolism of Cocteau's universe.This is why one should not watch the Testament d'Orphe before the better rounded up works especially La Belle et la Bte which is a true masterpiece. And as with all masterpieces everything else including one artist's other works pales in comparison. But at least Cocteau's language becomes better articulated and more understandable once we have been exposed to the most seamless of his poems.".

	schema:reviewBody "One can view this movie and find themselves asking themselves by the end what did they watch? The movie has very confusing that tossed all logic out of the window. One might think it's a continue story of Orpheus 1950 with the opening scenes but the series of symbolic encounters and surreal images more resembles The Blood of a Poet 1930. This movie might be considered the final part of the Orphic Trilogy but it's just a film that is a petrified fountain of thought in my opinion. In his last film legendary poetfilm maker Jean Cocteau portrays an 18th century poet who travels through time on a quest for divine wisdom while seeing his past work come back alive due to his inspirations and obsessions with them. Cocteau's persona is unstuck in time and materializes in and out to episodically interact with various characters such as two judges who essentially put Cocteau's life on trial some mimes dressed like horses a camp of gypsies and a professor who apparently enabled this time travel through inventing a bullet which flies faster than light. In the opening narration Cocteau alternatingly calls the movie a striptease show where I take off my body to reveal my soul and a poet's legacy to the youth which has always supported him. Testament of Orpheus brings full circle the journey Cocteau began in The Blood of a Poet an exploration of the torturous relationship between the artist and his creations. In a mysterious wasteland he meets several symbolic phantoms that bring about his death and resurrection. In the end the film is mostly a tribute to himself and him looking back at his work before accepting his death. Too bad the movie doesn't truly show that. Instead the audience gets an phantasmagorical whirl of imagery tragedy and an enormous transcendent sense of wonder. The movie works as an art surreal film as the movie goes from one dream sequence to another. The film use great work of imagery. Mirrors horses flowers tapestries are used to represent Cocteau's past. His special effects and camera tricks are always a highlight of his work as he sees slow motion walk scenes and selective color. My favorite is the backwardsmotion. A great example of this is how the punctured smokefilled balloon reassembles or a burned photograph is restored. Others are an erased blackboard sketch reappears. A draped sheet flies upward. Cegeste jumps out of the ocean perfectly groomed. And the lengthiest example is the meticulous repair of a tornup hibiscus flower. Check them out it's probably the best high lights of the film. The film was shot on location at Les Baux in the South of France and it's beautiful. The movie also host a few famous cameos such as Pablo Picasso JeanPierre Leud Jean Marais and Yul Brynner. The music is charming. Most of the film is Handel. Concerto in A minor Op.6. While it's the best of the trio it's nowhere near a good film. It's a bit pretentious stiffly acted and cinematically dated. His lack of writing skills can be seen in this undeniably dreadful screenplay loaded with the most clichd statements about poetry and art and the most trite and incongruous imagery imaginable. The scenes with a man walking about with a fake horses head might be a bit silly today. By contrast Cocteau's symbolism is so heavyhanded so obvious and so manifold that they have little realworld referents so they can be hardly understood by the average viewer. The scene with the faster than light bullets is weird science Cocteau brings them into the past so the professor can shoot him thus sending him back in time. How all that works is left unexplained. In a way the movie is full of mixed imagery that rarely makes any sense to anybody but Cocteau himself. In the end Cocteau the poet movie maker nobody has reached higher doing poetry with images. Nobody. Rather than being a complete ego trip it is closer to what Fellini did in 8 12 a similar work of genius where the soul is searched a document is made with all the art and craft the director can bring and doesn't matter if the audience get it or not. Once Cocteau vanishes for the last time the film ends. If you didn't like it I'm sorry he humbly adds. Check it out if you're a huge Cocteau fan if not research more about him before watching this film.".

Once Cocteau vanishes for the last time the film ends. If you didn't like it I'm sorry he humbly adds. Check it out if you're a huge Cocteau fan if not research more about him before watching this film.";

Pretentious dialog dated special effects a penurious set overstudious acting and a score that just did not fit.The dialog was stilted and affected it did not make any sense at all. Maybe it did to Cocteau but even that I doubt. It was full of enigmatic and obtuse references to whoknowswhat? I suspect Cocteau just went overboard in tangential talk.The special effects were embarrassing but done with such gravity that you had to take a doubletake at the vapid seriousness displayed.The only actor worth seeing was Yul Brynner. Cocteau should have stayed on the other side of the camera. He was not an actor just like Hitchcock was not. Cocteau should have learned from Hitchcock and just had a cameo role. It actually became painful watching him move deliberately from scene to scene. Not that the scenes made any sense except in his poor attempt at stitching his memories together.The main set was a ruined building built with large blocks but it had peoples' initials scored on their faces. So a scene that was intended to be somber or meaningful had scrawls of past visitors clearly visible. Whatever effect Cocteau intended was lost by the distractions. The set was messy too. Could not it have been cleaned and swept for heaven's sake? The acting in general was amateurish. There was no spontaneity no joie de vivre nothing to show Cocteau led anything but a pretty boring life. Surprising really when you know he was responsible for Beauty and the Beast one of my favorite movies. But that had JeanAlfred VillainMarais and Josette Day in it.The music was empty and powerless. I have just watched the movie and cannot even remember any part of the score. If you are going to write a score for a movie make some of it memorable.".

That may well be the best way to look at it as I found this a fairly involving even compelling story of unrequited and difficult loves not just between the central characters of Heathcliff Roch in this version an at first bloodless but later quite savage Lucas Belvaux and Catherine deceptively strongwilled in Fabienne Babe's performance....throughout the film there are hints of incestuous feelings on the part of Catherine's older brother Guillaume and all of the characters seem to have powerful lovehate attractions to their landscape and environment here translated to a remote and rocky pair of farms in 1930s France. The class distinctions between orphan Roch his onthedecline adoptive family and the ontherise siblings Olivier and Isabel are subtly drawn and the feelings of entrapment in the remote vastnesses of both the two huge country houses and the wild hillside are always present if more potently presented in the early parts of the film. Beautifully shot though the VHS copy I watched suffered from rather washedout color the very minimal and rarely heard music is from the Bulgarian Women's Choir fitting ultimately if not a very obvious choice.When all is said and done Rivette's theatrical style of shooting and direction of performances offers a lot of interesting counterpoint to the madness at the heart of the story the actors seeming cool and detached and often still at many points both before and after short eruptions of violence and passion but ultimately it does drain some of the drama from the story and I found the second act after Roch's return less involving than the first. Still this is far from awful as I had been led to believe it might be and though it is certainly one of the director's weaker films it remains well worth seeing to his fans.Letterboxed VHS tape rental. 810".

In it two very openminded young women both practitioners of different kinds of magic get tangled in a mysterious oldfashioned love triangle story taking place in a archetypal haunted Victorian house. When they figure out that the 10year old daughter of the houseowner is going to get murdered out of love madness they decide to sneak into the house and rescue her.The thing is you know from the beginning that the pathetic melodrama in the haunted house is not real in the sense that Celine and Julie are. It's rather they invented the whole story just to kill time  have some fun with outdated storytelling. It's essentially a illustration of what is called deconstruction. The melodrama just serves as something that can be manipulated or even laughed at. Rivette respectively Celine and Julie play very freely with a kind of narrative that doesn't seem to work anymore.Unfortunately Hurlevent has just the feeling of the haunted house sequences of the earlier movie  and that means the characters are not likable seem like marionettes bloodless dull. It completely lacks the lighthearted though very intellectual sophistication that made Celine and Julie so enjoyable. Maybe Rivette wanted it just like that.
